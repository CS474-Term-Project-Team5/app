Moon was formally arrested earlier in the day.He is accused of having pressured the NPS, the biggest shareholder of builder Samsung C&T; Corp. to support a controversial merger between it and Cheil Industries Inc. on behalf of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.President Park was impeached on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal involving her long-time confidante Choi Soon-sil which has rocked the country's politics for months.State prosecutors earlier said that Park allegedly colluded with Choi to strong-arm Samsung and other local conglomerates into donating money into two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi.Samsung is suspected of receiving backup from the NPS for the merger deal in 2015 in exchange for donations and favors to Choi and her daughter.Moon, who had denied of having exerted influence in the pension fund's decision at a recent parliamentary hearing, reversed his statement during an interrogation by special prosecutors, according to the independent counsel team's spokesman Lee Kyu-chul.Investors are now looking into whether President Park was directly involved in the process, which they believe could constitute bribery.The team led by independent counsel Park Young-soo arrested without warrant Yi Il-hwa, a professor at Ewha Womans University, on Saturday on suspicion that he gave unjust favors to Choi's only daughter to help her earn credits.Chung Yoo-ra, Choi's 20-year-old daughter, allegedly gained illicit admission to the university and favors from professors.Last week, investigators secured a court warrant to arrest Chung, who is believed to be hiding out in Germany.Choi, currently in custody, is under trial over a set of corruption charges where President Park was named accomplice by state prosecutors.Park, who denies all charges against her, is waiting for the Constitutional Court's decision over whether to unseat or reinstate her after lawmakers voted to impeach her early this month.","peddling scandal involving president ,minister grilled over scandal ,prosecutors on saturday grilled ,scandal involving president park ,south korea special prosecutors","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'the National Pension Service', 'NPS', ""Samsung Group 's""]",10,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.00593418  0.30413052

One of them was that she colluded with Choi to strong-arm Samsung and other local conglomerates into donating some tens of millions of dollars to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi.Moon Hyung-pyo, chief of the National Pension Service , is accused of pressuring the state fund to back a major merger deal between Samsung subsidiaries on behalf of the presidential office when he was health minister last year. The 60 year old served as the country's health minister from December 2013 to August 2015.Early Saturday, the Seoul Central District Court issued a writ to prolong his detention, making him the first suspect to be formally arrested by the special investigation team. Judge Cho Eui-yeon said that criminal facts have been explained and the reason and need for Moon's arrest are recognized.Moon was put into emergency detention early Wednesday after appearing before the special investigation team the previous day for questioning.There have been allegations that the presidential office, Cheong Wa Dae, pressured the state fund -- which held an 11.6 percent stake in Samsung C&T; Corp. and a 5 percent stake in Cheil Industries Inc. -- to support the conglomerate in return for favors Samsung gave to Choi.Moon, who had denied exerting influence in the pension fund's decision at a parliamentary hearing, reversed his statement during an interrogation by the independent counsel team, according to the probe team's spokesman, Lee Kyu-chul.Investigators are now looking into whether President Park was directly involved in the process, which they think could constitute bribery.The investigation team, led by independent counsel Park Young-soo, has been accelerating its probe since its official launch last week, summoning a number of figures implicated in the scandal. The investigation should be completed within 70 days of the start date and can be extended for another month upon request from the special counsel.","arrested in corruption probe ,peddling scandal involving president ,saturday formally arrested south ,formally arrested in corruption ,corruption probe special prosecutors","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Samsung']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.26906171  0.22805536

Lawmakers, who are the prosecutors in an impeachment trial, argued it could pressure companies. Park's lawyers, however, said the court needed to verify facts independent of the findings by state prosecutors, who accused Park of allowing Choi to interfere with government affairs and of colluding with Choi to extort money and favors from the country's largest companies.   The court said there was no way to force Park to appear and the trial can proceed without her. South Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Park on Dec. 9 over the corruption scandal, and the court has up to six months to decide whether she should permanently step down or be reinstated. During the impeachment trial, the court will also review lawmakers' accusations that Park was responsible for media restrictions and government inaction during a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people, mostly teenagers on a school trip.State prosecutors have passed the investigation to a special prosecution team, which on Friday summoned an arrested former presidential aide for the second time this week as they focus on bribery suspicions between Park and the Samsung Group.Ahn Jong-beom, Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, allegedly directed former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo to pressure the National Pension Service to support a merger between two Samsung affiliates last year.The deal reduced the pension fund's stake in one of the companies by an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in value, but allowed Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong to promote a generational transfer of leadership and increase corporate wealth at the group.Samsung is one of the main companies that gave a combined 77.4 billion won  to two non-profits Choi allegedly controlled and abused to expand her personal wealth. Choi, Ahn and Jung Ho-sung, another arrested presidential aide accused of passing on confidential government information to Choi, will be called to testify Jan. 10.","impeachment trial south korea ,dismissing demands by lawmakers ,constitutional court on friday ,next week dismissing demands ,testify in impeachment trial","[""South Korea 's"", 'Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.23088028  0.10036749

This all in stark contrast to suspended President Park Geun-hye and a number of her key aides who are currently facing investigation over corruption allegations.The practical state affairs leader is now also being counted as a plausible presidential hopeful for the ruling Saenuri Party -- a rumor’s made no effort to fully quash.“We have to expand on the ‘one strike and you’re out’ system  against those who misrepresent distribution dates or sell nonconforming products, so as to fundamentally prevent all unqualified sellers from setting foot back in the market,” Hwang said Friday at a ministerial Cabinet meeting on food safety measures, gesturing at taking an active stance on the issue. Prime Minister and acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn chairs a meeting on bird flu countermeasures held at the Seoul Government Complex on Friday. Prime Minister’s OfficeHe also chaired a public-private joint task force on responding to the bird flu virus sweeping through farms.His assertive tone over his presidential role during these key meetings was also reflected in a recent talk with reporters, where he refrained from denying a potential bid in the forthcoming presidential race.“I have already told you everything,” the prime minister said repeatedly during a luncheon with reporters Thursday, when asked in various formats whether or not he would run in the earlier-than-planned presidential election next year.Even when asked a clear-cut question, he did not rule out running for president.“I will do my best in serving my current post, and once it is done, I will then make efforts for the future,” he said.Since taking office as prime minister in June 2015, Hwang has officially presided as the No. 2 chief official in the Cabinet, standing next in line to President Park Geun-hye.Despite his position, however, Hwang has mostly been seen as an administrative assistant to the president, partly because of South Korea’s powerful president-centered governance structure and partly because of Hwang’s rigid character.He even came close to resigning when President Park suddenly tapped former liberal presidential aide Kim Byung-joon to be prime minister, as part of her effort to pacify the political turbulence following the outbreak of the extensive corruption scandal whirling around her confidante Choi Soon-sil.Hwang, who was given notice at the last minute reportedly via text message, immediately offered to resign, but soon withdrew his offer, as Kim’s appointment was thwarted upon opposition backlash.It was the president‘s impeachment on Dec. 9 that brought the overshadowed prime minister to the center of the stage. Upon the legislature’s passage of the impeachment resolution and the consequent suspension of Park‘s powers, Hwang became the ninth acting president in the nation‘s history, as well as the second to temporarily replace an impeached state chief.With a reinforced range of authority, Hwang also rose as a likely presidential choice for the ruling Saenuri Party. The conservative camp currently has few options, due to the mass defection of reformist members and the consequent estrangement of Ban Ki-moon, who was set to finish his final term as UN secretary-general on Dec. 31.By Bae Hyun-jung","political upturn this year ,presidential hopeful ,experienced dramatic political upturn ,pm hwang enters 2017 ,presidential hopeful for","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51665509  0.54374599

The state head was impeached by the parliament earlier this month over a scandal involving her confidante. She met with all nine of her attorneys at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday morning to prepare for the inaugural hearing on Jan. 3. Also in attendance at the meeting were two heavyweight figures of the Korean legal circle -- former Constitutional Court Justice Lee Dong-heub and former Prosecutor General Lee Myeong-jae. The two are advisers and not officially appointed as Park’s representatives, sources said. Park is likely to add two more attorneys to create a 11-member legal counsel team, another source revealed.  The Constitutional Court has planned for the first and second hearings to take place on Jan. 3 and 5, respectively, and is likely to try speeding up the trial process. Through preliminary hearings -- with the third and final one to be held Friday -- the court has sought to figure out key points of the trial beforehand in order to get a head start. The parliament’s impeachment motion lists 18 charges against the conservative leader, including violations of multiple clauses of the Constitution, the abuse of power, extortion, leaking government secrets and neglecting her presidential duty to protect the lives of the people. In a written statement submitted to the court last week, Park denied all charges, claiming that the impeachment was a flawed process based on false accusations and no evidence. By law, the top court must decide by June 7, 2017, whether to reinstate Park or finalize her dismissal.

The independent counsel team looking into the corruption scandal that has led to her impeachment said its investigators visited some 10 places, including plastic surgeon Kim Young-jae's clinic and home in Seoul.He is suspected of treating Park with the help of her friend Choi Soon-sil without going through due security procedures.Lee Kyu-chul, spokesman for the probe team, said they are also investigating allegations that Kim illegally prescribed the psychotropic drug propofol.The seizure and search indicated that the investigators are digging into Park's alleged inaction during a ferry disaster in 2014. Her office has yet to clarify what she was doing exactly during the first seven hours of the Sewol sinking, which killed more than300 people, failing to quell rumors that she might have received cosmetic treatment during the critical hours.  Investigators have been looking into allegations that doctors violated medical law by giving prescriptions or treatment to Park without leaving official records. There have been suspicions that the doctors were given business favors in return.Seoul National University Hospital, headed by Suh Chang-suk, was also known to have been searched by investigators. Suh served as Park's official doctor from 2014 to earlier this year. Lee said they are investigating whether Suh neglected his duty by overlooking such irregularities while being aware of them.Meanwhile, the investigation team has asked the Financial Supervisory Service to provide property details for some 40 people related to Choi, who is at the center of the scandal.

The investigators already raided the homes and offices of former Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and incumbent Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun in relation to the list. The former senior secretary for education and culture did not answer any questions from reporters, simply saying he will “cooperate the best he can” with the investigation. Kim Sang-yule, former senior presidential secretary for education and culture, arrives at the independent counsel's office for questioning in southern Seoul on Dec. 28. He had been appointed to the governmental post on the recommendation of his nephew Cha Eun-taek, a jailed associate of the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil. President Park Geun-hye, her aides and Choi are embroiled in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal that has sparked nationwide fury and led to Park’s impeachment earlier this month.Suspicions about the blacklist date back to 2014, when Kim Ki-choon supposedly gave the order to create the list as a means to identify and disadvantage those who are critical of the Park administration. Former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong claimed to have seen the list in June 2014, saying he believed it was created by the presidential office.Evidence suggests that the list was used for the conservative government to reign in liberal figures.A daily log by former late Presidential Secretary Kim Young-han showed that Kim Ki-choon had instructed officials “to actively respond against schemes by leftist artists.” Park Young-soo’s team is said to suspect that the list was actually initiated by Choi and was used to weed out individuals that could get in the way of her winning state-funded projects. Choi and former presidential aide An Chong-bum have been accused of establishing the Mir and K-Sports foundations to coerce donations from local conglomerates.But both Choi and An have testified that both the donations and the establishment of the foundations were under orders from President Park. It was reported earlier that a former Cheong Wa Dae official told investigators that the president had established the Mir Foundation in order to “take care of” culture circles, particularly individuals perceived as liberals.Renowned poet Ko Eun was among those on the document, with the listed reasons simply being “supporting Moon Jae-in,” an opposition front-runner for next year’s presidential race.Ko said that the government disgusted him, adding that it was “an honor” to be on the list.The blacklist is said to include those who supported Moon in the 2012 presidential election, those who supported liberal Mayor Park Won-soon in the 2014 election, and those who supported the joint statement denouncing the government in the wake of the 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol. South Korea’s Ambassador to France Mo Chul-min, who was the presidential education and cultural affairs secretary at the time, was also summoned for questioning in relation to the list.Key government figures embroiled in the blacklist scandal have denied the allegations. Park and Kim Ki-choon remained silent as of Wednesday, and Minister Cho denied ever seeing the list or giving orders related to the list.The opposition responded furiously, with Rep. Kim Young-joo, a member of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea’s Supreme Council, suggesting that Cho should be taken into custody to prevent her from destroying evidence.The parliamentary culture and education committee were to receive a report from the Culture Ministry on Wednesday afternoon. In addition to allegations surrounding the blacklist, the independent counsel’s team also pursued their investigation on other corruption charges surrounding the embattled president.It has been alleged that President Park received illegal medical treatments from doctors associated with Choi, in exchange for granting favors to them.

9,9,Political awakening of teens,"Based on South Korea’s current legal standards, Yoon Kyeong-ah is considered too immature to form a political opinion or vote in elections. But the 18-year-old high school senior from Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, believes otherwise.

But the 18-year-old high school senior from Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, believes otherwise. She may be immature in some aspects of life, but is fully aware of what has been going on in her country over the past few months, said Yoon.  “I came here to show that we  have a voice in society,” Yoon told The Korea Herald on Nov. 19, when she joined tens of thousands of protesters at a massive rally in central Seoul against President Park Geun-hye. “I couldn’t just stay home watching the president’s irresponsible attitude.” Two high school students hold banners and candles during the fourth Saturday rally against President Park Geun-hye in central Seoul on Nov.19. Amid the bizarre and shocking scandal involving Park and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, South Korea is witnessing the political awakening of an unlikely demographic -- teenagers. The anti-Park rallies -- held every Saturday since late October, with its turnout peaking at 2.3 million on Dec. 3 -- have been a telltale sign of their increased interest in politics.   The Nov. 19 protest took place two days after the national college entrance exam. It drew a conspicuously larger group of teen participants. Many of them were in school uniform and some local media outlets described this new breed of protestors as “the legion of school uniform.” Some of the teen protestors were even more outspoken than their older counterparts, speaking confidently of their rights as citizens on makeshift stages and podiums on moving trucks. They expanded the discussion about lowering the voting age. “Youths and teens are participating more and caring more about current affairs,” said Kim Ji-yoon, also 18, who came to the Nov. 19 candlelight vigil after her college entrance exam. Unlike their counterparts in many other countries, 18-year-olds in South Korea are not allowed to vote. They are even banned by law from joining political parties or expressing political opinions continuously to affect any election. The law has been challenged by proponents of an earlier voting age in the past. But the Constitutional Court has displayed a conservative stance on the issue, rejecting the first appeal in 1997 when the minimum age was 20. It cited that the young “lacks the discernment” and is “immature” when it comes to making political choices. The same reason -- when the voting age was 19 -- was echoed in 2014. In Korea, 18 year olds are seniors in high school while 19 is when they are legally stipulated as adults. Among the 38 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Korea is the only nation stipulating voting rights at 19, while 32 member states grant suffrage to those 18 years and older, with Austria at the even earlier age of 16. Neighboring Japan has lowered its voting age from 20 to 18 in July. Around the globe, 147 countries have set the voting age to start at 18 years. In 2005, Korea revised down the age from 20 to 19. Supporters of the law revision argue that teenagers are “conscious” of state affairs and that they should be allowed to form their political opinions from an early age. “The logic of the opponents is flawed. When a teenager turns 19, they don’t just become enlightened all of a sudden and know who to vote for. Allowing teens to participate in political activities at an earlier age can help them learn” said Choi Seo-hyun, the secretary general of a teen organization called Hope.The civic group led teen’s rallies, financially supporting transportation fees for the students living outside of the capital so that they could participate in protests in central Seoul, with donations from citizens. “Besides, youths have actively played their part in social issues including the state-authored textbooks and the Sewol ferry disaster. History shows that the young were always at the forefront of rallies to fight for their rights,” Choi added. High school seniors who demand voting rights highlighted that the older generation can also have “flawed” political stances. “Not all adults are ‘mature’ enough to make political choices. Look at those 50s and 60s loyal to Park regardless of what she did. Though we are young, we are willing to speak out about state matters as citizens of South Korea,” said Kim Ji-yoon, 18, at a rally held on Nov. 17. “I would like to vote for the right leader.”Political circles are highly divided over voting age. Lowering the voting age is favored by the liberal opposition and opposed by the ruling conservatives for their own political interests. That is why some experts are skeptical that the election law can be changed anytime soon. According to a latest poll by Gallup Korea, the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea garnered 57 percent support among teenagers and those in their 20s, while the ruling Saenuri Party saw only 5 percent of support from this demographic group. This year again, lawmakers from opposition parties -- the Democratic Party, People’s Party and Justice Party -- have proposed a motion to grant suffrage to those who are 18. But the bill has been in limbo, lacking a major political push. “Eighteen-year-olds can legally get married, obtain their driver’s license and even serve the military. They of course can have political opinions and make political choices,” Rep. Kim Kwan-young of the People’s Party told The Korea Herald. He was among the 23 members of the opposition party who proposed the bill. A politics professor at Myongji University, Shin Yul, also pointed out that the political climate should be taken into account, as in Korea, voting results are often said to reflect regionalism, school relations, and kinship.“I’ve seen students who are much cleverer than some adults during the protests. However, a failed attempt to invite the 18-year-old students to ballot can turn high schools into a political battlefield,” Shin said. “It may not be a good idea to infuse such voting culture to young voters so early as they may easily be swayed.”A liberal professor from Seoul National University, Cho Guk, argues that lawmakers should grant voting rights to the teenagers, citing the world trend.Students played some key roles in several movements in the past, such as in the Gwangju Democratic Uprising in 1987 against the authoritarian regime led by then President Chun Doo-hwan. In 2008, when thousands gathered to protest against the import of US beef due to fears about mad cow disease, a big portion of the rally-goers were students holding candles. After the 2014 Sewol ferry incident resulted in more than 300 dead or missing -- most of them high school students on their way to a field trip -- teens also took to the streets to condemn the government for its mishandling of the disaster.

Joo Ho-young came as the conservatives are casting a wide net for competent candidates to represent them in the next presidential election.   Rep. Joo Ho-young of the tentatively named New Conservative Party for Reform. ""Sohn has left the Democratic Party, and currently does not hold any party affiliation. He also served as a provincial governor, affiliated with the Grand National Party  and thus shares similar visions with us,"" the whip of the tentatively named New Conservative Party for Reform, told YTN Radio. The GNP is the predecessor of Saenuri. Joo bolted from the Saenuri Party on Tuesday along with 28 other lawmakers disgruntled with the party's loyalists to President Park Geun-hye. Sohn served as a lawmaker and the governor of Gyeonggi Province when he was a member of the GNP. He left the conservative party in 2007 to run in the presidential election on the opposition ticket.He retired from politics in 2014 after losing a parliamentary by-election. He returned from the wilderness in October to prepare for the election and bolted from the main opposition Democratic Party.The Saenuri defectors' group with 30 lawmakers has been seeking to recruit more influential figures to expand its presence. Pundits said Joo's remark indicates it is open to accepting politicians from the centrist and even opposition blocs.They plan to establish the new party on Jan. 24, with more lawmakers from Saenuri expected to join down the road.""While preserving traditional conservative values on economy and social issues, bona fide conservatism should embrace changes about things that are behind the times and in areas many people demand ,"" Joo said. ""But as far as national security is concerned, we will thoroughly stick to traditional views.""Joo also ruled out the possibility that his colleagues might return to Saenuri before the presidential election, emphasizing the strong determination they showed when leaving the party.","next presidential election rep ,recruit former opposition leader ,presidential election rep joo ,new party floor leader ,presidential election rep","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Sohn Hak - kyu', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Joo Ho - young', 'New Conservative Party for Reform']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.08756796  0.37333354

Kim Sang-yule, former senior presidential secretary for education and culture, arrives at the independent counsel's office for questioning in southern Seoul on Dec. 28, 2016. Kim served as senior presidential secretary for education and culture from 2014 to earlier this year. ""I will fully cooperate with the special counsel's investigation,"" Kim told reporters before entering the office.

Hwang Young-cheul of the New Conservative Party for Reform said the confidante Choi Soon-sil paid 1.13 million won  to Chaum, an upscale anti-aging clinic, in Seoul from 2011 to 2014, which also included the cost for a blood test on Park. Choi's sister, Choi Soon-deuk, also paid 1.1 million won over the cited period.Park was impeached by the parliament earlier in December amid allegations that Choi exerted influence on state affairs without any official seat in the administration while pursuing personal benefits. The confidante is currently in custody.The figures are based on 29 medical records of the two Chois, which used bynames, such as ""VIP,"" ""Park chairman"" and ""Blue,"" apparently referring to the president. The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae is often called the Blue House.The Choi family paid for 27 cases, while the remaining two were not actually prescribed for Park.Investigators are trying to determine the nature of such payments, as Choi was earlier accused of paying for Park's clothes and bags, which could result in bribery charges. The presidential office had issued a statement saying Park had paid back all expenses incurred for the purchase of the clothes and bags.""The prescription by proxy to help Park receive shots, and having Choi pay for them could be problematic,"" Hwang said, adding such payments by the confidante also adds more suspicion to the influence-peddling scandal.","impeached president park geun ,currently impeached president park ,13 million won 936 ,of currently impeached president ,investigation shows choi paid","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Hwang Young', 'the New Conservative Party for Reform', 'Chaum']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.45179206  0.63358682

Investigators have 48 hours to seek a formal arrest warrant or release him.There have been allegations the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae pressured the state fund -- which held an 11.6 percent stake in Samsung C&T; Corp. and a 5 percent stake in Cheil Industries Inc. -- to support the conglomerate in return for favors Samsung gave to the president's close friend Choi Soon-sil. Choi, currently in custody, is under trial over a string of corruption charges where President Park was named accomplice by state prosecutors. Park who refuted all charges leveled against her is awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment after the parliament voted to oust her on Dec. 9. Moon, who served as health and welfare minister from December 2013 to August 2015 before becoming the pension chief, has been denying the suspicions raised against him, saying he did not have any contact with the presidential office or Samsung regarding the deal beforehand.""As far as I know, we have explained our stance multiple times,"" Moon told reporters before entering the office. ""I will fully cooperate with the interrogation."" He declined to comment further.Last year, then Samsung C&T;, the group's construction arm, successfully merged with Cheil Industries, which was then the de facto holding firm of the conglomerate.At the time, Samsung had faced strong challenge from individual shareholders, led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Associates, over the merger plan. The deal was widely seen as an attempt to smoothly transfer power from group owner Lee Kun-hee to his son, Jae-yong.The NPS' backing for the merger drew criticism as its decision was not reviewed by an independent panel, which generally advises the state fund in exercising voting rights for invested firms. Also Tuesday, the investigators questioned former Vice Culture Minister Chung Kwan-joo over suspicions he was involved in creating a ""blacklist"" of cultural figures who are critical of the government, while he worked as a presidential secretary from late 2014 to early this year.The investigation team said the two were summoned to bear witness to each case but added their status can change to that of a suspect following the probe. An Chong-bum, former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, also appeared at their office later in the day. He earlier declined to answer the summons citing health issues but following the team's repeated demands, showed up in the afternoon. An is currently standing trial, along with Choi and Jeong Ho-seong, ex-senior secretary for private presidential affairs, for their involvement in the alleged corruption and influence-peddling scandal that has been rocking the country since late October.The team also summoned Choi to appear before investigators Tuesday, but she too refused, claiming poor health.""In the case of defendants in custody, we can seek an arrest warrant if they repeatedly refuse to appear before investigators,"" the teams' spokesman Lee Kyu-chul said.","emergency detention early wednesday ,wednesday over suspicions he ,prosecutors took south korea ,detention early wednesday ,detention early wednesday over","[""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'the National Pension Service', 'NPS']",10,[1.         0.         1.         ... 0.14192872 0.55120677 0.02674973],신용배,Social affairs,12,2016,"detention early wednesday over suspicions ,for questioning on tuesday investigators ,into emergency detention early wednesday ,office for questioning on tuesday ,wednesday over suspicions he pressured","[""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'the National Pension Service', 'NPS', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'Cheong', 'Samsung C&T', 'Corp.', 'Cheil Industries Inc.', 'Samsung', 'Park', ""the Constitutional Court 's"", 'Samsung', 'Moon', 'Samsung C&T', 'Cheil Industries', 'Samsung', 'U.S.', 'Elliott Associates', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'NPS', 'Chung Kwan - joo', 'Chong', 'Choi', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Choi', 'Lee Kyu - chul']",0,[1.         0.         1.         ... 0.14192872 0.55120677 0.02674973]

Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, said during a party meeting that it would hold regular discussions with civic society on what it calls “legislative reform.” “In order for the reform to take place at the February session of the National Assembly, we must collect opinions from civic society within January,” he said.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, speaks at a party meeting Tuesday. Rep. Kim Song-sik, chief policymaker of the minor opposition People’s Party, also stressed the necessity of the passage of reform-related bills to “eradicate residual harmful effects of the Park Geun-hye administration.” The legislative reform refers to the passage of laws for agendas that have been jointly pursued by the opposition bloc, but have been thwarted by the ruling Saenuri Party’s status as the majority party. A mass defection of 29 nonmainstream Saenuri lawmakers has shrunk the ruling party down to 99 members. Falling below the 100-member mark is of particular significance, as the Korean law stipulates that at least one-third of the 300-member parliament is required to hinder a legislative process via a filibuster. Opposition by one-third of the parliament is also necessary to foil an amendment of the Constitutional Law.The opposition bloc can now potentially bypass the law to directly push through the legislative process, as the law only requires consent of 60 percent -- or 180 -- of the lawmakers. This means if the opposition can get the Saenuri defectors to fall in line with their reform drive, any objection by those in Saenuri who are pro-Park would not be a factor. The opposition party leaders have already extended a hand to the conservative opposition bloc to partake in their reform.Among the legislations expected to be pursued are bills to amend the anti-terrorism bill, which is disputed for infringing people’s privacy, install an investigative body on corrupt civil servants, extend the operation of the special committee on investigating the 2014 sinking of ferry Sewol, and ban the adoption of the controversial state-authored textbook.“Obviously we need to negotiate within the political circles but if that fails, isn’t it time that the principal of majority should take effect?” said Park Wan-joo, the deputy floor leader of the Democratic Party, implying that they should capitalize on their majority for the legislation.In addition to the parliamentary majority, nationwide discontent toward the president is also expected to propel the reform drive. President Park’s alleged involvement in the recent corruption and influence-peddling surrounding her confidante Choi Soon-sil has led to multiple candlelight vigils -- with up to 2.3 million participants at one point -- and the National Assembly passing a motion to impeach her.The Constitutional Court is currently deliberating the case.By Yoon Min-sik","said during party meeting ,the opposition bloc tuesday ,opposition pushes for bills ,media officialdom the opposition ,korea said during party","['Woo Sang - ho', 'Democratic Party of Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44920865  0.2736395

The team earlier said it has secured a court warrant to detain Chung for questioning on charges of business obstruction.The team said it decided to make the request as she has declined to respond to the investigation despite repetitive summons.Choi is suspected of having exercised influence over key state affairs and used her ties with Park for financial gains and personal favors. State prosecutors identified Park as an accomplice.South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group allegedly signed a 22 billion-won  contract with a Germany-based company owned by Choi and financially supported her daughter Chung's purchase of equestrian horses, training and other costs. The team, meanwhile, said it has also confiscated a mobile phone of Kim Ki-choon, 77, who served as presidential chief of staff from 2013 to 2015. Kim is suspected of overlooking and even protecting the president's Choi as she meddled in state affairs without any government post.The independent counsel raided Kim's house Monday. The team said it is also considering raiding the presidential office.","choi daughter on interpol ,corruption case surrounding president ,daughter on interpol ,daughter on interpol wanted ,court warrant to detain","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'interpol', 'Choi', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Germany', 'Chung']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.10443858  0.25424337

Choi has been indicted for allegedly conspiring with Park and her former aides for crimes such as coercion, embezzlement and abuse of authority. He had claimed repeatedly that he knew nothing of Choi, but recently admitted that he has had some knowledge of her.The man, once referred to as the invisible hand behind the Park administration, is suspected of exercising undue influence over the Culture Ministry, as part of his effort to protect Choi’s interests and muzzle complaints against the president. Kim, recently barred from leaving the country, is suspected of ordering then-Vice Culture Minister Kim Hee-bum to have six high-ranking ministry officials resign from their posts in 2014. Former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong claimed that this was a prerequisite for establishing the Mir and K-Sports foundations, nonprofit organizations believed to have been founded as cover to channel public funds to Choi.The disgraced top presidential aide is also embroiled in suspicion surrounding the so-called “blacklist” of those in culture circles who are anti-government. Local civic groups filed a complaint to Park Young-soo’s team earlier in the month against Kim, accusing him of instructing culture ministry officials to create the list and ban them from participating in state-funded projects.The incumbent Culture Minister Cho Yun-sun’s home and office were raided earlier in the day, along with ministry departments believed to have managed the list. Kim Ki-choon is also accused of pressuring the culture ministry to appoint an acquaintance of former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong as the vice chief of the organizing committee for the 2018 PyongChang Winter Olympics.Kim Chong was questioned by the special counsel team for the third straight day on Monday over the aforementioned allegation, along with the suspicion that he coerced local companies to provide financial support for organizations related to Choi and her family. Investigators suspect that the contributions may have been in effect bribes to Choi -- who is linked to the president, with the biggest benefactor being Samsung Group. Among those whose homes were raided Monday were former welfare minister Moon Hyung-pyo and Kim Jin-soo -- former Cheong Wa Dae senior secretary for health and welfare -- who are suspected of pressuring the National Pension Service to support a controversial merger of two Samsung Group companies in 2015. “I think it would be fair to say that Moon is suspected of abusing his authority,” said an official from the independent counsel’s team.  The merger between Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries is believed to be crucial for Samsung Vice Chairman and heir apparent Lee Jay-yong to tighten his control over the entire Samsung Group. Lee’s family effectively “owns” the group via a complex cross-shareholding structure. Hong Wan-sun, former head of the asset management division for the NPS, was also summoned Monday to be questioned by the special probe team on his role in the merger. He denied to having received then-minister Moon’s orders to support the move, but declined to answer any other questions.In addition to Kim Ki-choon, another former Park aide Woo Byung-woo is also subject to investigation for allegedly knowingly condoning Choi‘s wrongdoings. The prosecution’s special team on Woo officially wrapped up their work and disbanded Monday, handing over the investigation files to the independent counsel‘s team. In addition to charges of neglecting duty and abusing authority -- both related to Choi scandal -- Woo is accused of embezzling funds from a family-owned company, asserting influence for his son to receive favoritism during mandated military service, hiding personal assets via borrowed names and receiving kickbacks via a shady sale of his family‘s property in Seoul. While Woo’s Choi-related suspicions will be primarily handled by Park Young-soo‘s team, residual investigation on the former presidential secretary will jointly be conducted by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, according to officials.By Yoon Min-sik","peddling scandal surrounding president ,team on monday raided ,on monday raided homes ,monday raided homes ,monday raided homes and","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Park Young']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.33701035  0.33793852

Choi, who is currently detained for trial on allegations that she used her ties to Park to manipulate state affairs, is the central figure in a sweeping cronyism scandal that led to the president’s impeachment earlier this month. “Choi spent most of the time expressing frustration about the situation she ended up in,” said Rep. Chang Je-won of the governing Saenuri Party, one of members of the parliamentary inquiry committee who interviewed Choi at her detention cell. The closed-door interview, which lasted more than two hours, took place, when lawmakers visited her room in the detention facility in southern Seoul. Including Choi, former presidential aides involved with the scandal -- An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong -- was also questioned by the lawmakers. As the final session of their investigation into the scandal, the parliamentary panel sought to hold a hearing at the facility where Choi and the presidential aides are being held. But none of them appeared, citing that their appearance could affect pending trial and ongoing investigation.Instead, the lawmakers interviewed them at the detention cell. During the session, Choi denied all the allegations surrounding her, including accusations she extorted money from conglomerates and channeled it to two foundations run by her. She also said she had never conspired with President Park for any crimes nor engaged in any wrongdoing. The 60-year-old Choi also said she had never met former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and former Presidential Secretary of Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo, who were suspected of neglecting their duty and allegedly allowed Choi to meddle in state affairs. The seats for three key witnesses are vacant at a parliamentary hearing at the Seoul corrections headquarters in Uiwang, south of Seoul, Monday. Choi Soon-sil refused to show up for the first hearing to be held at a prison facility in 19 years. Presidential aide An, meanwhile, told the lawmakers that President Park had instructed him to make the conglomerates contribute donations to the foundations run by Choi. An was in charge of coordinating government policies until he resigned over the scandal in October. During the interview, Presidential aide Jung admitted that he had delivered classified document to Choi and that she had edited some of them. Among the documents are presidential speeches and a list of appointee for the government posts.  Before the interview took place at the detention facilities, the lawmakers denounced their refusal to appear at the hearing, saying that their behavior was tantamount to contempt of the National Assembly and that they would take legal action against them.   “It is like a battle between Choi and the people. If we back down and fail to see Choi, it will be a victory for Choi and defeat for the people,” said Rep. Ha Tae-keung of the Saenuri Party, a member of the bipartisan panel. “We should stay here until Choi shows up.”  Lawmakers pay a vist to the detention center to interview with Choi Soon-sil. YonhapThe lawmakers had held high expectations for the rare parliamentary inquiry being held at the prison. A similar inquiry had taken place for the first time in 1997 when a conglomerate leader was under questioning in prison for causing the nation’s worst financial crisis. But the much-anticipated session took a hit Sunday when Choi and the presidential aides notified the lawmakers of their refusal to attend the hearing. There is no legal measure to enforce their attendance, except for imprisonment and fines -- relatively lenient punishments for the already imprisoned witnesses. Outraged by the no-show of the key suspects, some panel members asserted that the National Assembly should enact a law to mandate summoned witnesses testify when upon receiving a subpoena from lawmakers. “The reason why we can’t force Choi to take the stand is that there is no legal ground to enforce it,” said Rep. Ahn Min-suk of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. “We have to pass a bill to enforce their attendance when we hold a plenary session this Thursday.Rep. Kim Kyung-jin of the third-biggest People’s Party urged the lawmakers to hold another hearing for Choi and extend the working period for the bipartisan committee investigating her. The committee was scheduled to finish its term Jan 15. Since the committee was launched in November, the panel members have struggled to find conclusive evidence linking Choi to the president. The lawmakers were blocked from investigating the presidential office and key witnesses refused to attend a parliamentary inquiry.Over the past five sessions, Choi has not taken the stand and neither have former presidential aides An and Jeong. They have given reasons ranging from physical illness to the risk of impacting ongoing investigation. “My biggest disappointment for the inquiry is that most of key witness refused to take the stand,” said Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the governing Saenuri Party, a third–term lawmaker who chairs the bipartisan committee.But the lawmakers have managed to summon some high-profile presidential aides and business leaders suspected of colluding with Choi to seek personal gain, offering the public a rare glimpse inside the nepotism issue here. Among them were Samsung Electronic Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo, former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and former Presidential Secretary of Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo.While most witnesses denied the allegations -- and some lawmakers were criticized for conspiring perjury and covering old ground -- they found themselves on the hot seat for new revelations to the public, which clashed with their previous testimonies. For instance, Presidential Chief of Staff Kim’s claim that he had never heard of Choi until the scandal erupted was refuted by a report from an online commenter. He sent the lawmaker a video clip of Kim watching President Park being grilled over her connection to Choi and her father when she was a lawmaker in 2007. “One of the achievements for the inquiry was that it saw unprecedented cooperation with civil society,” said Kim Gap-soo, former head of the Korean Society Opinion Institute. “It is truly two-way communication we have never seen before.”By Yeo Jun-suk","the president impeachment earlie ,denies all wrongdoings president ,all wrongdoings president park ,the president impeachment ,president impeachment earlie","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28820151  0.41505569

The team also confiscated data from the ministry in Sejong, 121 kilometers south of Seoul.Kim is suspected of overlooking and even protecting the president's confidante Choi Soon-sil as she meddled in state affairs without any government post. The team said it raided Kim's home in central Seoul around 7 a.m., securing documents related with his duty at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.Sources said the team is also searching the homes of several figures at South Korea's cultural ministry, as Kim is suspected of ordering the ministry to layoff six high-ranking officials, which can be viewed as abuse of power.While three of them actually left the ministry, observers suspect the request came in line with the steps to establish the Mir and K-Sports Foundations.The two foundations, virtually controlled by Choi, collected large-sum donations from local conglomerates. Investigators suspect Choi attempted to take control of the foundations' assets. Kim and Cho are currently accused of writing a so-called ""blacklist"" of cultural figures. There has been an allegation that the government had a list of artists who participated in anti-government statements. Cho has been denying such suspicions, claiming there are no such lists.Kim Chong, a former vice culture minister under custody, is also suspected of requesting the former top presidential aide provide a favor to an executive at the ministry who will be designated to the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympics.Kim Ki-choon has a long history in Korean politics. He served Park Chung-hee, who was president for 18 years after seizing power in a military coup in 1961. Park, the father of President Park Geun-hye, was assassinated in 1979. Kim's close ties with the Park family led to allegations that he was aware of Choi's meddling in state affairs.While Kim has insisted he does not know Choi personally, he later revised the statement after the parliamentary committee came up with evidence that showed he was at least aware of the confidante.","prosecutors raided the homes ,corruption scandal surrounding president ,aide special prosecutors raided ,special prosecutors raided ,special prosecutors raided the","['Park Geun', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Cho Yoon - su']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49116468  0.62808806

She is suspected of colluding with her long-time friend Choi Soon-sil, now jailed, to twist the arms of business leaders to fund two non-profit foundations on culture and sports.State prosecutors earlier alleged that Park abused her power to help Choi, who had no government post, in her campaign to raise funds and also leaked some classified state documents to her.The allegations led the National Assembly to impeach Park in early December. The president is awaiting the final decision by the Constitutional Court on her presidential fate, with her authority suspended.The special prosecutor's team, however, suspects that Park might have taken bribes from local conglomerates seeking business favors.""For now,  can't tell you the specific timing of a raid ,"" Lee Kyu-chul, spokesman for the special prosecutor's office, told reporters. "" are still reviewing whether the raid is necessary and if so, which part should be a focus.""If there is raid of the presidential office, he added, it will be done ""publicly,"" not secretly. The move is apparently aimed at putting pressure on Cheong Wa Dae which has opposed a raid by prosecutors of the presidential office.There's speculation that the investigators may seek a search warrant for Cheong Wa Dae as early as this week.If taken, it would represent a prelude to a face-to-face interrogation of Park, the first time for prosecutors to directly question a sitting South Korean president in a criminal case.People here hope that the special prosecutors' team will be able to reveal the truth behind all the allegations including whether Park neglected her duties in the handling of a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 passengers, mostly high school students.Earlier in the day, meanwhile, the team summoned Jeong Ho-seong, former secretary for private presidential affairs, who was jailed on charges of leaking confidential documents to Choi.","corruption scandal involving president ,mulls raid on presidential ,prosecutors may soon raid ,raid on presidential office ,special prosecutor mulls raid","['south korean', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44159472 -0.01135491

The special parliamentary probe committee Sunday made preparations to hold an on-site hearing at the Seoul Detention Center starting from 10 a.m. Monday, according to officials.The center, located in Uiwwang, Gyeonggi Province, is where key suspect Choi has been kept in custody since late October. Woo Byung-woo, a former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, attends a parliamentary hearing Thursday to answer questions on his alleged involvement with Choi Soon-sil. Choi was absent, citing health reasons. Choi, who earlier attended the court’s pretrial and underwent the independent counsel’s questioning, has absented herself from the five parliamentary hearings held so far, citing poor health and mental distress.Unlike the special prosecutor team and court, however, the parliamentary committee does not have the ability to summon witnesses against their will.Two former presidential officials, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, have also been called to take the stand, but like Choi, their attendance still remains uncertain.The parliamentary committee’s plan is to have An and Jeong brought from their detention center in western Seoul to the Seoul Detention Center for the day, to exert pressure on Choi. But they are also considering visiting the two centers separately, if the two former Blue House figures resist the summons. However, concerns persist that the parliamentary hearing will draw out little from the reticent culprits and that the task of finding the truth will eventually go to the special prosecutors.Another challenge for the legislature, apart from the stalemate in its probe, is the mounting pressure that it should move on from the corruption scandal and pay more attention to economic issues.Rival parties have recently been gesturing at holding a provisional session early next year, as the ruling Saenuri Party’s factional feud has halted all parliamentary discussions this month.The Saenuri also agreed that a supplementary budget may be necessary to add momentum to the nation’s stalled economy.Meanwhile, reformists of the divided Saenuri camp are expected to exit their party Tuesday to create a new conservative political entity.Their key task is to gather at least 35 lawmakers -- according to an early proclamation -- and hopefully raise the number to 38 or more, in which case they would outnumber the People’s Party to become the third-largest party in the National Assembly.By Bae Hyun-jung","parliamentary probe committee sunday ,grill choi in detention ,detention centers this week ,hearing at local detention ,the president longtime friend",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19641159  0.52647913

23,23,Former prosecutor says he hasn't heard of bribery allegations against Ban Ki-moon,"A former chief prosecutor who led an investigation into a high-profile lobbying scandal back in the mid-2000s has told Yonhap News Agency that he doesn't know anything about the recent allegations raised against UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.""Many people have been calling me since this morning, but I don't know anything about it,"" said Lee In-kyu, former chief investigator at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, durin...","A former chief prosecutor who led an investigation into a high-profile lobbying scandal back in the mid-2000s has told Yonhap News Agency that he doesn't know anything about the recent allegations raised against UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.""Many people have been calling me since this morning, but I don't know anything about it,"" said Lee In-kyu, former chief investigator at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, during a meeting with Yonhap in Seoul on Saturday.Earlier in the morning, the weekly magazine Sisa Journal reported that Ban allegedly received a kickback worth $230,000 from Park Yeon-cha, a businessman who was at the center of the corruption scandal involving close aides to and family members of late President Roh Moo-hyun.""While I am not sure about the veracity , I don't know anything about it,"" Lee claimed.Citing several anonymous sources close to Park, the magazine quoted Park as saying that he handed a paper bag carrying $200,000 in cash to Ban at the residence of the foreign minister in Hannam-dong, southern Seoul, in 2005. Ban was the foreign minister at that time. The magazine also reported, citing a person close to Park, that Park asked the owner of a restaurant in New York to pass on another US$30,000 to Ban in early 2007, right after Ban was elected UN secretary-general. The money was allegedly given to Ban. The probe team covered up the allegations for fear of causing damage to national interests, even though it had secured the testimony from Park in March 2009 that he gave money to Ban, the report continued, citing Park's lawyer.He added that even if it were true, the allegations in 2005 won't be prosecutable because the statute of limitations on a bribery charge is only 10 years. Regarding the one in 2007, he said: ""It is not a lot of money. And it doesn't make sense that the money was handed over at the restaurant frequented by Park.""Lee assumed major posts at the prosecutors' office and left the organization in July 2009.","moon former chief prosecutor ,heard of bribery allegations ,kyu former chief investigator ,former prosecutor says he ,lobbying scandal back in","['Yonhap News Agency', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Lee In - kyu', ""the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office""]",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37222144  0.38711137

The embattled president was dealt a blow during the first preliminary proceedings, as the court turned down her objection on its request to the investigators for files related to the corruption and influence-peddling scandal Park is believed to be involved in. The National Assembly on Dec.9 passed a motion to impeach Park on her involvement in the scandal. Three justices of the Constitutional Court take their seats for the first pretrial hearing of President Park Geun-hye's impeachment trial in Seoul on Thursday. Last week, the judiciary requested the prosecution and independent counsel Park Young-soo’s team provide complete records of their investigation into the Choi Soon-sil scandal, named after the president’s nongovernmental confidante who is believed to have illegally interfered in state affairs and embezzled public funds. President Park claimed it was in violation of a Constitutional Law that bans the transfer of files related to an ongoing investigation or trial. Justice Lee Jung-mee of the Constitutional Court cited a clause that says the impeachment trial would follow legal proceedings outlined for criminal procedures, which says the court can decide to ask for files from authorities if necessary.“Even though the investigation record may not be the only evidence, it can be prominent in the trial,” said Justice Lee Jin-sung. The court also selected Choi and Park’s former aides, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, as witnesses for the trial. An is suspected of conspiring with Choi and Park on their illegal activities -- including coercing local conglomerates to raise money for an organization related to Choi -- while Jeong allegedly leaked government secrets to Choi on Park’s orders.Choi and An have been called upon by the parliament multiple times to appear at hearings for the scandal, but they have repeatedly snubbed the requests. The court outlined the five main grounds for impeachment, on which both sides agreed. They are: disregard for people’s sovereign rights and rule of law; abusing presidential authorities; infringing upon freedom of press; violating duties to protect lives of people; and criminal activities including bribery.The court in particular requested Park personally work to uncover the truth behind her “mysterious” seven-hour absence in the aftermath of a 2014 ferry sinking that left 304 dead or missing. The accusation that Park neglected her duty in a control tower role during the disaster to save lives -- specifically pointed out in law -- has been among the biggest hurdles she has faced in the scandal.“Even though two years have passed, most Koreans can vividly remember what they did that day considering the special circumstances. ... I ask  to state where she was in Cheong Wa Dae, exactly what she did, what reports she received and what orders she gave,” Justice Lee Jin-sung told Park’s legal proxies.The next preliminary proceeding is scheduled for Tuesday.Another engine revving to thrust Park out of office is the suspicion of bribery and favoritism given to Choi and her family, which the special investigative team led by the Independent Counsel was working on Thursday.Special counsel Park’s team as of Thursday was investigating the National Pension Agency on relation to cash-for-favors allegations surrounding Choi’s family and Samsung Group. The team has already questioned several of Samsung’s high-ranking officials.There have been suspicions the NPS supported the merger of Samsung C&T; with Cheil Industries -- both companies the NPS holds shares of -- under pressure from the president.Samsung is believed to be the biggest benefactor of the Choi family, which includes financial support for Choi’s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, a dressage rider.Lee Kyu-cheol, a spokesperson for the special counsel team, said during Thursday’s briefing that his team was working to forcibly bring Chung back from Germany, where she is believed to be residing.The team plans to request cooperation from German law enforcement to cooperate in apprehending Chung.He said Chung had been put on a wanted list as of Wednesday, and said any acts helping her escape justice or destroy evidence would be punished by law.The investigative team requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nullify Chung’s passport, and the ministry said it plans to order Chung to turn in her passport. If she does not comply within the designated period, the passport will be nullified, ministry officials said.By Yoon Min-sik","president impeachment the embattled ,impeachment the embattled president ,the president impeachment the ,the president impeachment ,president impeachment the","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.67126453  0.69048434

I did my best,” Woo said during a nationally televised parliamentary hearing on Thursday, denying accusations that he had either actively played a role in the scandal or had neglected his duty to stop it.Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, arrives at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday for a parliamentary hearing. President Park was impeached on Dec. 9 over the scandal which revealed her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of Park’s late mentor and cult leader Choi Tae-min, had been meddling in state affairs. Woo was neither intimidated nor lost his temper when confronted by feisty lawmakers, two of whom had even offered a $10,000 bounty on tips about his whereabouts earlier this month while he was hiding from the public. “I have never met Choi Soon-sil,” he repeated several times to lawmakers.  The former state prosecutor has been sarcastically described by Korean media as the “emperor” for his strong grip on the nation’s most powerful organizations -- the prosecution and the National Intelligence Office -- as well as his arrogant attitude to antagonists. He is also known for having interrogated in 2009, then as a prosecutor, the late President Roh Moo-hyun in a corruption case that eventually led to the liberal president‘s suicide. Opposition politician Moon Jae-in, in his personal account of the probe, recalled Woo as being stiff-necked and arrogant toward the former state head. Moon was present at the questioning session as Roh’s legal representative. Before the Park Geun-hye presidential scandal erupted in October, Woo had been in the news for months already, himself suspected in a number of irregularities. One of them concerns the sale of his family’s real estate in Seoul to Nexon, a local game developer, at a price far higher than the market value. It was suspected that the dubious transaction was in effect a kickback offered to Woo in return for his turning a blind eye to a shady stock deal between a high-ranking state prosecutor and the Nexon founder. Woo vetted the promotion process of the prosecutor, Jin Kyun-joon, at that time. Despite accusations, Woo was not even investigated until the scandal involving Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil came to light. He was questioned by prosecutors only in early November amid the public censure of the president and after two of her other former aides were arrested. The prosecution wrapped up its probe, without indicting Woo. Fresh allegations have surfaced since November. It includes a suspicion, which Woo unwaveringly denied on Thursday’s hearing, that he obstructed a prosecutorial investigation to determine the exact cause of the deadly sinking of the ferry Sewol in 2014, possibly for the president’s political benefit. Lawmakers’ attempts to pressure Woo to own up have failed, as Woo has denied virtually everything. Whether Woo will walk away unscathed from this mess is now up to special counsel Park Young-soo, whose team has publicly vowed to dig into the host of allegations against the 49-year-old prosecutor-turned-presidential secretary.By Lee Sun-young","bizarre as the president ,monitoring corruption and irregularities ,park geun hye scandal ,park former senior secretary ,charge of monitoring corruption","['Park Geun', 'Woo Byung - woo']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.57688445  0.32546657

Woo, Park’s senior secretary for civil affairs from January 2015 to October 2016, claimed that he had never met Choi, the president’s longtime friend accused of meddling in state affairs. “Even at this moment, I don’t know of Choi Soon-sil. I only saw her in the news reports,” said Woo during the fifth parliamentary hearing on the scandal that took place at the National Assembly in Seoul. Lawmakers suspect that it was Choi who handpicked Woo for the post of senior secretary for civil affairs, which includes making sure there is no corruption among officials. Former senior presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo  and former presidential nurse officer Cho Yeo-ok  attend a parliamentary hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. Woo dismissed the allegation as groundless and claimed that that he was selected by Kim Ki-choon, the former presidential chief of staff who had also denied any knowledge of Choi during a previous inquiry. Woo added that he had never met the president before working at Cheong Wa Dae. His stance was consistent with the defiance he has shown since the scandal erupted last October. Not only did Woo deny his involvement with Choi at a prosecutorial probe last month, he had refused to attend the hearing despite mounting calls for him to do so. He accepted the request last week. “I am not running away ,” said Woo, responding to the criticism from lawmakers that Woo might have gone into hiding to avoid testifying at the hearing. “So many reporters were waiting at my house. I couldn’t stay there.” Woo also denied the allegation that he had attempted to block an investigation into the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation run by Choi. They are accused of extorting donations from large businesses such as Samsung and LG.  When questioned whether he had instructed his staff at Cheong Wa Dae to create falsified documents to refute the allegation, Woo said, “I never made such a document. I never gave my staff such instructions.” Woo also denied the accusation that he had prevented prosecutors from probing into rumors that Choi’s former husband Jeong Yun-hoe meddled in state affairs in 2014. Jeong had worked as Park’s top aide when she was a lawmaker in 2006.Also in attendance during the hearing was an Army captain, who had been rumored to perform plastic surgery on the president during the 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol. The officer worked as a nurse at Cheong Wa Dae back then. Having returned from the United States following the lawmakers’ request for her appearance, she denied the allegation that Park received facial injections for beauty purposes on April 16, 2014 when the ship sank and left more than 300 dead or missing. The officer also that said she never saw Park receiving such treatments from others and that the presidential office does not have the psychotropic drug propofol. She, however, declined to comment on whether Park was suffering from sleeping disorders, citing such information as private.The lawmakers, meanwhile, vowed to hold a separate session Friday for Choi Soon-sil who refused to attend the hearing, citing the reason that she is under investigation. They said that if Choi continues to refuse to attend, they will pay a visit to the prison where Choi is being kept.

Chung Yoo-ra Accelerating the investigation into Chung, the special counsel team is working to both invalidate Chung’s passport and ask for the German prosecution’s cooperation to arrest her in the country. If the German court approves the arrest warrant, the German prosecution can extradite her to Korea. If not, the cancellation of Chung’s passport could lead to her deportation. Chung’s whereabouts remain unknown and she refused to attend a parliamentary inquiry into the scandal held last week.Chung’s lawyer Lee Kyung-jae, who also represents her mother Choi, did not specify when Chung will return, saying he has not been in contact with her recently. “We are going to check the charges first and think about how to respond to it. I don’t know when she will return. She has the freedom to make a choice,” he said. The German prosecution is also looking into Choi and Chung’s dubious process of accumulating assets in the country through Choi’s paper company Widec Sports. Choi and Chung could face an up to five-year jail term in Germany for money laundering. Choi and Chung are suspected of receiving 2.8 million euros  in sponsorship from Samsung Group through their paper company to purchase horses and cover Chung’s dressage training fees in Germany. Allegations suggest they spent much of it for personal use. Earlier in the day, the independent counsel team raided the state-run National Pension Service in connection with the merger of Samsung Group’s two affiliates. Choi, who has never held a government post, allegedly influenced the agency to back the merger in return for Samsung Group’s financial support for Chung and donations for the K-Sports and Mir foundations she controlled.Chung is also accused of being unfairly accepted into Ewha Womans University and given overly generous marks without attending classes or turning in assignments, due to her mother’s status. But Lee’s lawyer claimed that Chung’s acceptance into the university is not crime. “It is just that the public are venting anger at it,” he said.Meanwhile, the Education Ministry said Wednesday that Chang Si-ho, Choi’s niece who was arrested over influence-peddling and extortion, also received special favors in her acceptance into Yonsei University. Just like Chung, she was admitted to the school as a student athlete in 1998 and was able to graduate from the university despite her poor academic record, along with 115 other students, according to the inspection result. The ministry said that Chang’s graduation will not be cancelled for legal reasons, but it asked for a criminal investigation into the university over the irregularities. It added that it will impose punishment such as a reduction of admission quotas or the curtailment of state funding for the university, which gave her a university diploma by breaching its own school policy.

Opposition lawmakers relayed their criticism that the prime minster “pretends to be” an elected leader, taking issue with his initial choice not to show up, the recent appointment of high-level posts and his alleged demand for presidential protocol during last week’s visit to National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. Prime Minister and acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn speaks at the parliamentary interpellation session Tuesday afternoon. Rumors also persist that some Park loyalists in the ruling Saenuri Party are considering Hwang as a potential presidential flag bearer in next year‘s presidential election. “I don’t at all,” Hwang said, when Rep. Chae Yi-bai of the minor opposition People’s Party asked whether he was planning or considering running for president. As Rep. Kim Jin-pyo of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea accused Hwang of doing a “costume play” as the president, taking issue with his naming of the new chief of the Korea Racing Authority last week and for other senior positions. With the Constitution lacking clear guidelines on the acting president’s authority, debate has been fierce over whether Hwang is entitled to personnel appointment power. Opposition legislators argue that he should play a minimal, managerial role. “I much bear in mind the discussions about whether acting president could make major appointments,” Hwang said. “But I believe some of the positions, which may help plug a government vacuum and shore up the economy, inevitably need to be filled.” The session was intended to review the government’s responses to a range of pressing socioeconomic issues including the outbreak of bird flu, the US Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate hike and the upcoming US leadership transition. While directing most economy-related questions at Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, opposition lawmakers expressed skepticism toward Hwang’s leadership, following a fracas over his initial decision not to take part in the questioning citing the lack of precedents. The last-minute about-face reflects Hwang’s resolve to foster “collaborative governance” with the Assembly, which is dominated by the opposition in particular, officials said. “The acting president said it is not desirable to be deemed at this point, as if the administration was in conflict with the legislature, which also does not accord with the people’s wishes for a swifter stabilization of state management,” an official at the Prime Minister’s Office told reporters earlier in the day. “The government thinks of the Assembly as the No. 1 communication partner. Without its cooperation, it’s difficult to make and implement any policy.” By Shin Hyon-hee","impeachment motion against president ,on tuesday ruled out ,house bid acting president ,tuesday ruled out the ,motion against president","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.25121543  0.12470302

In a series of remarks following Park’s impeachment -- who now awaits her impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court -- Moon laid out his vision for a “complete overhaul” of the nation and vowed to pursue “revolution” if the court decides to reinstate the president. While energizing his liberal supporters amid mounting anger over Park and her governing Saenuri Party, Moon’s strong rhetoric has drawn criticism that it would ostracize moderate voters during the 2017 presidential election, which could take place earlier than expected if the president is ousted. Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, attends the unveiling of a statue honoring Hyun Bong-hak, who saved some 98,000 North Korean refugees by persuading the US Forces to take them aboard while evacuating. “No matter how outrageous we are, we have to find a solution to protect the people’s lives and property by observing the Constitution,” said South Chungcheong Gov. Ahn Hee-jung, an opposition heavyweight competing with Moon for the presidential race. Since the National Assembly impeached the president over her connection to an influence-peddling scandal tied to her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, Moon has rolled out a series of plans to overhaul the nation’s power structure, economic system and security policies.  Describing the massive public protests against the president as an opportunity to “overhaul” the government system, Moon has pledged to eradicate the nation’s widespread corruption and wrongdoings among the political and business elites.  In order for that to happen, Moon noted that removal of Park from her office is crucial and must take place promptly. He even suggested that the people should consider overthrowing the government if the Constitutional Court decides to bring Park back to power. “Though it is hard to imagine, I think we are left with no choice but to pursue revolution,” said Moon in a media interview last Friday with Kim Yong-ok, a prominent liberal-leaning scholar known by his penname “Dohol.”  Moon also demanded a shift in the president’s approaches on North Korea and diplomatic issues. He urged the government to shift away from its hawkish stance on Pyeongyang and pursue changes in bilateral military agreements with the US and Japan. Moon has not always adopted such an assertive tone. His demands became stronger after the lawmakers passed the impeachment motion against Park earlier this month. Compared to other liberal heavyweights such as Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong, who had called for the immediate resignation of Park, Moon distanced himself from such a proposal and suggested instead that Park should let the prime minister govern the nation. Some Saenuri lawmakers criticized Moon for shifting his stance. They argued that Moon had become more assertive just to appeal to liberal supporters, who have been attracted to outspoken liberal politicians such as Lee since the outbreak of the Choi scandal.“Moon should stop thinking about Lee. He should put the people first,” former Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Won Yu-chul said on Facebook on Sunday. “His radical remarks violate the principles of democracy and the rule of law.”By Yeo Jun-suk","stance unnerves centrist politicians ,unnerves centrist politicians ,remarks following park impeachment ,politicians the main opposition ,unnerves centrist politicians the","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'the Constitutional Court -- Moon']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.30747235  0.2916477

The special team led by independent counsel Park Young-soo said it would hold a ceremony to hang up its signboard Wednesday, symbolically launching its probe into the series of accusations that has left the South Korean leader on the brink of being forced out of office.Choi is suspected of working with her associates, President Park and former presidential aides to meddle in state affairs, interfere in the operations of companies for personal gains and coerce conglomerates to make donations to organizations related to her, which investigators suspect were essentially bribes that might be connected to the president herself.Lee Kyu-cheol, spokesperson for the special counsel team probing into the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her associate Choi Soon-sil, answers reporters’ question after a press briefing Tuesday. The prosecution’s biggest accusation against the president was the abuse of authority, but independent counsel Park has said that adopting such an approach “has many holes,” indicating that he will look into the bribery charges.An official from the special team told local media that the investigators may look into President Park’s bank transactions related to the bribery charges. Even prior to the official launch of the probe, the independent counsel team appeared to be looking into the charges as it reportedly contacted high-ranking officials from Samsung Group. Samsung is among major Korean companies embroiled in the bribery charges, with the company suspected of providing 2.2 billion won  of support to Choi’s family in the form of contracts with her company.The company is also the biggest benefactor of the Mir and K-Sports foundations, two nonprofit organizations which authorities suspect to have served as a cover for channeling public funds to Choi.Samsung Electronics’ Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of the conglomerate, has denied both the allegations and being closely acquainted with Choi.“The pre-arranged meeting  was conducted as part of preparation for the investigation. We will decide whether or not to reveal the details after the investigation begins,” said an official from the investigative team.He said that his team contacted less than 10 people related to the scandal, but declined to elaborate. Korean media outlet Maeil Daily on Tuesday reported that the independent counsel team is set to summon Chang Choong-ki, deputy head of Samsung’s Strategic Planning, as a suspect in the bribery charges.Investigators refused to confirm if Chang and other Samsung officials were investigated as persons of interest or suspects.Park’s team has already barred Samsung’s Vice Chairman Lee from leaving the country.Independent counsel Park is also expected to target the president’s former aides, including ex-Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and her former Senior Secretary Woo Byung-hoo. The two are among former Cheong Wa Dae officials suspected of knowingly condoning or helping Choi with her wrongdoings.Woo, who has vowed to finally appear at Thursday’s parliamentary hearing, is suspected to have interfered in investigation related to the 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol, one of the nation’s worst maritime disasters, which left 304 dead or missing.It is a key factor in the allegations surrounding President Park, as she is suspected of having taken inappropriate actions during her unexplained seven-hour absence in the wake of the accident.“We are aware of the relevant information . But it is not appropriate to say whether or not we will investigate the matter, since it is simply a suspicion as of now,” said an official from the investigative team.The special team has vowed to leave no stone unturned in the investigation, saying that a raid on Cheong Wa Dae itself was “not out of question.”The presidential office told local media Tuesday that it has yet to receive a request from the team, but is preparing for it. It had refused the prosecution’s earlier request to raid the office.Litigations related to the scandal also kicked off this week. Choi, who is at the center of the scandal, appeared at court Wednesday and denied all allegations.The Constitutional Court announced Tuesday that it would hold its first official preliminary for President Park’s impeachment Thursday, during which the legal representatives of parliament -- which passed the motion for impeachment on Dec. 9 -- and Park will face off for the first time.The court will also decide whether to accept the president’s objection to the court's requests to the independent counsel and the prosecution on files related to the Choi scandal. Park had claimed that it is illegal to ask for files related to an ongoing investigation.By Yoon Min-sik","preparation tuesday kicking off ,with park impeachment trial ,corruption scandal surrounding president ,choi scandal kicks off ,tuesday kicking off its","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Park Young - soo']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40711308  0.32857865

Woo, who has been in hiding, is one of the key figures in the influence-peddling and corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, which led to the embattled president’s impeachment earlier this month. Former presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo Left-wing news outlet Hankyeoreh reported the then-presidential secretary phoned a prosecution team raiding the headquarters of the Coast Guard in June 2014 and pressured it not to search and seize computers in its situation room. The computer system allegedly contained sensitive information such as phone records between the Coast Guard and presidential office at the time of the sinking of the ferry Sewol in April 2014. As investigators from the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office refused the call, citing the importance of the evidence, the then-prosecutor-turned-presidential aide ordered it to seek a separate warrant. That resulted in delaying the seizure of the computer server, according to the news outlet. The news reports come amid a series of revelations implicating Woo in the influence-peddling scandal. With an independent counsel team expected to embark on its probe into the scandal Wednesday, Woo will be grilled over his alleged role in condoning or even helping Choi meddle in state affairs and leaking confidential information about the raid on the conglomerate Lotte to Choi. “The civil affairs presidential aide has no legal authority to instruct the investigators whether they can search or not. His call for the investigation team to stop the search constitutes abuse of authority and we will look into it,” an official from the independent counsel was quoted as saying. The revelation about Woo’s alleged meddling in the investigation process came at a critical juncture for the Park Geun-hye administration amid growing suspicions over where the president was and what she was doing while the ferry Sewol was sinking. The nation’s worst maritime disaster left more than 300 people, mostly students on a school trip, dead or missing, with the government’s botched rescue efforts cited as one of the major reasons. Woo also allegedly pressured acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to exert influence on the prosecution when Hwang was serving as justice minister. Hwang reportedly forced investigators not to charge a maritime police officer, who failed to save passengers from the sinking Sewol ferry, with professional negligence.  Following the news reports, the Democratic Party of Korea blasted Woo for overriding the justice system.“Using his connections in the prosecution, Woo has infringed the justice system and ridiculed the public,” Democratic Party spokesperson Park Kyung-mee said in a statement. “We urge the independent counsel to conduct a thorough probe into Woo and clarify all the suspicions.”Woo, who has claimed that he was not able to testify “due to rules that bar him from making public comments related to his job at the presidential office,” will testify at the upcoming and last parliamentary inquiry Thursday. After he was questioned over separate charges of embezzlement and abuse of power, he went into hiding and his whereabouts had remained unknown. Though selected as a witness, he did not appear at a Dec. 7 parliamentary inquiry into the scandal.He faces other accusations that he embezzled money from a family-run company and that he abused his power to help his son be assigned to an easy post during his mandatory military service. Woo has denied all allegations.

But the political situation here has been working against such a scenario, as a corruption scandal has caused Park and her party to plunge to record-low approval ratings. The more Ban was associated with the president, polls suggested, the less approval he received from the public. Now the world’s top diplomat, whose term will end on Dec. 31, appears to be adopting a new strategy in the current political turmoil -- bashing the incumbent president.Outgoing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon talks during a press conference last Friday. “The  people were very much frustrated and angry about the complete lack of good governance,” said Ban during his remarks at a meeting with the Council on Foreign Relations on Friday. “They believed that the trust on and for the leadership of  country was betrayed.”Using words such as “betray” and “trust” -- terms that Park herself had often used to dismiss her dissenters’ pushback against her initiatives -- Ban denounced the president for creating political turmoil “that the Korean people have not seen since the Korean War.” Ban went as far as to compare Park’s leadership to that of her father, former president Park Chung-hee who ruled the nation with an iron fist. He blamed the incumbent president for creating such a crisis in a country where political stability and economic prosperity have come a long way from her father’s presidency. “When her father, President Park Chung-hee, was assassinated in 1979, those were the times when Koreans were going through a turbulent process. But this time, in a very peaceful society,  very democratic, economically well-to-do society, this has happened,” Ban said. But the 72-old career diplomat continued to remain ambiguous about whether he would run in the 2017 presidential election. When asked whether he would offer new leadership to the Korean people, Ban only said he would “focus on the UN agenda” until he finishes his term Outside of a potential presidential bid, Ban has set a different tone from his previous stance on his political ambitions. During his farewell press meeting at the UN on Friday, Ban offered a glimpse into the leadership that he had envisioned, saying that South Korea needs an “inclusive leadership that helps them overcome political challenges.”Ban’s remarks raised speculation that if he decides to throw his hat into the ring at the presidential election, he would not go with the group once led by Park and her loyalists and would decide instead to represent moderate conservatives, such as those among Saenuri lawmakers or the centrist People’s Party. “Currently, Saenuri Party is in a difficult position to represent conservative voters. Should Ban decide to run for the presidential race, I think he would seek a new option,” said former Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, one of the moderate Saenuri lawmakers who is known to be close to Ban. Having clashed with Park loyalists over control of the party since they joined the opposition parties in impeaching the president, some bigwigs from the group of anti-Park Saenuri lawmakers have been casting Ban as their standard bearer and have considered rallying behind him. Earlier this month, former Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who has campaigned for impeaching the president, said that he is “willing to work” with Ban and that “there is no reason” for Ban to the join pro-Park faction. People’s Party interim leader Rep. Kim Dong-cheol described Ban as a platform to expand their political base, leaving open the possibility that the runner-up opposition party could align with Ban for the presidential race.

She was indicted on charges of abuse of authority, extortion and attempted fraud in late November.  Choi, who said publicly earlier she had committed a sin that deserves death, signaled that she would clarify herself and fight back against charges throughout the upcoming trials. “When I first came back from Germany, I was ready to abide by any punishment, but now that I have faced interrogations and  charges, I only feel that I should clarify myself,” she mumbled in front of some 150 spectators in the courtroom. “I am sorry for causing trouble. I will sincerely go through the trial,” she said. Choi was escorted into the courtroom by a female guard and sat next to her lawyer. She appeared in a white prison uniform and black-framed glasses, looking nervous and mostly keeping her head down. Choi, who has neither government post nor policy background, is suspected of colluding with President Park and an ex-presidential aide An Chong-bum to coerce donations from conglomerates for the Mir and K-Sports foundations which she controlled for her personal gains. .“Eight of the allegations raised by the prosecution are that she colluded with the president,” Choi’s lawyer Lee Kyung-jae said. “As she did not collude with the president, she cannot be found guilty of the charges.” Choi Soon-sil, accused of being involved in an influence-peddling scandal, enters a court room in Seoul on Monday. She is also suspected of manipulating state affairs behind the scenes, exerting influence over the culture, education and sports sectors, getting her daughter accepted into a prestigious university and monopolizing lucrative state-led projects for her paper companies.At the first pretrial hearing for Choi, An and another ex-Presidential Secretary Jeong Ho-seong, only Choi turned up at court. Choi had also largely been anticipated not to show up as she has refused to attend the parliamentary hearings investigating the scandal. It is not mandatory for defendants to attend the pretrial hearings during which the prosecution and lawyers for the defendants review the charges, the list of evidence and set the trial schedule. Both An and Jeong claimed that Park was the one who gave them orders to commit wrongdoings including forcing conglomerates to make donations and the leaking of presidential documents.  An’s lawyer denied all the charges including abuse of authority and extortion, saying he was only serving President Park by delivering her intention to conglomerates. Jeong, who was indicted on charges of leaking confidential documents to Choi, admitted to his wrongdoing and said that he had conspired with President Park in doing so. Later in the hearing, Choi’s lawyer also claimed that the prosecution violated Choi’s human rights during the investigation process by illegally summoning her after she had been indicted and calling her in without a warrant. The prosecution immediately refuted the claims. During the probe, Choi, through her lawyer, also asked the judge to check the authenticity of a tablet PC, which the cable-TV network JTBC revealed in late October, saying she had never seen it.The tablet PC, which is supposedly owned by Choi and contained policy drafts and presidential speeches, led to shocking revelations of Choi meddling in state affairs. A total of 8 million South Koreans have taken to the streets over the past eight weeks to demand President Park step down, which led to Park being impeached earlier this month.Park claimed that she had no knowledge of Choi and her ex-aides’ alleged wrongdoings. She also said she had done nothing that deserves impeachment. The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to make a ruling on whether to impeach her.The next preparatory hearing will be on Dec. 29. In a separate hearing held later in the day, Chae Eun-taek, a TV commercial director charged with embezzlement and extortion, only admitted to the embezzlement charge.

The H5N8 strain of the bird flu was detected at a chicken farm located in Anseong, some 77 kilometers south of Seoul.

The conservative president was charged with 18 violations of the Constitution and laws. While rejecting all of the listed charges, Park’s attorneys stressed it is untrue that Choi extensively meddled in state affairs, including appointments of high-level government officials. The special parliamentary team, who will act as “prosecutors” in the historic trial, plans to make a counterargument detailing what merits her removal by Thursday again via written statements to the top court, the team said Sunday. Chaired by Rep. Kwon Sung-dong, the head of the National Assembly Judiciary Committee, the team had its first meeting with legal representatives to prepare for a legal battle with the sanctioned president.  “Tens of thousands of people are staging massive  rallies every Saturday, demanding the whole truth  and punishment of those who are responsible,” Rep. Kwon of the ruling Saenuri Party said. “Opinions may vary, but I believe everyone  would agree that the core values of our Constitution, undermined by this scandal, must be restored as quickly as possible.”  The following is a summary of Park’s written statement as revealed Sunday. - The impeachment motion predicates unconfirmed allegations and thereby violates the presumption of innocence. - Shifting the blame to Park for what Choi Soon-sil did violates a principle that bans collective punishment. - There is no evidence that Choi and others exerted power over state affairs or in appointments of government officials. The Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation were only part of the presidential duty, and not for her personal gain. Park was not aware of Choi’s embezzlement. -   The president may have consulted others in appointing officials, but did not abuse the authority, as she made the final decisions. - Park did not force conglomerates or their affiliates to make donations. The firms stated in the prosecutorial probe that they contributed voluntarily. - Park did not exert undue pressure on the management of media corporations, including local daily Segye Ilbo. - The Sewol ferry incident was a tragic accident, but not reason to impeach the president. - Park’s direction to actively help small and middle-sized companies to the presidential aide was part of her duty and does not constitute bribery. - It is not clear if the speech drafts and other presidential documents were considered confidential documents, and they were not delivered to Choi under Park’s instruction.  Park’s lawyers concluded there is no legitimate evidence nor grave violation of law to justify impeachment. Regarding bribery allegations, any charge should be decided after the court tries Choi, they said.By Jo He-rim","upcoming impeachment trial park ,the upcoming impeachment trial ,parliament impeachment of president ,upcoming impeachment trial ,impeachment of president park","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29229257  0.15855972

Dissenters have been claiming that the battery will hurt Seoul's relations with Beijing.Last year, Seoul and Tokyo also reached a deal that centers on Japan's admission of responsibility for the wartime crimes against sex slaves and plans to pay reparations to the victims. South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.After the impeachment of Park earlier this month, opposition parties claimed that such controversial policies must be reconsidered.Concerning the state-authored history textbooks, the Prime Minister's Office said the government will make a final decision by the end of this year. The policy to adopt a single textbook for local students also has been criticized, with some claiming it is intended to glorify the dictatorship of Park's father, who ruled the country for 18 years after seizing power in a military coup in 1961.Pundits said such a stance will escalate the tension between the opposition bloc and Hwang. The opposition parties have been claiming that Hwang should refrain from exercising his power actively, adding he is also an accomplice to Park's alleged corruption.","impeached president park geun ,acting president acting president ,promoted by impeached president ,by impeached president park ,president park geun hye","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.4685123   0.59647357

Choi's key acquaintances, as well as other presidential staff members and business tycoons, have been summoned by the National Assembly for questioning.On Thursday, 18 figures are expected to be summoned, including Woo, who is charged with delinquency of duties for remaining silent while being aware of Choi's interference in state affairs.Choi was also summoned by the parliament, but her attendance remains uncertain. The confidante has been refusing to attend, citing her fragile health. Choi has been in custody since last month.Amid the rising criticism over the investigation on the influence-peddling scandal that has failed to secure testimonies from Choi, the parliamentary committee earlier said it would seek to hold a separate session at her cell, tentatively on Friday. The committee will also seek to hold an on-site visit to the presidential office this week, which ended in vain last week as Cheong Wa Dae refused to accept the investigation, citing security issues.","thursday questioning of president ,sunday former presidential secretary ,said sunday former presidential ,sunday former presidential ,corruption scandal slated for","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Woo Byung - woo']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.73412669  0.32514745

The prime minister is “acting like” an elected leader, when he should remain a “manager” of state affairs, they said, adding they may “reconsider” replacing him.The recent trigger was Hwang’s declining of the three opposition parties’ offer of four-way talks and counterproposal to meet each party separately.“While the National Assembly is exploring various solutions on concerns of a vacuum,  pretends to be the president as if he had been waiting for the passage of the impeachment motion ,” main opposition Democratic Party of Korea chair Rep. Choo Mi-ae said at a meeting with senior party members. “The acting system under Hwang is no more or less than a short-term, transitional management leadership. With the motion’s approval, the prime minister was effectively discredited together with the president.” Minor opposition People’s Party Floor Leader Rep. Park Jie-won also stepped up criticism over news reports Hwang sought to intervene in a probe into the 2014 ferry sinking, then as the justice minister. The party’s interim leader Rep. Kim Dong-cheol also expressed “deep regret” after Hwang was found to have demanded presidential protocol during his visit to National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun on Thursday. “The acting president is supposed to manage the crisis and clean up the deep-rooted evils within the Park Geun-hye administration,” Park Jie-won said during a party meeting. “People are very worried about his recent inappropriate acts.” The opposition’s onslaught came amid a series of controversial moves from the premier. Despite persistent calls for the ouster of Hwang, opposition parties have decided to wait and watch Hwang’s behavior, attempting to minimize confusion and prevent a vacuum in state management after Park’s duties were suspended.Yet Hwang, who pledged to boost interactions within political circles and uphold the people’s wishes upon taking over the top job, is seen following in the footsteps of the disgraced president. While arranging a meeting with conservative elder politicians, he unilaterally instructed Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho to remain in charge, despite the ongoing debate over the legitimacy of his position. “I clearly warn that if the acting president continues spending his energy on media manipulation and dividing the opposition, we three parties, together with the people, will move to replace him,” Rep. Sim Sang-jeung, chair of the minor opposition Justice Party, said at a news conference, urging Hwang to stop “having fun with playing the presidential role” and focus on crafting measures to shore up people’s livelihoods.

Lee Jung-hyun, a prominent loyalist of President Park Geun-hye, resigned Friday, leaving a newly elected floor leader with the task of navigating the embattled party through escalating factional strife following the impeachment of Park. Earlier in the day, Rep. Chug Woo-taik, a fourth-term lawmaker supported by the pro-Park faction, was elected as Saenuri’s new whip. Chung beat his contender Rep. Na Kyung-won, who represents Park dissenters, by 62 to 55 votes.“We should never put new wine into an old bottle,” said Lee during a press conference at the National Assembly. “Now that we have elected a new floor leader, we decided to transform ourselves into the group that the people want.” Saenuri leaders Reps. Lee Jung-hyun  and Chung Jin-suk watch the ballot count for the party's floor leadership vote on Friday. Both offered to step down, after Rep. Chung Woo-taik was elected floor leader. YonhapScheduled to leave his post Thursday, Lee moved up his departure after the election result was announced. Chung will steer the party as an interim leader until the party elects new leadership next January. Besides Lee, other key Park loyalists also left their leadership positions. Among them were Reps. Cho Won-Jin and Lee Jang-woo, outspoken Park loyalists who sit in the party’s decision-making Supreme Council.In an acceptance speech, the new floor leader called for “unity” among the party members, who have endured escalating infighting between the Park loyalists and their dissenters over control of the conservative party.“ reminds me of a famous quote, ‘United we live, divided we die,’” Chung told the lawmakers. “If we stay together, the people will support us. Then we can achieve the goal of winning the next presidential election.”But the 63-year-old politician’s passionate plea did not help to ease the animosity among non-Park lawmakers and prevent their defection from the party. Some leading figures of the non-Park group, such as former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, hinted that they would leave and form a new party. “It didn’t bother me, I actually feel relieved,” said Kim, when asked by the reporters about how he felt about the election result and whether he would quit the party. Kim said that he voted for lawmaker Na and that the gap was larger than he expected. While describing the election result as a “disappointment,” Rep. Yoo Seong-min, a former floor leader and one of Kim’s key allies, refused to say whether he would leave the party, only saying that he would “give much more thought” to the move. Since the influence-peddling scandal tied to the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil rocked the nation last month, those from Saenuri’s rival faction have been blaming one another for worsening their biggest-ever political crisis. The animosity reached its peak when dozens of non-Park lawmakers joined the opposition parties in impeaching the president last week. Up to 62 dissenting members were said to approve the motion in a secret ballot. Meanwhile, opposition parties pledged to halt legislative discussion with the Saenuri leadership for the time being, denouncing the Saenuri for choosing a Park loyalist as a floor leader despite the public anger against Park and her supporters. By Yeo Jun-suk","hye resigned friday leaving ,pro park leaders resign ,friday leaving newly elected ,geun hye resigned friday ,resigned friday leaving newly","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Chug Woo', 'Saenuri', 'Chung']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36329776  0.46807185

The resolution listed 13 charges -- five constitutional violations and eight legal offenses -- but the lawyers claim that these all lack legal grounds.  Lee Joong-hwan , legal representative for President Park Geun-hye, visits the Constitutional Court on Friday to submit Park's written rebuttal to the impeachment resolution. Yonhap“We will argue for both facts and legal responsibilities,” Lee said, alluding that Park will consent to none of the suggested allegations.“As for the Sewol ferry tragedy, the president does not hold direct liability over the accident and thus may not be seen as having violated the people‘s  right to life.”Park will not show up in court throughout the upcoming monthslong court proceedings, according to the lawyer.The Constitutional Court had demanded on Dec. 9 that the president submit an initial written answer by Friday.As Cheong Wa Dae kept silent up to the deadline, speculations had mounted that the embattled president would delay the submission so as to set back the court’s impeachment decision process in the hopes that negative public sentiment would rebound.But facing ongoing rallies asking for Park’s immediate ouster, the Blue House has decided to face the trial head-on.Park, whose presidential authority is temporarily suspended, is to be deprived of power once and for all, if the court upholds the legislature’s impeachment decision. If this happens, a sooner-than-expected presidential election should be held within 60 days of the court’s decision.Throughout the scandal that her confidante Choi Soon-sil meddled in a number of key state affairs, Park has repeatedly denied her involvement.“Not for a single moment have I pursued my personal interests,” Park said in her third and final address to the nation delivered on Nov. 29.“I have carried forward these state projects  for I believed them to be public business for the nation.”She also denied exerting political pressure on conglomerates to fund the two organizations which were operated under Choi’s influence, the Mir Foundation and the K-Sports Foundation.While the Constitutional Court gears up for its watershed judgment, the independent counsel team also accelerated its preparatory steps for a probe, seeking to raid the presidential office for evidence.“Several warrants have been issued for the search  but their execution has been thwarted,” said the team’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul.“We are currently reviewing related laws to see if we may .”The special probe led by independent counsel Park Young-soo will be activated for 70 days from its official launch slated for next week, and may be extended by another month.Lee also said that the team is discussing with the prosecution on whether to accept the court’s earlier request to submit investigation materials.Though the special probe and the court’s judgment are to proceed on separate tracks, the Constitutional Court may request necessary materials from the probe team or any other government bodies, as long as they do not involve cases currently under investigation.As the special probe is still in its preparatory stage, the court’s request is legitimate, though not binding.By Bae Hyun-jung","park rebuts all impeachment ,friday refuted the impeachment ,impeachment charges president park ,all impeachment charges president ,rebuts all impeachment charges","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Joong - hwan', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park ’s']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25351351  0.4052996

Choi said in the phone call with an acquaintance unveiled by Rep. Park Young-sun of the opposition Democratic Party.The acquaintance replied that despite the efforts to stop him, Jeong was stubborn. The recording also showed that Choi sought to pressure SK Group to testify that it has not received requests from her.On Wednesday, the lawmaker also revealed a voice recording which indicated that Choi sought to have Ko Young-tae, her close associate who worked at a company she owned, deliver false testimony at parliament. During the parliamentary hearing, Cho Han-gyu, former president of the local daily Segye Ilbo, raised the allegations that the Park administration carried out illegal surveillance of senior judicial officials, including Supreme Court chief justice Yang Seung-tae.In 2014, the newspaper first reported on the allegations of the president's once-powerful former aide Chung Yun-hoi meddling in state affairs based on a set of presidential documents it had secured during its news coverage. Cho cited some of the unreported documents to back his claim about the illicit surveillance.Cho alleged that the incumbent government spied on Yang's day-to-day activities, including his mountain climbing. He also said Choi Sung-joon, currently the head of the Korea Communications Commission, was put under scrutiny in 2014 when he was serving as the chief judge of a provincial district court.Cho called the illicit monitoring of civilians an illegitimate act that ""trampled on"" the constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers among the government, legislature and judiciary.Following the revelations, the Supreme Court voiced displeasure, saying if the allegations prove true, the illegal surveillance runs counter to the constitutional principle of judicial independence.""We cannot help but call it truly anti-constitutional,"" the Supreme Court said in a statement.The Democratic Party also claimed the action violated the Constitution, and that it is another reason the president should be removed from office.""Park turned the government back into the military dictatorship of 1970s,"" the main opposition party said.Other opposition parties echoed the view, adding the action clearly violated the democratic division of legal, administrative and judicial powers.The splinter People's Party said the alleged surveillance on judicial officials can be considered the revival of the draconian Yushin Constitution introduced by her father Park Chung-hee in 1972.The former Segye Ilbo chief also commented on the rumors that a deputy prime ministerial official was involved in a bribery case. He said that the official, who is still serving in the current government, was related to the allegations that Chung, Park's former aide, had received kickbacks for helping some clinch high-level government posts. Lawmakers also grilled former Ewha Womans University President Choi Kyung-hee over allegations that the university admitted and gave academic favors to Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra. The former president said the university's investigation showed no lawbreaking activities related to the admission of Choi's daughter. She admitted meeting Choi in 2015, after her admission.An admission official from the university said he never received orders to accept Chung Yoo-ra. Concerning whether the university meddled with her grades, another official said issuing grades is the right of professors.Meanwhile, Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the Democratic Party said in a statement the country's largest business group, Samsung, originally planned to give some 20 billion won to Chung under the name of a consulting arrangement.In the copy of the contract between Samsung and a German company owned by Choi and her daughter signed in August 2015, the group's tech arm agreed to support horse riders through the company until 2018.Samsung originally said it would support six athletes under the contract, but Chung was the only one who actually benefited from it.Among the 30 summoned by the parliamentary committee, Choi's ex-husband, among others, refused to attend. The summons on Chung failed to be delivered as his whereabouts remain unknown, sources said.Former presidential official Kim Han-soo, who is suspected to have provided a tablet PC to Choi, also did not attend the questioning. The scandal surfaced after a local broadcaster disclosed the files on the tablet PC presumed to be used by Choi, which held files containing presidential addresses. Choi neither holds an administrative position nor is privy to such classified documents as a civilian.The parliament issued orders of accompaniment for 11 witnesses.The order is issued to forcefully make a suspect or witness appear at a hearing when he or she refuses to attend without a justifiable reason.","corruption hearing new allegations ,parliamentary hearing on thursday ,bribery involving deputy premier ,from corruption hearing new ,corruption hearing new","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ...  0.04798928 -0.10045938

Cho Han-gyu, a former publisher of local daily Segye Ilbo, claimed to have documents that reveal the presidential office spied on senior members of the judiciary branch, including the Supreme Court’s Chief Justice Yang Sung-tae.“It is a grave violation of our Constitution and the democratic principle of separation of powers,” said Cho.“ was not about finding out significant wrongdoings. Everyday life was surveilled and reported to the presidential office.” The two-page document, whose copied version was only submitted to the lawmakers, contained information about how Yang had reacted to a report about him hiking with his colleagues during working hours. Rep. Park Bum-kye of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said that the document was created by the National Intelligence Agency, the top spy agency which had been accused of surveilling civilians during the previous conservative Lee Myung-bak government. Cho was among the witnesses who testified about the allegations surrounding Jeong Yoon-hoe, the ex-husband of Choi. Cho’s newspaper was the first to expose that President Park had secret advisors -- Jeong and Choi -- who wielded undue influence over the president.He also revealed that Jeong took 700 million won  in return for giving a government post to an individual, who held a position amounting to vice prime minister when Jeong worked for President Park. Cho said the individual still works for the government, but refused to reveal the identity. Before the report in late October that Choi was found to have manipulated government affairs, Jeong was considered to be Park’s most close confidant. Chung had served as a parliamentary aide to Park when she was a lawmaker in 2002. When asked by the lawmakers whether Choi became closer to the president after her divorce with Jeong, Cho replied, “Yes.” The publisher also claimed that Cheong Wa Dae arranged the divorce between Jeong and Choi in 2014. But his series of revelations was overshadowed by the absence of Chung and other key witnesses connected to the scandal. Among them was Park Gwan-chun, a police superintendent who worked at Cheong Wa De and who famously said, “In terms of the rank of power in the current administration, Choi comes first and Jeong second, followed by the president herself.”The lawmakers also spent their time investigating the allegations that Ewha Womans University offered preferential treatment to Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi. Chung has been accused of receiving special favors in the admission process and her academic records at the nation’s longest-running women’s university.But the university’s President Choi Kyung-hee denied any wrongdoing. “We have underwent thorough investigation by the Education Ministry, but found out that we have never offered special favors to her,” Choi Kyung-hee told the lawmakers. The controversy over Chung’s illicit admission to the school has prompted mounting calls for Choi Kyung-hee’s resignation. The students denounced the president for giving good grades to Jeong despite her long absences from the school and submissions of assignments past deadlines.By Yeo Jun-suk","ceo testifies government spied ,the scandal surrounding president ,newspaper ceo testifies government ,the presidential office spied ,scandal surrounding president","['Park Geun', 'Cho Han - gyu', 'Segye Ilbo']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.67452127  0.46447238

Park’s former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon is reported to be among those barred.Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson of the team led by independent counsel Park Young-soo, confirmed that “several people whose presence are needed for the investigation” of the Choi Soon-sil scandal have been banned from leaving the country. The official declined to give names, but multiple local media reported that Kim, the president’s former right-hand man, and Kim Young-jae and Kim Sang-man, doctors who admitted to have treated the president. The independent counsel has yet to officially kick off an investigation. The counsel is currently preparing for it, studying the charges laid against the president, her longtime friend Choi and their associates by the two-month investigation by the prosecution. The accused are suspected of coercing local conglomerates to raise money for the nonprofit Mir and K-Sports foundations and embezzling the funds, pressuring local companies and government officials to grant favors for those in their inner circles.Kim Ki-choon, considered to have been one of Park’s most trusted aides, is suspected of knowingly condoning or possibly protecting Choi’s wrongdoings. Kim had claimed to have not been in acquaintance with Choi, but later admitted to knowing who she was.Kim and Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, are being investigated for possibly abusing authority to look after Choi and her associates, including her daughter Chung Yoo-ra. Prosecutors have already barred Woo from leaving the country. Woo made headlines recently after refusing to attend a parliamentary hearing on the scandal and going off the grid. He agreed to attend next week’s hearing.Kim Young-jae is suspected of using his relationship with Choi to receive benefits from the government, although he claimed that Choi was just a regular patient at his hospital. He also claimed that neither he nor his wife has acquainted with former presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong, believed to be one of three key aides who had control over access to the president.But it was revealed Thursday that the prosecution has multiple recordings of phone conversation between Jeong and Kim’s wife. Park Young-soo’s team also reportedly barred officials from the companies who raised money for the two nonprofit foundations. The independent counsel is expected to investigate allegations that the money for the two foundations -- along with other donations related to Choi family -- are essentially bribes that can be linked all the way to the president herself.Park is currently subject to an impeachment trial of the Constitutional Court, and observers believe that confirming bribery charges against her can be a nail in the coffin for the embattled president. During the impeachment trial of former President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004, the court mentioned bribery and embezzlement of public funds as acts that can validate a president’s impeachment.In a bid to ensure thorough investigation on the president, Spokesman Lee said that even Cheong Wa Dae could be raided. “We are planning to take any measures necessary for the investigation...

He is suspected of overlooking, or even protecting, Choi as she meddled in state affairs without holding an official government post. Choi was arrested and indicted last month.  The independent counsel team, while preparing to officially launch its investigation, also put travel bans on other key figures involved in the scandal, including doctors who are suspected of giving treatments to President Park without leaving official records. The spokesperson of the investigation team Lee Kyu-chul confirmed that they have barred a number of people from leaving the country. Lee, however, declined to comment on who they were or how many have been put under the restriction. Independent counsel Park Young-soo is accelerating the preparation for the investigation, which will last for 70 days after the official launch. He has an additional 20 days for preparation and the probe can be extended for another month.Park is awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment, which was passed by parliament last Friday over suspicions she let her friend Choi influence state affairs and amass profits using her ties to the president. ""We cannot interrogate the president two or three times,"" the independent counsel told reporters during a lunch meeting. ""It would be best for it to be done all at once or twice at the most.""""We need to be fully prepared ,"" he added. ""There could be security problems if we call her in here  and we need to treat the president with due respect.""

In the third parliamentary inquiry session on a scandal that led to Park‘s impeachment last week, the bipartisan panel of parliamentarians grilled former chief of the Presidential National Security Office, Kim Jang-soo, repeatedly about how he reported to Park about the situation and whether the president was briefed in real time.“I had my aide send the report to the presidential office and Park’s residence. I didn’t check where she was,” said Kim, acknowledging he was unware of the president’s location on April 16, 2014, when the ferry sank with over 300 believed to be trapped inside. Kim said his aide told him the president “appeared to be not at her office.” Cheong Wa Dae later said the president was at her private residence all day long and attended to her duties as usual. Kim Young-jae , who heeds a hospital frequently visted by President Park Geun-hye's confidante Choi Soon-sil, and a group of presidential aides take an oath during a parliamentary hearing in Seoul, Wednesday. Kim was one of the 16 witnesses in attendance during the inquiry into the influence-peddling scandal involving the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil. An additional three presidential aides were summoned, but did not appear. On the day of the Sewol ferry tragedy, the president was first told about the sinking at 10 a.m. and showed up at the government’s rescue headquarters about seven hours later. While many question what Park was up to during the seven hours, suspecting a possible neglect of duty, Cheong Wa Dae has repeatedly insisted that the president was briefed about the situation via phone and documents. It said the president was at her private residence all day, except for the trip to the rescue center. Given there was no face-to-face briefing during the seven hours, rumors still abound over what she really was doing. Some suggested that she may have undergone cosmetic or medical surgery.The only confirmed detail was that Park spent time having her hair done by a professional after she instructed at 3 p.m. for her staff to arrange her visit to the rescue center. How much time she spent having her hair done is another topic of controversy, with Cheong Wa Dae insisting that it took 20 minutes while media outlet have suggested that it took more than 90 minutes. “Even if we believed that Park spent only 20 minutes on her hair as Cheong Wa Dae suggested, she should have been at the rescue headquarter by 4 p.m.,” said Rep. Ha Tae-kyun of the president’s governing Saenuri Party, criticizing Park for wasting time crucial to following up on the rescue mission. When the president appeared at the rescue center at 5:15 p.m., Park displayed her lack of awareness about the dire situation, asking the staff, “Why is it hard to find those students? I heard they all had life vests on,” when the ship was almost under water. “I don’t want to imagine that the president arrived at the rescue center  because she had to fix her hair,” said Kim, responding to a question from lawmaker Ha. “Actually, I don’t want to think that way and I have never thought about it.” When asked by the lawmakers why he had not tried to have face-to-face meetings with the president during the seven hours, Kim said that he had to keep his position in a situation room to monitor the developments.“Thing were so chaotic and complicated. I had to stay at the situation room. It was not a situation where the president could come to the room,” Kim said. Lawmakers also spent time investigating the allegation the president received medical treatment from civilian doctors known to have regularly treated Choi, a civilian who had neither an official tittle nor security clearance. Kim Sang-man and Kim Young-jae, doctors who have run their own clinics but have no access to the presidential office like Choi, admitted that they have offered the president medical treatment on several occasions since Park became president in 2012. But the doctors denied that they did treated Park on the day when the ferry Sewol sank. “I have never entered Cheong Wa Dae on April 16, 2014. I was at my hospital that day to treat my patients. I can offer records to prove it,” said Dr. Kim Sang-man, who worked at Chaum Clinic where Choi was a regular customer.Kim is suspected of prescribing vitamin shots to Park under Choi’s name. Kim admitted he treated the president on 12 occasions at Chaum Clinic or at the presidential office. Kim even tested Park’s blood under Choi’s name at his clinic without the knowledge of the official presidential medical staff.Plastic Surgeon Kim Joung-jae, who has been rumored to use propofol for surgery on Park, also said that he never treated Park during the day of the ferry sinking, adding that he was playing golf after performing surgery on his mother-in-law. They were appointed as “advisory doctors” for Park without the approval of the official presidential doctors, which violates established practice. Kim Sang-man admitted that he had one-on-one treatment sessions with the president before Seo Chang-suk, the former presidential doctor, took office in September 2014Cheong Wa Dae’s Medical Director Kim Won-ho, who oversaw health issues relating to Park and presidential officials, told the lawmakers that even though “it was not desirable” for the president to be treated by outside doctors, the president “can choose” how she wants herself to be treated.By Yeo Jun-suk","president missing hours lawmakers ,park impeachment last week ,on wednesday scrutinized president ,wednesday scrutinized president park ,disaster questioning presidential aides",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5335716   0.5419606

The KEF issued fabricated documents to excuse her from missing classes and possibly helped her gain selection as a national athlete, according to the result of the 15-day joint inspection by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korean Olympic Committee. Earlier this month, Chung had her high school graduation and admission to Ewha Womans University canceled over revelations she received special favors in attendance and academic records due to her mother’s peddling of influence.The KEF has been suspected of giving special treatment to Chung in selection for the national dressage team in the 2014 Asian Games and of planning to help her compete in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Chung Yoo-ra According to the findings, the KEF pushed for a road map to get Chung sponsorship worth 50 billion won  from Samsung Group without reviewing the plan’s effectiveness or seeking a consent from the board of directors. The names of the judges who select dressage players for the national team for the 2014 competition were also leaked to officials at the KEF. The judges’ identities are supposed to be withheld to ensure the fairness of the selection process. In breach of its manual, the KEF’s reports on Chung’s training as to where she was trained and who was in charge training her had false and insufficient information, according to the audit result. The equestrian agency also issued fabricated documents enabling her to be absent from classes with the excuse she was engaged in training or competition. According to the Education Ministry, Chung was absent from Chungdam High School for 141 days of her senior year upon the documents and was still able to graduate. Of the 141 days she was absent, for 105 of them she attended neither training nor competition.  The Culture Ministry plans to submit the audit results to an independent counsel investigating the case. It also plans to ask the Korean Olympic Committee to punish Chung. It said it will take disciplinary actions against the KEF officials involved in the irregularities. Meanwhile, Rep. An Min-suk of the Democratic Party of Korea said Wednesday in a media interview that he had found Chung’s residence in Germany during a recent trip to the country. Chung, 19, is thought to be staying in Germany, but her exact whereabouts have remained unknown. An slammed the prosecution for its lack of efforts to locate Chung, who he called a core of the influence-peddling scandal. He also raised allegations that Choi family is suspected of being involved in money-laundering through their paper companies in Germany. Chung earlier said through her lawyer Lee Kyung-jae, who also represents her mother Choi Soon-sil, that she would return to the country when the prosecution summons her for questioning. She, however, has refused to attend the ongoing parliamentary inquiry into the scandal. Chung’s mother Choi, who holds no government post, is accused of meddling in state affairs, coercing donations from conglomerates and peddling influence in the education and sports sectors to get her daughter special treatment through her ties to President Park.

Rumors have spread that Park received medical treatment, as well as hair services, during the critical hours. Witnesses of the third parliament hearing Park was impeached last week by the National Assembly. Her failure to fulfill her constitutional duty as president to protect the lives of the people was cited as a major reason for the impeachment.The witnesses present at the latest hearing session included Kim Young-jae and Cha Kwang-yul, who head hospitals regularly visited by Park's friend Choi Soon-sil, a key suspect in the scandal, and a nurse officer with the Presidential Security Service.Three key figures, including nurse officer Cho Yeo-ok, however, did not show up, citing personal reasons. Cho, who currently resides in the United States, is likely to appear at the National Assembly next week, the defense ministry said. The parliament issued orders of accompaniment for the remaining two witnesses, both presidential officials. The order is issued to forcefully make a suspect or witness appear at a hearing when he or she refuses to attend without a justifiable reason. The committee also said it will conduct an on-site investigation into the presidential security office on Friday.The presidential office, however, rejected the plan, citing concerns about the possible leak of confidential information.During the two previous sessions last week, the parliament committee questioned business tycoons and Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil's key acquaintances.","corruption scandal involving president ,ferry disaster on april ,ferry disaster south korea ,hours of ferry disaster ,scandal involving president park","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.04648448  0.1012542

But Jin Kyung-joon was acquitted of a separate charge of taking bribes from the founder of the country's leading online game developer Nexon Co. Jin was indicted on charges of receiving some 950 million won  worth of kickbacks from Kim Jung-ju, currently chairman of Nexon's holding firm NXC Corp., from 2005 to 2014.  Kim Jung-ju, the founder Nexon Co. and chairman of its holding firm NXC Corp., enters the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul on Dec. 13. The Seoul Central District Court found both not guilty, saying there is not enough evidence to prove Jin peddled influence for Kim or gave him other favors in exchange for the money.Still, the 49-year-old former prosecutor was convicted of receiving bribes from Suh Yong-won, the chief of Hanjin Transportation Co. Suh was also sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for two years, for making contracts with the company of Jin's brother-in-law in return for favors from Jin, while serving as the vice president of Korean Air Lines Co., South Korea's largest carrier.The corruption case involving Jin came to light early this year as the then superintendent-level prosecutor reported a whopping increase in his personal wealth in 2015. All ranking government officials and lawmakers here are required to disclose changes in their personal wealth annually.Prosecutors suspect that Kim gave 425 million won of Nexon's assets to Jin in 2005 for him to buy 10,000 shares of the company, which ultimately helped the senior prosecutor amass some billions of won in profit through stock transactions by 2015. He later gave another 425 million won to Jin so that he could pay back the money borrowed from the company originally, according to prosecutors.Jin was arrested in July, becoming the first incumbent prosecutor of his level, equivalent to that of vice minister, to be detained on criminal charges. He was dismissed in August.The prosecution said it will review the ruling and appeal to a higher court. Kim declined to comment on the issue, leaving the courthouse.","tuesday for offering illegal ,four years in prison ,years in prison tuesday ,sentenced former senior prosecutor ,gets years for corruption","['south korean', 'Jin Kyung - joon', 'Nexon Co.', 'Jin']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22719817  0.2072805

But he will soon face a slew of thorny issues that will test his leadership while the Constitutional Court reviews whether to endorse Park's impeachment to formally end her rule.Here is a look at several major issues that lie ahead for Hwang:NORTH KOREAHwang's first move as interim leader was to tell his defense minister to bolster readiness for any possible provocation by North Korea. North Korea hasn't made international headlines since its fifth and biggest-ever nuclear test in September. That could be in line with its nuclear development timetable, but given that Park and North Korea had terrible relations, the North might want to avoid doing anything that could unite conservatives in South Korea behind her.In a sign of the ongoing tensions, North Korea's state media on Sunday released photos of its smiling leader, Kim Jong Un, watching a practice attack on a replica of Park's presidential Blue House. A team of commandoes parachuted, shot at the Blue House model with rifles, leaving it engulfed in flames and black smoke. There are also worries about possible actions by North Korea in response to being slapped with tougher U.N. sanctions this month and in what some analysts think is its desire to test the incoming U.S. government of President-elect Donald Trump.HISTORY TEXTBOOKSIt's probably the first major, hot-button issue that Hwang will face. Park's government had been pushing to require schools to use state-authored history textbooks starting next year, saying current textbooks published by private companies are too left-leaning and sympathize with North Korea. But in the wake of the massive anti-government protests touched off by a political scandal involving Park's longtime confidante, the government took a step back, saying it wants to hear various opinions by Dec. 23 before making a final decision.The liberal opposition is pressuring the government to scrap the textbook plan, calling it a move to beautify past authoritarian leaders, including Park's late father, Park Chung-hee. The elder Park is a deeply divisive figure, with critics calling him a horrible human rights abuser who imprisoned and tortured dissidents, while supporters call him a national hero who guided the country out of poverty.Hwang, a former justice minister, is a strong supporter of state-authored textbooks. But South Korean media say it could be difficult for him to stand up to opposition parties that have gained a greater say over state affairs after impeaching Park.JAPAN DEALS The opposition also wants to scrap two key agreements Park signed with Japan, calling them diplomatic fiascoes.  One settled a decades-long impasse over Korean women forced to be sex slaves in Japanese military-run brothels during World War II, with an apology from Japan's prime minister and a pledge of more than $8 million in compensation. The other is about sharing military intelligence with Japan to better cope with North Korea.The 2015 sex slave deal triggered criticism in South Korea because it was announced without getting approval from victims. The intelligence-sharing pact went into effect last month, and liberal critics accuse the Park government of trying to use the agreement to divert attention from the political scandal.Efforts to boost ties with Japan often trigger a fierce public backlash in South Korea, where many people still harbor strong resentment of Tokyo's brutal colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 and 1945. Spiking such international deals will not be easy, especially after the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan described the sex slave deal as ``irreversible.''OTHER PROBLEMSHwang's government will also have to engage with the Trump presidential transition, work to prevent the political turmoil from taking a toll on the country's economy and deal with an opposition hoping to use the current situation as a chance to push for diverse social reforms. The planned deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system, which drew strong condemnation from China, is also a Park legacy that critics want to review.","ceremonial job until president ,south korean prime minister ,hye impeachment last week ,cabinet members on monday ,korean prime minister","['south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'Japan', 'Hwang', 'the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Cabinet']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5431872   0.31544539

On Friday, the parliament voted to impeach her, and the Constitutional Court has begun deliberations on whether to endorse the motion.In the explanatory material, Park reportedly asked the party to defer a decision on her punishment while an independent counsel investigates the case and the Constitutional Court conducts its review, which can last up to 180 days.The committee members, however, agreed that the judicial proceedings have no bearing on their decision, Lee said. The committee plans to meet again on Dec. 20 to decide on the scope of punishment.Saenuri can expel Park or recommend that she leave the party.Park will automatically be expelled if she does not leave the party within 10 days after receiving a recommendation.","park over corruption scandal ,hye over corruption scandal ,punish park over corruption ,it will punish president ,over corruption scandal south","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.31490561  0.57703584

Inste...","Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn launched a new ministerial consultative body Monday, setting security, the economy, people’s livelihood and public safety as top items on his agenda for stable state management. After initially emphasizing security, the prime minister appears to be turning to domestic tasks in the face of ever-growing signs of economic trouble and an outbreak of avian influenza across the nation. Instead of taking over regular meetings of top presidential secretaries and the Cabinet in place of President Park Geun-hye, Hwang opted to create a semiweekly separate session with similar functions. It was built on a conference with deputy ministers he had been chairing since the Choi Soon-sil scandal broke out in late October, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Hwang Ko-ahn, the prime minister and acting president, presides over a pangovernmental meeting on the bird flu outbreak at the governmental complex in Seoul on Monday.“The new initiative is envisioned to be the control tower for state affairs, spearheading timely discussions and responses over pressing tasks in the four designated areas and pursuing stable administrative management under the acting president,” the office said in a statement. In the introductory edition, the participants agreed to improve measures to support the underprivileged ahead of winter -- in particular poor children and some 220,000 senior citizens living alone. In an apparent bid to curb confusion over economic leadership, Hwang instructed incumbent Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho to remain in charge of overall economic policy, while Yim Jong-yong, chairman of the Financial Services Commission who had been nominated by Park to succeed Yoo, should focus on monitoring market trends. Amid soaring criticism over the government’s failure to contain the AI epidemic earlier, the acting president also held a separate ministerial session to assess the damage so far and examine further preventive steps.As of midnight Monday, nearly 8.9 million poultry had been slaughtered nationwide within less than a month, with another 1.5 million scheduled to be killed, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. This marks the largest-ever loss relative to the given time frame.  The ministry issued a 48-hour “standstill” emergency ban on all movement to and from poultry farms, starting midnight Tuesday. Hwang also called for preventive vaccinations and speedy supplies in all AI-related areas including habitats for migratory birds and hunting grounds across the country, while setting up an expanded team in charge of the issues. Though the opposition camp has decided to accept the Hwang leadership for now, skepticism persists over the legitimacy of his rule, however temporary it may be. The unpopular acting president is blamed for having failed to ward off -- or turning a blind eye to -- the scandal since his days as the justice minister. Over the last four years, he has also taken flak for stoking ideological tension and backing controversial programs such as the state-authored history schoolbooks. The textbooks, a prototype of which reignited uproar following its recent introduction, is likely to be the first victim given bitter public sentiment. On Monday, three opposition parties hosted a seminar in cooperation with a coalition of 430 civic groups opposed to the plan, during which participants relayed criticism, pointing out factual errors and what they see as historical distortions in the book.On top of the textbook controversy, Hwang is also in the hot seat as the opposition is seeking to thwart other contentious plans including the stationing of a US missile shield and agreements with Japan on military intelligence sharing and wartime sex slavery. With an extra parliamentary session slated for Thursday to Dec. 31, the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea chair Rep. Choo Mi-ae pledged to look into missile defense and other issues.  The splinter People’s Party also called for action to scrap the textbooks and debate on what to do with other controversial projects among the ruling party, opposition and government. “We should immediately mobilize a three-way consultative body to forsake state-authored schoolbooks, while reaching a collective decision on the next government’s handling of the to-be-deployed MD system and intelligence-sharing accord,” party interim chief Rep. Kim Dong-cheol said at an emergency meeting Monday. To trade views on pending issues and the planned trilateral discussions, Hwang plans to visit the National Assembly on Wednesday and meet with Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, officials said. At his news conference earlier in the day, Chung also expressed his willingness for talks with the acting president “as soon as possible” to foster cooperation between the parliament and government in a way that “lessen the people’s concerns” over the faltering economy and uncertain political situation.

The meeting was attended by eight of the nine judges, including Kang Il-won, who will lead the coming trial as head justice. They discussed the formation of a task force, the hearings schedule and other related issues, the court’s spokesperson said. Park Han-chul , head of the Constitutional Court, arrives at the court in Seoul on Monday, for the first full bench meeting on the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Judge Kim Yi-su was unable to attend the meeting due to an overseas business trip. “The first hearing date has not been fixed yet,” court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon said during a press briefing at the court in Seoul on Monday. “ requires a lot of discussions at the pretrial stage as there are many issues to be addressed.”The justices decided to form a special team of 20 constitutional researchers to review materials and examine records by no later than this week. They also asked Park to submit answers to the court’s questionnaire by Friday for to enable the trial to proceed quickly. “We also requested the Ministry of Justice and the National Assembly to submit a written opinion on the case to help us understand what is at stake, just like we normally do for any other case,” Bae said. Two to three of the justices will be chosen to focus on investigating the evidence. The court will then set dates for hearings, the official explained. Some legal experts raised the possibility that the court could rule before fully deliberating all of the charges brought against the president, if it finds sufficient legal grounds for Park’s removal.  However, the justices decided against the idea, Bae said. “The court will have to review all of the charges listed  to make a ruling.”  The National Assembly, which impeached Park on Friday over a corruption scandal, listed 18 breaches of the Constitution and laws as grounds for her dismissal. The nine-member court has up to 180 days to rule weather the charges warrant Park’s removal from office. Justices are expected to summon Park and question witnesses regarding the case.The president is accused of allowing her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil, and Choi’s associates, to meddle in state affairs and colluding with Choi and others to force private businesses to make sizable donations and give contracts to certain companies. She is also alleged to have leaked confidential information to Choi and neglected her duty to protect the lives of the people when the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, which left over 300 people dead or missing. Park denies all of the charges.In the meantime, National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun expressed hopes Monday that the Constitutional Court will quickly review the impeachment of President Park to help put the country back on track. “We need to stabilize state affairs and the lives of the people. The paralysis of state affairs should not last long,” Chung said, adding he expects the court to come to a wise solution in the near future.Chung also called on lawmakers to lead national efforts to root out corruption and establish a new state system.“The people have been asking for not only the impeachment, but the establishment of a new Republic of Korea,” Chung said.Lawmakers should take the first step for national reform by dropping their privileges, he added.By Kim Da-sol  and news reports","president impeachment south korea ,pretrial process on president ,impeachment trial of president ,on president impeachment south ,process on president impeachment","['South Korea ’s', 'Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kang Il - won']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38464922 -0.08132683

South Korea’s prosecutors Sunday effectively wrapped up their two-month investigation, handing over the baton to the special counsel. They managed to link criminal activities committed by Park’s former aides An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong to her through notes and recorded phone conversations which showed the two were acting under the president’s orders.Park Young-soo, who has been appointed the independent counsel to investigate a political scandal that centers on President Park Geun-hye's close friend Choi Soon-sil, is surrounded by reporters while entering his office in southern Seoul on Dec. 11. An has been indicted along with Park’s longtime friend Choi for pressuring Korean conglomerates to raise funds -- suspected to be bribes for Choi’s inner circles -- for the two nonprofit organizations Mir and K-Sports foundations, and Jeong was accused of leaking government secrets to Choi.While the indictments for An and Choi specified Park as their accomplice, the prosecutors have stopped short of pressing bribery charges against the president. Instead it only accused her as guilty of abuse of authority, coercion and leaking classified documents. Park Young-soo, formerly the chief of Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office, is expected to tackle thorny issues including bribery, allegations surrounding Park’s former Senior Secretary Woo Byung-woo and what the president was doing during the critical hours of the sinking of the ferry Sewol in 2014. Among the charges, bribery is expected to be a game changer in the scandal. The allegations President Park is facing now are only punishable by up to five years in prison, while a sentence for bribery ranges from 10 years to life in prison. “After looking into the cited  allegation, we decided that it needs additional investigation and have forwarded the relevant records and evidence to the Park Young-soo independent counsel team,” said the prosecution. Park Young-soo’s team is reportedly scrutinizing records of donations linked to Choi that were made by the country’s largest companies -- including the biggest benefactor of the Mir and K-Sports foundations, Samsung Group. Samsung is suspected of supporting Choi and her associates in exchange for protecting its business interests, namely the government-run National Pension Service’s backing of a merger between Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries Inc. Lotte Group is also suspected of making a 7 billion won  donation to K-Sports to regain its duty-free shop license. In addition to coercing the corporations into making donations, Choi is also suspected of embezzling the foundations’ funds and interfering in the companies’ operations for personal gains. In addition, Park Young-soo’s team is also expected to grill those who the prosecution failed to put under scrutiny. While the prosecution’s special investigative team managed to pinpoint the incumbent president as a suspect, it came under criticism for what some have accused as a passive attitude toward powerful persons of interest.Despite Woo being a prominent figure in the presidential office and a key figure in the Choi scandal, it was revealed that the team never summoned him for questioning after his status was switched from key witness to a suspect. An official from the prosecution refused to give an explanation for this, saying it was “inappropriate” to comment when an independent counsel is about to commence investigation.Woo is suspected of condoning criminal activities related to Choi. A photo of him sitting comfortably with his arms crossed during an investigation has also fueled the suspicion that the investigators were going easy on the former prosecutor. Kim Ki-chun, the president’s former chief of staff who was among her most trusted, is also expected to be summoned for possible involvement in the Choi scandal.He initially claimed to have not known Choi at all, but he recently admitted that he “cannot say that he does not know Choi” to the parliament after opposition lawmakers showed him a video of Park Geun-hye mentioning Choi’s name several times in Kim’s presence.Park herself is among those who the prosecution failed to interview, as she flip-flopped on her initial pledge to cooperate and repeatedly snubbed its summons.A bribery charge against Park may be a damning case in her impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which will continue from December for up to six months. The 2004 impeachment trial of former President Roh Moo-hyun effectively outlined bribery or embezzlement of public funds by a president as acts that can validate an impeachment. Allegations surrounding her seven-hour disappearance from public eyes during the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking disaster is also to be investigated by the independent counsel. There have been suspicions that Park received cosmetic treatment or got her hair done during the crucial hours of the Sewol tragedy. The Constitutional Court states that the president is obliged to protect the lives and safety of the people during a national crisis.Other suspicions include those surrounding Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra, who was found to have received unlawful favors from Chungdam High School and Ewha Womans University. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education recently nullified her graduation from Chungdam and her admission to Ewha.Chung, a professional dressage rider, is also suspected of receiving favors form a wide-range of government officials in the culture and sports sectors including former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong.By Yoon Min-sik","south korea prosecutors sunday ,corruption scandal involving president ,korea prosecutors sunday effectively ,their two month investigation ,prosecutors sunday effectively wrapped","['Park Young', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Chong', 'Jeong Ho - seong']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.60250866  0.43796417

The nine justices of the Constitutional Court will decide whether to approve or reject the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Pundits seem to agree on one thing at least. The cases of Roh and Park have two significant differences that could lead to a different outcome: public sentiment and charges brought against the president.  Public sentiment When the National Assembly impeached President Roh in 2004, the lawmakers who had pushed for it faced fierce public backlash. Candlelight vigils were held to salvage the embattled liberal leader and denounce “arrogant” lawmakers who had impeached Roh for a “trivial” controversy. The cumulative participation in the pro-Roh rallies was over 1 million. Roh was impeached for remarks he had made at a press conference two months before a parliamentary election: “I expect voters to overwhelmingly support  Uri Party. … If any good deed of mine could help the Uri Party in the  election, I would like to do whatever is within the boundary of law.” He was accused of violating election laws. But this time, it is the public who wants Park’s ouster over the scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil, which broke out in late October and pressured lawmakers to vote for her impeachment Friday, experts said. Over the past seven weeks, a total of nearly 7 million people have taken to the street on Saturdays for candlelight vigils calling for Park’s resignation. “Public sentiment will surely come into play ,” said attorney Cho Dae-hyun, who was one of the nine Constitutional Court justices who tried President Roh.  Professor Kim Seung-dae of the Pusan National University School of Law, who participated in Roh’s impeachment trial as one of the nine justices of the Constitutional Court, said, “The 2004 Roh impeachment case was a political tussle. It wasn’t something that people wanted.” Kim added that the strong public anger toward the head of state would make judges feel less worried if they have to deliver an unfavorable verdict against her. Different charges The parliamentary impeachment motion, which passed the National Assembly in a landslide 234-56 vote Friday, lists 13 breaches of the Constitution and laws as grounds for President Park’s impeachment.   “There was one core issue in the Roh impeachment trial and it was simple -- the election law violations,” said Kim Jong-dae, another former judge who participated in the 2004 trial.  Moreover, Roh had admitted to making the controversial remarks. But in the case of Park, the president firmly denies the eight charges brought against her, which sets the stage for a fierce legal battle.   Park’s attorney Yoo Young-ha said in previous briefings that the president had no part in the corruption scandal involving Choi and others. All the president has done was for the sake of the country and she had no knowledge that Choi pursued private benefits using their decadeslong ties, Yoo claimed. This is why some experts say the trial could drag on past the 63 days it took for Roh’s case, or even the legal limit of 180 days. On Friday, after the parliament passed the impeachment motion against her, Park hired Chae Myung-seong as her legal representative, adding to three other lawyers who will represent her at the Constitutional Court. “The size of Park’s legal representatives for the impeachment trial will be bigger than the one that was formed for the  independent counsel investigation,” an official at Cheong Wa Dae said, hinting that Park may choose not to reveal some of the members of her legal representative team, as she has done so far. Former President Roh formed a large counsel for his impeachment trial. It comprised of 12 lawyers including former Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Moon Jae-in, ex-prosecutors, judges and human rights lawyers.The parliament formed a 60-member “prosecutor” team, headed by Rep. Kim Ki-chun, then chairman of the National Assembly Justice Committee. The two sides held seven rounds of arguments from March 30 to April 30, 2004 which Roh declined to attend despite the court’s request.   On May 15, 63 days after Roh was impeached by the parliament, the court ruled in favor of the president, saying, “ were not serious or grave enough to justify the unseating of the president.”The verdict effectively set a guideline for presidential impeachment in South Korea: the president can be removed only for “grave violations.” According to the court, the gravity of a violation should be determined by “balancing the degree of negative impact or harm to constitutional order caused by the violation of the law and the effects that would be caused by the removal of the respondent from office.”By Kim Da-sol","upcoming trial of president ,will park impeachment trial ,impeachment trial of president ,trial of late president ,park impeachment trial","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10265247  0.26775077

Though some links may seem tenuous, what began as a probe into a crime ring operating an illegal gambling house on the Chinese resort island uncovered corruption and peddling of influence involving baseball players, legal professionals, business tycoons, government officials and, finally, the president’s secret confidante Choi Soon-sil.    The Korea Herald went back to what appears to be the beginning of South Korea’s worst political fiasco in recent years to trace the chain of events that led to Park’s impeachment Friday.  Stage 1. Cosmetics CEO nabbed for illegal gambling It all began with the arrest of a gangster last year.In July 2015, a man belonging to a crime ring called the “Pan-Western Clique” was apprehended. During the probe, it was revealed that he had operated illegal gambling sites in Macau. From his accounting book, prosecutors learned he had some high-profile clients.Among them were Jung Woon-ho, CEO of cosmetics firm Nature Republic, and four popular baseball players from Samsung Lions. Jung was brought to the court on charges of illegal gambling of some 10 billion won  in Macau. He was sentenced to a year in prison. Stage 2. Legal corruption scandal During the appeals process, Jung hired judge-turned-lawyer Choi Yoo-jung. Choi allegedly promised the cosmetics businessman that she would earn him bail and a lenient ruling, using her connections in the judiciary. Jung agreed to pay Choi 5 billion won in attorney fees. But their deal turned sour when the appeals court handed down an eight-month prison term to Jung. Choi filed a complaint against Jung in April this year for assaulting her during an argument over attorney fees. Their quarrel opened the floodgates to revelations of how lawyers who were formerly judges or prosecutors have used their personal ties with former colleagues to defend their clients in return for huge sums of money. Choi revealed a list of eight names in legal circles -- from judges to high-powered lawyers -- whom she said Jung lobbied to get himself a favorable ruling. On the list was Hong Man-pyo, a prosecutor-turned-lawyer, who allegedly received kickbacks from Jung in exchange for peddling influence over the prosecution.That is when the name of Woo Byung-woo, the then-civil affairs secretary for President Park who later turned out to be key figure in what we now know as the Choi Soon-sil scandal, was first brought up with relation to irregularities.   During the trial, it was revealed that Jung had allegedly told his lawyer, “I am not worried about the ruling because Hong told me that he got Woo Byung-woo and a senior prosecutor on our side.” It was only the tip of the iceberg of a wide range of cozy connections circulating business, political and legal circles unveiled in the months to come. Stage 3. Lotte falls deeper in crisisIn an unexpected turn of events, the investigation into cosmetics mogul Jung Woon-ho uncovered another lobbying scandal involving Lotte Group, a large conglomerate running businesses ranging from duty-free shops to a professional baseball team. Media reports alleged that Jung had offered kickbacks worth 1 billion won to Shin Young-ja, daughter of Lotte founder Shin Kyuk-ho, in return for getting his cosmetics brand into Lotte department stores and duty-free shops.This added to an extensive investigation already targeting Lotte and its controlling family over allegations that they created slush funds to siphon off company funds. In the process, the group’s No. 2 man -- Vice Chairman Lee In-won -- committed suicide. Shin Young-ja is being tried on charges of bribery in connection with Jung and embezzlement. Four other members from the Shin family, including group Chairman Shin Dong-bin – are facing charges of embezzlement and tax evasion. Lotte is also one of the local conglomerates found to have contributed billions of won to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, both surreptitiously controlled by President Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Stage 4. Woo Byung-woo Gate Despite suspicions related to the legal corruption scandal, Woo’s name was swept under the rug until local media outlets raised fresh speculations against him. Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, enters the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office for questioning on Nov. 6 On July 18, South Korea’s biggest, right-wing newspaper Chosun Ilbo broke news of a scandal involving local game developer Nexon, a top-ranking prosecutor and Woo.  Jin Kyung-joon, a vice ministerial-level official, was already under arrest at the time on suspicion of receiving kickbacks in the form of cash and unlisted shares from Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju. The newspaper revealed that Nexon, possibly at the request of Jin, had purchased land from Woo’s family, who had trouble selling it, at a price much higher than its market value. The report alleged that Woo, in return, turned a blind eye to the shady connection between Jin and Nexon. Woo was at that time a presidential secretary in charge of inspections of various government agencies, including the prosecution and had overseen the vetting process of Jin for promotion in 2015. The next day, a left-wing daily, the Kyunghyang Shinmun, brought the story back to the cosmetic CEO’s scandal, exposing that Woo had worked with Hong Man-pyo to represent Nature Republic CEO Jung until he was appointed as a presidential aide in 2014. More allegations surfaced against Woo, but the Presidential Office maintained its silence on them, indicating President Park’s unwavering trust in him. Woo was not investigated, either.  Stage 5. Choi Soon-sil Gate    On July 26, local cable channel TV Chosun broke news about the Mir Foundation, alleging it had raised nearly 49 billion won in donations from local conglomerates in just two months through a dubious process. Its investigation led to then-presidential secretary An Chong-bum allegedly forcing large firms to donate money to the nonprofit foundation. He reportedly threated the firms with tougher tax audits.A few days later, the same news outlet reported on the K-Sports Foundation, which raised some 38 billion won in a similar way. It speculated that there may have been a powerful person running these foundations and peddling influence behind the scenes. Choi Soon-sil enters the headquarters of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office for questioning on Dec. 3. As Chosun media group continued to raise allegations against presidential aides, Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party, one of Park’s staunchest loyalists, exposed in August how the media firm’s editorial writer Song Hee-young had received expensive trips and favors from a local company in 2011. The revelation tarnished the paper’s reputation, leading many of the public to question the integrity of its past news reports. While Chosun floundered, left-leaning Hankyoreh newspaper brought the corruption allegations involving presidential aides back to life. That is when the name Choi Soon-sil became connected to the scandal. The daily claimed that Choi, President Park’s longtime friend and daughter of her late mentor Choi Tae-min, was the one behind the Mir and K-Sports foundations.Stage 6. Full-blown Park Geun-hye scandal On Oct. 24, cable TV network JTBC claimed to have found Choi Soon-sil’s tablet computer containing over 200 presidential documents, including scripts of Park’s speeches with apparent signs of editing. Mindful of the explosiveness of the revelation, Park made a rare public address the following day. She apologized and admitted to having sought Choi’s advice on public speeches. Park described Choi as someone who had been by her side at “difficult times.”  Follow-up news reports, however, revealed that Choi’s advice was far-reaching. Choi, a civilian who holds no official government post and has no policy background, is alleged to have used her ties to the president to peddle influence over state affairs, personnel appointments and force donations from local firms for the embattled foundations. Protesters hold a candlelight vigil at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Nov. 26. Stung by an overwhelming outpouring of public anger, state prosecutors expanded its investigation team on the scandal and started to bring in Park’s key aides for questioning. In weeks that followed, many were arrested: Choi Soon-sil, former presidential aides An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, Cha Eun-taek, Choi’s associate accused of exerting massive influence over cultural projects, and former Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong, whom one of Choi’s now-estranged associates described as Choi’s subordinate, like a “personal secretary.” Indicting Choi, An and Jeong on Nov. 20, prosecutors said the president was an accomplice to the three, but couldn’t be prosecuted because, as sitting president, she was exempt from criminal liability. As the scandal unfolded, Park made two more televised apologies, reshuffled personnel in the Cabinet, offered to yield some of her executive powers to the parliament and finally offered to give up her presidency in accordance with a parliament-suggested schedule and legal procedure. But none of the actions was enough to assuage public anger. Her approval rating plummeted to a record low of 4 percent, the lowest ever for a sitting Korean president. On Dec. 3, a record 2.32 million South Koreans took to the streets, pressuring hesitant lawmakers to impeach the scandal-ridden president. Last Friday, Park became the second president of South Korea to be impeached. If the Constitutional Court endorses the decision, she would be the first to be dismissed by the parliament. This, however, may not be the end of the saga. The president denies any wrongdoing, except that she was friends with the wrong person -- Choi Soon-sil. She is determined to fight for her job and name at the Constitutional Court. While an independent counsel continues to investigate the scandal, Choi and other key figures are to stand trial on Dec. 19. Woo Byung-woo, the ex-civil affairs aide to Park believed to have exerted influence over the country’s judicial system, remains unscathed. So does Kim Ki-chun, Park’s longest-serving chief of staff, who on national television last week denied any knowledge of Choi Soon-sil, her now-arrested associates or any irregularities in the highest office.

The prime minister officially took up the nation’s top job after the National Assembly approved a motion to impeach the disgraced president, going on to preside over a meeting of the Cabinet and the National Security Council. Shortly after the bill’s passage, he made phone calls to the defense, foreign and interior ministers.At a news conference, Hwang offered an apology to the people, saying he felt a “deep sense of responsibility” for the crisis as Park’s aide.  Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahnExpressing concerns over political and economic challenges at home and abroad, he pledged to focus on “stable management” of state affairs in an “upright and transparent” manner, in line with public demands. “There are growing concerns state government is losing steam due to the recent crisis,” Hwang said. “In this grave national situation, there must not be any drifting or power vacuum in state affairs for a single moment.”  To Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Hwang stressed the need for the military to be put on alert against a possible accident at home or provocations from North Korea. But the level of the defense readiness condition is to remain unchanged, according to the ministry. “Considering our circumstances to be a period of security vulnerability, North Korea could possibly attempt to aggravate confusion in our society through not only nuclear and missile tests but various small-scale, cyber or other forms of provocations,” Hwang said. In turn, Han relayed the message to all units of the military and convened a video conference with the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force and other major commanders stationed around the country. Speculation has been growing the communist state may stage a major provocation in protest against a latest UN Security Council resolution and unilateral sanctions by Seoul, Washington and Tokyo. The North’s major holidays are also in the offing, such as the Dec. 17 anniversary of the death of longtime strongman Kim Jong-un and the incumbent ruler Kim Jong-un’s birthday on Jan. 8. Wary of concerns over a diplomatic vacuum, Hwang instructed Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se to inform the international community that the situation would not lead to any change in foreign policy or economic relations. He also called for the ministry to keep up close cooperation for a thorough implementation of the sanctions and for all overseas diplomatic missions to make the utmost effort to maintain Korea’s image. Later in the day, Yun and other senior diplomats held a series of meetings later in the day with ambassadors of the US, China, Japan, Russia, the European Union and other key partners to explain about the domestic situation and reaffirm the ties. During a separate call, Hwang urged Interior Minister Hong Yoon-sik to devise “special measures” to forestall any crimes and accidents especially given the ongoing weekly mass demonstrations in downtown Seoul and across the nation. By Shin Hyon-hee","impeach the disgraced president ,vacuum acting president hwang ,north korea provocations after ,acting president hwang ,the disgraced president going","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39966503  0.44213036

Park taking on her first public role in South Korea happened as dramatically and abrupt as ever; with the assassination of her mother Yuk Young-soo, wife of former president Park Chung-hee.The death of Yuk to a bullet meant for her husband and president called for then-22-year-old Park to take on the role as the first lady. It was then when Park developed a close relationship with Choi Tae-min, a cult leader who claimed to be a messenger of her deceased mother. Park Geun-hye is sworn in as the 18th president of South Korea in this Feb. 25, 2013 file photo. After the assassination of her father in 1979, Park Geun-hye left the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae. In years that followed, Park kept Choi close, while running an educational foundation named after Yuk. Her relationship with Choi would become the source of lurid rumors that would haunt her throughout her political career, and her friendship with Choi’s daughter -- Choi Soon-sil -- would later explode in what is believed to be the worst political scandal in the country’s history.‘Queen of elections’ Park Geun-hye accompanies her father, ex-President Park Chung-hee, during an official event in this undated file photo.Since leaving Cheong Wa Dae, Park lived in seclusion for 18 years until she joined the Grand National Party -- the forerunner of the now-ruling Saenuri Party. Park was elected to the parliament on the GNP ticket in 1998. As a politician, she enjoyed solid support from voters nostalgic for her father whose 18-year rule saw the economy making a meteoric rise dubbed “the Miracle on the Han River.” She earned a nickname, “queen of elections,” after 2004 general elections, in which she led the then-crushed GNP into a surprising performance. Elected as the party leader in the month before the election, Park decided to relocate the party’s head office into a makeshift tent in a symbolic move to apologize for an illegal funding scandal it was involved in. The election was widely expected to be a nail in the coffin for the GNP, but when the dust cleared on April 15, 2004, the GNP exceeded expectations by winning 121 of 299 parliament seats -- there are currently 300 seats.In this Nov. 28, 2013 file photo, then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye addresses citizens during her campaign for the 2012 presidential election. Uri Party won the majority for the first time in its history with 152, but it was rather underwhelming as strong public support had it once shooting for 200-plus seats.It was the first in a line of successful election campaigning that later became a core asset to the “queen of elections.” Rise to top office and downfall In August 2012, Park became the presidential candidate for the Saenuri Party. Her presidential campaign was marked by questions about her past -- her relation with the self-proclaimed pastor Choi who by that time had already passed away. Many people also raised questions if a daughter of a dictator can be president of a democratic society. But Park eventually defeated the liberal candidate Moon Jae-in in a close race to become the first female president in Korean history in February 2013. One of the worst incidents during Park’s tenure was the sinking of ferry Sewol in April 16, 2014. The tragedy left 304 dead or missing, and the lackluster rescue effort had ultimately revealed a network of connections between the civic and public sectors. It sparked the administration to launch a pan-government anti-corruption task force headed by the Prime Minister’s Office.Park’s time in office has been marked by a deteriorating relationship with North Korea. Pyongyang’s new leader Kim Jong-un -- who took power after his father’s death in 2011 -- repeatedly snubbed international regulations and conducted more ballistic missile launches than his father did in his 17 year-reign. The administration also indefinitely postponed the transfer of wartime operation control from the US military to Korea, citing stronger military alliance against North Korea.Other notable incidents during her tenure include the disputed decision to disband the far-left Unified Progressive Party in 2014, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015 and the controversial decision to reinstate the state-authored history textbooks in the same year. But the biggest bang came in 2016, when it was revealed that Park’s civilian friend Choi Soon-sil had access to classified documents and is believed to have siphoned public funds via nonprofit foundations. Prosecutors believed that Park conspired with Choi and her former aides, and an independent counsel, Park Young-soo, is expected to investigate whether or not the money raised by local corporations for Choi’s foundations amounted to bribery for Park’s inner circles.The scandal led to Park’s impeachment on Friday. If the Constitutional Court endorses it, she will be the first president of Korea to be removed by the parliament. By Yoon Min-sik","hye the disgraced president ,nation first female president ,country worst political fiasco ,the disgraced president ,assassination of her mother","['Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea', 'Park Chung - hee']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.80781472  0.29258147

During the 70-minute session, most of the lawmakers stayed calm, sitting quietly and reflecting on the gravity of their actions. When the result was announced, there was a shout of surprise and joy from the opposition lawmakers who campaigned for Park’s ouster. But other than that, the floor was quiet until they exited in an orderly manner. Citizens urge lawmakers to vote for an impeachment bill against embattled President Park Geun-hye during rally in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Friday. “Today’s session is not a political battle where one wins and the other loses. It is only a sad history of our Constitution,” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the main opposition Democratic Party’s floor leader, told his fellow lawmaker before they entered the chamber. Back where observers were seated, the mood was quite different. Among ordinary citizens who watched the voting session were a group of those who lost their loved ones when the ferry Sewol sank in 2014. The tragedy left over 300 dead or missing, most of them high school students. The family members and civic groups have blamed President Park for neglecting her duties to rescue them during the nation’s worst maritime tragedy. It was one of the charges that Park would face during her impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court. When the National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun announced the passage of the impeachment bill, most of them rejoiced. Some of them wept, as if they couldn’t believe the result. “It was victory for the country and the people who took to the streets to protest against the president,” Lee Chang-hyeon, one of the bereaved family members, told The Korea Herald.  Before the crucial vote, tension was palpable both inside and outside the National Assembly. With a historic ballot to decide the fate of the Park presidency scheduled for 3 p.m., protestors rallied in front of the main gate of the parliamentary compound. Inside, political parties held a flurry of meetings, reconfirming their commitment to ousting the embattled president or making a last-ditch effort to salvage her administration. “Impeachment is the way to save the country and people’s lives. Citizens, who hold national sovereignty, have already impeached the president ,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Hundreds of citizens gathered in front of the front gate, making impromptu speeches on a makeshift stage and singing Korean folk songs. They also held up yellow flags bearing various messages condemning President Park. Placards read “immediate resignation” and “prompt punishment.” Police said that they dispatched 13,500 officers to the protest scene. Conflict erupted as a farmer drove a tractor to the main road in front of the National Assembly building packed with protestors. As police blocked protestors walking from another part of the area from joining the protestors at the front gate, protestors chanted “guarantee peaceful rallies” and “open the way.”A dozen police buses lined up to block access to the parliamentary compound, a preventive measure in case angry protesters tried to break into the parliamentary buildings.The Assembly had decided to shut down the buildings if the impeachment vote fell through.“It is a bit cold, but I had to come because it is unfair that someone born into a rich and powerful family becomes resident, ruins our country and gets away with her wrongdoings,” said 43-year-old homemaker Ko Yang-hee at the front gate of the National Assembly building.“At least if Park is impeached, that is justice served to some extent. I want my children to grow up in a fair and just society,” she said. On the other side of the National Assembly building’s front gate, Park’s loyal supporters gathered to voice their objections to the impeachment. They also held a rally in front of the Saenuri Party headquarters in the morning. Cheong Wa Dae remained quiet from the morning, with the president and secretariat members opting not to appear in public or make official remarks.Presidential Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok chaired a meeting of senior secretaries in the morning to discuss countermeasures to possible impeachment. “All we can do is keep watching,” said an official, under condition of anonymity. “All senior secretaries have pledged to hold the fort so as to minimize confusion in state affairs.”Meanwhile, Park was said to be in her presidential residence from the morning, staying away from the operational offices and watching the situation in Yeouido via television.The parliamentary plenary session started promptly at 3 p.m. and the vote commenced at 3:25 p.m. To impeach the embattled head of state, at least 200 lawmakers from the 300-member National Assembly needed to support the motion. And the result was a landslide 234-56 victory of the opposition. With that, President Park became the second president in Korea, after President Roh, to face an impeachment trial. If the Constitutional Court endorses the parliamentary sanction, she will become the first to be dismissed by the parliament.

His two confirmation hearings, first in 2013 as a justice minister nominee and then for the premiership two years later, were strewn with allegations of wrongdoing. He was accused of dodging income and gift taxes, real estate speculation and military service evasion, among other allegations, while sparking public furor over his lopsided historical, political and religious views. While in office, the 59-year-old retired public security prosecutor won the trust of the now-disgraced president. But he clashed with opposition lawmakers, experts and other critics on nearly every hot issue, from the spy agency’s meddling in the 2012 presidential election to state-authored history schoolbooks to the dismantling of a far-left political party. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn Against all odds, Hwang on Friday became the fifth acting president in Korean history and the third prime minister to take over the position. Following the vote, opposition parties ratcheted up pressure on Hwang, saying he should also take responsibility for failing to nip the Choi Soon-sil scandal in the bud, despite warning signs that began to emerge since he became justice minister. “The People’s Party has said the prime minister is unfit for the job . So we want him to resign voluntarily,” the party’s interim chief Rep. Kim Dong-cheol told reporters, calling for opposition-wide talks on the fate of Hwang and the deputy prime minister in charge of finance.Main opposition Democratic Party of Korea chair Rep. Choo Mi-ae has also urged Hwang and all other ministers to leave. But after the vote, she apparently shifted to a wait-and-see position, saying the focus should be on “minimizing confusion” for the time being. But Choo raised the need to nominate a new deputy prime minister in charge of finance, saying further reviews are required for Park’s nominee Lim Jong-ryong, currently chairman of the Financial Services Commission. “With the passage of the impeachment motion, the prime minister, who is appointed by the president, as well as the entire Cabinet in effect, obtained a vote of no confidence,” Choo said at a news conference. “I will closely monitor whether the acting leadership will uphold the people’s desire as shown during the candlelight vigils or go against it.” Yet ruling Saenuri Party legislators and others expressed skepticism over another leadership change, citing the difficulties of ousting the president and premier all at once and the ensuing vacuum in state governance it would create. Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk on Friday labeled Choo an “anarchist,” saying her idea would only trigger “national anomie.” The Constitution does not define the specific boundaries of an acting president’s authority, nor do the government’s crisis management manuals carry detailed guidelines for a presidential vacancy. Opposition lawmakers are adamant that the power of Hwang, who is not an elected official, ought to be kept to a minimal level. This means he cannot nominate Cabinet members, Supreme Court and Constitutional Court justices or other core posts, or sign major treaties such as free trade agreements. Two opposition legislators, Reps. Min Byung-doo of the Democratic Party of Korea and Kim Kwan-young of the People’s Party, have been pushing for a bill to enshrine the principles and clarify an acting president’s role. The Prime Minister’s Office, meanwhile, has been preparing for a possible Hwang leadership, exploring what to prioritize among various tasks to minimize a vacuum in state management. Their review was chiefly based on the 2004 case when Goh Kun became acting president after then-President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached, officials said. Following his takeover, Goh was seen as largely maintaining the status quo, refraining from even visiting Cheong Wa Dae or requesting its escort or other administrative support. With Roh’s duties suspended, a public-private personnel recommendation committee within the presidential office steered several vice-ministerial appointments, while scheduled overseas trips and summits were canceled. Some level of confusion appears inescapable, however, given the absence of precedents and the quickly evolving political situation. In the 2004 case, Roh’s duties were restored about two months after the vote, as the Constitutional Court overturned the result. This time, the court’s deliberation may take up to six months, which in turn would prompt Hwang to exercise greater power to facilitate state affairs. With a two-month election campaign taken into account, his term could stretch to eight months in total. In the wake of the impeachment, debate on a constitutional amendment is likely to heat up anew, which has divided not only the Saenuri Party, but even the opposition camp. While Democratic Party presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in argues that the Assembly should focus on the election, leaving the Hwang leadership intact, the party’s former chair Sohn Hak-kyu has been calling for the party to formulate a neutral Cabinet and take the initiative in constitutional reform efforts. By Shin Hyon-hee","his four year career ,new acting president hwang ,four year career in ,four year career ,unpopular pm becomes unlikely",['Hwang Kyo - ahn'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48773283  0.76739186

It is now up to the nine judges of the Constitutional Court to determine whether Park should be removed from or remain in office. President Park Geun-hye  Who is Park? Park is the first female president of South Korea. She is the first daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 18 years until his assassination in 1979. She won the 2012 presidential election on support of conservative voters -- particularly elderly voters nostalgic for her father’s era. Childless and never married, the president has famously said she has devoted her life to the country and never pursued private interests. Park has 14 months remaining in her single, five-year term. Why is she in trouble? A scandal erupted in late October, revealing Park’s seemingly unexplainable reliance on Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of her late “mentor” Choi Tae-min, in both public and private life. In her first apology, the president admitted to having sought the advice of Choi, who holds no government position and has no policy background, on public addresses. Ensuing revelations show that Choi’s influence was far-reaching -- from Park’s wardrobe choices to government policies and personnel appointments. At the core of the scandal are two foundations – Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation – founded and controlled by Choi. Park is accused of colluding with Choi to extort donations from large businesses, including Samsung and LG. What is Park being impeached for? The impeachment bill, approved by the parliament Friday, listed four main charges against President Park. They are: - Park violated multiple clauses of the Constitution by allowing her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil and Choi’s associates to meddle in state affairs. - Park broke multiple laws by colluding with Choi and others to force private businesses to make donations and give contracts to particular companies. - Park broke the law by handing over to Choi a draft of presidential and governmental documents containing confidential information.- Park neglected her duty to protect the lives of the people when the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing over 300 people. What is an impeachment trial like in South Korea? The impeachment trial, as described in the Constitution, is different from that of the US and other Western countries. Presided over by the Constitutional Court, it is basically about whether certain acts of the president constitute impeachable offenses or not. So it is more of a legal judgment than anything political. According to the Constitution:“In case the president ... violated the Constitution or other acts in the performance of the official duties, the National Assembly may pass motions for impeachment.” The head of the parliamentary judiciary committee acts as the lead “prosecutor,” while the president will be represented by her own team of attorneys. Actual hearings do take place, but the president is likely to be spared the embarrassment of facing the interrogation of lawmakers. In a previous trial, then-President Roh Moo-hyun was requested to appear in court, but refused to do so. A verdict must be reached within 180 days. In the 2004 trial of Roh, the court decided on the 63rd day after passage of the parliamentary impeachment bill to reinstate him. How likely is Park’s impeachment? In a survey of six Constitutional law experts, conducted by The Korea Herald last month, three said the court is likely to find Park’s actions warrant her impeachment. Two refrained from making predictions, while one said the impeachment could be overturned by the court, given the ideological makeup of the judges. Aside from legal considerations, two factors may come into play: public sentiment and the scheduled departures early next year of two of the nine judges. The two seats may go unfilled during the trial, with the president suspended from office. In a Real Meter poll, over 75 percent of the public supported Park’s impeachment. Citizens demanding her immediate removal have been taking to the streets every Saturday for the past six weeks. In the latest massive anti-Park rally last Saturday, a record 2.32 million rallied nationwide. By Korea Herald special report team /","second presidential impeachment trial ,first female president ,country second presidential impeachment ,second presidential impeachment ,presidential impeachment trial","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park', 'South Korea']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.33949792  0.2102

The lawmakers of the main opposition Democratic Party remain confident about the prospect of the motion's passage, vowing to resign as legislators if it is voted down.In a last-ditch effort to thwart the impeachment drive, loyalists to Park within the ruling party reportedly asked Park to publicly declare her voluntary departure by April next year. But Park appeared unwilling to issue another public statement, sources said.    ""Park will calmly watch the  vote and respond appropriately to the unfolding situation,"" a presidential official told Yonhap News Agency, declining to be named.

The presidential office has repeatedly said that it would ""follow the due legal process"" in an indication that Park would not resign amid the trial.However, if the motion is voted down, Park is expected to pursue the scenario that the ruling party previously suggested -- her ""orderly"" departure by the end of April with a presidential election to follow two months later.On Wednesday, Saenuri Party leader Lee Jung-hyun said Park should officially declare she would step aside by April next year even if the impeachment motion is rejected.","silent thursday as political ,of impeachment showdown president ,silent ahead of impeachment ,impeachment showdown president park ,impeachment trial during talks","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53253639  0.13943177

An association of some 1,500 civic groups demanding President Park’s resignation plan to hold a large-scale debate session at the front gate of the National Assembly main building in southwestern Seoul from 1:30 p.m. Friday until the vote ends. Citizens demanding or opposing President Park Geun-hye's impeachment hold seperate protests in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday, a day before the crucial vote. Artists will join the move by surrounding the National Assembly building with some 1,000 yellow-colored flags bearing messages from the public calling for Park’s ouster until Friday. The daily candlelight vigils, which have been held at Gwanghwamun Square in the evenings, will be staged in front of the National Assembly building until Friday, according to the rally organizers. This came after National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun said the parliament would temporarily allow protests at the front gate following requests from the civic groups and lawmakers a day earlier. The Public Assembly Act bans protests within 100 meters of the nation’s key facilities, such as the presidential office, National Assembly building and foreign assemblies. “The National Assembly is the hall to echo the will of the people. It is the parliament’s responsibility to guarantee the public’s free and peaceful expression of their opinions within the legal boundaries,” Chung said. But he refused to open the parliament to the public or allow rallies inside the National Assembly building. Farmers also joined the last-ditch effort to remove Park from her presidential office by driving their tractors and trucks to Seoul, but it remains to be seen whether their farming vehicles will be allowed into Seoul. Some 200 members of the Korean Peasants League, the country’s biggest farmers’ association, plan to drive some 10 tractors and 20 trucks on the highway through Suwon and Anyang up to the National Assembly on Friday. They plan to join anti-Park rallies in central Seoul on tractors and trucks on Saturday. “It is the second uprising of farmers to plow up dirty power and dirty history. Let’s sow seeds of history to give hope to the public,” said Kim Young-ho, chief of the peasants’ group, during a rally held Thursday in front of Pyeongtaek City Hall. This would be their second attempt to roll into Seoul on trucks and tractors in a display of defiance. In late November, they had to leave their vehicles in a side street to get into Seoul due to police blocking their way. The farmers and police clashed, with three farmers injured. Police again plan to stop the trucks and tractors from coming into Seoul, saying the vehicles could pose a danger to the public. They plan to ban them from carrying any placards or flags with political messages on the vehicles. Police said 1,100 officers would be dispatched. Regardless of whether lawmakers decide to impeach Park, the anti-Park rally organizers said they would hold a demonstration demanding President Park’s immediate resignation at Gwanghwamun Square on Saturday. “If the impeachment motion is rejected, more South Koreans will take to the streets in anger,” the rally organizers said in a statement.

The motion’s passage would immediately suspend the disgraced president from her duties. But that would only be the beginning, as Park refuses to step down on her own and is seen as gearing up to defend her innocence in court. With six months given to the constitutional justices to deliberate the motion, concerns are spiraling over uncertainties and a subsequent vacuum in statecraft. Worrying signs are rampant in almost every sphere of the economy, top-level diplomacy is at a standstill and speculation is rising that North Korea may stage a major provocation in the near future. Opposition parties are calling for Park to resign immediately if the bill is passed, despite varying interpretations on the move’s constitutionality. Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, has expressed the willingness to negotiate with the ruling Saenuri Party on the timetable of the president’s exit following the Friday vote. “She must step down upon the impeachment vote without a word,” the party’s former chief Moon Jae-in wrote on his Facebook page last Saturday. “Though constitutional scholars remain divided on that matter, the dominant opinion is that she can. If she resigns before the Constitutional Court begins its deliberation, it would quickly complete the impeachment procedure.” But former Saenuri Party head Rep. Kim Moo-sung rebuffed the idea as “anti-constitutional,” saying the court has the authority to make a final decision and accused Moon of flaunting his ambition to take advantage of a possible early election as a leading opposition contender. Incumbent Saenuri Party chair Lee Jung-hyun also said Wednesday that even if the motion is voted down, the president should publicly declare she will leave in April as she indicated to him a day before. “The forthcoming impeachment poses a choice between an orderly departure and a forced one,” Lee said in a press interview. “It’s a choice between whether we would go according to the plan under which she resigns in April and an election is held in June, followed by a constitutional amendment, or we would confront the severe chaos due to an unpredictable constitutional deliberation and election schedule.” Park, however, has made clear that she is ready to follow the court process “in a calm and composed manner,” rather than leave Cheong Wa Dae through resignation.Controversy also persists over the text and language of the bill, with pro-Park Saenuri lawmakers, including Lee and some experts, arguing it included a multitude of unverified or relatively irrelevant allegations and thus would require more time for the justices to corroborate. Another focal point is whether to let Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn govern as acting president until the next election or appoint someone else and form a neutral Cabinet. The Constitution rules that the premier would take the reins in case of the president’s impeachment. Democratic Party Chairwoman Rep. Choo Mi-ae has said the National Assembly shout nominate a new prime minister to replace Hwang. But others deem the proposal as idealistic or beyond the parliament’s powers, calling instead for ousting Hwang before the impeachment vote. With the Constitution lacking specific clauses on the acting president’s authority, Hwang’s role is forecast to deepen the dispute not only between the ruling and opposition sides, but also inside each camp. It is also likely to have an impact on Park’s impeachment as two constitutional justices are scheduled to retire in January and March, which means that, if they are not replaced, the motion would require the approval of six of the remaining seven justices.

Those who were in attendance spent most of their time denying allegations or claiming no knowledge or memory. Former chief presidential secreatry Kim Ki-choon testifies at a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. Former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon claimed no knowledge of any irregularities in the country’s highest office during the session, which was broadcast live on TV. “I am ashamed and sorry for not properly assisting the president and for failing to stop the country falling into this situation,” he said. Kim, who was the conservative president’s right-hand man for 16 months until February 2015, said he had never met Choi.   Wednesday’s inquiry came just two days before a crucial parliamentary vote slated for Friday on whether or not to impeach the embattled President Park.The former presidential aide asserted that he did not know what the president was doing inside the presidential residence on April 16, 2014, when the ferry Sewol sank in country’s southwestern waters. The accident left 295 dead and nine missing, most of them high school students on a school trip.The related questions specifically referred to the recent set of reports that Park spent about 90 minutes having her hair done during her unexplained hours before appearing in public. Cheong Wa Dae admitted that hair designers visited Park, but claimed the hairdo took just 20 minutes.The lawmakers grilled witnesses who are suspected of either using ties to the president and her confidante Choi to win business favors. Jang, the daughter of Choi’s older sister Choi Soon-deuk, is suspected of embezzlement by allegedly founding Korea Winter Sports Elite to make undue profits ahead of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.“From what I know, the center received 600 million won  from the Culture Ministry and 1.6 billion won from Samsung Group. They are used to foster student athletes,” she said. Kim Jae-yeol, the president of Cheil Industries, who came to testify for the Samsung group said Samsung Electronics’ Global Marketing Group is in charge of making the decision to donate to the sports group. He added he was pressured by then Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong who was also present in the inquiry scene. Jang is suspected of embezzling some 1.1 billion won  from Samsung Group’s donation.Choi’s other associate Cha, a TV commercial director dubbed “the crown prince” for his sweeping influence in cultural affairs, admitted to recommending his close affiliates Choi Kim Jong-deok and Kim Sang-ryul, as culture minister and senior presidential secretary for education and culture, respectively. By Jo He-rim","hye scandal on wednesday ,aides face parliamentary hearing ,half of key witnesses ,park aides face parliamentary ,scandal the second day","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42840919  0.26961198

During the hearing, Ko, the chief of handbag manufacturing company Villomillo, provided a clue which may implicate Choi and Park for bribery. Ko said he made not only up to 40 bags, but also about 100 pieces of clothing for President Park, delivering them through Choi. He said Choi directly paid him for the goods worth about 45 million won . “I received 1.2 million won for ostrich skin bags and 2.8 million won for crocodile leather bags from Choi,” he said. As Rep. Hwang Young-cheul of the ruling Saenuri Party asked him whether the money seemed like Choi’s personal money, he said “yes.” Hwang raised “bribery” allegations that Choi paid for the products and gave them to Park in exchange for favors, citing that the presidential office said it had never set aside a budget for Park’s clothes and bags.“I just made what I was asked to make. I never thought it could be bribes,” Ko said. Ko Young-tae, the closest confidant of Choi Soon-sil, arrives at the National Asssembly in Seoul on Wednesday as a witness in a parliamentary hearing. Ko, who has been rumored to be Choi’s “boy toy” amid speculations that he met Choi while working at a host bar in southern Seoul in 2006, also denied being close to Choi.“I first met Choi while running Villomillo through my acquaintance who asked me to show the bags to Choi after the presidential election in 2012,” he said. Ko, who also served as director at Choi’s Germany-based paper companies -- The Blue-K and Widec Sports -- said, “I was only a staff member of The Blue-K, but I was not close to Choi.”Choi is accused of extorting donations from local conglomerates to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which she controls, and siphoning off the funds for her personal use through the paper companies. But Cha Eun-taek, a TV commercial director and Choi’s aide suspected of peddling influence over the culture industry through his ties to Choi, said, “I thought Ko and Choi were very close.” Ko dismissed speculation that his relationship with Choi turned sour because of Cha, who he introduced to Choi.  “Choi has hurled insulting remarks since two years ago and has not treated her subordinates like human beings on many occasions,” he said after being asked whether he hates her now. Rumors have it that their relationship turned icy after Cha got closer to Choi than Ko was.“Choi asked me to introduce a person with knowledge about the advertising sector and I introduced Cha, whose staff member was my close friend,” he said. “I thought that it was a mistake to introduce him after I found that Cha was poor at making advertisements.”Ko also confirmed his earlier comments about Choi editing presidential speeches. “I didn’t say Choi likes editing presidential speeches. But I have said Choi seemed to have edited presidential speeches,” he said. Ko first brought up the allegations during an interview with cable TV network JTBC, which led it to search for and obtain a tablet PC, supposedly owned by Choi, containing files of presidential speeches in late October.Ko denied speculations that he had delivered the tablet PC to a news outlet, saying “I have nothing to do with the tablet PC. I would have not left it like a fool in the office.”He also said that Choi may not be able to use the table PC, but her daughter Chung Yoo-ra might be. Asked whether he thought Choi was addicted to shots and propofol, he said that he had never seen Choi being injected. “I don’t know for sure, but she went to see a doctor often. I don’t know  but I saw her repeat her words over and over again.”The testimony came as other key witnesses involved in the sprawling scandal engulfing Park’s presidency -- former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong -- have claimed no knowledge of any irregularities during the parliamentary hearing. By Ock Hyun-ju","scandal during the hearing ,key aides to president ,peddling and corruption scandal ,implicate choi and park ,park during parliamentary inquiry","['Ko Young - tae', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi', 'Ko', 'Choi', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15161194  0.19280286

Until recently, however, it had refused to offer details on the unexplained hours, citing “national security.”Kim Ki-choon, Park’s chief of staff at the time, also backed the Blue House by saying that the president indeed received reports during those hours.“It is just that written reports are faster than face-to-face procedures,” Kim said at the parliamentary hearing Wednesday, in explanation for the lack of Park’s public appearance or a face-to-face encounter with officials.But Park’s remarks at the scene, which only seemed to reflect her lack of awareness of the situation, amplified the doubts of the Blue House’s position.“The students are wearing life vests, so why aren’t they found yet?” was her first question after she arrived at the center at 5:15 p.m., a full six hours after the sunken ferry submerged with only its bow remaining above water and most of the passengers trapped inside the capsized vessel.The suggestion of Park’s lax response on the Sewol sinking day is expected to add momentum to public anger and the opposition political parties’ action to have the embattled president driven out by impeachment.President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday said she would not waver even if the parliament should approve of the impeachment bill on Friday, holding ground against growing calls for her immediate ouster.Meanwhile, chances increased that the opposition-motioned bill would make it past the legislature as the ruling Saenuri Party’s nonmainstreamers recently gestured at signing the bill.The rebel group, consisting of some 40 members, is likely to complete the necessary two-thirds quorum to pass the impeachment bill in the 300-seat Assembly. The number of opposition and liberal-leaning independent lawmakers currently stands at 172, falling 28 short of the necessary 200.But some last-minute tensions were detected, as the non-Park cluster demanded excluding the “seven-hour mystery” from the impeachment bill, claiming the controversial issue may lead some hesitant figures to shy away from supporting the bill. The opposition, however, refused to do so, citing the public’s anger over the issue.By Bae Hyun-jung","vote on impeaching president ,ferry sinking on april ,minute issue before impeachment ,before impeachment vote ,on impeaching president park",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.02246814  0.07629167

The threshold for the parliamentary motion’s passage is 200 votes, or two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly.Rep. Hwang Young-cheul of the ruling Saenuri Party, speaking for a group of more than 40 Saenuri lawmakers which are key to the opposition-led campaign’s success, claimed that at least 35 of the group would vote for the impeachment. “So far, at least 35 votes have been confirmed ,” he said on a radio program. The lawmaker represents a Saenuri faction called “the non-Parks,” because they are in the gray area between Park’s liberal opponents and staunch loyalists within the ruling party. Another non-Park key figure spoke of an even higher likelihood of the bill’s passage saying, “At least 50  lawmakers support Park’s impeachment.” If their predictions turn out to be correct, the opposition-mounted motion to dismiss Park will pass the National Assembly on Friday, opening the way for the country’s second presidential impeachment trial in history. Three opposition parties and independent lawmakers, united for Park’s ouster, control 172 votes, 28 shy of the required quorum.Saenuri leaders, rallying behind the embattled president, challenged that, claiming that at least 10 non-Parks had switched sides. “I doubt many  would cast a yes vote, knowing that it could pave the way for the liberal opposition to seize power ,” Yonhap quoted a Saenuri lawmaker as saying. “I think  with just 195 votes,” the lawmaker said. The opposition on Wednesday officially declared a shift into a “24-hour emergency mode,” asking all members to concentrate on the impeachment bill’s passage. “Tomorrow , all Democratic Party lawmakers will pull an all-nighter in a candlelight vigil  for Park’s impeachment,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.President Park will “follow due legal procedures” if the National Assembly passes the impeachment bill against her on Friday, a Cheong Wa Dae official said. The stance, delivered to Saenuri leaders in a meeting a day earlier, indicates Park has no intention to bow out and would rather choose to fight for her job and name at the Constitutional Court. Local reports said Park may ring Saenuri lawmakers in person in a last-minute effort to evade the impeachment.   By Lee Sun-young","wednesday afternoon impeachment proponents ,historical impeachment vote president ,impeachment vote projections 222 ,impeachment vote president ,impeachment vote president park","['Park Geun', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.75038058  0.65181321

Testifying before a bipartisan panel of lawmakers in a hearing at the National Assembly on Tuesday, Sohn admitted to having received the message purportedly from President Park Geun-hye via Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Cho Won-dong. “Cho asked to meet , and said ‘Vice Chairwoman Lee Mie-kyung should step down from office. This is a word from the president,’” Sohn said in an answer to Rep. Kim Kyung-jin of the People’s Party. Vice Chairwoman Lee Mie-kyungLee is the daughter of late CJ Group founder Lee Maeng-hee. Current CJ Chairman Lee Jay-hyun is her younger brother. The presidential secretary didn’t offer any explanation, Sohn said. Lee, after hearing the message, did not believe it was from the president and wanted to hear the direct words from Cho, he added. According to Cho’s testimony to the prosecution in November, President Park said it was unfair for a family member to stand in for the CJ chairman, who was at that time arrested for embezzlement.  Local media suspect it may have been retaliation against Lee for her film projects, including 2013’s “The Attorney,” about deceased liberal President Roh Moo-hyun. Lee stepped aside from management in early 2015 and has since stayed in the US. Sohn also revealed he had two private meetings with the president. CJ is among several Korean conglomerates that provided donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which are suspected to have been controlled by President Park‘s friend Choi Soon-sil. “The government then had settled some policies for the culture industry.  asked CJ Group to make efforts to foster the industry sector,” Sohn said.By Jo He-rim","quit testifying before bipartisan ,assembly on tuesday sohn ,national assembly on tuesday ,to remove vice chairwoman ,assembly on tuesday","['CJ Group Co -', 'Sohn Kyoung - shik', 'Lee Mie - kyung', 'the National Assembly', 'Sohn', 'Park Geun', 'Economic Affairs', 'Cho Won - dong', 'Cho']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.08220052 -0.03796368

Such figures include former party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung.But other more outspoken nonmainstreamers have recently made it clear that they will not ease down on forcefully driving out the scandal-ridden president.“We have decided that the only way to solve the current crisis is to go ahead with the impeachment procedure,” said Rep. Hwang Young-cheul, speaking for the emergency council meeting, an in-party group of nonmainstreamers.He thus reiterated that the non-Park members would continue to uphold the impeachment bill, whether or not Park offers to resign by April.“The people have made it clear that the president’s  withdrawal from power is not an acceptable solution,” the lawmaker said.Rep. Hwang had claimed in a radio interview earlier in the morning that 35 non-Park lawmakers had explicitly expressed their approval of the impeachment bill and that three or more unexposed members from the pro-presidential group may also cast their ballot in Friday’s vote.“We are making sincere efforts to have the impeachment bill voted through and are ready to prove it to the people, if necessary,” he said, alluding that the anti-Park cluster may possibly go public with the names of those backing impeachment.The Saenuri’s anti-Park cluster, comprising of some 40 members, is likely to complete the necessary two-thirds quorum to pass the impeachment bill in the 300-seat Assembly. The number of opposition and liberal-leaning independent lawmakers currently stands at 172, falling 28 short of the 200 mark.While adding fuel to the impeachment action, however, the Saenuri minority faction also protested against mounting political pressure from the opposition, referring to the daily candlelight rallies held this week on the National Assembly yard.“I hope that the rights of our lawmakers  as individual constitutional organs are not hindered by illegitimate means,” Hwang said.Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, another non-Park figure, blasted upon Moon Jae-in, former chairman and presidential frontrunner of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.“Moon and his aides are imposing pressure upon the lawmakers’ decision-making and instigating the public,” the third-term lawmaker said.“They should realize that such actions are of no help to the nation’s democracy.”In spite of such complaints, opposition parties kept up their firm stance on impeachment, leaving no room for the president’s voluntary resignation.“Ninety-five percent of the people are demanding the president’s immediate ouster,” said the main opposition DPK chief Rep. Choo Mi-ae at a trilateral meeting of opposition leaders.“The opinion of Cheong Wa Dae or the Saenuri may not precede that of the entire nation.”By Bae Hyun-jung","prepares for impeachment president ,tuesday on her departure ,park prepares for impeachment ,for impeachment president ,for impeachment president park","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Saenrui Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.48084918  0.23311807

Yet, some admitted the contributions were not 100 percent voluntary. Nine business leaders, including Samsung Group’s heir and de facto chief Lee Jae-yong, faced feisty lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing at the National Assembly over their alleged involvement in the scandal swirling around the president and her friend Choi Soon-sil. Despite being hailed as one of the biggest parliamentary inquiries in the country, with some of Korea’s richest people on the witness stand, the session provided little new information. Most of the tycoons spent their time denying allegations, eluding sensitive questions or just claiming to have no knowledge or memory. “Samsung has never ever made any donation anticipating business favors in return,” Samsung’s Lee, the youngest of the tycoons in attendance, told lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties during the session broadcast live on TV.  Top business tycoons including Samsung Group Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong  attend a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday. While admitting to having two exclusive meetings with President Park in July 2015 and in February this year, Lee contended the meetings had nothing to do with Samsung’s more than 20 billion won  in donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- now suspected to have been a cover for Choi’s embezzlement.In the meeting, the president had asked for Samsung’s generous support for the nation’s cultural and sports scenes, Lee said. Core projects of the Mir and K-Sports foundations were for cultural exchanges and local sports development.The Samsung Electronics vice chairman went on to dispute the allegation that Samsung may have received special treatment from the government -- the state-run National Pension Service’s support of the group’s much-disputed merger in particular -- in return for donations. Lee said the merger between Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T;, which was all over the news at that time because of US fund Elliott’s open campaign to block it, was never brought up in his meeting with the president. NPS was the largest shareholder of the premerger Samsung C&T.; The marriage of the two seemingly unrelated companies materialized thanks to the NPS’ support, widely viewed as helping cement Lee’s grip over the conglomerate.“The merger of Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries was not for the succession of managerial rights,” Lee said.  The Samsung heir, however, acknowledged having funded business projects led by the president’s friend Choi and her family members, but claimed the decisions were not “voluntary.” “It was an unescapable situation for us,” said Lee.Other attendees of the session -- heads of Hyundai Motor, SK, LG, GS, Lotte, Hanwha, Hanjin and CJ – also rejected bribery accusations in unison, but some of the tycoons admitted that their donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations were not quite voluntary.  “It is hard  to snub a request from the government. That’s the reality in Korea,” said Hur Chang-soo, the chairman of GS Group who leads the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobbying body for big business.LG Group Chairman Koo Bon-moo echoed the sentiment, saying, “Businesses have no choice but to comply with government policies.” SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won said his group’s contribution to the foundations run by Choi was done in accordance with a quota set by the FKI. Lotte’s Shin Dong-bin refuted the prosecution’s claim that the group’s decision to donate 7 billion won -- on top of the 4.5 billion won it had already given to the two foundations -- was at the direct request from the president. Prosecutors investigating the scandal surrounding President Park have said the group’s additional support was the outcome of a closed-door meeting between the president and Shin in March this year.  “That  didn’t happen,” the businessman said, while admitting to having met the president.  The parliamentary investigation also shed light on the generous support that conglomerates provided to Chung Yoo-ra, the dressage rider and daughter of the president’s friend. Earlier, it was revealed that Chung rode a horse that was worth nearly 1 billion won and was purchased by Samsung.Samsung’s Lee, asked about the group’s 10 billion won in support for Choi’s daughter and sports business interests, said: “It was not right. I want to say nothing but sorry.” Rep. Jang Je-won of the ruling Saenuri Party said that Hanwha Group, whose chief Kim Seung-youn chaired the Korean Equestrian Association until March 2015, provided Chung two horses worth a total 800 million won, which the Hanwha boss claimed to have no knowledge of. Hanwha Group later denied the allegation.

Topping the agenda in Monday’s session was the president’s whereabouts on the day the Sewol ferry sank in 2014. Rumors are rife that Park might have received plastic surgery with assistance from military medical officers during the nation’s worst-ever maritime disaster, which claimed the lives of more than 300 people. But the often-testy exchange between committee members and their prominent witnesses revealed little new information about the day, as senior presidential aides in charge of security services for Park refused to attend the inquiry.Rep. Ahn Min-suk of the main opposition Democractic Party speaks about a TV image of President Park Geun-hye At a special parliamentary investigation session in Seoul on Monday. “Their testimony is a key to finding out exactly what happened,” said Rep. Hwang Young-chul of Saenuri Party, criticizing the absence of Park Heung-ryul, the chief of the Presidential Security Service, who cited other important businesses as the reason for his absence.  Rep. Hwang, who represents a group of Saenuri lawmakers critical of Park, urged the committee to take “extraordinary” measures to compel the witness to testify, such as holding another session at Cheong Wa Dae. The Assembly law mandates that if the witnesses refuse to attend the inquiry without offering a legitimate explanation after receiving a subpoena, they can be sent to prison or forced to pay fines. But there is no measure to enforce their attendance if the witnesses choose to risk punishment. In the second session of the parliamentary inquiry designed to investigate the allegation that Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil had meddled in state affairs, Monday’s hearing saw several senior presidential aides answer questions. Opposition lawmakers demanded that the presidential office provide evidence to refute the allegation that Park had been receiving plastic surgery, urging them to allow presidential medical officers to testify before the lawmakers. In a recent interview with media outlets, the officers denied the rumors that they provided medical attention to the president on the day when the Sewol sank. But opposition lawmakers have contended that they might have been coerced into making such statements by the presidential office.  “They should come back to South Korea and testify before the lawmakers,” said Rep. Park Young-sun of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, referring to one of the officers who was thought to be studying in the United States. When asked by Saenuri lawmaker Rep. Ha Tae-keung about whether the president had signaled early resignation in her latest national address -- where she said she was willing to step down if the lawmakers come up with a timeframe and legal process -- Presidential Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok said, “It is correct.”“The president is not sticking to her designated term,” Han told the lawmaker, referring to the fact that the president’s term is scheduled to end in Feb 2017. “The president has gathered various opinions and reached a decision afterward.” The chief-of-staff added that the president would “soon” announce a specific plan for her resignation, responding to the mounting criticism that Park’s announcement is a stalling tactic to fend off looming impeachment led by the National Assembly.

Park is being investigated as a suspect in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal involving her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil and former aides.The civilian-run website’s name is a combination of the embattled South Korean leader’s name and “tan-haek,” the Korean word for impeachment. It was created last Friday to provide a platform for submitting petitions and messages to lawmakers, ahead of the historic impeachment vote on Friday.A screenshot of parkgeunhack.com A person can submit a petition via the lawmaker’s official email address along with a personal message. Rep. Kim Moo-sung, one of leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party’s nonmainstream faction, has received most petitions out of 300 lawmakers with 46,838 as of Monday morning.Rep. Park and his fellow nonmainstreamers of Saenuri -- numbered over 40 --- are considered to hold the deciding vote in the impeachment, which requires at least 200 votes. Opposition and independent lawmakers account for only 172.This group had flipped back and forth on their decision to support the extreme but public-backed measure. Their known current stance, judging from what they said Sunday evening after a record-breaking anti-Park protest Saturday, is that they will go on to vote for Park’s impeachment, unless rival parties agree on an alternative plan. “The nationwide consensus is calling for a stronger punishment  for the president. Her begging for mercy would not be enough, but she effectively said in  address that she has no fault. This aggravated the situation,” said Saenuri’s Rep. Ha Tae-keung in a radio interview Monday.If the motion for impeachment is passed at the National Assembly, it will be subject to deliberation by the Constitutional Court. The court will decide whether or not Park will be the first president in the country’s history to be sacked by the parliament. The messages submitted at Park Geun-hack.com was a reminder that an overwhelming majority of the public demand that Park should be removed from office immediately  “We don’t need  resign. She should be impeached, no question! Please be a lawmaker who puts people over the benefit of you or your party,” said Hong Yu-jin of Ulsan in his petition. “ brought the biggest shame in history to the people of Korea. Make sure that she is kicked out in a most shameful way,” said Jang Hyo-cheol of Gyeonggi Province.Lawmakers who receive petitions can notify the website on whether or not they support the impeachment. Nearly all opposition lawmakers have done this, declaring their support of the motion, but only a few from Saenuri. As of Monday, 176 said they support the motion while four -- all Saenuri lawmakers -- were against it.Six from Saenuri have declared their support for the motion; at least 28 Saenuri votes are needed to pass the bill at the National Assembly.By Yoon Min-sik","park impeachment online website ,for park impeachment online ,park impeachment online ,impeachment has gone viral ,impeachment online website allowing",['Park Geun - hye'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33958238 -0.0122399

105,105,Opposition seeks to keep Saenuri rebels onside for impeachment,"With four days remaining to the impeachment showdown, the opposition assumed the offensive on passing the bill against President Park Geun-hye and the ruling camp struggled to divert the likely ouster to the president’s gradual and voluntary resignation.The key variable, which added momentum to the impeachment action over the weekend, was the shift in stance from nonmainstreamers within the Saenuri Party who do not ...","With four days remaining to the impeachment showdown, the opposition assumed the offensive on passing the bill against President Park Geun-hye and the ruling camp struggled to divert the likely ouster to the president’s gradual and voluntary resignation.The key variable, which added momentum to the impeachment action over the weekend, was the shift in stance from nonmainstreamers within the Saenuri Party who do not align themselves with the embattled president -- commonly referred to as the non-Park cluster.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Monday maintained awkward silence, with spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk skipping out on his regular press briefing in the morning without prior notice.Though the Blue House did not specify the reason for calling off the daily briefing, the sudden reclusion was largely taken as a sign of distress, following the Saenuri Party’s non-Park members’ gesturing to take part in the opposition-led impeachment bill.“We once again urge parties to negotiate at their best , but should they fail to do so, we shall participate in the impeachment bill vote on Dec. 9 without reservation,” Rep. Hwang Young-cheul said Sunday, speaking for the nonmainstream Saenuri lawmakers.As the three opposition parties have made it clear that they will accept nothing less than Park’s forceful ouster by impeachment, this effectively meant that the non-Park group decided to uphold impeachment.Last Friday, the nonmainstreamers seemed to soften up as they demanded President Park set the date of her resignation by Wednesday, alluding that they would not go as far as the coercive measure of impeaching should Park only gesture at stepping down.But it was the ever-mounting candlelight rally on Saturday, an event said to have gathered some 2.32 million protesters nationwide, which apparently kindled the sense of crisis that those hesitating over impeachment may eventually fall to pieces along with the outgoing president.The non-Park group, comprising some 40 lawmakers, is likely to create the necessary quorum to pass the impeachment bill. The number of opposition and liberal-leaning independent lawmakers currently amounts to 172, which is 28 votes short from the two-thirds quorum in the 300-seat Assembly.The Saenuri Party’s pro-Park leadership, flustered by the nonmainstreamers’ hardened stance, showed moves to let go of its earlier plan to allow the president a self-directed departure.“Should the impeachment process proceed as planned, all Saenuri lawmakers should participate and cast their vote according to their conscience,” floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told reporters.This indicated that the ruling party is willing to overturn its earlier party platform that the president should step down by April next year so as to give way to an earlier-than-expected presidential election in June.Rep. Chung also added that Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, a representative presidential loyalist who had adamantly stood against impeachment, agreed to this idea of free voting -- hinting that the leadership is now ready for anything only to stop the impeachment clock.But while making gestures of embracing impeachment, the ruling party leadership also displayed last-minute struggles on the president stepping down of her own will.“We demand for Cheong Wa Dae’s immediate response on  resignation by April, which we decided on in an unanimous vote last week,” said spokesperson Rep. Kim Sung-won.Speculations have risen that the president, with few options left, may choose to deliver another address to the nation within the week to accept her home party leadership’s suggestion.The Saenuri leadership’s continued calls for the president‘s “orderly withdrawal from power” are seen as part of its effort to talk the moderate non-Park members out of impeachment. Among those lawmakers is former party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who claimed impeachment to be unnecessary, should the president confirm her resignation.But regardless of the response from the Blue House or even the possible change of heart from the Saenuri’s nonmainstreamers, the three opposition parties have vowed to hold their ground and push ahead with the impeachment at all costs.“I am telling you once and for all, there can be and will be no partisan agreement on  resignation by April,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairperson of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.The main opposition chief thus pledged to hold emergency party meetings and candlelight rallies on a daily basis up to the parliamentary vote on Friday, so as to consolidate opposition unity on impeachment.The party‘s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho, while backing up Choo‘s calls, also warned against mounting optimism that the non-Park group’s move will vouch for the impeachment bill passage.“It is true the non-Parks have turned in favor , but that does not mean that all 40 of them are bound by that decision,” he told reporters, estimating there is a fifty-fifty chance that the impeachment bill would pass the parliamentary floor.The smaller opposition People‘s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won, who had previously appeared hesitant on impeachment due to the possible lack of quorum, also raised his voice.“We no longer demand for an orderly withdrawal, but only for impeachment,” he said in a party meeting. “Only by discarding its president may the Republic of Korea survive.”Rep. Sim Sang-jeung, leader of the progressive minority Justice Party, argued that the people will ultimately dismiss the Assembly as well, should it fail to respond to calls for Park’s ouster.By Bae Hyun-jung","rebels onside for impeachment ,impeachment with four days ,impeachment showdown the opposition ,bill against president park ,to the impeachment showdown","['Park Geun', 'the Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.20117949  0.18236347

An impeachment push by opposition parties gained traction after an estimated 2.32 million citizens took to the streets across the country last Saturday to call for Park's immediate resignation.Adding to the move are some ruling party members who are not loyal to the president, or ""non-mainstreamers."" They vowed to join the impeachment vote should their Saenrui Party fail to negotiate a compromise this week with the opposition parties over the terms of Park's departure. Opposition parties, however, remain opposed to any negotiations with the ruling party.Following a meeting of senior party officials, Lee Jung-hyun, leader of the Saenuri Party, said that the president would honor the party's official line to have her resign by the end of April next year and hold a presidential election two months later.But the party line has started to crumble as the non-mainstreamers are poised to join the forthcoming impeachment vote. The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said that the president is pondering ""all possible ways,"" including delivering another address.""But nothing has been decided yet,"" a presidential official said.Reflecting the difficulty in finding a way out of the current political crisis, Cheong Wa Dae abruptly canceled a regular press briefing in the morning. Some observers cautioned that if Park fails to clearly declare her plan to bow out during an address, it could further inflame opposition parties as well as disgruntled citizens that have staged massive rallies for the last six consecutive weekends.","fourth address over scandal ,foil an impeachment vote ,the embattled president may ,her resignation during speech ,an impeachment vote slated",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.06728854  0.21736401

Choo Mi-ae, head of the main opposition Democratic Party, holds a press conference at the Seoul-based National Assembly headquarters on Dec. 5.Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the head of the main opposition Democratic Party, said it will not discuss Park's voluntary retreat, adding the public only calls for impeachment and the president's immediate resignation.""On Saturday, 2.3 million protesters joined rallies, refusing to accept Saenuri's plan for a voluntary resignation,"" Choo said.""We urge Saenuri lawmakers to join the move for impeachment in accordance to the public's voice and conscience.""During a press meeting, Choo said some of its lawmakers are even insisting that the National Assembly should dissolve itself if it fails to pass the impeachment motion.Choo rebutted Park loyalists's argument that an impeachment would bring bigger confusion to state affairs, saying a greater cause is at stake with the impeachment.  ""The fate of South Korean politics and the country's future lie on the impeachment. It is about choosing between the faction led by conscience and the Constitution, and the unprincipled bloc,"" Choo added.A successful passage of the impeachment motion calls for approval from at least 200 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly. The opposition bloc is 28 seats short of getting a two-thirds vote and therefore must persuade the Park dissenters in Saenuri.Rep. Park Jie-won of the splinter People's Party also echoed the view, adding the parliament should vote on the impeachment even if the president does agree to step down in April as suggested by Saenuri leaders.""The public's anger, reflected through candlelight rallies, will not allow the president to return to state affairs.

They complain of receiving hundreds of phone calls and text messages from angry voters. The Saenuri Party on Friday filed a legal complaint against a lawmaker from the main opposition, Rep. Pyo Chang-won of the Democratic Party of Korea, for releasing a list of party lawmakers who he claimed have opposed Park’s impeachment. The party claimed Pyo had violated their privacy and interfered with their official dutiesWhile some 2 million people took to the streets across the nation Saturday to demand Park’s immediate resignation, some 3,000 gathered in front of the Saenuri Party headquarters in Yeouido in Seoul. With citizens’ fury directed at the ruling party, protesters shouted, “Disassemble Saenuri,” and tore a large Saenuri flag. Some participants threw eggs at the windows of the building. The protesters said that the Saenuri Party’s push for the resignation of the president in April and a presidential election in June was “a strategic survival plan” and claimed that “a suspect Park” should not be allowed to resign “in honor.” “It is those 28  lawmakers versus 2 million street protesters and other citizens fighting for the immediate resignation of Park,” said Kim Young-mi, a citizen who participated in Saturday’s rally. Soon after Pyo’s list was released, an anonymous source uploaded the lawmakers’ phone numbers online. Saenuri members complained about their phones ringing in early hours while others suffered from a bombardment of mocking text messages from angry citizens.The ruling party suspected a possible link between Pyo and the phone number distributor, and demanded for a thorough probe of the leak. “The phone numbers were revealed at around the time Rep. Pyo posted the list online. There are possibilities of collusion,” a Saenuri lawmaker said. Sharing the news article reporting Saenuri’s lawsuit on his Facebook on Sunday, Rep. Pyo said he “welcomed” the ruling party’s move. “Unlike Park Geun-hye or pro-Park lawmakers, I actually abide by the law. I will  cooperate in the probe,” he wrote, referring to President Park’s previous refusals to the prosecution’s requests for face-to-face questioning. Pyo said in his previous Facebook and Twitter posts that he would take the blame from the ruling party lawmakers but said their distress is the result of public sentiment. He added that he would update the list of legislators that disagreed with the impeachment plan, which, he claims has been figured out based on a fair evaluation of news reports and statements the lawmakers have publicly made. Representatives of three opposition parties hand in the impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye to the National Assembly secretariat on Saturday. The bill has been signed by the parties’ 171 lawmakers. From right: Reps. Lee Choon-suak of the Democratic Party of Korea, Kim Kwan-young of People’s Party and Lee Jung-mi from Justice Party. The opposition People’s Party’s leader Park Jie-won also faced strong criticism when he came out to participate in the sixth rally in central Seoul Saturday, with some protesters calling the party a “second army of Saenuri Party.” The opposition party opposed the Democratic Party’s proposal to hold an early vote last Friday to impeach President Park, delaying the official voting a week from the suggested date. He reportedly received some 20,000 text messages and numerous phone calls from angry citizens who seek to remove President Park from office as soon as possible after he made the statement. He also made some controversial remarks in a televised interview with a local news program Thursday, saying that over 70 to 80 percent of citizens agree the Constitution should be amended. Seven out of 10 citizens disagreed with the idea of making a Constitutional revision before the impeachment, according to survey released by one of the nation’s pollster RealMeter Thursday.Early on Saturday, the three opposition parties submitted a motion to impeach Park for violating the constitutional order. For the motion to pass, at least 28 lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party need to vote for it, as it requires a two-thirds majority in the 300-member National Assembly. Currently, 171 assembly members from outside the Saenuri Party have signed on to support the motion. The motion will officially be placed to vote on Friday.The ruling party suffers from a split between the conservative leadership loyal to President Park and her dissenters, with the former group arguing for the president to step down voluntarily in April but refusing to vote for impeachment.By Jo He-rim","anger directed at politicians ,messages from angry voters ,the scandal ridden president ,directed at politicians failing ,angry voters the saenuri","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.60560471  0.13756441

The motion will officially be proposed during a regular parliamentary session on Thursday, with the vote to place on Friday.Park has been facing the biggest crisis of her political career due to the influence-peddling scandal centered on her friend Choi Soon-sil and some of her aides. Choi is suspected of exerting influence on state affairs and having profited from her close relationship with the president.The motion claimed Park violated the Constitution as well as other laws, adding she took advantage of her authority granted by the people.The opposition parties said the president broke the country's supreme law by allowing Choi to exert influence on state affairs, while disrupting the market system by forcing conglomerates to donate funds to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which could be considered a form of extortion. Investigators have claimed that Choi may have tried to siphon off money to enrich herself from these entities.As widely expected, the motion also cited the Sewol ferry disaster, adding that Park failed to protect the lives of the people as stipulated in the Constitution. The Sewol ferry, which sank on April 16, 2014, was en route to the southern resort island of Jeju from Incheon, west of Seoul, with a total of 476 passengers. Most of the 304 dead were high school students on a field trip.The successful passage of an impeachment motion calls for approval from 200 of the 300 lawmakers in the National Assembly. At least 28 Saenuri members must support the motion even if every opposition and independent lawmaker votes for impeachment.Park loyalists in the Saenuri Party have opposed the impeachment motion and argued for the president to step down voluntarily by late April. Park dissenters in the ruling party, meanwhile, have been urging the presidential office to come up with a detailed plan of retreat by Wednesday, adding they will vote on the motion if she fails to do so.Observers have, however, said that even lawmakers critical of Park in the past may not vote for the motion by the opposition especially since Saenuri already passed a resolution supported by all its members outlining a timetable for Park's resignation and transfer of power.","parliamentary session on thursday ,hand in park impeachment ,saturday for her alleged ,impeachment motion to parliament ,plenary session next week","['Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33543429 -0.03232164

It also said that past attacks such as those in France and Belgium over the last two years show that extremists acting in the name of IS can effectively plan complex attacks.Both France and Belgium are among European nations that have joined the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group. Others include Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Germany's military also is involved, but not in combat operations.Europol also notes a shift in attacks from symbolic targets like police officers and military personnel to indiscriminate attacks on soft targets, such as the Paris attacks in 2015.``Indiscriminate attacks have a very powerful effect on the public in general, which is one of the main goals of terrorism: to seriously intimidate a population,'' the report says, adding that the focus on so-called soft targets means that attacking critical infrastructure like power grids and nuclear facilities is ``currently not a priority.''Europol also says that the consensus among intelligence agencies in EU member states is that ``the cyber capabilities of terrorist groups are still relatively low,'' but adds that ``the possibility of terrorist-affiliated cyber groups engaging in cyber warfare sponsored by Nation States - those with capacities to engage in this type of attacks - should not be discounted.''Meanwhile, a police raid in Morocco in February may have thwarted a possible attack by an IS cell using chemical or biological weapons, raising the specter that such weapons also could be used in Europe, though the report says automatic firearms, knives and vehicles are more easily available and that ``The effectiveness, ease of use and access of these weapons will continue to be relevant.''","coalition fighting the extremist ,eu police report highlights ,fighting the extremist organization ,fighting the extremist ,police report highlights ongoing","['HAGUE', 'Netherlands', 'AP', 'Islamic', 'the European Union', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'EU', 'Europol']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59576625  0.38275942

The resignation plan, though it states that the president should hand over practical power to the prime minister as a transition measure, means that she will continue to hold power for five more months.The two scenarios also lead to a different timeline for the next presidential election to choose Park’s successor.In case of resignation by late April, the presidential race is likely to be held around June. Political parties will have about five months to single out their candidate and prepare for a campaign.With impeachment, an election would be held earlier. Park’s ultimate dismissal could come as early as February, which means that the election would take place in April. Despite the uncertainties of the possibility and consequent political timeline, there is yet another reason for the opposition circles -- and the angered public -- to push ahead with impeachment.Impeachment, being the only way to legally sanction a standing president, is to deprive Park of several of the privileges which she may otherwise enjoy after stepping down.The Act on Honorable Treatment of Former Presidents entitles former presidents to a number of benefits -- all of which are to be suspended, should he or she be driven out of the post by impeachment, face imprisonment for a crime or expatriate to another state.The financial advantages range from pension, medical fees, transportation expenses, telecommunication costs, as well as state-funded private security services and personal assistants.The affiliated enforcement ordinance states that a former president may receive a yearly pension of up to 8.85 times the monthly salary of the incumbent president at the time of payment. Upon this rule, former presidents are generally to receive about 50 percent of their salary during their time in office.Park, whose yearly salary is 212 million won , will thus be given about 148 million won after retirement or resignation.This amount would have been inherited to Park’s spouse or children, had she been married or had children.Last year, a budget of 20.1 billion won was used to support former presidents and their families, according to the Ministry of Interior.The current beneficiaries include former President Lee Myung-bak and the bereaved families of Roh Moo-hyun, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam. Other former presidents have been excluded from the list due to their post-term criminal charges.By Bae Hyun-jung","president self directed resignation ,park to shun impeachment ,better alternative to impeachment ,shun impeachment the ruling ,stance concerning embattled president","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.22470263  0.4551006

The counsel, who was recommended by the opposition parties and appointed by the president Wednesday, is currently forming a 105-strong special investigative team, the largest in size in South Korean history. Upon his appointment, the 64-year-old has pledged a no-holds-barred investigation of the presidential scandal. Park also hinted Friday that his probe will look into suspicions that the ongoing prosecutorial probe hasn’t covered. This includes the so-called “mystery of seven missing hours” and the alleged cult influence from Park’s late “mentor” Choi Tae-min whose daughter, Choi Soon-sil, was the epicenter of a massive scandal that now threatens the presidency of Park Geun-hye. “We will also look into the seven hours of President Park,” he said. On April 16, 2014, the day of the ferry disaster, Park did not appear in public until seven hours after the incident, ostensibly lacking a proper understanding of the incident that killed nearly 300, mostly teenagers. This led to various lurid rumors including one of cosmetic treatment taking place at Park’s presidential residence. On accusations that Park ran the country under a religious influence of the deceased cult leader Choi Tae-min and his daughter Choi Soon-sil, the counsel said: “If the alleged crimes originated from Choi Tae-min, we should look into that too.”","investigate scandal engulfing president ,vowed friday to question ,scandal engulfing president park ,counsel vows to grill ,geun hye vowed friday",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.03981181  0.58410424

""At this important juncture, she will not just idle away her time.""On Tuesday, Park called on parliament to determine her fate, pledging to bow out in accordance with the timeline and procedures that the ruling and opposition parties set based on their agreement. But she stopped short of specifying the date for her resignation, spawning doubts over whether she is sincere about her avowed departure.Some ruling party members who have been critical of Park demanded Park give a clear timeline for her departure by 6 p.m. on Wednesday next week, as opposition lawmakers are pushing to put an impeachment motion to a vote on Friday.The non-mainstreamers had leaned towards Park's impeachment. But after Park expressed her intention to step aside, many have favored her early departure, which they think will help facilitate a stable government change and prevent the party from breaking up.A day earlier, the ruling party as a whole decided to push for Park's resignation by the end of April next year with a presidential election to follow two months later.Opposition parties are seeking to bring Park down as soon as possible, but the passage of an impeachment motion requires endorsement from dozens of ruling party members given that it requires support from two thirds of the 300 lawmakers.During her talks with ruling party lawmakers, Park is expected to note that it is difficult for her to set an exact date for her departure, as the ruling and opposition parties have yet to engage in any serious negotiations over her resignation. Cheong Wa Dae has repeatedly said Park will comply with whatever decision rival parties make over her fate.Observers said the list of Saenuri lawmakers she would meet for talks may include Rep. Kim Moo-sung, a former party leader and her factional rival, and Yoo Seong-min, one of the party's potential presidential contenders.","lawmakers stave off impeachment ,stave off impeachment president ,party lawmakers stave off ,lawmakers stave off ,off impeachment president park","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.70022339  0.48377964

Chung, a 19-year-old dressage rider, is involved in the scandal, but has not been brought in for questioning yet. Chung is said to be in Germany, on leave of absence from Ewha Womans University. Her mother, who stayed there with Chung, returned to Korea last month and is now under arrest. The Ministry of Education confirmed through a special inspection that she was illegally accepted into the university and was given overly generous marks without attending classes or turning in assignments at Ewha, due to her mother’s status. Chung Yoo-ra competes in the 2014 Asian Games Choi, who holds no government post, is suspected of meddling in state affairs, extorting donations from conglomerates and getting her daughter accepted into the prestigious university through her ties to the embattled president. It is also suspected that Samsung Group, a corporate sponsor of Chung, received business favors from the government in return for generous support of Chung.   “As we are investigating the Ewha case, Chung Yoo-ra will be questioned at some point,” said an official from the prosecution, without specifying an exact date.A special committee for the parliamentary inquiry summoned Choi and Chung as witnesses for questioning at the second hearing to be held on Dec. 7 at the National Assembly in Seoul.But it remains to be seen whether she will accept the call, as her lawyer Lee Kyung-jae, who is also representing Choi, said Wednesday that Chung would only return to Korea when the prosecution formally calls her in for questioning. The prosecution has brought in several ranking officials from the university, including the university’s former President Choi Kyung-hee and admissions chief Namgung Kon, on charges of obstructing business. It raided the school on Nov. 22. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education said Thursday it would suspend financial support for Ewha Womans University for its irregularities surrounding the admissions process.The ministry has provided select universities with state budget funds to help improve their university admission systems. Ewha, which won the project for three straight years dating to 2014, received about 700 million won  this year. The money will be withdrawn and the school will be excluded from the financial aid next year. Ewha Womans University had already won eight of nine state-funded projects, which critics say could be a result of the school giving special favors to Chung. But the Education Ministry’s inspection could not confirm the links.

Some of them have gone viral. A screen capture of a parody Facebook account for Choi Soon-silThousands of internet users have shared fake posts and photos from these accounts, lauding them for their satirical value.Kim Jin, 29, searched for Chung Yoo-ra’s name on Facebook and sent her a friend request out of curiosity. He said he finds the phenomenon a new way of expression. “Choi and Chung are the hottest figures in South Korea’s history right now. Although I know that I’m being fooled by those fake accounts, the fact that I can directly comment on a public enemy makes me feel better and also helps me relieve stress,” said Kim. On one of the Facebook accounts under the name of Choi Soon-sil, the account shows Choi’s portrait as the profile photo. For the cover photo, it was set to a photo taken in 1979 when Choi was spotted escorting President Park at a political event for university students at Hanyang University in Seoul.Under that 1979 photo, some angry online users left insulting comments that read: “Is this when you thought you could control this country?” “You should disappear from this planet” and “You and your daughter Chung should spend your entire life in prison,” among others.A screen capture of a parody Facebook account for Choi Soon-silPeople liked the post that read “I’m sorry for what I did” over 100,000 times, which was apparently written by a fake account operator under Choi’s name.Choi Jin-bong, professor of media communications at SungKongHoe University, said, “while debates are now actively taking place on online platforms such as social media, many online users are relieving their stress and expressing their opinions or feelings of loss toward parody accounts of those figures.”“However, there are some issues regarding illegal use of someone’s name, which may lead to a libel suit for defamation,” he added.

It was the first time that the president attended an event outside Cheong Wa Dae since the Choi Soon-sil scandal broke out in late October. Either way, it remains that the country will be facing an earlier-than-planned presidential election in mid-2017.With the scandal leaving a power vacuum expected to persist for several more months, public offices are shelving policy decisions, especially those that require presidential approval or guidelines.Among those deferring their activities most are key policymakers in the Cabinet and the presidential secretariat, most of whom are unlikely to be replaced for a while.Among the top positions is that of finance minister. Yim Jong-yong, chairman of the Financial Services Commission was tapped for the given job on Nov. 2 but yet remains a nominee as the National Assembly has not held the required confirmation hearing.Incumbent Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho continues to hold the post, which doubles as Deputy Prime Minister, but there is widespread skepticism about his power to fully manage the nation’s faltering economy.“I shall make sure to carry forward next year’s economic policies in a consistent manner, without vacuum,” Yoo said Wednesday in a meeting with economy-related ministers.During the meeting, the finance chief also warned about the recent contraction of consumer and investor sentiment, triggered by the domestic political scandals and the growing external uncertainties following the US presidential election last month.Another Cabinet post waiting to be filled is that of justice minister, which remains vacant since Kim Hyun-woong resigned early last week over the prosecution’s investigation into the Choi Soon-sil corruption scandal. His resignation was shelved for a week, until the president accepted it this week in a reluctant move.Though the Blue House repeatedly denied it, the departure of the justice minister, who is also the top chief of the prosecution, was largely taken as a sign of disobedience against the president. Park is accused of a number of irregularities -- which the public and opposition see as reason enough for impeachment.“My decision to resign came after careful consideration on what is right for the nation and the people,” Kim said in his farewell speech.He also quoted an idiom saying that “when a leader fails to demonstrate faith, the people will drop out in agitation,” a phrase taken as indicating his antipathy toward the disgraced president. President Park addresses the nation this week. Even the ministries with their respective chiefs at posts are facing a sudden halt or change in their landmark projects.An example is the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s series of policies to nurture the biomedical and health care industries, which has lost momentum amid the rampant suspicion that President Park and her disputed confidante Choi Soon-sil covertly received illegal stem cell injections and other cosmetic surgeries.It was also suggested that the medical care center alleged to have performed the treatment received undue payments.While the domestic economic sectors are in turmoil, concerns also rose on exterior factors, especially the military threat of North Korea.Following the United Nations Security Council‘s decision Wednesday to impose a new package of restrictive measures on the reclusive state, the ministry said that it would announce additional sanctions Friday to further restrict on the North’s access to foreign currency.“ always tends to take a step beyond the UNSC resolution,” said Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, claiming that the upcoming sanction would deliver substantial damage to the nuclear-driven North.The escalating inter-Korean tension triggered the public’s anxiety that the domestic political row evolving around President Park may seriously impede on the nation‘s defense and foreign affairs management.Meanwhile, the public enmity against the president persisted, with a majority still supporting impeachment, despite her recent offer to cut her term short and to follow the parliament’s decision on the timeline and procedure of departure.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter after Park’s Tuesday address, 75.3 percent of the respondents said that they wanted Park’s ouster, down 4.2 percentage points from the previous week.Also, civic groups leading the Saturday candlelight protests to demand Park’s ouster have recently expanded their course of action to weekday rallies, as well as mass walkouts and legal charges against conglomerates involved in the extensive corruption scandal.By Bae Hyun-jung","scandal paralyzes government while ,politics sunk into stalemate ,scandal paralyzes government ,paralyzes government while political ,between the embattled president","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.84011984  0.35140872

""We hope the National Assembly will swiftly hold discussions ,"" Jung Youn-kun, presidential spokesman, told reporters.Despite Park's call for the legislature to determine her fate, opposition parties have dug in their heels, vowing to close ranks and push for Park's impeachment. Yet, some lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party, who were initially in favor of impeachment, are now leaning towards Park's early resignation to pave the way for a stable government transition.In the morning, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, a former Saenuri head and prominent rival of Park within the party, held talks with Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, to try to close a gap between the two sides. But they failed to agree, as Kim expressed his intention to time Park's resignation for the end of April next year, while Choo said Park must step down by the end of January.","thursday urged parliament to ,on thursday urged parliament ,thursday urged parliament ,presidential office urges parliament ,hye will resign over","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.53559387  0.50675881

Cho, who has been in the US for training at an Army hospital in Texas, also said in a telephone interview that neither she nor other medical staff visited Park's residence on April 16, 2014, when the ferry disaster happened.Her remarks are in line with what another former presidential nurse, identified as retired Capt. Shin, said about what happened on that day. Shin said in a recent media interview that she performed her routine duties but didn't see the president that day.Asked whether Park usually received Botox wrinkle treatments or other cosmetic procedures, Cho said, ""Not that I know of."" She side-stepped questions about whether Park has usually received various nutritional injections or used outside medical facilities, citing confidentiality about patients.Rumors have persisted that Park might have undergone plastic surgery or other medical procedures on the day of the ferry disaster, which detractors allege could have led to her failure to properly cope with the sinking of the ferry Sewol that left more than 300 passengers dead or missing.The rumors came to the fore recently in the wake of a separate corruption scandal surrounding allegations that a long-time confidante of Park exercised huge influence over her and state affairs, and amassed ill-gotten wealth. Park has offered to step down over the scandal.","2014 former presidential nurse ,ex presidential nurse says ,presidential nurse says park ,presidential nurse said wednesday ,former presidential nurse","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Army', 'Cho', 'US', 'Army', 'Texas']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.48192832  0.44277981

Park Young-soo The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, runner-up People’s Party and progressive minority Justice Party on Tuesday recommended Park and Cho Seung-sik, another former senior prosecutor, as plausible figures to lead the independent counsel.Of the two, Park is said to be the pick of the People’s Party, especially its interim chief and senior lawmaker Rep.

A report for the parliamentary audit by the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office showed that Kim is being investigated for abusing his authority to have officials removed from their posts. This is suspected to have been related to the establishment of the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which are believed to have served as a cover for Park’s civilian friend Choi Soon-sil to siphon public funds. Former Senior Secretary Woo Byung-woo Kim, Park’s former right-hand man, is suspected of ordering then-Vice Culture Minister Kim Hee-bum to have six high-ranking ministry officials resign from their posts in 2014. Former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong alleged that this may have been related to the ministry’s extraordinarily fast approval of the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which are believed to have been established as a cover for Park’s civilian friend Choi Soon-sil to siphon public funds. Choi, the key figure in the scandal, is accused of using her relationship with the president to interfere in government personnel decisions and embezzle money via the two nonprofit organizations. Choi and Park’s former Senior Secretary An Chong-bum have been indicted on charges of abusing authority, coercion and attempted fraud in relation to the establishment of the Mir and K-Sports foundations, which received some 77.4 billion won  of donations from local companies. Whether Kim and Choi were acquainted before the scandal surfaced has been a topic of dispute, with Kim denying that he knew about Choi’s influence in the irregularities. “Call me incompetent or an idiot, but I had no idea that such a person  was behind Park to do these things,” Kim told local media Tuesday. Opposition lawmakers including Rep. Joo Seung-yong of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said this was unlikely, pointing out that Kim had been very close to Park and her father, former President Park Chung-hee. Former Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon Kim also denied having told Kim Chong -- a former vice culture minister -- to “look after” Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra, despite Kim Chong testifying so.Kim Chong is also under investigation for leaking classified governmental documents to Choi for her financial gains. The report to the parliamentary inquiry revealed that the former vice minister also pressured Samsung Electronics to donate 1.6 billion won to the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, an organization established by Choi’s niece Jang Si-ho.Investigators are checking if financial support provided by Samsung for Chung -- along with donations made by Samsung and other companies -- amounted to bribes for Park’s inner circles.With Park snubbing the prosecution’s request for a face-to-face interview, the prosecution has said that it will be realistically difficult for them to bring bribery charges against the president. The president has been formally accused of being an accomplice to Choi and An on establishing the Mir and K-Sports foundations, along with conspiring with her former aide Jeong Ho-Seong to leakpresidential documents to Choi.Investigation of the bribery charges against Park is expected to be done by independent counsel Park Young-soo, former chief of Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office. He was nominated by the opposition coalition Tuesday and appointed by Park on Wednesday.President Park had vowed to “actively cooperate” with the independent counsel and expressed hopes that the investigation would get to the bottom of Choi scandal, according to Cheong Wa Dae Spokesperson Jung Youn-kukUpon its launch, the independent counsel is given 20 days of preparation, followed by 70 days of investigation and a 30-day extension if necessary. As the bipartisan agreement states that it is possible to work on the case during the preparation period, it is possible for Park Young-soo to conduct up to 120 days of investigation.During her public address Tuesday, the president effectively denied the charges against her by saying that she believed the acts related to Choi -- such as establishing the two foundations -- were “for the good of the country.”“The special investigative team will continue to investigate in parallel to the independent counsel, and we can possibly cooperate as well,” said an official from the prosecution’s special investigative team.Civic groups and the opposition have also called for the independent counsel to investigate what the president did on the day of the tragic 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol that left 304 dead or missing. Starting from when she first received a report on the accident on the day, she did not make a physical appearance for seven hours, sparking rumors and suspicions about what she had been doing during one of the worst maritime disasters in the country’s history.Vice Justice Minister Lee Chang-jae told the parliament Wednesday that he believes that the independent counsel will review the case.By Yoon Min-sik","former presidential aides probed ,choi scandal the prosecution ,prosecution is investigating president ,presidential aides probed ,corruption scandal involving park","['Park Geun', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park', 'the Ministry of Justice', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.13859929  0.14181249

A special committee for the parliamentary inquiry held its first hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul, broadcast live on TV, with the attendance of witnesses from four governmental institutions -- the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Justice Ministry, Health Ministry and National Pension Service. Three witnesses from the prosecution, including Kim Soo-nam, chief of the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, refused to appear, citing an ongoing prosecutorial investigation into the scandal. Opposition lawmakers strongly denounced their failure to appear, which led to a 20-minute suspension of the morning session. A parliamentary special committee for the inquiry into the Choi Soon-sil scandal holds its first hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. In the highlights of Wednesday’s hearing, Vice Justice Minister Lee Chang-jae denied the existence of a recorded phone conservation in which President Park referred to Choi Soon-sil, her confidante accused of meddling in government affairs, as “teacher,” which in Korea is used as an honorific for a respected or higher-authority figure.   Media reports have claimed that a mobile phone of Jeong Ho-seong, Park’s long serving aide now arrested for his involvement in the scandal, was found to have contained many recordings of phone conservations between him and the president, and him and Choi.“In my knowledge, there is no audio recording ,” Lee said. Lawmakers requested the ministry to submit any recordings found on Jeong’s phone.Asked about the president’s possible arrest after resignation, the official refrained from answering, but reiterated that Park is an accomplice to Choi, Jeong and others in several crimes. “Prosecutors stated the president  in the arraignment, because there were enough reasons to do so,” he said.  The president, in her third national address Tuesday, denied allegations of corruption and abuse of power, insisting she only meant to do good to the nation. The inquiry began amid a pivotal week of political maneuverings in South Korea that could possible culminate in an impeachment vote against Park on Friday. The president Tuesday offered to cut her term short, asking the parliament to suggest the time frame and legal procedures for her early departure from office. Opposition parties, calling it a ploy to avoid the imminent impeachment, officially rejected the offer and vowed to impeach her. The parliamentary inquiry committee will convene for a second hearing on Dec. 5, which will be followed by crucial sessions on Dec. 6-7 during which the lawmakers will question the heads of big business groups as well as figures at the center of the fiasco -- Choi and her associates. Choi’s attorney, however, said Wednesday it has not yet been decided whether she will attend the hearing. Choi is currently under arrest.

As the three opposition parties and liberal independents currently constitute 172 out of the 300 parliamentary seats, support from at least 28 ruling party members is needed to get the vote to pass.They can either provide the final push needed to force the president out of her seat, or dampen the initiative altogether -- the latter scenario involving them leaning toward the idea of Park’s gradual, voluntary resignation.Saenuri Party lawmakers supportive of the ousting of President Park Geun-hye attend an emergency meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the day after President Park’s offer to leave the fate of her presidency to the National Assembly, the Saenuri’s reformative group, often referred to by local media as the “non-Park faction,” reconfirmed its earlier plan to join the opposition in seeking impeachment.But it also left some room for the embattled president to step down voluntarily, kindling concerns from opposition parties that the impeachment bill could falter at the last minute.“Yesterday, the media seemed to think that the emergency committee  took a step backward  but this is not true,” said Rep. Hwang Young-cheul, speaking for the non-Park group.“Despite the speculated impact on the impeachment quorum, our stance  has become even stronger today.”On the previous day, Park had said that she would let the National Assembly decide the fate of her presidency.“I shall lay my course of action, including a curtailment of my presidential term, to the decision of the National Assembly,” she had said in an unheralded address to the nation.“Should the political circles suggest a way in which I may hand over power so as to minimize chaos and a vacuum in state affairs, I shall step down from the presidency according to the given time line and legal procedure.”This was her third official statement since the allegations broke out in late October that her confidante Choi Soon-sil had extensively meddled in key state affairs and taken undue profits.While confirming its ongoing drive for impeachment, the non-Park group also suggested a scenario for the president’s voluntary renunciation of power.“The president should set a clear time limit of her resignation in order to prove the sincerity ,” Rep. Hwang said.“We consider late April  to be the most suitable time , as several of the party’s senior advisers suggested recently.”Before Park makes her official exit, she should also hand over all practical power to a legislature-selected prime minister, so as to minimize the vacuum in state affairs, Hwang added.The non-Park figures’ statement was thus seen as indicating two key stances -- that they did not accept the president’s buck-passing and that they still wished to prioritize a peaceful resignation, if possible, over a forceful impeachment.Put on edge by the changeability of this group, opposition leaders poured out remarks on Wednesday, urging them to uphold their support for impeachment.“It is the non-Park figures who hold the key for impeachment,” said Rep. Park Jie-won, interim chief of the runner-up People’s Party.He also used a stronger tone, warning that the non-Park lawmakers “may not survive,” unless the president is impeached and driven out of office.The Saenuri leadership, on the other hand, pushed the non-mainstreamers to call off their plan for impeachment.“The  leadership will step down, if the  emergency committee deactivates itself and withdraws  impeachment,” said Supreme Council member Rep. Cho Won-jin.“But should they move onto impeachment, the leadership may no longer resign.”Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, party chairman and ranking aide to President Park, had earlier said that he will step down early next year and give way to a new leadership, in a reluctant response to growing pressure for resignation.By Bae Hyun-jung","key to impeachment president ,to impeachment president ,to impeachment president park ,mps key to impeachment ,impeachment president park geun","['Park Geun - hye‘s', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39951724  0.32666126

The parliamentary probe kicked off earlier in the day, receiving reports from the ministries of culture and sports, justice, and health and welfare. The Supreme Prosecutors' Office and the National Pension Service were also included on Wednesday's report list. Kim, who served as the chief of staff from 2013 to 2015, is suspected of abusing his power to order the vice culture minister to dismiss six of its senior officials in October 2014. Three out of the six are known to have actually left office. He is also accused of overlooking, or even protecting, Choi Soon-sil, Park's longtime friend at the center of the scandal, to meddle in state affairs. Choi, indicted earlier this month, holds no official government post nor has any policy experience. Woo is also under the prosecution's investigation on charges of dereliction of duty over suspicions he overlooked Choi's alleged irregularities while serving as the senior presidential secretary.","scandal two former presidential ,peddling scandal surrounding president ,two former presidential secretaries ,scandal surrounding president ,former presidential secretaries","['Park Geun', 'the Ministry of Justice', ""the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Woo Byung - woo']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.60018182  0.13833682

The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and the runner-up People’s Party accused the president of not giving a specific timeline for her resignation to deflect the people’s attention away from the impeachment process. In a speech earlier in the day, the president asked the National Assembly to decide the fate of her presidency, but did not specify when she would leave her post. Park said that she would follow whatever process the legislative body comes up with to ensure a smooth transfer of power.“In short, it is a tactic to distract and avoid impeachment,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, during a general assembly with her fellow lawmakers. “We remain united as one and will continue to push for impeaching her.”Likening Park’s speech as a “declaration of war” against the people, Choo went on to attack the president for refusing to acknowledge any wrongdoing in the nepotism scandal ensnaring her and her confidante Choi Soon-sil.In a five-minute press conference without any Q&A; session, President Park reiterated that she has never sought personal gains during her presidency. Refusing to respond to reporters’ questions about her involvement with the scandal, she said she would hold a separate session later on. People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won called Park “irresponsible,” saying that the president has engineered a plot to undermine the public and legislative efforts to remove her from office. “It seems to me that Park doesn’t have any sense of conscience. Her actions are so politically motivated,” interim leader Park Jie-won told reporters. “It’s like getting hit by the president with a sledgehammer. I can guarantee that the president will never resign.”The opposition bloc’s response came as the National Assembly inches closer to passing an impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye this Friday. The main opposition Democratic Party and runner-up People’s Party have tentatively agreed to approve the motion during Friday’s plenary session.By Yeo Jun-suk","opposition opposition parties tuesday ,commitment to impeaching president ,impeaching president park geun ,the looming parliamentary impeachment ,to impeaching president park","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37340286  0.31062287

127,127,Park calls on parliament to decide her resignation,"President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday said that she would let the National Assembly decide the fate of her presidency.  “I shall lay my course of action, including a curtailment of my presidential term, to the decision of the National Assembly,” Park said in an address to the nation.“Should the political circles suggest a way in which I may hand over power so as to minimize chaos and the vacuum in state affairs, I s...","President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday said that she would let the National Assembly decide the fate of her presidency.  “I shall lay my course of action, including a curtailment of my presidential term, to the decision of the National Assembly,” Park said in an address to the nation.“Should the political circles suggest a way in which I may hand over power so as to minimize chaos and the vacuum in state affairs, I shall step down from the presidency according to the given time line and legal procedure.”Park’s term as the nation’s 18th president is until February 2018. By suggesting a reduced presidential term and not resignation, Park seems to be calling for a revision to the Constitution, which currently states a single presidential term as five years. Talks on altering this system to a four-year double-term have been ongoing within political circles, to promote continuity in state affairs. Park bows as she finishes her address. The presidential address, which came with little advance notice, was the third of its kind since the extensive influence-peddling scandal revolving around her confidante Choi Soon-sil broke out in late October.In her last two speeches, Park apologized for causing public discontent but neither admitted her intentional involvement nor offered to step down from power.Park’s statement Tuesday came amid escalating political moves for her impeachment, just days ahead of the parliament’s anticipated vote on a presidential impeachment bill which may legally force Park out of her elected post.It also followed growing calls for her resignation from the public and opposition circles, as reflected by the record-breaking nationwide candlelight rally held over the weekend, an event said to have gathered over 1.9 million participants demanding Park’s ouster.“I have now laid down everything,” the president said. “All I hope for is for the Republic of Korea to break away from this confusion and get back on track.”Though she passed on the decision to the legislature, Park was seen as leaning toward the concept of an “orderly withdrawal,“ which suggests that the president should first confirm her renunciation of power, establish an interim administration and then prepare to step down.Earlier suggested by opposition parties and later fielded by a number of ruling party members as well, this was considered a valid alternative to the president’s immediate ouster, which is likely to cause chaos in state affairs.It was also deemed the only way for the beleaguered president to gesture at voluntary resignation, amid the ever-growing public calls for her withdrawal and the prosecution’s ongoing investigation.With such considerations, the ruling Saenuri Party’s leading figures considered to be loyalists to Park had asked Monday that the president bow out “for the sake of the country and herself.”Also, on Tuesday morning, shortly before Cheong Wa Dae confirmed the urgent presidential address, the party’s first-termers -- most of them classified as pro-Park members -- announced that Park should choose to “resign in an orderly manner.”Despite such voices from the pro-Park cluster, not to mention the vow by other political figures to participate in the opposition-led impeachment, the Blue House continued its silence, only claiming to be “all ears to all opinions.” Park says she will ask parliament to decide on cutting down her term in office. But this moderate tone, clearly differentiated from its stern denial so far, triggered speculations that the president was weighing the “advice” of her loyalists.Throughout the snowballing allegations that she was actively involved behind Choi’s corruption, Park has expressed disapproval -- though not explicitly -- over the escalating calls for her resignation.When the special probe team listed her as accomplice in her aides’ irregularities, the Blue House vowed to stop all cooperation with the prosecution, alluding that Park would rather face an independent counsel or even impeachment.“We would rather settle these disputes through a legitimate procedure which may clearly discern the president’s liability,” said Park’s spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk on Nov. 20.The spokesman also said repeatedly that “there is yet nothing for the president to decide” as the related investigation is under way, implying that none of Park’s allegations have been proven.In her address, Park reiterated her “innocence” in the series of corruption and influence-peddling charges involving not only Choi but a number of former ranking presidential officials.“Ever since I started politics back in 1998, up to this very moment as president, I have made every effort for the sake of the nation and of the people,” she said.“Not for a moment have I promoted my own personal interests but only worked for what I believed to be public businesses for the state.”She only admitted to having “failed to properly manage” those around her, vowing to offer further explanations on the Choi scandal soon in a separate address. Once again, she withdrew after her speech, without taking questions from the press.By Bae Hyun-jung","decide her resignation president ,her resignation president park ,her resignation president ,to decide her resignation ,resignation president park geun","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54992336  0.60003746

Kim was the chief supervisor for the prosecutorial organization and Choi the chief official for the president’s legal affairs.The two were even rumored to have received pressure to deter the prosecution’s aggressive probe. The presidential office, however, kept silence over the prosecutorial probe issue, only referring to its earlier statement that the president would rather face an independent counsel that is “politically neutral.”“The president’s stance on the independent counsel remains unchanged,” the spokesman said.On Thursday, the president approved a bill to launch an independent counsel investigation on herself and her friend Choi, and officially requested that the opposition political parties recommend two candidates to lead this incoming probe unit.Once the president chooses between the two, a special investigation is to kick off and substitute the current prosecutorial probe.“Once the independent counsel chief is picked, it is likely that the prosecution’s special probe team may be dismissed right away, handing over the related documents and dispatching some of its key investigators to the incoming team,” said a prosecution official.The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and the runner-up People’s Party agreed earlier to submit their candidate resignation as late as possible -- Tuesday -- so as to buy some time for the ongoing probe.With no signs of cooperation from the Blue House, the opposition parties are set to make their final selection for the candidates, but they are said to be facing obstacles, due to the refusals of the candidates. A number of former senior prosecutors, especially those from the progressive-leaning Honam region in the southwest of the nation, have so far been tapped as plausible figures for the job but most have turned down the offers. “ do not mind being named as minister candidates, but when it comes to an independent counsel, most do not wish to have their names mentioned,” Democratic Party floor leader Rep.

Cha Eun-taek According to prosecutors, Cha apparently used his network to coerce a small advertising agency, which acquired POSCO's in-house ad firm Poreka, into relinquishing its shares to Cha's new company.When Cha was trying to take over Poreka, Park apparently ordered An Chong-bum, former senior presidential secretary under arrest for his role in the scandal, to ensure Poreka wouldn't be picked up by a major corporation instead.After his takeover attempt failed, Cha teamed up with Choi to found another ad firm, Playground Communications, with an objective of cornering the ad market for major conglomerates.Prosecutors alleged that Park ordered An to contact telecom giant KT and tell its leadership to hire acquaintances of Cha's and Choi's as advertising executives.With friendly faces in key positions, Playground won ad contracts for KT worth 6.8 billion won  between March and August this year, and helped Cha net some 510 million won in profits, according to prosecutors.In addition, Cha is also suspected of having embezzled millions at another of his ad firms, Africa Pictures, to pay off personal debts and finance his child's overseas education.Kim Jong-min, Cha's attorney, later told reporters that his client met with former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon at the latter's residence.The attorney said the meeting, which took place around June or July 2014, was arranged by Choi, and lasted for about 10 minutes.Also present at the meeting were Kim Chong, the former vice minister of culture, sports and tourism who's been arrested in the scandal, and Chung Sung-keun, the then culture minister nominee.In earlier interviews, Kim Ki-choon had claimed that he didn't know anything about Choi and her involvement in state affairs.Cha's attorney also said Cha once played a round of golf with Choi and the mother-in-law of Woo Byung-woo, former presidential secretary for civil affairs under investigation for his role in the scandal.Kim Jong-min said he wasn't aware of the exact nature of that meeting or what sort of conversations took place, but that he believed Choi had set up the round.Meanwhile, prosecutors said Park has yet to respond to their request for face-to-face questioning. They sent the request to Park's attorney, Yoo Yeong-ha, last Wednesday.Park, recently dubbed by prosecutors as a key suspect in the scandal, is alleged to have directly or indirectly pressured major conglomerates into making donations to Choi's foundations, which legal experts say could constitute an abuse of authority.","peddling scandal involving president ,indicted sunday on charges ,authority to embezzlement prosecutors ,scandal faces trial over ,peddling scandal faces trial","['Park Geun', 'Cha Eun - taek', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Cha Eun - t']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.24220495  0.21577264

Similar protests will be staged at major cities around the country.While previous protests ended peacefully, police said they will deploy some 25,000 officers to guard against any eventualities.The rally marks the fifth of its kind after the outbreak of the scandal in which Choi Soon-sil, who has been Park's friend for more than 40 years, is suspected of exerting influence on state affairs despite holding no official position in the incumbent administration.  Protesters approach within 200 meters of the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Nov. 26, to call for President Park Geun-hye's resignation. A rising number of South Koreans have been expressing anger over allegations that Choi exerted influence in the business, cultural and sports areas.Reflecting the sentiment, Gallup Korea said Park's approval rating fell to another record-low level of 4 percent this week, down 1 percentage point from a week earlier.Local observers said more participants will join the latest protest after prosecutors claimed Park was complicit in the scandal, which led opposition parties to officially seek the president's impeachment. The main opposition Democratic Party said it will put the motion up for vote no later than Dec. 9.Park's attorney rejected the prosecution's investigation results, claiming prosecutors lacked ""fairness and credibility"" and even hinted at political bias. The presidential office blasted the allegations raised by prosecutors as being based on wishful thinking with no basis in fact and said Park will not accept questioning.As the successful passage of the motion calls for support from at least 200 lawmakers, the opposition bloc needs to persuade 28 members from the Saenuri party to support it. Pundits said the figure seems plausible, considering some 40 lawmakers of the ruling party are anticipated to join the move.Once the motion is passed, the Constitutional Court will review the case. It took 63 days for the court to dismiss the impeachment motion against late former President Roh Moo-hyun.Next week, the parliament will kick off the parliamentary investigation of the scandal separately from the prosecutors'probe, starting by questioning the cultural and justice ministries.It will also investigate the presidential office and other organizations later in December.The parliament's special committee carrying out the parliamentary investigation said it has decided to call in major business leaders, including Samsung Group's heir-apparent Lee Jae-yong, along with the heads of LG Group, Hyundai Motor Group and SK Group in December.Local conglomerates were reportedly requested to chip in for the establishment of the Mir Foundation and the K-Sports Foundation, with allegations indicating that Choi tried to siphon off money from these entities. Samsung is also suspected of providing favors to Choi's daughter.","steps to impeach president ,protests intensify as parliament ,central seoul on saturday ,early december local police ,to impeach president park","['Seoul', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38931432 -0.21476489

Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is related to establishment of the two organizations, is believed to have embezzled some or all of the money, which totaled $77.4 billion won .Some companies have also received requests for additional donations, such as SK and Lotte, who were asked respectively to donate an extra 8 billion won and 7.5 billion won after heads of the companies had a private meeting with Park. Choi and former presidential secretary An Chong-bum have been indicted on charges of abusing their authority during the establishment of the two organizations. The prosecution recently added bribery to the charges against the pair. Prosecutor General Kim Soo-nam enters the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul on Friday. YonhapThe focus of the prosecution’s investigation has recently been to link the bribery charges to Park herself. The prosecution had specified Park as an accomplice to Choi and An, making it likely that any proven bribery will be traced back to the president.Prosecutor General Kim Soo-nam has reportedly led the active investigation into Park’s inner circle, with sources saying that he suggested that they include bribery charges for Choi and An.As of Friday, investigators raided the offices of Lotte and SK, along with those of Samsung Group and the National Pension Service, related to allegations of corruption related to Park.Prosecutors are looking into suspicion that the president pressured the NPS to back the merger of Samsung C&T; with Cheil Industries. The NPS holds shares in both companies. Samsung is believed to have provided sizeable support for Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra, while being the biggest benefactor of the Mir and K-Sports foundations.There has been suspicion that such actions by the NPS have been in return for Samsung’s financial support. Chung was illegally admitted to Ewha Womans University, and received unlawful favors during her middle, high school and college years, according to an Education Ministry investigation. Government offices including the Finance Ministry have also been raided, with the prosecution looking for evidence of “illegal solicitation.” Proving that the donations were solicitation, not a result of coercion, is the key to proving that they were actually bribes.Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho declined to comment on the raid, saying it was “not yet time to say something.”Although the prosecution said it would continue to request a face-to-face interview with Park, she has vowed not to cooperate with its investigation. The ball now appears to be in the court of an independent counsel, which is expected to start an investigation into the scandal early next month. “Our consistent stance has been to try our best in the investigation until the day we hand over the case to the independent counsel,” an official from the prosecution said. Between the snowballing scandal and Park’s approval rating falling to a new low of 4 percent -- according to Gallup Korea -- the bribery charges are expected to all but confirm the prospect of Park’s impeachment. The National Assembly’s previous attempt to impeach a president -- ex-President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 -- had failed after nationwide protests against the move. But in the process, the Constitutional ruling effectively outlined the criteria for a president’s impeachment as “an act of corruption by abusing one’s power and position, such as receiving bribes or embezzling public funds.” Adding bribery charges will also allow a harsher punishment on the accused. The major charges against the suspects in the scandal currently is abuse of authority, the maximum penalty for which is five years in prison.But the punishment for bribery -- for sums of 100 million won or more -- starts with 10 years in prison and peaks at lifetime imprisonment.By Yoon Min-sik","korean prosecutors on friday ,bribery charges south korean ,prove park bribery charges ,park bribery charges south ,park bribery charges","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'SK Group']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.19735548  0.32188445

Prosecutors also suspect that he pressured Daewoo Shipbuilding into investing in a local biotech firm run by his friend in return for overlooking irregularities committed by then head of the shipyard Nam Sang-tae.The KDB is the largest shareholder of the financially troubled shipbuilder.Daewoo Shipbuilding decided to provide 5.5 billion won  for the biotech firm's research project in 2012 and actually transacted some 4.4 billion won until 2013, but the funding ended after Kang stepped down as KDB chief, according to prosecutors.The prosecution sought a warrant to formally arrest him in late September, but the request was declined by a judge who said Kang's major crime allegations are still disputable.Prosecutors are expected to file for the warrant again after the interrogation.  Kang's alleged irregularities emerged after prosecutors launched a full-fledged investigation into the shipyard earlier this year.Daewoo Shipbuilding is one of the country's big three shipbuilders that have been implementing drastic self-rescue programs, including asset sales and workforce reduction, in order to tide over a protracted slump and cut costs.Earlier this year, the shipyard said it had much larger losses in 2013 and 2014 than earlier reported, citing accounting mishaps.The Board of Audit and Inspection, the country's state audit agency, has said the shipyard is suspected of rigging its books to hide up to 1.5 trillion won in losses during the period.Its former chief Nam as well as his successor Ko Jae-ho are currently on trial over a string of corruption allegations.","over bribery allegations prosecutors ,prosecutors on friday questioned ,again over bribery allegations ,bribery allegations prosecutors ,bribery allegations prosecutors on","['Korea Development Bank', 'KDB', 'Kang Man - soo', 'Daewoo Shipbuildi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43517432  0.46827832

The previous record was 6 percent held by late former President Kim Young-sam who ruled the country between 1993-1998.South Korea's three opposition parties, as well as some lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party are currently preparing for an impeachment motion against Park over the scandal involving her and confidante Choi Soon-sil, who exerted significant influence on state affairs without holding a government position.By age group, Park's supporters were non-existent in South Koreans in their 20s and 30s. The approval rating stood at 9 percent among those aged 60 and older, the data also showed.In 2013, Park's approval rating hovered around 40 percent, and gradually increased to reach a peak at 67 percent in September that year.But Park's standing started to tumble after the general election in April this year, falling to the 29-34 percent level, and began to plunge in October following the outbreak of the scandal.Gallup Korea said Saenuri's approval rating also reached a record-low of 12 percent by dropping 3 percentage points on-week, falling behind the minor People's Party that posted 16 percent. The main opposition Democratic Party posted 34 percent, up 3 percentage points on-week.","amid impeachment bid president ,park approval rating dips ,impeachment bid president park ,impeachment bid president ,approval rating dips further","['Park Geun', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51004773  0.29166293

""It comes amid heightened anxieties in South Korea caused by the United States' transition to a Donald J. Trump presidency and North Korea's push to develop a long-range nuclear strike capability,"" he said.As the opposition-controlled National Assembly is intent on paralyzing government functions as a message to Park that her decisions no longer carry legitimacy, the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense  system will now encounter heightened opposition, Snyder said.""Park's impeachment or resignation would generate intense debate in the National Assembly.

But opposition parties have strongly opposed the decision, arguing that the system isn't effective in defending against the North and its deployment would only seriously sour relations with China.China has called for scrapping the decision, seeing THAAD, especially its powerful ""X-band"" radar as a threat to its nuclear deterrent and other security interests, despite repeated assurances from Washington that the system is designed only to defend against the North.","massive corruption scandal threatening ,the massive corruption scandal ,unseat south korean president ,massive corruption scandal ,scandal threatening to unseat","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'US', 'US', 'Choi Soon - il']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.25710261  0.55596298

In 2004, the National Assembly voted to impeach late former President Roh Moon-hyun, which was later turned down by the Constitutional Court.Currently 172 opposition and independent lawmakers are expected to support the proposal. The number could increase if some Saenuri members join.Later in the day, the three opposition parties, along with the smaller People's Party and the Justice Party, agreed to cooperate in drawing up a motion to impeach the president and put it to a vote with the parliamentary session that ends on Dec. 9, according to a spokesperson of the Democratic Party.For the impeachment motion to pass the Assembly, it needs support from at least 28 Saenuri lawmakers. Thirty-two lawmakers from Saenuri have already expressed their support. But pundits do not rule out the possibility some opposition lawmakers may vote against it.Once the motion is passed, it will be adjudicated by the Constitutional Court, which experts estimate may take some three to four months. The factional feud in Saenuri has been escalating over whether ruling party lawmakers should join the impeachment bid.Saenuri head Lee Jung-hyun warned Thursday that the party cannot become a ""betrayer"" of Park. He added that the impeachment will further increase uncertainty and risks for the country.Observers said Saenuri may be on the path to breakup, especially as its former head Kim Moo-sung declared his support for the impeachment on Wednesday.Later on Thursday, a group of 158 lawmakers, including 32 from Saenuri, announced a draft resolution calling for the National Assembly to come up with measures to have the president step down in an ""orderly"" manner and fill the government vacuum, which exposes the country to increasing risks. They also called on the speaker to convene a special session involving all legislators to discuss the solution to the current crisis, before the impeachment motion is put to a vote. Pundits said such a plenary session can also help draw 200 lawmakers, which is needed to pass the motion, to the floor.","motion to impeach president ,democratic party said thursday ,put impeachment to vote ,to impeach president park ,to impeach president","[""South Korea 's"", 'Democratic Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Woo Sang - ho']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.25530216  0.261033

Their moves were largely taken as a sign of insubordination to the embattled state chief. They were also seen as indicating a divide within the Blue House, especially since presidential adviser Choi had only been in his post for less than a month, having been named on Oct. 30 and receiving his letter of appointment last Friday.“ has not yet accepted their resignations,” the spokesman added, claiming that the decision was for the president to make. Cheong Wa Dae. YonhapThe resignations of the two top officials are expected to pose a challenge to the Blue House’s response to the ongoing investigation, as Kim was the top supervisor for the prosecution and Choi the presidential chief for legal affairs.Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae continued to dodge the prosecution’s repeated calls for face-to-face questioning of the president.The previous day, the prosecutors had issued another ultimatum, demanding that Park show up for questioning by Nov. 29 at the latest.Their reinforced stance came in line with a seize and search operation by a special team affiliated with the senior presidential secretary’s office to find further evidence concerning former senior secretary Woo Byung-woo. Woo is currently under investigation for a separate set of corruption allegations, but investigators are said to be seeking to expand the probe to his involvement in the Choi case.“The attorney will answer ,” was the only response from Jung, when asked about the president’s plans concerning the prosecution’s calls.The president’s legal representative, Yoo Yeong-ha, had earlier pledged, following the prosecution’s decision to indict Park, that the president would no longer cooperate with the investigation.In contrast to her resistance against the prosecutorial probe, President Park gave her consent to letting the opposition recommend candidates for an independent counsel, adding momentum to preparations for the upcoming investigation.“President Park has signed the document, which will be delivered to the National Assembly within the day,” Jung said.Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun had on the previous day sent an official letter to the president, requesting that she ask the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and the runner-up People’s Party to pick two candidates to lead the counsel.Within five days of receiving the president’s signed letter, the parties have to recommend two candidates, among which Park is to make the final selection.The presidential house, meanwhile, refused to elaborate on the possibility of impeachment, an ongoing move led by opposition parties and with the participation of some members of the ruling Saenuri Party. Among the latter was Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the party’s former chairman and a once-anticipated presidential aspirant, who has vowed to give up his presidential candidacy and to take part in impeaching Park.“The National Assembly has not yet moved to that stage,” the spokesperson said.

Local polls released Thursday showed the outspoken politician ranked third among presidential hopefuls, behind the Democratic Party’s leader Moon Jae-in and the United Nation’s Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.  Seongnam City Mayor Lee Jae-myung For the first time in its survey of favored presidential candidates, pollster Realmeter put Lee at third place with an approval rating of 11.6 percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than that of centrist People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. “We believe that Mayor Lee’s trademark, clear political messages have resonated with the young voters,” said Jung Hyun-bok, a senior researcher at Seoul-based local pollster Time research, whose poll also showed Monday that Lee was the third favorite presidential hopeful, behind Moon and Ban. Lee has seen his popularity surge in proportion to the public anger mounting against the Choi scandal. In a poll conducted late in October when the scandal just broke out, Lee was the fifth favorite candidate and his approval rating stood at 5.9 percent – half of the current figure. Since being elected as Seongnam mayor in 2010, Lee, a former lawyer with an activist background, has been thrust into the limelight with his overhaul of the city’s financial debt, contentious welfare policies for young people and unapologetic rhetoric against conservative politicians. Throughout his tenure, Lee has driven budget cutbacks and anti-corruption efforts to pay down debts he inherited from his predecessor. In 2014, he announced that the city repaid 520 billion won  of debt, on which he declared moratorium in 2010.But Lee’s liberal-leaning welfare policies and political views have drawn mixed response across the political spectrum. His supporters and progressive voters hail him as a reformist politician, but some conservative and moderate voters dismiss him as a populist. “Given that the current political dynamic is so flexible, we have to wait and see whether Lee can continue to capitalize on the political momentum created by the Choi scandal,” Jung said.

On Sunday, the prosecution cited Park as an accomplice in a string of the alleged wrongdoings involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil and two key former aides.Cheong Wa Dae has dismissed the prosecution's accusations against Park, saying the allegations are politically biased and a mixture of ""imagination and conjecture."" It has vowed to establish Park's ""innocence"" through the upcoming independent counsel probe.Park faces allegations that she played a role in pressuring local conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit organizations.

142,142,Park's actions warrant impeachment: scholars,"With President Park Geun-hye defying calls for her resignation over a nepotism scandal tied to her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil, opposition parties are campaigning for a parliamentary impeachment motion to remove Park from office.But the road to impeachment is fraught with many hurdles.

Not only do the lawmakers have to clear a strict threshold at the National Assembly to open a trial, they have to convince judges at the Constitutional Court that the case warrants her removal. Rep. Choo Mi-ae of the Democratic Party of Korea  YonhapConstitutional law scholars interviewed by The Korea Herald agreed that the president’s wrongdoing -- most notably allowing Choi, without an official title, to meddle in state affairs -- could meet the legal standard for launching an impeachment case. “The president is subject to the impeachment process because she violated both the Constitution and other laws,” said Huh Young, professor emeritus at Kyung Hee University Law School and the first president of the Constitutional Research Institute for the Constitutional Court. “By consulting with Choi Soon-sil on important state affairs and following through on her instructions, she violated the Constitution. Her allegation prescribed in the prosecutors’ arraignment shows that she also breached other laws,” he said. The Clause 65 of the Constitution stipulates that a sitting president can be impeached if he or she is found to have breached the Constitution or other laws while performing their official duties. The prosecutors said earlier this week the president had played a significant role in helping Choi commit wrongdoings. Choi, a civilian who has never held public office, was indicted for extracting money from conglomerates and coercing some of them to give contracts to companies owned by herself or her associates. The scholars also noted that the president had violated key clauses in the Constitution designed to preserve democratic value, such as those stating that Korea is a democratic republic and its president is elected by the people.But the professors were divided as to whether the impeachment motion would clear the final hurdle at the Constitutional Court, in which at least six out of nine judges must approve it to remove the president from office. Local media label eight of them as conservatives.Lee Heon-hwan, a constitutional law professor at Ajou Univeristy Law School, said that if the judges have their decision clouded by the fact that they were appointed by the president, they may end up abandoning their obligation. Some worried the impeachment motion might not be compelling enough to convince the lawmakers during the process at the National Assembly. More than 200 lawmakers out of the 300-member National Assembly should approve the impeachment. That would require 29 votes coming from across the aisle. “Impeachment could be difficult if the special probe fails to yield a decisive evidence linking Park to corruption charges,” said Lim Ji-bong, professor at Sogang University Law School. “It is also unclear whether two-thirds of the National Assembly lawmakers would really cast their vote in a secret ballot.”Most scholars suggested the court would approve the motion for the sake of the country, but highlighted that the judges -- who had applied a strict standard on reviewing the impeachment -- would consider many factors playing into the decision-making process.One factor to consider is the public outrage over the president. They said that the more pressure mounts on the president through either a special probe’s investigation or massive rallies, the more likely the court would be to rule against the president. “It is hard to tell about the court’s ruling. My view is that the judges would watch the public sentiment carefully before they decide,” said Han Sang-hie, a professor at Konkuk University Law School.By Yeo Jun-suk","park actions warrant impeachment ,impeachment scholars with president ,campaigning for parliamentary impeachment ,actions warrant impeachment scholars ,resignation over nepotism scandal","['Park Geun', 'the National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2420845   0.243156

Her mother is currently indicted for her role in the influence-peddling and corruption scandal in which Park is a suspect.Earlier in the day, the prosecution raided Ewha Womans University, along with the home of its former chief Choi Kyung-hee, in regards to the school’s admission process in 2015, which supposedly showed favoritism to Chung.  The focus of the investigation is expected to be on whether there was outside pressure on the process, particularly from Cheong Wa Dae. “If Chung herself was directly involved in corruption allegations related to admission or grades, or if we  feel the need for investigation, we will summon Chung for questioning,” said an official from the prosecution.Chung Yoo-ra competes in the 2014 Asian Games The Education Ministry’s probe last week clarified that Chung, a professional dressage rider, had received favorable treatment in the admission process. The ministry had requested that the school cancel Chung’s admission. Ewha Womans University had revived the application process for dressage riders in 2015, the year Chung applied. Although regulations prohibit applicants from bringing their medals to admission interviews, Chung was allowed to show it to the interviewers. It was one that she had won at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games.She was also found to have received other benefits including getting grades for eight subjects without submitting any work and having a professor do a project for her.But the ministry stopped short of finding out who was responsible for giving the orders.Although the head of the admissions office told the ministry officials that she was instructed by then-university head Choi Kyung-hee to pick Chung, the ministry said it did not find related evidence.Education Minister Lee Jun-sik said that the ministry “did not see” if anyone of higher authority had influenced the process, pinpointing Choi and Chung as the ones responsible for the admission fraud.Given that the university has won some 18.5 billion won  worth of state projects each year since Chung’s admission, it has been alleged that the state funding was a trade-off for pandering to Park’s inner circle.Another aspect of the corruption scandal involving Chung was that the Korea Racing Authority’s recently established road map to support dressage prospects’ training for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was actually a plan exclusively designed for Chung. The plan -- jointly set up by the Korea Equestrian Federation -- involved an 18.6 billion won donation by Samsung Group. A former official of the KRA, Park Jae-hong, who was sent to Germany as part of the plan, told local media that the funds provided by Samsung were pocketed by the Choi family. Investigators are expected to question former KRA chief Hyun on why and how the organization came to establish the road map, and whether there was any deal with Samsung or Choi.Samsung is one of the local corporations who made an accumulated 77.4 billion won in donations to the nonprofit Mir and K-Sports foundations, which prosecutors believe were used for Choi’s personal gain. But the prosecution is investigating to see if the donations were actually bribes from the companies.After the prosecution named Park as a suspect in its criminal investigation, the president refused to comply with the probe. But the prosecution reiterated Tuesday that a face-to-face interview was necessary for the investigation, particularly concerning her private meeting with the heads of the seven biggest companies in the country. She is accused of coercing the companies into making the donations to the foundations.By Yoon Min-sik","daughter south korean prosecutors ,prosecutors on tuesday raided ,korean prosecutors on tuesday ,tuesday raided local university ,mother is currently indicted","['south korean', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Park Geun', 'Korea Racing Authority', 'Hyun Myung - kwan', 'Chung']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.56172907  0.28287548

Seoul-based Biostar has several bio ventures as affiliates that specialize in anti-aging and cell rejuvenation therapies using stem cells.

The now defunct RNL Bio, a unit of Biostar, shut down after a crackdown by health authorities on suspicion it conducted the unauthorized therapy on a select group of clients illegally.  Based on the testimony of the whistle-blower -- a former employee of RNL Bio, the report said Park was among the firm’s “secret VIP clients” whom the company tried to lobby to win legal authorization by secretly offering them free therapies. “ was cleared by the prosecution in 2011, which investigated allegations that it offered the authorized stem cell therapies to clients,” Biostar said.

The president's and admissions offices, as well as three homes of related officials, including that of former President Choi Kyung-hee, were included on the list of places searched, prosecutors said.The legal move came four days after the government announced that the school had given a string of illicit favors to Chung Yoo-ra, ranging from college admission to academic affairs, wrapping up its two-week special inspection.Chung is a former member of the national equestrian team and the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, who was indicted Sunday on charges of bullying local conglomerates in collaboration with President Park Geun-hye. Former aides of the president were also indicted over their involvement in the scandal.The Ministry of Education said a panel of professors allegedly ignored multiple school regulations to help Chung get admitted and the favorable treatment continued after she was accepted. Choi Kyung-hee, 54, resigned last month in the wake of growing criticism from the university students and faculty. Still, the ministry said the former head of the university has flatly denied all allegations that she directed the professors to give Chung special treatment.","tuesday raided local university ,prosecutors on tuesday raided ,raided local university suspected ,prosecutors raid university over ,scandal prosecutors on tuesday","['Park Geun', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.18916063  0.05645144

Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil and third-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae announced their decision to leave the party after the conservative party leadership, dominated by pro-Park loyalists, refused their demand to step down.  Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil  and third-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae, both affiliated with the ruling Saenuri Party, attend a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Nov. 22, to announce their decision to leave the party. ""A president who undermines the values of the Constitution and violates the law for the sake of personal interests does not deserve the mandate granted by the people,"" Nam, formerly a five-term lawmaker, said during a press meeting. Nam added that a party should not represent a certain group and the current situation calls for the establishment of an alternative party.Kim also said Park has disrupted the free-market order by extorting funds from conglomerates.Local conglomerates were reportedly requested to chip in for the establishment of the Mir Foundation and the K-Sports Foundation, with allegations indicating that Choi tried to siphon off money from these entities.Kim added that Saenuri currently remains unrepentant for the scandal, despite the public's claim that the ruling party cannot be detached from the scandal.Their defection reduced the number of Saenuri-affiliated administrative chiefs of metropolises and provinces to five and that of its lawmakers to 128.It marks the first time for high-profile members to bolt from the party since the influence-peddling scandal broke late last month. The prosecution implicated Park on Sunday as an accomplice in the massive corruption case centering on her confidante and aides. Political pundits said their actions may trigger a wave of defection from the party. Some lawmakers outside the pro-Park faction are discussing plans to leave the party and establish a separate parliamentary negotiation group, which requires at least 20 legislators, according to sources. Their move is expected to add ammunition to opposition parties' ongoing push to impeach Park.The passage of an impeachment motion needs to win the approval of at least 200 lawmakers of the 300-seat National Assembly. The Saenuri dissenters have demanded party leader Lee Jung-hyun and Supreme Council members resign for what they called a botched response to the scandal, stemming from their close ties with the beleaguered president. Lee refused to resign for now, citing his responsibility as leader to reunite and normalize the party.Choi Soon-sil, the prime suspect in the snowballing scandal, allegedly exerted influence on state affairs and enjoyed personal benefits based on her 40-year-old friendship with the president.","corruption scandal involving president ,quit saenuri amid scandal ,members quit south korea ,quit south korea ruling ,scandal involving president park","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'pro - park']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.12170663  0.29249421

The Seoul Central District Court issued a warrant to arrest Kim Chong, 55, on charges of abuse of authority and leaking official secrets, acknowledging the reason and necessity for the detention.According to prosecutors, Kim is suspected of pressuring Samsung Group between September 2015 and February this year to fund some 1.6 billion won  to the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, set up in June 2015 and controlled by Chang Si-ho.Chang is the niece of Choi Soon-sil, who was indicted Sunday on charges of collaborating with the president and former presidential aides to interfere in state affairs and peddle influence on the country's big business groups.The same court also issued a warrant to formally arrest Chang on the same day for allegedly collaborating with Kim in the process and embezzling some of the money. There have been allegations that the center was established for Choi and Chang to pocket profits amid the country's preparation for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.The center received 670 million won of funding from the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism last year, which is rare for a newly established corporation. Kim is suspected of having played a role in the decision.The former vice minister is also accused of leaking government secrets to Choi, who holds no governmental post nor has any policy experience, reporting on state affairs related to the culture and sports industries.In return, he allegedly asked Choi, suspected of having been a behind-the-scenes power broker in the current administration, to influence the posting of officials. Before being named vice minister in 2013, Kim was a professor in the department of sports industry at Seoul's Hanyang University.Kim is known to have wielded strong influence over the sports industry until he offered to resign late last month in the wake of the scandal.","conglomerate samsung to donate ,peddling scandal former vice ,formally arrested by prosecutors ,largest conglomerate samsung ,by prosecutors on monday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Samsung', ""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Kim Chong']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.1293696   0.21445644

The prosecutors said earlier in the day that the president was found to have played a key role in allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs -- such as leaking confidential documents and forcing conglomerates to donate money to the foundation run by Choi.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party speaks at a gathering of opposition presidential hopefuls at the National Assembly in Seoul on Sunday to discuss the political situation of South Korea. From left: Kim Boo-kyum, Moon Jae-in, Park Won-soon and Sim Sang-jeong. “We reaffirmed that the president’s violation of law is obvious and grave enough to make the case for impeaching her. We requested the National Assembly and opposition parties to discuss impeachment of Park,” the opposition politicians said in the statement. The eight politicians attending the meeting -- including Moon, Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon -- have been reluctant to impeach the president because they were concerned that the process would be too complicated and aggravate the public’s unease over political deadlock.To avoid such turmoil caused by the impeachment process, the liberal bigwigs decided to demand that the legislative body elect a new bipartisan prime minister and set up an interim Cabinet until the nation elects a new president next year. South Korea’s Constitution stipulates that the Assembly may impeach the president if they have proven to commit a “grave breach” of the Constitution and other laws while in office. Such violation includes the act that undermines democratic value such as the rule of law and betrays the public trust of the people by receiving bribery, said the Constitutional Court when they ruled the impeachment motion against the late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004. The measure requires two-thirds approval of the 300-strong National Assembly and nine-member Constitutional Court.The ruling Saenuri Party’s whip Rep. Chung Jin-suk said later in the day that he would agree to discuss the impeachment motion if the opposition bloc proposes it. For the motion to meet the two-thirds quorum at the Assembly, the opposition needs extra 29 votes from Saenuri members. Saenuri lawmakers critical of the president have rejected the calls for Park’s voluntary resignation, but appeared to support the impeachment process. They have noted that it is the only legitimate measure to hold the president liable for her wrongdoings. “Impeachment procedure is prescribed in the Constitution. Should the impeachment motion be proposed, we have to act in accordance with the Constitution. It is something that we cannot avoid,” Chung told reporters during press conference. Most opposition presidential hopefuls have been skeptical of pursing the impeachment process until the prosecutors described the president as an accomplice in their indictment against Choi Soon-sil and her aides for their involvement with the scandal. For example, Moon Jae-in said during the press conference on Tuesday that “it is not the time” to push for impeaching Park.

An Chong-bum, former senior secretary for policy coordination, was indicted on the same day for allegedly collaborating with Choi, it said. Jeong Ho-seong, who served as former senior secretary for private presidential affairs, will also stand trial on charges of handing over governmental and presidential documents to Choi. President Park Geun-hye is suspected of colluding with the three suspects in many of the allegations raised, according to the prosecution. Still, the prosecution said it cannot indict Park, citing the Constitution, which stipulates that the country's president is immune from indictment except in cases of insurrection or treason.Lee Young-ryeol, the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office who headed the team investigating the influence-peddling scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye and her confidante, announces the interim probe results during a press briefing at the prosecution's office in Seoul on Nov. 20.""Based on such judgment, the special probe team will continue investigating the president,"" said Lee Young-ryeol, the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, who heads the team.The indictment came as Park accelerated her resumption of state affairs, naming new vice ministers, despite calls for her to step down over the scandal.On Thursday, her attorney Yoo Yeong-ha effectively rejected prosecutors' repeated demand for her to undergo questioning over her possible role in the alleged irregularities before they press charges against Choi. Yoo said he will prepare for the interrogation so it can take place sometime this week.Park's approval rating remained at a record-low 5 percent last week, according to local pollster Gallup Korea, amid a series of anti-Park rallies held throughout the country.On Nov. 12, some hundreds of thousands of citizens took to the streets in the largest number since the democratization of the country decades ago. Organizers said up to 1 million people took part in the protest, demanding Park's resignation, while police put the number at 260,000. Another massive anti-Park rally was held in downtown Seoul on Saturday for the fourth straight weekend.","in corruption prosecution president ,corruption prosecution president park ,corruption prosecution president ,aides in corruption prosecution ,friend aides in corruption","['Park Geun', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.11694297  0.08442087

Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, revealed this in a nationally televised press conference, announcing the midterm results of a high-profile investigation into the Choi scandal.Lee also said the office’s special investigative team was indicting three key figures in the scandal -- Choi, Park’s former secretaries Jeong Ho-seong and An Jong-bum. Park was not included as according to the Constitution, the president is exempt from criminal prosecution, except in cases of insurrection and treason. Still, the prosecution made clear its determination to continue investigating the conservative leader as a criminal suspect. It may seek to interview her face-to-face interview in the coming days. Last week, the team had tried to question Park in person, but did not manage to, as the president had delayed the process.Park, who is resisting mounting calls to step down from her post, is also set to face more scrutiny, as the National Assembly is preparing to launch an independent counsel-led probe and a parliamentary inquiry over the Choi scandal.Their findings, as well as that of the ongoing prosecutorial probe, could lay the legal groundwork for her eventual impeachment. The Choi scandal broke out late last month, when it was revealed that Choi, Park’s friend for 40 years, may have been meddling in state affairs and peddling influence such as by granting favors to her close associates and pulling strings to get special treatment for her daughter.","nationally televised press conference ,choi prosecutors president park ,state prosecutors said sunday ,accomplice to choi prosecutors ,seoul central district prosecutors","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Young - ryeol', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30026147  0.3254104

The 19-year-old dressage rider is currently in Germany where she stayed with her mother Choi, before Choi returned to Korea late last month to face investigation. Choi is a key figure in a political scandal ensnaring President Park, accused of meddling in state affairs and influence-peddling. She is also alleged to have pulled strings behind the scenes to get her daughter special treatment in educational and sports circles. According to the ministry’s findings, the university added horseback riding to a list of categories open to student athletes in 2014, right before Chung’s admission in 2015. It then considered the 2014 Asian Games gold medal she obtained after the application deadline in the admission process. A chief in charge of admissions ordered interviewers to select “a person who brings a gold medal,” although its policy bans candidates from presenting such items during interviews. Chung was the only candidate who brought a medal. The audit also found that the interviewers had given other students lower scores to help Chung gain admission. While attending the university, Chung was given overly generous marks despite not attending classes, taking exams and turning in assignments. The probe found that in eight of school courses she took, she didn’t attend the classes even once, take exams or turn in assignments but was given generous grades. In one case, the professor did Chung’s assignment on her behalf and gave her marks. The ministry also detected signs that in other courses, someone else took exams and classes for Chung. The Education Ministry conducted the inspection for 16 days, questioning 118 faculty members and students. But it did not grill Choi, Chung and the former Ewha president. It said that it could not confirm allegations that Ewha Womans University won eight of nine state-led projects in return for providing special treatment to Chung.In the coming weeks, prosecutors are expected to investigate whether Choi peddled influence over the university in the process of accepting Chung and granting state-led projects to the university. A separate inspection by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education also found that Chung’s middle and high schools gave her favors in attendance and grading. She was able to graduate from high school though she only attended 17 days out of the 193 days in her senior year at Chungdam High School. Her mother Choi offered kickbacks to teachers on three occasions. She also verbally abused and publicly humiliated Chung’s teachers, threatening to fire them, according to the investigation. She was then the wife of her ex-husband Jeong Yoon-hoe, who was a presidential aide. State prosecutors investigating Choi on abuse of power and fraud have questioned high ranking officials from Samsung Group, Chung‘s corporate sponsor, to see if any shady deal was made between the conglomerate and Choi.

A chief in charge of admissions at the university ordered interviewers to select “a person who brought an Asian Games gold medal.” She was the only student who was allowed to bring in a gold medal during the interview, which is in violation of the school’s policy. The audit found that the interviewers internationally had given other students lower scores to help Chung be accepted. The school also added horseback riding to a list of categories open to student athletes in 2014, right before the dressage rider’s admission in 2015.

Choi then tried to siphon off the funds for her personal profit.Choi, with no official title nor security clearance, was arrested for attempted fraud and abuse of power.

A few outspoken liberals have been calling for Park’s impeachment from the very beginning of the scandal surrounding the conservative president and her friend for 40 years Choi Soon-sil, but most in the liberal opposition bloc are reluctant to talk about the possibility of the extreme measure.   Ironically, the embattled president herself and some members of her governing Saenuri Party seem to prefer the scenario involving impeachment.  “Impeachment is something that the legislative body discusses in accordance with the Constitution. There is nothing we can do about it,” said the presidential office Tuesday. To understand the rationale behind the opposition’s aversion to an impeachment campaign as well as Park’s preference for it, one has to look into the complicated process -- as described in the Korean Constitution -- of impeaching and removing a sitting president. It is quite different from that of the US. Impeachment procedure  First, the impeachment motion.To set in motion an effort to impeach the president, South Korea’s unicameral, 300-member National Assembly must pass a motion for it by a two-third vote. Park’s foes -- three liberal opposition groups and liberal-minded independents -- have 171 votes, 29 short of the required quorum. This means that assuming there is no dissenting votes from the opposition bloc, at least 29 Saenuri members have to agree to impeach Park. Within Saenuri, which has 121 lawmakers, voices calling for Park’s early departure from the presidential office are growing. Yet, it is unclear how many of its legislators would cast their votes across the aisle to support an opposition-led motion. A poll by a local daily, released earlier this week, put the number of lawmakers willing to vote for Park’s forced ouster at 18. Among them could be former party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, as he has publicly called for Park’s impeachment.  Once the motion is through, the Constitutional Court will determine the president’s fate. In the US, the final decision is made by the Senate. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk  shakes hands with his opposition counterpart Woo Sang-ho during a plenary session at the National Assembly on Thursday. In Korea, the top court will deliberate whether the president has violated the Constitution or law to deserve a dismissal. So, the court’s finding could deviate from the public opinion.A decision to unseat Park requires consent from at least six of its nine judges. The problem is that the ideological composition of the judges is largely stacked against the president’s foes. Currently, seven out of the nine members are considered to be leaning right.  By law, the president, chief justice of the Supreme Court and the National Assembly can each appoint three judges. To make it even worse, two of the incumbent judges are to retire early next year. The looming vacancies could work against those seeking to oust Park, because they would need consent from six out of seven, not nine, judges. The court must offer their ruling within 180 days upon receiving the motion from the Assembly.  While the court deliberates, the prime minister replaces the role of the president. If the legislative body fails to appoint the nation’s second-in-command, incumbent Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, appointed by Park, would run the state. The president is removed from office immediately, once the court approves of the motion. The nation would then have to elect a new president within 60 days. The newly elected president is granted a five-year term regardless of how much time was left in the outgoing president’s term. Risk of pursuing impeachment There are three reasons for the opposition parties’ reluctance to impeach the president: Difficulty in proving President Park’s violation of the Constitution, a high threshold of passing an impeachment motion at the Constitutional Court, and uncertainty surrounding an arduous impeachment process. After all, the key is not the public sentiment or the legislature’s act of no-confidence in Park. The Constitutional Court will have to be convinced that Park’s wrongdoings are grave enough to warrant her removal. Among the allegations facing Park now is that she abused her power to extract money from conglomerates and leak confidential document to her longtime friend Choi. But the prosecutors have yet to find direct evidence linking the charges to the president herself and plans for a face-to-face investigation with Park have been stalled. So far, the president has admitted to the fact that she sought some help from Choi when writing her speeches.Outside of criminal charges against the president, Constitutional experts noted that Park violated the basic law for disrupting fundamental democratic values -- such as rule of law -- by allowing an unelected individual like Choi to meddle in state affairs. “Impeaching the president can be justified if the president loses her ability to manage state affairs,” said Han Sang-hee, a law professor at Seoul-based Konkuk University. “In that regard, I think we have enough case to pursue the impeachment.” Another predicament lies in the high threshold for the impeachment motion to get passed by the Constitutional Court, whose nine members are mostly dominated by judges elected by President Park and her conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak. For the impeachment to take place, six or more judges need to approve the motion. Currently, six members were appointed by the two conservative presidents and their governing Saenuri Party. And the judges are inclined to apply strict standards when reviewing the impeachment motion. In 2004, the late President Roh Moo-hyun was subject to impeachment for violation of political neutrality, however, the judges rejected the motion, saying the allegation was not “grave enough” for the impeachment. The last reason is that impeachment is a time-consuming process. Even if the independent counsel is launched this week after the lawmakers pass the bill aiming to name the special prosecutors, the lawmakers have to wait up to 120 days until the prosecutors announce the investigation result. Combined with the up to 180 days of legal review conducted by the Constitutional Court and 60 days of transition period until the nation elects a new president, the whole process would last up to 360 days and end when the president has almost finished her five-year term. Opposition parties are concerned that the time-consuming process will aggravate the political deadlock and attract public protest that could hurt their political fate. In 2004, the then opposition parties were defeated in general elections after they pushed to impeach late President Roh.

Park Jie-won, floor leader and interim chief of the runner-up opposition People’s Party, wrote via his Facebook account.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the party’s former chief and presidential hopeful, also asserted that the president has set to bracing herself for the inevitable impeachment.Impeachment is the only legally binding sanction which the legislature may impose on a president who has violated the Constitution or other laws.But it is also considered a political risk for the motioning party, especially if the motion fails to obtain a two-thirds quorum, which requires 200 or more votes in the 300-seat National Assembly. Even with parliamentary approval, the sanction may be thwarted upon the Constitutional Court’s dismissal.Such was the case of the attempted impeachment of former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004, which politically backfired upon the then-opposition Grand National Party.By Bae Hyun-jung","bracing for impeachment president ,for impeachment president park ,for impeachment president ,impeachment president park geun ,impeachment president park","['Park Geun', 'Dae']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.28617007  0.23093413

The emerging chasm continued to deepen as the dissenters demand the all-out resignation of the incumbent leadership run by pro-Park lawmakers. Earlier in the day, heavyweight dissenters boycotted the party’s decision-making Supreme Council meeting and launched their own leadership organization. Saenuri’s worsening factional division has offered two choices to its leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, one of the staunchest loyalists to the president: Whether to accept the call for resignation or to stick to his leadership position. Until now, Lee has pledged to choose the latter. Instead of leaving his office immediately, the third-term lawmaker said that he would retain his position at least until late December, a month before the party elects new leadership on Jan. 21, 2017. Saenuri Party leader Lee Jung-hyun “I’m an elected Saenuri leader whose term ends on Aug. 9, 2018,” Lee told reporters during a meeting to mark the 100th day anniversary of his taking office. “No one can ignore the party’s average members’ right to choose me.” His opponents -- almost 60 Saenuri lawmakers outside of the pro-park faction -- pointed to Lee’s “special relationship” with the president as the rationale for his reluctance to leave the top office despite the mounting criticism. Since running for parliamentary election for the first time in 2004, Lee has been considered to be a “mouthpiece” for Park, who led the then main opposition Grand National Party, a precursor to Saenuri. He had worked as a senior spokesman until Park was defeated during the primary for the 2007 presidential election. Though most GNP members who supported Park switched sides and worked for then President-elect Lee Myung-bak, Lee decided to stay with Park. He rejected the offer to work as a senior strategist in Lee’s election campaign.Lee once told Park that he would leave politics if he lost the opportunity to work for her. Such behavior has earned the trust of Park, who observers say has commitment issue over her aides after seeing her father, late President Park Chung-hee, assassinated by his long-time confidante. “I have never seen Lee say what I didn’t say,” Park famously said in 2013 when she served as GNP leader. A year later, Park was elected as the president. Under her presidency, Lee worked as senior presidential secretary for political affairs, and afterwards, served as the senior secretary for public relationsEven after being elected as a party leader in August, Lee has showed no sign of setting a different tone in his relationship with Park unlike his predecessors, such as former Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. Kim clashed with the president over differences in the nominating procedure for 2016 parliamentary elections.“What the president thinks and what the Saenuri Party thinks should not be different,” said Lee during his first public meeting after taking office on Aug 10. “If you think that confronting the president is the right thing to do, you don’t deserve to be Saenuri member.” By Yeo Jun-suk","scandal tied to president ,pro park lawmakers earlier ,the all out resignation ,since the nepotism scandal ,nepotism scandal tied","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'pro - park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.57995081  0.44597721

Her conservative rivals called the quick change in stance a typical case of the opposition camp’s recklessness and lack of responsibility. “I am sorry for causing confusion to the citizens and party members. I am also regretful to the two other opposition parties,” Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Korea, said in a Facebook post Tuesday. As she felt burdened to do something to end the crisis of leadership engulfing the nation, she wanted to try talking the scandal-ridden conservative president into voluntary resignation, she added. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the democractic Party of Korea Rep. Choo then proposed to form an emergency committee encompassing opposition parties and civil groups. The Democratic Party leader’s about-face came after the party’s lawmakers decided to adopt a more hard-line stance and officially demand Park’s resignation at a general assembly in the evening. The lawmakers harshly criticized their leader for having pushed for her own agenda without any discussion with other party leaders or members.   The presidential office and the ruling Saenuri Party expressed regret over the cancellation of the meeting. “We expected the talk between the president and Rep. Choo to find ways to stabilize the nation and normalize state affairs, and  regret her one-sided decision,” Presidential Spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk said Tuesday. He highlighted that the president had swiftly responded to the proposal, agreeing to meet Rep. Choo on Tuesday.  Saenuri chief Rep. Lee Jung-hyun was more outspoken. “Politics is all about trust. It is regretful that the main opposition party just changed their decision in such an irresponsible manner,” Rep. Lee said. The party’s floor leader Chung Jin-suk questioned the opposition camp’s willingness to put an end to the presidential crisis that has brought about a paralysis of the executive branch. “I wonder if the opposition party members have any will to normalize the government,  blocking any chance for possible talks with the president,” he said.  He added that the Democratic Party is trying to use the scandal involving President Park to its own advantage. However, the two minor opposition parties, which had criticized Rep.

Despite the pr...","President Park Geun-hye’s newly appointed lawyer clashed with the prosecution Tuesday over the date and format of its planned questioning of the embattled leader.The president has selected Yoo Yeong-ha, a 55-year-old private attorney, to counter a growing list of allegations that she may have helped her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, create slush funds with corporate donations and meddle in state affairs. Despite the prosecution’s call for the interview to be held no later than Wednesday, Yoo was adamant that it was “physically impossible” because he was hired Monday and needed more time to prepare. He also took issue with the prosecution’s unprecedented plan to quiz a sitting leader face-to-face, saying a written query was “appropriate in principle” but if a head-to-head meeting is necessary, it could be done in minimal time.Yoo Yeong-ha“A probe into the president should be carried out in a way that minimizes any burden on the performance of her duties, which I believe is in line with the spirit of the Constitution,” Yoo told reporters. “It is reasonable for the probe to take place after  completes establishing factual grounds after looking into all allegations.”  A special prosecutors’ team in charge of the scandal confirmed that Yoo has requested more time for a review upon his submission of a letter of designation, offering to postpone the interview to Thursday. “Given the probe’s substantial progress so far, we believe a face-to-face session is a must to find out the truth,” the team said in a statement after the attorney’s news conference. The Constitution’s exemption of the president from being prosecuted had fueled debate over whether she should be grilled. But Park has displayed her willingness to speak in person with the investigators, including those of an independent special prosecution to be arranged by the National Assembly. With Choi’s arrest warrant due to expire Sunday, the investigators said they plan to prosecute her later this week alongside former presidential secretaries An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, who have also been arrested on charges of abuse of authority, interference with a right and attempted coercion, and leaking state secrets, respectively. But following a 16-hour inquiry, the team dismissed two other close aides, Ahn Bong-geun and Lee Jae-man, saying it has not “caught suspicions.” Yoo’s ties with the president dated back to 2005 when Park, as chief of the then ruling Grand National Party, tapped him to be a deputy chief of its strategic planning committee. He has since been working as her legal adviser, joining her first, unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2007 and her successful run in 2012. After Park’s swearing in, he was made a partner of a law firm run by her sister-in-law, Seo Hyang-hee, before being named by the ruling party as a member of the standing committee of the National Human Rights Commission. In terms of the prosecutorial career, he passed the bar exam in 1992 and served at district prosecutors’ offices in Seoul, Incheon, Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province and Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province. He then pursued a foray into politics, running for the general elections in 2004, 2008 and 2012, all of which he did not win despite Park’s support. Yoo appears to be a reasonable pick for Park given his experience in defending allegations about her relationship with the Choi family, which the opposition and other critics brought up during her previous election campaigns.  Yet he often emerged as a source of contention. An opposition lawmaker has claimed that Yoo received entertainment from the owner of a night club during his days as a district prosecutor in Incheon, while playing a role in diluting a stock price-rigging scandal engulfing then leading presidential contender Lee Myung-bak months ahead of a vote.    Around the 2012 presidential election, Yoo also posted other controversial comments on his Twitter account and even cursed Park’s critics such as renowned novelists Lee Oi-su and Gong Ji-young.

The centers have also provided various kinds of support for aspiring entrepreneurs both at home and abroad.According to the sources, the Seoul Metropolitan Government plans to withdraw the budget for one of the 17 centers located in Seoul.The city government injected 1 billion  into the center last year but said it plans to withdraw the 2 billion allocated for this year. Also, there are moves in the National Assembly to cut back the budget for the creative centers next year.Earlier, the government announced that the budget allocated for creative economy innovation centers will be increased by 8.5 percent on-year to 607.2 billion won in 2017.The moves come amid the snowballing scandal involving Choi Soon-sil that she had intervened in state affairs and personally benefited by using her friendship with President Park.There have been mounting suspicions that Choi even spearheaded many of Park's policies, including the creative economy policy.The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, in charge of the innovation centers, argues that the policy has nothing to with Choi.The ministry argues that the centers have offered various forms of support to 1,175 startups, and 1,644 small and medium-sized enterprises, and have helped attract investments worth $256 million for these local firms.","amid political scandal innovation ,scandal surrounding the president ,political scandal innovation centers ,political scandal innovation ,risk amid political scandal","['Park Geun', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.65370166  0.08507635

The move came two days after the prosecution called in Samsung Electronics Co.'s Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, the heir apparent of the family-run group, to undergo questioning over cash donations to two nonprofit foundations allegedly set up and controlled by Choi, who has maintained ties with the president for over four decades.Choi is currently in custody over suspicions of peddling influence and amassing profits by using her friendship with the president.The latest move follows another raid carried out on the head office of the conglomerate earlier this month, which marked the first time in eight years that Samsung's main office was subject to a search by authorities.Prosecutors suspect that the advertising company gave business favors to Choi. They are also looking into whether it was involved in the group handing over 3.5 billion won  to a company in Germany owned by Choi and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra to fund Chung's equestrian training.Prosecutors here have been accelerating their probe into the growing scandal, which has shaken President Park Geun-hye's presidency, with her approval ranging plunging to a record-low level.They are consulting with the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae with a plan to question Park later this week.

Ahn Bong-geun and Lee Jae-man arrived the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at about 9:25 a.m. and 10:25 a.m., respectively, to be questioned over their possible involvement. They are alleged to have assisted Choi Soon-sil, Park’s longtime confidante, in meddling in state affairs and bullying major conglomerates into paying into her slush funds. Asked by media whether he personally knew Choi and about other allegations, Ahn declined to comment, saying he would “speak with the investigators upstairs.” Lee Jae-manLee also simply said he would undergo the investigation “with sincerity.” The two were sacked late last month as after working with Park for nearly 20 years, along with another secretary Jeong Ho-seong. Jeong has been arrested on suspicion of leaking state secrets. During the latest questioning, prosecutors intended to look into whether Ahn and Lee passed confidential documents to Choi and acted as intermediaries between her and the president. Ahn Bong-geun Ahn and Lee were summoned as “reference witnesses,” but investigators may change their status to “suspects” if evidence against them grows. The special prosecutors’ team also raided their homes Wednesday.  The three former secretaries were suspected to have jointly used the email ID “greatpark1819” to send Park’s speeches, Cabinet meeting materials and other sensitive files discovered on Choi’s tablet computer. As a presidential administrative affairs secretary, Lee was responsible for document security at Cheong Wa Dae.   Ahn faces allegations of having offered his car to facilitate Choi’s entry to the presidential residence. Their appearance came as the prosecution intends to directly question the president this week. It has delivered a plan via the Justice Ministry to Cheong Wa Dae, which said in response it will provide its position around Tuesday, after hiring an attorney and completing other preparations based on Park’s schedule. The team is exploring the formalities of what would be an unprecedented investigation of the sitting leader. It is thought to be leaning toward quizzing Park at a safe house inside the presidential compound. In another development, the prosecution on Monday raided the southern Seoul home of Cho Won-dong, a former senior presidential economic secretary. Cho allegedly sought to force Miky Lee, also known as Lee Mie-kyung, to step down as vice chairwoman of CJ Group. According to a recorded transcript exposed to the media, Cho called her uncle, CJ Group Co-Chairman Sohn Kyung-shik, in late 2013 and warned the company may be investigated by the prosecution if Lee didn’t quit. His words were in line with the president’s will, Cho added, saying Sohn had better make a decision “before it gets too late and dangerous.”Lee and Sohn were steering the group in aid of her younger brother, CJ Group Co-Chairman Lee Jay-hyun, who was in prison for embezzlement, breach of trust and tax evasion. Rumors had circulated that the food and entertainment conglomerate had incurred the wrath of the administration for airing shows satirizing Park on its cable television channel, and releasing a film that fanned positive memories of late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun. During the search, the investigators said they secured Cho’s mobile phone, computer hard disk, papers and other materials. If they find evidence for the allegations, they could charge him with abuse of authority and interference with the group’s management. Since being dismissed from his Blue House post in June 2014, Cho has been teaching economic policy as a professor emeritus at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.

Questions have emerged on two key fronts: What sort of charges will be brought against the president and how the prosecutors will deal with the unpresented investigation into an incumbent president. The prosecutors have submitted an official request to Cheong Wa Dae to question President Park in person. They want the questioning session to take place no later than Wednesday. Cheong Wa Dae For the investigation venue, the prosecutors have considered various options including Cheong Wa Dae and different places near the presidential office. “We’re still in consultation over the date, but what’s most important is when, and the place is a secondary issue,” a senior member of the investigative team told reporters. “Our position is the questioning should take place no later than Wednesday.” The proposed time frame appears to reflect the investigators’ efforts to untangle the relationship between Park and Choi as well as the president’s involvement in related wrongdoings before Choi’s arrest warrant expires Saturday. In terms of the methods, with retired presidents and first ladies, the prosecution has in the past sent written forms, made visits or summoned them in person. “A written investigation is physically not easy and takes time going back and forth between us and . A face-to-face meeting is easier,” the prosecutor added.Incumbent presidents are not subject to charges for criminal offense during their tenures. But the investigation’s findings could constitute grounds for a potential impeachment motion should the president be convicted of the accusations surrounding her. Among the possible charges facing President Park are whether the president had abused her power to extract money from conglomerates. Park is suspected of instructing her aides to raise some 77.4 billion won  and offering the money to nonprofit foundations run by Choi. “President Park gave me detailed instructions about how to raise the money,” Ahn Chong-bum, a former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination was quoted as saying during the prosecutors’ investigation Thursday. Ahn allegedly played a key role in pressuring the business into donating the money.If the president is found to have given instructions on those wrongdoings -- or to have been aware of them --- she would be charged with preventing the obstruction of duties and abusing her authorities as the head of the executive branch   The prosecutors have focused its investigation on whether the president herself demanded the conglomerates donate the money when Park hosted the meeting with seven local conglomerates in July at Cheong Wa Dae. Some legal experts noted that if the president is found to have made a promise to offer special treatment to those business leaders at the meeting, she could be convicted of receiving bribes from private entities. In order to investigate the allegation, prosecutors have summoned business leaders who attended the meeting with Park. Among them were Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo. Another point of investigation is whether Park instructed her presidential aides to share confidential documents, such as Park’s presidential speeches, with her confidante Choi, who has never held a government position.With Choi admitting to editing the presidential speeches, Jeong Ho-seong, one of Park’s closest aides, reportedly said during the investigation that he “personally gave those documents because of Choi’s relationship with the president.” If the documents that Choi received are found to have contained sensitive information on military and diplomatic issues -- or the prosecutors find more confidential documents shared with Choi -- she could be charged for leaking secrets about national security.  By Yeo Jun-suk","interrogation of sitting president ,closes in on president ,sitting president questions ,brought against the president ,into an incumbent president",['Park Geun - hye'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33939061  0.11891569

""I will talk with the prosecution,"" Ahn told reporters, entering the prosecutors' office. He declined to comment on any allegations raised against him.""I will fully cooperate with the prosecution's investigation,"" Lee said, also declining to comment further.The two, who served as presidential secretaries for public relations and administrative affairs, respectively, were among Park's longest-serving aides who resigned late last month following the scandal, which has shaken Park's presidency.Along with former presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong, they were among Park's most trusted secretaries who had been working with her since she was a lawmaker.Prosecutors suspect that Ahn and Lee were involved in leaking presidential records to Choi, who allegedly possessed a tablet PC with presidential documents on it ranging from Park's speech notes to those related to sensitive policy issues. Jeong has already been put under detention over similar allegations.The questioning comes a day after the prosecution announced it would carry out direct questioning of the president early this week to investigate her role in the widening scandal surrounding Choi.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae is expected to announce how it will proceed with the questioning around Tuesday. The office is expected to select legal counsel for Park in what will be the first prosecutorial questioning of a sitting South Korean president in the country's history.Park has already expressed her willingness to accept direct questioning when she made her second public apology delivered on Nov. 4. Despite efforts to allay public outrage over the scandal, her approval rating remained at a record-low 5 percent last week, according to local pollster Gallup Korea. On Saturday, some hundreds of thousands of citizens took to the streets in the largest numbers since the democratization of the country to demand Park's resignation. Organizers said up to 1 million people took part in the protest, while police put the number at 260,000.","two former presidential secretaries ,scandal prosecutors on monday ,prosecutors on monday questioned ,questioned two former presidential ,presidential secretaries who resigned","[""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Ahn bong - geun', 'Lee Jae - man', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Choi Soon - sil']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54588342  0.4007782

Prosecutors said they are considering opening an investigation into Park around Nov. 20 when the legal period of Choi's detention expires. Choi was formally put under arrest on Nov. 3 on charges of fraud and abuse of power.""The questioning of the president is most likely to take place later this week. But there is also a possibility of the questioning being delayed. In that case, it will be possible after the indictment of Choi,"" a Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office official said.As for the place of questioning, the official said the most likely option is a third location, instead of the prosecutors' office or the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae. However, Cheong Wa Dae has not been ruled out yet, he added.The official made clear that sending a questionnaire to the president instead of face-to-face questioning may not be under consideration.Park already agreed to be questioned by prosecutors in a news conference on Nov. 4.In the scandal, Choi allegedly leveraged her four decadelong relationship with Park to coerce local businesses, including Lotte Group and SK Group, into donating large sums to two dubious nonprofit foundations that she was suspected of using for personal gain. Even Samsung Electronics Co. is under investigation for its involvement in the scandal.Despite two public apologies by the president since the scandal erupted last month, her approval rating plunged to a record-low 5 percent, according to local pollster Gallup Korea.In the apologies, Park acknowledged that she allowed her guard to drop as Choi stood by her side during difficult times. She said the fallout from the scandal was ""all my fault.""South Korea's Constitution does not allow a sitting president to be prosecuted, but some senior officials have suggested that questioning, as part of a broader investigation, is permissible.","corruption scandal president park ,imminent questioning by prosecutors ,in corruption scandal president ,by prosecutors this weekend ,corruption scandal president","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.30424643  0.2042859

Kwon was set to be grilled over allegations that Choi’s close associate Cha Eun-ta had threatened an ad company, which was selected as a preferential bidder for Posco’s former affiliate Poreka, to hand over 80 percent of its shares after Cha failed to take over Poreka. An Chong-bum, an ex-presidential secretary for policy coordination, also played a role in allegedly extorting shares from the company. A local media outlet broke the news Friday that Kwon and An allegedly made several phone calls and exchanged text messages at around the time Cha and An together attempted to take over the ad company. The prosecution earlier said that it might possibly investigate seven heads of the nation’s biggest firms, as it was revealed that President Park had close-doors meetings with them to ask for financial donations for the foundations. President Park Geun-hye and the chiefs of 17 conglomerates and businesses pose for a photo session during a lunch event at Cheong Wa Dae on July 24, 2015. The prosecution also questioned officials from companies including Daerim Corp. which allegedly contributed 600 million won to the foundations. A director from Daerim had served as a member of the board of directors at the Mir Foundation. The ongoing probe is expected to offer clues on President Park’s role in the donations. Park’s aides involved in the scandal reportedly testified that they had pressured local firms to raise funds under Park’s direct orders. Choi, a 60-year-old civilian accused of meddling in state affairs, is allegedly at the center of establishing and running the foundations. The ex-presidential aide An and the music video director Cha also helped manage them. Woo Byung-woo, a former presidential secretary for civil affairs, is facing prosecutorial questioning for separate charges of embezzlement and abuse of power. But emerging evidence suggests that he had oversaw the alleged wrongdoings committed by President Park’s aides. According to a local media outlet, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae had contacted Cha when he was in China to possibly dodge questioning as the probe into the Choi scandal escalated. The left-wing news outlet suspected them of discussing details in preparation for the prosecutorial questioning. Fresh allegations also emerged against Cha late Thursday.Media reports said that Cha had abused his power to demand entertainment giant CJ group give him the top posts for two projects led by the conglomerate. Cha allegedly sought to head the Creative Center for Convergence Culture, a major cultural project under the Park administration. He also wanted to have authority to arrange all the performances at the entertainment complex K-Culture Valley to be built in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. As CJ Group refused the requests, according to local media, Cha did not grant favors to the firm. Cha also allegedly peddled influence to get his close associates jobs at telephone company KT Corp. He also used his ties to have his company selected as an ad agency for KT. Cha is involved in other allegations that he meddled in personnel appointments in the Culture Ministry, monopolized lucrative state-led projects for his personal gain and pocketed money from his own company.The prosecution applied for a court-issued warrant to arrest Cha, who holds no government post, on charges of abuse of authority as an accomplice to An in coercion, embezzlement and bribery.

On April 16, 2014, while the nation was gripped by shock and sorrow after watching on live TV the ferry’s slow sinking, with over 300, mostly students, trapped inside, Park did not make a public appearance until late in the afternoon. She showed up at the disaster control center at around 5:15 p.m., seven hours after the incident, and asked, “Why is it hard to find those students? I heard they all had life vests on.” This gave rise to suspicions that Park might have been absent or for some reason unable to attend to her duties as head of the government for the seven hours. As criticism mounted, Cheong Wa Dae at that time had explained that Park received reports on the incident 15 times in total and gave instructions twice for a swift rescue operation. But they were all written reports and she was never briefed by anyone in person. Even the presidential chief of staff said he was not aware of her exact whereabouts. On Friday, the presidential spokesperson reiterated that Park was not missing from Cheong Wa Dae, nor was she under the effects of a plastic-surgery related anesthesia as some now suspect. “The president was continuously given updates on the Sewol ferry’s situation,” he stressed, adding that she had engaged in a phone conversation with one of her secretaries at around noon on that day. Earlier this week, local media reported that a doctor from a cosmetic surgery clinic where Choi frequented visited Cheong Wa Dae to see Park regularly. Another report revealed that Choi regularly received undisclosed prescription drugs for intravenous injections on behalf of Park from the aforementioned clinic and another one. The Health Ministry said it will launch an examination into the clinics to verify the reports.

Park’s ex-presidential aides, who are now under questioning in the prosecution’s probe, told interrogators that they had just followed orders from President Park, after initially denying her role in the scandal, multiple media outlets reported Thursday. According to reports, An Chong-bum, ex-presidential secretary for policy coordination, testified that Park specifically ordered him to help the Mir and K-Sports foundations to raise funds from conglomerates. An was arrested for abusing authority and attempted coercion. Choi, who is at the center of the influence-peddling scandal, was also arrested for being an accomplice to An. Choi, who on paper holds no title in the entities, is said to have orchestrated their foundation, fundraising and project management.    An also allegedly said that Park ordered him to help Cha Eun-taek, a TV commercial director and Choi’s close associate who was arrested for extorting shares from a midsize ad company. After failing to take over Poreka, a former in-house ad company for Posco, Cha allegedly threatened the firm to hand over 80 percent of its shares or face a tax evasion probe. The prosecution is said to have discovered recorded conversations between Park and Jeong Ho-seong, a former secretary of the president, in connection with the scandal, on his phones that were confiscated during the raid of his residence. In the recorded file, Park was heard ordering Jeong to show policy-related documents to Choi and to seek her opinion. In another recorded file, Jeong called Choi to tell her the documents were sent. Jeong had initially denied knowing Choi and delivering confidential documents to her, but later admitted to doing so under Park’s orders. He was arrested for leaking official documents such as presidential speeches and policy guidelines. President Park appears to deny her involvement in forcing local firms to donate money to the foundations.In a second televised address Friday, Park said she did not know Choi peddled influence and embezzled funds for personal gain. Park also said she would undergo prosecutorial questioning if necessary.

The prosecution suspects the money may have been illegally channeled to Choi.“We are investigating just what was discussed between . ... Summoning them for questioning is not out of the question,” said an official from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. Prosecutors also raided the home of a former presidential aide for civil affairs, Woo Byung-woo, who is suspected of condoning Choi’s unlawful actions. Potential evidence acquired in the search included cellphones belonging to Woo and his wife.Woo has been banned from leaving the country and faces a series of suspicions, including embezzlement and abuse of power.Questions were raised over whether Woo was involved in leaking information related to a corruption probe on Lotte Group. Lotte donated 7 billion won to the foundations, but has since received back the funds.Woo is also suspected of overlooking wrongdoings by former TV commercial director and Choi’s aide Cha Eun-taek, which include interfering in the president’s personnel decisions.Investigators later in the day requested an arrest warrant for Cha, who is suspected of using his relationship with Choi to get state-backed projects and attempting to unlawfully acquire advertisement company Poreka through coercion.The prosecution is slated to summon Posco CEO Kwon Oh-joon on Friday for questioning on suspicion his company cut its orders for Poreka after the chief executive of the company refused to comply with the threats and give up the company.Choi, a 60-year-old civilian, is suspected of meddling in state affairs and pocketing public funds. She and An Chong-bum, a former senior presidential secretary, are suspected of playing the key role in raising funds for the foundations.But prosecutors are conducting an investigation to see if Park herself was involved in the process, particularly after it was revealed she held a closed-door meeting with individuals heading seven of the biggest corporations in South Korea.The individuals included Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jay-yong, Hyundai Motor Group chief Chung Mong-koo and LG Group Chairman Koo Bon-moo. Officials from Samsung, Hyundai Motor, LG, SK, CJ, Hanhwa and Hanjin have already been summoned for questioning on the allegation.Reports have indicated that the companies related to the Mir and K-Sports foundations made donations in exchange for favors, such as being exempt from tax audits. Local Channel-A reported Wednesday that one of Choi’s aides had approached the son of Hwanhwa Group Chairman Kim Seung-yeon, who was then on trial for unlawful financial aid to one of the company’s subsidiaries. The aide reportedly told Kim it was possible for his father to receive a presidential pardon through Choi.An official of Hanhwa also told the media the company relinquished its sponsorship of the Korea Equestrian Federation because it was unable to comply with the demands of Choi concerning her daughter Chung Yoo-ra, a professional dressage rider.“Considering that most of the companies made sizeable donations without complaints, and that the president pursued policies favorable to corporations afterward, we cannot but help wonder if the corporation heads had no choice when they provided the funding,” said Lawyers for a Democratic Society, also known as Minbyun, in a statement. It added that after the scandal broke out, high-ranking officials from Samsung Electronics -- the company that made the biggest contributions -- secretly left for Germany, where Choi and her daughter were residing at the time.By Yoon Min-sik","scandal south korean prosecutors ,korean prosecutors said thursday ,conglomerate tycoons face investigation ,investigators have arrested choi ,south korean prosecutors","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi ’s']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36585248  0.80130315

The clinic that Choi Soon-sil, Park’s confidante accused of meddling in state affairs, and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra are said to have frequented for skin care treatments is accused of receiving favors from Cheong Wa Dae. After suspicions surfaced, the plastic surgery clinic, which also runs a skin care clinic and cosmetics business, had closed down and was unavailable when The Korea Herald tried to reach them Wednesday. According to multiple news reports, a director of the clinic, only identified by the surname Kim, was appointed as a doctor and professor at Seoul National University Hospital in July, even though SNUH does not conduct plastic surgery procedures, nor does it provide aesthetic medical services.Kim’s Kim’s appointment came two months after Suh Chang-suk, a former presidential doctor, was appointed as the new head of the SNUH in May.“Director Suh appointed Kim as a doctor and professor, probably at Choi’s personal request. ... Not only that, a presidential secretary supported Kim’s medical business’ expansion overseas,” an official from SNUH was quoted as saying.The SNUH denied all allegations Wednesday and said it did not know of any relationship between Choi and Kim. It also added that it withdrew the appointment of Kim in mid-July after the hospital saw no reason for bringing in Kim.On Tuesday, a local media outlet reported that two other director-level officials from the plastic surgery clinic also accompanied President Park when she made visits to South American countries, China, Africa and France between April last year and May this year.Cosmetics manufactured by the hospital were also selected for a New Year’s Day gift set at Cheong Wa Dae. They also recently entered duty-free stores here.By Kim Da-sol","political scandal plaguing president ,scandal plastic surgery clinic ,scandal plaguing president park ,choi scandal plastic surgery ,scandal plaguing president","['Seoul', 'Gangnam', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Cheong']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29089299  0.34994629

Cha Eun-taek, once a prominent TV commercial director, appeared before the prosecution Wednesday to be questioned on allegations that he played a role in illegally acquiring the advertisement company Poreka, formerly an in-house firm owned by Posco. Cha Eun-taek gets out of a vehicle that transported arrested suspects from a detention facility to the prosecutors’ office in front of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors‘ Office in southern Seoul on Wednesday. Cha returned from China late Tuesday night and was immediately arrested. Later in the day, investigators requested an arrest warrant for former Korea Creative Content Agency chief Song Sung-gak for threatening a medium-sized ad company that acquired Poreka to hand over 80 percent of the shares to Cha. An Chong-bum, a former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination who was arrested Sunday, is also being investigated for the same charges. A recording of a phone conversation with the threatened company CEO and Song shows that Song told him that “there are over 100 ways to ensure that your business does not go well,” while insinuating that the authorities could use tax investigations to penalize him.Prosecutors on Wednesday also called in an official of Posco on allegation that the company cut its orders for Poreka, after the aforementioned CEO refused to comply with threats. Cha is also suspected of illegally usurping billions of won from his former companies while using his friendship with Choi to get state projects.Dubbed the “crown prince” of Korea’s cultural scene, he is believed to have been a member of Choi Soon-sil’s clique that exercised influence over state affairs. Prosecutors have questioned Cha for over five hours after taking him into custody Tuesday evening. He admitted to reporters that he knew An “a little bit,” but did not comment on his relationship with Choi or whether he interfered in the president‘s personnel choices as rumors suggest.According to his lawyer, Cha said that he never had a private meeting with the president and denied any acquaintance with Woo Byung-woo, another former presidential aide embroiled in the scandal.As the investigation expanded to those close to the president, the prosecution on Wednesday raided homes of Park’s former aides Lee Jae-man and Ahn Bong-geun for their possible involvement in allowing Choi to enter Cheong Wa Dae freely and helping her access presidential documents. Jeong Ho-seong, another former Park aide, has already been arrested over the cited allegations. In relation to suspicions that the presidential staff pressured local firms to give donations to the K-Sports and Mir foundations, which were then channeled to Choi, investigators have summoned officials of corporations for questioning.Park reportedly had a closed-door meeting with heads of seven major corporations, leading to speculation the president instructed the companies to make sizeable donations. Samsung, Hyundai Motors and SK contributed 20.4 billion won , 12.8 billion won and 11.1 billion won, respectively, to the eventual 80 billion won fund for the two foundations.Officials from the companies have been called in for questioning along with those from Hanjin, LG, Hanhwa and CJ.By Yoon Min-sik","allegations prosecutors on wednesday ,choi graft allegations prosecutors ,prosecutors on wednesday ,their investigation on embezzlement ,prosecutors probe choi graft","['Park Geun', 'Cha Eun - taek', 'Poreka']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.15756202 0.53600454 0.17972113],Yoon Min-sik,Social affairs,11,2016,"the prosecution on wednesday raided ,prosecution on wednesday raided homes ,penalize him prosecutors on wednesday ,prosecution on wednesday raided ,arrest warrant for former korea","['Park Geun', 'Cha Eun - taek', 'Poreka', 'Posco', 'Cha Eun - taek', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Seoul', 'Cha', 'China', 'Korea', 'Song Sung', 'Poreka', 'Cha', 'Chong', 'Song', 'Song', 'Posco', 'Poreka', 'cha', 'Choi', 'Korea', 'Cha', 'Choi', 'Cha', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Lee Jae - man', 'Ahn Bong - geun', 'Choi', 'Cheong', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Park', 'the K - Sports', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Samsung', 'Hyundai Motors', 'Hanjin', 'LG', 'Hanhwa', 'Yoon Min - sik']",6,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.15756202 0.53600454 0.17972113]

His professor and uncle served President Park Geun-hye as culture minister and senior presidential secretary for culture and education, respectively. By profession, Cha is an award-winning ad film director who gained a reputation in the culture sector in the late 1990s after producing some 800 TV commercials and nearly 200 music videos for famous singers. His latest works include a music video for Psy’s “Hangover” and Big Bang’s “Lie.” Artistic director Cha Eun-taek responds to reporters' questions upon arriving at Incheon Airport on Tuesday. In more recent years, his reputation as a commercial director dwindled. Yet, his influence in the culture scene grew markedly after his appointment in 2014 as a civil member of the Presidential Committee for Cultural Enrichment, a centerpiece of the Park administration’s culture agenda. He secured a job as an audio director for the 2014 Incheon Asian Games and as a director of the Korean section in the Milano Expo last year. He was recently selected as a chief of public-private partnership to boost the creative economy, a top-ranking government official.Cha is allegedly involved in some of 20 state-led projects including the establishment of K-Culture Valley in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, which is expected to cost 1.3 billion won. CJ E&M; won the deal last December. His friendship with Choi goes back years. Cha allegedly helped Chang Si-ho, daughter of Choi’s older sister Choi Soon-deuk who went to the same high school as President Park, debut in the entertainment scene. Chang is involved in a wide-range of influence-peddling allegations in the sports and entertainment scene. Cha is also suspected of pulling strings in setting up and running the Mir Foundation. All the key posts in the foundation were allegedly filled by those Cha recommended. His former professor was the first president of the foundation. The Mir Foundation, along with the K-Sports Foundation, were non-profit foundations allegedly involving President Park, Choi and other ex-presidential aides. Choi was arrested on charges of forcing local firms to contribute money to the foundations as an accomplice to former presidential secretary An Chong-bum. Cha is also suspected of extorting shares in Poreka, an ad firm affiliated with Posco, along with An Chong-bum and Song Sung-gak, Cha’s associate and former chief of the state-run Korea Creative Content Agency. As one of the key men in the multi-faceted Choi Soon-sil scandal, he faces the ever-widening prosecutorial investigation.

Their work logs and cell phones were confiscated in the process. The two are among Park's top aides who resigned last week following the scandal surrounding Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend of Park, suspected of meddling in state affairs and amassing profits based on her ties to the president.Along with another former presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong, they were among Park's most trusted aides who had been working with her for nearly two decades.Prosecutors suspect that Ahn and Lee were involved in leaking presidential records to Choi, who allegedly possessed a tablet PC which had many presidential documents on it ranging from Park's speech notes to those related to sensitive policy issues. Jeong has already been put under detention over similar allegations.The prosecution declined to identify the standing presidential officials subject to the search, saying it cannot give details of private information.The raids came as prosecutors here expedited their probe into the scandal, summoning a number of executives from the country's leading business groups. They grilled a former executive of the Hanjin Group, the parent of cash-strapped Hanjin Shipping Co., on Wednesday, following interrogation on other execs from the LG, CJ, SK and Hanhwa groups on the previous day.Choi and another former presidential secretary are accused of pushing local companies to donate some tens of billions of won to the Mir and K-Sports foundations. There have been suspicions that the money was then unlawfully funneled to Choi. The prosecution, meanwhile, found that K-Sports, which had received some 7 billion won  from the Lotte Group, returned the money right before the retail giant was raided by prosecutors earlier this year, prosecutorial and industry sources said. On June 10, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office launched a full-fledged raid into the group's headquarters and its major affiliates over a string of corporation crime charges, with some 200 investigators.The foundation, which had received the money after months of negotiations, returned the money to Lotte's affiliates from June 9-13, raising suspicions that the details of the probe were leaked to K-Sports.A high-ranking prosecutor who was in charge of the investigation told reporters at that time that they had to promptly carry out the raids as there had been multiple tips that the group was attempting to destroy evidence in preparation for the probe.In South Korea, the proceedings of major investigations are reported to the office of the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs via the Ministry of Justice. The former presidential aide for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo is currently facing suspicions of dereliction of duty or collaborating in Choi's intervention in state affairs. He is another secretary who resigned last week following the scandal. Woo is also under a separate investigation regarding his personal corruption suspicions. The prosecution, however, declined to confirm the allegations raised about Lotte, saying it cannot talk about the testimonies or evidence obtained during interrogation.The 7 billion won transferred to K-Sports in May is separate from another 4.5 billion won Lotte donated in total to the two foundations.","prosecutors on wednesday raided ,prosecutors raid homes of ,current presidential officials prosecutors ,prosecutors raid homes ,wednesday raided the homes","['Park Geun - hye', 'Ahn Bong - geun', 'Lee Jae - man']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32645831  0.27924445

Asked about whether he had a relationship with President Park, Cha said, “I met her at official events, but never one on one.”He was transported to the prosecutor’s office in Seoul for questioning. Cha, who has close ties with Choi, allegedly meddled in state-led projects and exerted undue influence in the culture sector. Cha has been called the “crown prince” in the local cultural scene, with the backing of the president’s friend Choi. Cha’s professor and uncle were appointed culture minister and senior presidential secretary for culture and education, respectively.

But she could...","State prosecutors investigating Choi Soon-sil, who is at the center of an unfolding presidential scandal, are likely to indict her next week, sources said Tuesday. Choi, President Park Geun-hye’s friend of 40 years accused of meddling in state affairs and extorting donations from corporations, is under arrest and currently facing two criminal charges -- accomplice to abuse of power and attempted fraud. But she could face more charges, the prosecution said. “Indictment is not the end of our investigation. She may face additional charges if new evidence presents itself,” a prosecution official told reporters. A team of 32 prosecutors -- the largest ever for any prosecutorial probe in Korea’s history -- are simultaneously looking into various allegations of Choi’s wrongdoings that span across business, sports, culture and education circles. As part of the multifaceted investigation, the prosecutors searched the head office of Samsung Electronics on the suspicion that it provided financial support to Choi’s horseback rider daughter in return for business favors. Choi is also accused of coercing Samsung and other big businesses to donate some tens of billions of won to two nonprofit foundations that she created. The prosecutors  suspect that the money may have then illegally funneled to Choi. The presidential confidante is also accused of receiving presidential documents via email -- some containing sensitive information on diplomacy, inter-Korean relations and Park’s personnel appointments. Jeong Ho-seong, a former Park aide, is under arrest for leaking those documents to Choi, a civilian who has never held public office. For the information leak, however, Choi is unlikely to be held legally accountable, because the law on the presidential information security penalizes those who leak, not the ones who obtain the leaked data. The scandal broke last month, when a local TV channel reported to have found over 200 presidential documents -- including presidential speech scripts -- on a discarded computer used by Choi. President Park, one day after the revealing report, admitted to having sought Choi’s advice on her speeches before delivering them. A flurry of revelations ensued to suggest that Choi’s advice was far-reaching from key state affairs to the president’s wardrobe choices. Several of Park’s former aides are now under investigation, including Jeong, An Jong-bum and Woo Byung-woo. An and Jeong are in custody. An, the former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, is accused of pressuring local firms to give donations to the K-Sports and Mir foundations. Investigators are also stepping up their inquiry into allegations that Choi’s associates interfered with various cultural projects for their personal gain. Song Sung-gak, the former chief of the state-run Korea Creative Content Agency, was arrested late Monday night on suspicion that he pressured a mid-sized ad company to hand over its shares to a third party. Song is a close associate of Cha Eun-taek, whom local press said acted like the “crown prince” in the local cultural scene with the president‘s friend Choi on his back. Cha’s professor and uncle were made the culture minister and the senior presidential secretary for culture and education. Cha is currently staying in China. By Korea Herald staff","an unfolding presidential scandal ,next week state prosecutors ,unfolding presidential scandal ,indicted later next week ,unfolding presidential scandal are","['Choi', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55787516  0.49520478

Park Jie-won, floor leader and interim chief of the runner-up opposition People’s Party.“According to notice from the Speaker‘s office, the president is coming to visit the assembly at 10:30 a.m. today. I am not going,” he wrote earlier in the morning.The Blue House claimed that it is still communicating with the opposition camp, especially on having their leadership attend the meeting at the Speaker‘s office.Whether or not to withdraw the nomination of the prime minister may also come up during the meeting, the presidential officel also explained.The state leaders’s surprise visit to the legislature came a day after the new presidential chief of staff, Han Gwang-ok, had met with opposition leaders to seek their cooperation.The presidential office has recently been under fire, not only for the extensive corruption scandal involving key presidential aides such as Choi Soon-sil, but also for Park‘s consecutive personnel decisions. The prime ministerial appointment was largely accused by the opposition as a unilateral decision which fails to reflect the public sentiment.","withdraw her disputed appointment ,pm nominee president park ,president should first withdraw ,current political deadlock cheong ,on pm nominee president","['Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Kim Byong - joon']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38903484  0.62116975

Min Byung-doo of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea wrote on Facebook.The third-term lawmaker plans to hold a public hearing on the issue as early as this week, submit the draft bill within the month and have it passed in the National Assembly by year-end.Rep. Chae Yi-bae, a lawmaker from the centrist People’s Party, said that he would also propose a similar bill. The activist-turned-lawmaker said that his legislation includes clauses designed to recover assets amassed illegally by the Chois.  Choi Soon-sil Choi Soon-sil, who currently stands at the center of the nationwide dispute that she actively manipulated key state affairs by using her close ties with President Park Geun-hye, is said to have exerted influence on a number of state-run businesses. This history of alleged illicit profiteering traces back to her father, the late cult leader Choi Tae-min.“Not only did the Chois abuse their influence over public servants, but they also used public foundations and educational organizations to build their massive wealth,” Min said.“Though it is difficult to hold the Choi family liable for their financial achievements in the private sector, the special bill will enable the authorities to punish them for raking in money through public organizations.”A similar bill had been motioned by the opposition and passed in 2013 to redeem the illicit assets of public servants -- dubbed the Chun Doo-hwan act, after the former autocratic president. But in order to regulate the Chois, who hold no official government posts, a new special act is needed, according to the lawmaker.Considering that the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee consist of an opposition majority, the bill is likely to make it to the general meeting for a full floor vote.By Bae Hyun-jung","lawmakers push for special ,choi assets opposition lawmakers ,korea wrote on facebook ,opposition lawmakers are pushing ,scandal riven presidential confidante","['Min Byung - doo', 'Democratic Party of Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46795571  0.5033406

Jeong is the ex-husband of Choi.Conventionally, the role of the second office is to assist the spouse and children of the president in their public appearances and speeches.President Park, too, was subject to the office’s care during her father’s time in office, the late President Park Chung-hee, especially after the assassination of her mother Yuk Young-soo, an event which bestowed upon the young Park the role of acting first lady.When the unmarried and childless Park was elected president in 2012, speculations rose that the surplus second office would be abolished for the sake of management efficacy. The presidential transition committee, however, decided to maintain the organization, claiming to use it as a “communication channel with the socially disadvantaged.”It was Ahn, one of the controversial trio, who was leading this questionable office at the time as personal secretary in charge.Jeong, who is now under questioning over his alleged leak of presidential documents to Choi, has been in charge of the first office since Park took office in 2013.While the precise and actual function of the second office remained veiled, those affiliated with it remained in the closest vicinity of the president for years. Unlike other presidential secretaries’ offices, the two personal offices were located in the very same building as the president’s office room.What added to the suspicions was that most of the Blue House officials who were involved in the Choi scandal were connected to this second personal office.Among them is Lee Young-sun, a presidential official who had been observed to accompany Choi over several occasions including her frequent visits to the presidential residence, and who worked in the office until the merger.The Blue House security team’s testimony also seemed to back such suspicions on Choi’s power over the president’s personal offices.“Certain cars are allowed inspection-free passage at Cheong Wa Dae’s gate, if there is advance notice coming from the presidential personal office,” said Lee Young-seok, deputy chief for security in answer to an opposition lawmaker’s question.Cho In-geun, Park’s former speechwriter, admitted in a press conference earlier that presidential speech drafts were passed onto the personal secretary’s offices.Reflecting such circumstances, a number of local media and political observers have been claiming that the mysterious second office was never abolished but just remained under cover so as to perform unofficial tasks, either for the president or the president’s friend Choi.By Bae Hyun-jung","secretariat key in scandal ,scandal while the prosecution ,key in scandal ,choi soon sil scandal ,key in scandal while","['Park Geun', 'Cheong']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49135473  0.58082217

Kim Moo-sung, a former Saenuri leader, held an emergency conference at the National Assembly and criticized Park for the scandal that involved her allowing her confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs and siphon public funds.“The president is supposed to protect the Constitution, yet she ran the government in a way that violated it. ... Her powers as the president, bestowed upon her by the people, was used in order to let the Choi family meddle in state affairs and pursue unlawful gains,” he said. “As Saenuri’s No.1 member, the president must leave the party in order to save it.”Former Saenuri leader, Kim Moo-sung Kim stressed that Park leaving the party will allow Saenuri to gain back some of the trust it lost in light of the scandal, adding that the party can even oust the president if she refuses to leave.He urged Park to accept the opposition’s request for the launch of a neutral Cabinet, while withdrawing her nomination of Kim Byong-joon as the new prime minister and asking the parliament to recommend the new premier. The opposition and some within the ruling party had decried Park’s pick of Kim and demanded that she let the National Assembly appoint the nation’s new second-in-command, who will take on a much more prominent role.Kim, a bigwig of the nonmainstream faction within the ruling party, has butted heads with the president on several occasions while he was the party leader, particularly during the nomination process of the general election earlier in the year.As the president’s approval rating dropping to a low of 5 percent last week, calls for Park to leave the party have been growing even within the Saenuri. They have demanded that Park relinquish her control of state affairs, while retaining her post.Rep. Kang Seok-ho, the only member of the party’s Supreme Council who is not of the mainstream “pro-Park” faction, stepped down from his post Monday while demanding a reshuffle of the party’s leadership. He echoed Kim’s demands of forming a neutral Cabinet and Park taking a back seat in state affairs.Rep. Ha Tae-keung, who is also not of the pro-Park faction, said in a Facebook post Monday that it is “very clear” that the president had played a role in the Choi scandal.“As the prosecution and an independent counsel carries out the investigation, the clearer it will be that Park interfered. ... She must take responsibility,” he wrote, urging Park to “let it go.”Saenuri leader Lee Jung-hyun, however, refused to step down immediately and asked for more time “to help the president.” The opposition stepped up calls for Park to resign, buoyed by nationwide discontent that was apparent in the some 200,000 protestors demanding Park’s resignation in central Seoul on Saturday. “Park must withdraw her Cabinet reshuffle that is directly against public sentiment and must accept the parliament’s recommendation. ... If she continues to refuse, we will have no choice but to push for her resignation,” said Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.The president has requested for talks with opposition leaders, but the parties have demanded Park’s cancellation of Kim’s nomination as a precondition to the meeting.Democratic Party floor leader Woo Sang-ho has said that unless Park withdraws the prime minister nomination, the party will not accept her request for a meeting with the party leader. “It can only lead to one of the following three; cancelling the nomination,  resignation or the parliament’s refusal. The conclusion has already been set,” he said.Rep. Park Jie-won, the floor leader of the minor opposition People’s Party, said that in addition to cancelling the nomination, Park should leave Saenuri before coming to the meeting.The party’s nine first-term legislators officially demanded the president bow out for the sake of the nation, stressing that her presidency is “broken beyond repair.”“No exercise of the president’s governing authority would earn the public’s endorsement. The only way for President Park to serve the country is by vacating the office voluntarily,” they said in a joint press conference at the National Assembly. Park’s new Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok said that the president could discuss the nomination at the meeting, admitting that the process “has had some problems.”“While recognizing the problems, it is important for party leaders  to meet in order to have sufficient time to discuss how to solve this problem,” he said, adding that Park could pay a visit to the parliament if necessary.Calls for Park’s impeachment have also been growing. Rep. Chun Jung-bae, formerly the leader of the People’s Party, suggested that the lawmakers should immediately commence discussion on impeaching Park. Stressing that it is his personal opinion and not the position of his party, Chun called for formation of an interim government and a nationwide discussion on reforming the state system and the presidency itself.By Yoon Min-sik","political predicament worsened monday ,party demanding she leave ,park for the scandal ,turn on park president ,hye political predicament worsened","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59730339  0.3029446

Prosecutors said they discovered recorded phone conversations between Park’s former presidential aide Jeong Ho-seong and Choi on Jeong’s phones that were seized during a raid on his home late last month. Jeong, ex-secretary for the president’s private affairs, was arrested Sunday on charges of leaking official secrets. Jeong, who resigned on Oct. 30 following the scandal, allegedly handed over classified documents such as presidential speeches and policy guidelines to Choi. They also secured Jeong’s planner that allegedly includes a schedule of President Park’s meetings with chiefs of local conglomerates. In July last year, Park allegedly asked for financial donations from the 17 chiefs of local firms to the Mir and K-Sports foundations during a closed-door lunch meeting.  The phone also included a recording of Jeong’s conversation with Park. The prosecution said that it did not find anything related to the nepotism scandal from the file.  The key pieces of evidence are likely to offer clues on what roles President Park, Choi and a former presidential aide An Chong-bum played in pressuring local firms to raise donations for the non-profit foundations.The investigation team also called in for questioning two executive directors, surnamed Park and Lee, of a business lobby group the Federation of Korean Industries. Professors of Seoul National University hold a press conference demanding President Park Geun-hye's resignation at the university's campus in southwestern Seoul on Monday. A total of 728 professors have signed a joint declaration in the largest ever collective action by the school's faculty. The FKI is suspected of encouraging its member firms including Samsung Group, Hyundai Motor, LG Group and Posco to contribute nearly 80 billion won  to the K-Sports and Mir foundations. Choi was arrested Thursday on charges of abuse of authority as an accessory to An, a former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, and for attempted fraud for siphoning off funds from the K-Sports and Mir foundations for private use. An was arrested Sunday on charges of abusing authority and attempted coercion for his involvement in raising funds for the foundations. President Park appears to deny her involvement in forcing local firms to donate money to the foundations. In a second televised address Friday, Park said that she regrets disappointing local firms who offered help to her out of good will, adding that the donations for the foundations were to help the nation’s economy and the lives of the Korean people. The prosecution also summoned the deputy secretary-general of the Mir Foundation and chief of the Korean branch of Widec Sports owned by Choi. It is looking into whether the donations were funneled into Choi through Choi’s firms Germany-based firms. Ex-presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo, suspected of embezzlement and abuse of authority, returned home Monday after a 15-hour questioning session. Woo was questioned over allegations that he siphoned off funds from his family-owned company and used his influence to get his son assigned to a relatively easy post while serving mandatory military service. The prosecution is set to look into his alleged dereliction of his duty in connection with the Choi Soon-sil scandal. It asked the Justice Ministry to impose a travel ban on Woo. Woo was suspected of not doing his job properly while serving as a presidential secretary for civic affairs by turning a blind eye to Choi peddling influence over personnel appointments and state affairs.

Real Meter, a local pollster, said her approval rating plunged 7.5 percentage points to 11.5 percent, the lowest figure ever compiled by the pollster, last week.The figure marks a historic low among Korean presidents surveyed by the company. The previous lowest record was held by late president Roh Moo-hyun, whose approval rating once hovered at 12.6 percent.The poll was conducted from Monday to Friday last week with 2,528 adults across the country, with a 1.9 percent margin of error.Despite the overall erosion of support, Park appeared to regain approval from conservatives after she apologized for a second time Friday. Her approval rating that day increased to 28.4 percent from 23.5 percent from the previous day among respondents aged 60 and above, and to 42.6 percent from 36.9 percent among traditional backers of the ruling Saenuri Party.A separate poll by Gallup Korea last week showed her approval rating plummeted to 5 percent, the lowest for sitting South Korean presidents.In the Real Meter poll, the main opposition Democratic Party garnered an approval rating of 33 percent, beating the ruling party's 21.4 percent for a second consecutive week.

Early in the morning, An Chong-bum, a former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, was arrested on charges of abusing authority and attempted coercion, referring to his alleged involvement in raising funds for nonprofit organizations as a cover to channel money to Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.Funds worth some 80 billion won  was raised by contributions from local firms -- including Lotte Group, SK Group and Posco -- for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation. An and Jeong Ho-seong -- a former secretary for private presidential affairs suspected of leaking government documents to Choi -- were grilled Sunday, along with Choi herself. The scandal centers on suspicions that Choi -- a 60-year-old civilian and the daughter of Park’s mentor Choi Tae-min -- had accessed presidential documents and classified information, meddled in various state affairs, siphoned state funds and received unlawful favors.  Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, looks at reporters when asked about his embezzlement charges, before entering the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office for questioning on Sunday. Woo Byung-woo -- the former senior secretary for civil affairs accused of embezzlement and abuse of authority -- is also being suspected of condoning Choi’s actions. He refused to comment on the issue when appearing before the prosecution for questioning Sunday. As investigators brace themselves for the unprecedented prosecutorial questioning of an incumbent president, the focus now is on the extent to which Park was involved in the scandal.Local media reported recently that An had said his role in raising funds for the foundations was under orders from Park herself. Another report claimed that Park ordered her staff to have the 30 biggest conglomerates in the country raise 100 billion won  for the foundations, in stark contrast to her saying previously that the donations were done with a “helping hand out of good intent.”Park on Friday issued an apology for the scandal and vowed to cooperate with the ongoing prosecutorial investigation, as well as a separate probe by an independent counsel, if necessary. Although Park has admitted to letting Choi revise her speeches in the early part of her time in office, she claimed that this stopped as soon as the presidential staff was formed. But a tablet PC supposedly owned by Choi shows that leaking classified documents continued well into the later part of Park’s tenure, and included sensitive information such as secret military meetings with North Korea.The Constitution states that a sitting president is immune from criminal prosecution while in office, unless he or she has committed treason via instigation. But Kim Seon-Taek, a professor of constitutional law at Korea University, said in a recent column that the clause only postpones the time of indictment of a president until he or she has left office.“Even if the president cannot be prosecuted immediately, one needs to be investigated for acquisition of evidence for post-retirement indictment. ... Therefore an investigation for evidence gathering and preservation can and must be conducted on an incumbent president,” he wrote.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong on Thursday told the National Assembly that the ministry will recommend to the president that she subject herself to questioning, if deemed necessary to uncover the truth. It marked a flip-flop from an earlier stance when he said that Park would not be subject to a probe.Local civic group People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy has filed criminal charges against Park, An and Jeong, long with other Cheong Wa Dae officials and heads of local conglomerates on multiple suspicions including bribery, obstruction of civic duties, violation of laws concerning military secrets, leaking classified diplomatic relations and violating the law on presidential documents. The prosecution has yet to apply bribery charges to anyone involved in the scandal, instead focusing on those who have abused authority. This has raised concerns that the investigators are “going easy” on the president and her aides, by apparently not recognizing the illegal nature of the foundations’ establishment.While there has been initial debate over whether a president should be probed while in office, a series of evidence, testimonies and public anger have tilted the scales against her. A Gallup Korea poll showed 5 percent approval rating for Park -- an all-time low for any South Korean president. An estimated 200,000 citizens also gathered in central Seoul on Saturday, demanding Park step down.

Its priority appears to be obtaining parliamentary approval for Prime Minister nominee Kim Byong-joon, who President Park Geun-hye appointed last week in the hope of bringing new momentum to stalled state affairs and appeasing public anger over the scandal. Kim Byong-joon The Blue House held a meeting of senior presidential secretaries Sunday afternoon, under the chairmanship of the recently appointed Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok, according to officials.This was the first official occasion led by the new chief of staff since he was named for the post last Thursday.“It is with a heavy heart that we embrace the stern message from the people, which was shown at Gwanghwamun Square yesterday,” Han said at the meeting.He also urged senior secretaries to unite and to cooperate in normalizing state affairs, possibly to defuse persistent complaints over the president’s recent staff reshuffling. Park, who is facing increasing public fury after her second address to the nation Friday, was not there. The key agenda of Sunday’s meeting, according to officials, was to promote the president’s communication with the legislature, especially through a possible summit involving the top three political parties.The secretariat also agreed on sending an official request to the National Assembly within the upcoming week, asking that the personnel confirmation hearing be held for Prime Minister nominee Kim.Kim, whose appointment has largely been criticized as the president’s attempt to bypass the political crises, said Saturday that he will not reject the nomination.“That is not an option,” he said, when asked whether he is willing to decline the nomination.However, Kim’s inauguration as prime minister is facing hurdles due to resistance by the opposition. If the three opposition parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, runner-up People’s Party and the progressive minority Justice Party -- use their joint majority to veto the mandatory parliamentary hearing, Kim will be unable to assume the post.For the presidential office, Kim taking office as prime minister is deemed the only alternative to “lesser desirable” options such as a neutral Cabinet consisting of ruling and opposition figures, or even the president’s resignation.“Last week,  placed focus on expressing apologies while this coming week will be more about finding actual solutions ,” said a Cheong Wa Dae official.It is likely that the president will meet with the leaders of political parties as early as this week to seek for their cooperation in confirming the prime minister nominee and resuming stalled state affairs, the official added.The top officials’ meeting came in the wake of the prosecution’s detention of An Chong-bum, former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, and Jeong Ho-seong, former personal secretary to the president.Both key officials are currently undergoing questioning over their alleged connections to the much-disputed presidential confidante Choi -- An for coercively raising funds for two foundations allegedly controlled by Choi, and Jeong for delivering to Choi a series of confidential state documents including presidential speeches.On Sunday, Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, finally appeared at the prosecutor’s office, heeding a months-long call to ascertain the truth over his suspected involvement in high-profile corruption cases.By Bae Hyun-jung","grip on key presidential ,on key presidential aides ,parliamentary approval for prime ,sunday grappled to find ,the prosecution tightening grip","['Kim Byong - joon', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.26157266  0.08844777

Woo Byung-woo The summons came a week after he resigned as part of Park's personnel reshuffle aimed at assuaging growing public anger over an escalating influence-peddling scandal involving her close confidante Choi Soon-sil.The probe into Woo opened after former special presidential inspector Lee Seok-soo referred Woo's case to the prosecution in August.Prosecutors vowed to look into all of the allegations that have been raised against Woo and Woo's family. Woo is alleged to have embezzled funds from a real-estate company run by his family. He is also purported to have peddled influence to help his son secure an easy job during his mandatory military service.Another suspicion against Woo is that he has wrongly reported the total amount of his properties by excluding a swath of land in Hwaseong, about 60 kilometers south of Seoul. The piece of land at issue is alleged to be registered under a false name, but actually owned by his wife.Regarding the real-estate property, prosecutors questioned Woo's wife and mother-in-law last Sunday and on Thursday, respectively.The prosecutors are expected to wrap up their probe into Woo soon and announce the results of the investigation as early as this week.","corruption allegations on sunday ,corruption allegations president park ,over corruption allegations president ,third ex presidential aide ,corruption allegations president","[""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Park', 'Woo Byung - woo']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20208234  0.25246796

Prosecutors charged An, the ex-presidential secretary of policy coordination who is currently under emergency detention, with abuse of power, accusing him of forcing local firms including Lotte Group, SK Group and Posco to contribute money to the Mir and K-Sports foundations. An was also charged with attempted coercion for his role in threatening a midsize ad company, which bought Posco’s in-house advertisement company Poreka, to hand over its shares to a third party associated with Cha Eun-taek, a close confidant of Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s feud-ridden friend. Former presidential aide An Chong-bum An maintains that he has never met Choi and companies voluntarily contributed money to the foundations. The court will hold a hearing to review the warrant application Saturday. The move came a day after Choi, who holds no public post, was formally arrested late Thursday night for being an accessory to An’s abuse of power and attempting to commit fraud. Top prosecutor Kim Soo-nam ordered the expansion of the current investigative team to thoroughly investigate the allegations surrounding President Park’s civilian friend Choi, who is accused of meddling in state affairs and coercing businesses for funds. Ten prosecutors will be added to the current 22, making it the biggest-ever team under the prosecution. Prosecutors arrested Jeong Ho-seong, a former secretary in charge of the president’s private affairs, late Thursday night for allegedly leaking confidential presidential speeches and documents related to diplomacy, security and economy to Choi. Jeong was one of Park’s closest aides, along with Lee Jae-man and Ahn Beong-guen. Next in line to face the probe is likely to be Woo Byung-woo, a former presidential secretary of civil affairs. The prosecutors are likely to call him in soon for questioning over allegations that he siphoned off his family-owned company’s funds, falsely reported his assets and used his influence to get his son assigned to a relatively easy post while serving mandatory military service. The prosecution is seen widening its probe after finding itself in the hot seat over what critics see as lukewarm efforts to investigate influence-peddling allegations and the lenient charges it brought against Choi, a central figure in the burgeoning scandal engulfing the Park administration. President Park said Friday that she would cooperate with prosecutors for the probe. She could face questioning for allegedly leaking classified information to Choi and allowing her to interfere with state affairs. The scandal erupted last week when a local TV channel reported to have found over 200 presidential documents on a trashed tablet PC purportedly used by Choi. The documents were said to include presidential speech scripts, with apparent signs of editing by the owner of the computer, and other documents that contained top-secret information on inter-Korean relations. Investigators said Friday that they found traces of Jeong’s involvement on a tablet PC containing presidential documents. Lee Seong-han, ex-secretary general of the Mir Foundation, claimed in an interview with local media that Jeong delivered a 30-centimeter-thick report about the president and state affairs to Choi daily.The prosecution allegedly concluded that the tablet PC belongs to Choi, despite her denial. The prosecution is also considering summoning Ahn Bong-geun, who is suspected of helping Choi enter and leave the presidential office, and Cha Eun-taek, Choi’s close aide who allegedly exerted influence over state-led projects in the culture sector upon his return from China. The prosecution is reportedly also investigating allegations involving Jang Si-ho, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil’s sister Soon-deuk, who is being accused of meddling in state affairs. It imposed a ban on her from leaving the country.

While appearing to embrace calls to ascertain the truth, Park’s agreement to cooperate with the prosecution’s probe signaled she would not step down from power.She also denied having known about Choi’s extensive influence and illicit profiteering, only admitting to what she described as a betrayal of trust from a longtime friend.“I feel sorry and miserable that a specific individual derived benefits in the process of key state projects which were meant to improve the nation’s economy and the people’s lives,” Park said Friday in an address broadcast live to the nation. President Park Geun-hye. YonhapThis was the second “apology” to come from the president since a series of reports early last week revealed circumstantial evidence showing Choi had long meddled in key state affairs. Though she claimed to be “deeply responsible” for the current circumstances, Park sidestepped criticism she failed in her duty as the state’s control tower.“The prosecution should hence stand free from all  and reveal the truth, on which strict judicial measures are to be taken,” Park said.She also referred to the prosecutors’ recent detention of Choi and the arrest of former Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum as part of a “thorough and prompt” investigation. An, who has long been one of the most trusted advisers to Park, recently claimed during questioning that he had contacted Choi only under direct orders from the president.Park’s detached tone was clearly distinguished from her earlier silence, which implied an apparent refusal to recognize the wrongdoings of her aides which could, in turn, lead to her own liability.The state chief’s acceptance to be questioned, making for the first case in South Korea’s political history of an incumbent president facing prosecutorial scrutiny, followed remarks by key officials the president should not be exempt from fact-finding procedures. “My answer is that all people, including the president, are equal before the law,” said prime minister nominee Kim Byong-joon on Thursday in a press briefing.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong also said during a parliamentary committee meeting that he would suggest to the president that she respond to prosecutorial calls for questioning.Facing an imminent probe, Park once again elaborated on her relationship with the scandal-ridden Choi.“Since I came to Cheong Wa Dae, I have severed ties with those around me, including family members, lest disreputable situations should occur,” she said in a trembling voice.“Having nobody to assist me with my personal affairs, I came to seek help from my longtime acquaintance Choi.”Her explanation, however, was contradicted by her estranged siblings -- younger sister Geun-ryeong and brother Ji-man, who have long held grudges against Choi and her late father Choi Tae-min. The two younger Parks had even filed a petition demanding their elder sister be “freed” from the elder Choi’s influence in 1990.“Because  stood by my side through my hardest times, it is true that in spite of myself, I lowered my guard,” Park said, claiming to be a victim to Choi’s betrayal of trust.The president also denied rumors she had taken up a shamanist cult or religion, seemingly distancing herself from Choi, who is the daughter of the late cult leader Choi Tae-min.“It is only suitable that I should offer explanations about what happened, but with the prosecutorial probe ongoing, I find it inappropriate to describe details on the case,” Park added.She then urged the government to resume its functions so as to prevent a vacuum in state affairs, especially in the areas of national security and the economy. Though she did not mention the recent series of staff reshuffling, the president’s call for government normalization was taken as a message to the opposition to stop their protest and cooperate with the incoming Cabinet.The opposition, which had been demanding a fundamentally renewed Cabinet under the leadership of an impartial prime minister, has been filing complaints over the hurried and covert way in which Park reshuffled key officials.By Bae Hyun-jung /","over resignation president park ,snowballing corruption scandal involving ,resignation president park geun ,investigation over resignation president ,resignation president park","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.15315682  0.37322304

The special prosecutors’ team in charge of the scandal is expected to examine possible scenarios and coordinate the procedure with Cheong Wa Dae, the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office.  Officials of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea watch as President Park Geun-hye apologizes for the Choi Soon-sil scandal on a national TV channel on Friday. YonhapThe probe should focus on whether Park was behind the speedy launch of two culture and sports funds with corporate donations totaling 77.4 billion won , over which Choi and former top Presidential Secretary An Chong-bum are suspected to have peddled influence. Other potential charges include whether the president allowed confidential documents to be leaked to Choi and for her to meddle in other state affairs. The prosecution has in the past questioned retired presidents and first ladies by sending written forms, making visits or summoning them in person. Former President Lee Myung-bak, for instance, underwent an investigation as the president-elect in 2008 over stock-rigging allegations through a three-hour interview outside the prosecutors’ office. After his term ended, late President Roh Moo-hyun appeared at the prosecutors’ office in 2009 to be probed for more than 10 hours for a graft scandal involving a close businessman.The prosecution will be cautious about its limited options due to sensitivities surrounding a possible calling in of Park. But given the gravity of the scandal, it may face public backlash if it opts for a written inquiry. Civic groups including the progressive People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy warned that a written survey would only result in watering down the president’s accountability, whereas the right-leaning Citizens United for Better Society suggested a special investigation scheme. While raising the need for the president to face the probe, prime minister nominee Kim Byong-joon also called Thursday for “prudence in the procedure and method.” The Constitution exempts the president from being prosecuted. But a local bar association and many of those in legal circles have argued that in light of the issue’s urgency, the prosecution should undertake a probe now to obtain evidence and pursue a trial after Park’s term ends. A group of 69 criminal law professors issued a statement Friday, saying there is “no sanctuary” for any Korean under the law, and given the mushrooming allegations surrounding Park, the probe is not only possible, but essential. “An accomplice can be both probed and prosecuted whether or not the president is in office so it is wrong to skip the president-related parts in the investigation process,” they said. “To secure evidence for prosecution after her retirement, the investigators should carry out suspect questioning, reference witness inquiries and confiscation and search as long as it does not create an obstacle for the president’s state management.” Earlier in the day, People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy lodged an indictment against Park, arguing the president is the art and part of Choi. Another focal point is whether an independent special investigation will be set up, as Park expressed her willingness to accept the plan. The ruling and opposition camps have been at loggerheads over the issue. But after Park’s remarks, Rep. Chung Jin-suk, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, showed a more flexible stance at a meeting later in the day with new presidential Chief of Staff Han Kwang-ok, saying the party is willing to agree to the opposition’s demand for an independent team if “political neutrality is guaranteed.”Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chair of the main opposition Democratic Party, once again urged the launch of the special investigation headed by an opposition-endorsed prosecutor, calling it a “minimal precondition and start” to inquire into the president.

The Democratic Party said that Park should meet three conditions for any talks to be realized: cancel the designation of Kim Byong-joon as prime minister, accept a special counsel probe led by a truly independent team, not appointed by Park herself, and a parliamentary investigation. “If the president really feels she’s responsible for the current paralysis of state affairs, she should accept ” Rep. Choo said. Earlier in the week, the embattled conservative leader appointed two former opposition figures as the prime minister and her chief of staff, which were widely taken as a sign that Park would fight her biggest political crisis her own way. The appointments, however, further angered the liberal camp, which controls the parliament, as they came as a surprise without any prior communication with opposition parties. Some party figures are even mooting a possible campaign to oust her, emboldened by polls showing Park’s approval ratings in free fall. Moon Jae-in, the Democratic Party’s former chief and a presidential hopeful, said that with many Koreans demanding her removal from office, Park has no option but to relinquish her power to a National Assembly-formed Cabinet, if she wants to stay in office. “The president’s apology doesn’t show sincere self-reflection. She is trying to evoke sympathy with her apology and by consenting to undergo a probe,” he said. The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, said it was a sincere, heart-felt apology and urged opposition parties to together seek ways to address the crisis of leadership. “President Park admitted her failure, volunteered to undergo investigation and sought help in the current crisis,” said Rep. Chung Jin-suk, Saenuri’s whip. “She showed her willingness to discuss with the legislature and opposition parties,” he said. Saenuri’s 129 lawmakers issued an apology, saying they, too, have done wrong by not doing enough to prevent the current situation. “The party will cooperate fully with the ongoing prosecutorial probe and make utmost efforts to help unearth the truth behind the Choi Soon-sil scandal,” the joint statement read. By Korea Herald staff /","apology insufficient the president ,calling her second apology ,pressure on president park ,up pressure on president ,liberal party chairwoman said","['Democratic Party of Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Choo Mi - ae']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.25624833  0.43037748

Kim also held the highest approval rating of 83 percent in his first year, the pollster added.Park's approval was 2 percent in Seoul and 0 percent in the liberal-leaning South Jeolla Province, with the figures in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, largely supportive of the conservative bloc, standing at 10 percent.The rating among people in their 20s and 30s recorded 1 percent, while 13 percent of those aged 60 and above approved of her performance.In the wake of the scandal, the main opposition Democratic Party's support rating came to 31 percent, beating the ruling Saenuri Party's 18 percent. The People's Party posted 13 percent.The poll was conducted between Tuesday and Thursday with 1,005 adults across the country, with a 3.1 percent margin of error.On Friday, Park made her second apology on the scandal, adding she is willing to accept the prosecutors' investigation if necessary.The presidential office announced a reshuffle of top officials earlier this week to allay public outrage, only to face a barrage of criticism for not consulting with political parties beforehand.","sitting south korean presidents ,rating crashes to record ,scandal president park geun ,park approval rating plunged ,her approval rating crash","['Park Geun', 'south korean', 'Gallup Korea', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37819463  0.64725065

The 60-year-old has been put under custody since late Monday.With Choi under detention, the prosecutors' office said they will roll out a thorough investigation on the allegations to reveal the truth and mobilize all available resources. Following the decision to expand the probe, 31 prosecutors will work for the special investigation team, up from the current 22.The allegations surrounding Choi, who accessed and edited presidential speeches and documents and may have benefited financially from her connection to the chief executive, continued to expand.Experts said the increase of the investigation team also came amid the rising calls that Park should also cooperate with the probe and respond to questions if the need arises.Prosecutors, meanwhile, arrested Jeong Ho-seong, a former secretary in charge of the president's private affairs, late Thursday night for allegedly leaking confidential presidential documents that included diplomatic and security issues to Choi. Investigators said they found traces of Jeong's involvement on a tablet PC presumed to have been used by Choi.Sources said investigators have concluded the abandoned tablet PC initially presumed to have been Choi's does in fact belong to her. The scandal surfaced after a local broadcaster broke the story last month after it retrieved data from the device.Choi, however, has been claiming the device does not belong to her and that she does not know how to use tablets. Investigators found selfies of Choi along with photos of other relatives, which they say points to ownership.Lee Kyung-jae, Choi's lawyer, said he accepted the court's decision in regards to the arrest, but made clear this move does not necessarily mean that his client is admitting to the charges leveled against her.Cha Eun-taek, one of Choi's closest associates in the cultural sector, is also set to undergo questioning after returning home from China next week.","prosecutors expand special investigation ,scandal surrounding president park ,park confidante scandal special ,to formally arrest choi ,years over alleged abuse","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.22037911  0.31373939

President Park Geun-hye apologizes to the public at a news conference on Friday. “I feel sorry and miserable that a specific individual derived benefits in the process of key state projects, the purpose of which was to improve the nation’s economy and the people’s lives,” Park said in an address broadcast live to the nation.The address, delivered 10 days after her previous acknowledgement of Choi’s suspected interference in presidential speeches, came amid burgeoning criticism against her recent personnel decision regarding the Cabinet and presidential secretariat.“I have ordered the presidential secretariat and security team to fully cooperate in the prosecutorial investigation,” the president said.“I, too, am ready to accede to the probe if necessary.”Though the president refrained from further comments, citing the ongoing prosecutorial probe, she did once again refute rampant rumors her connection to Choi was based on a shamanist cult background.Park’s consent followed remarks made by key officials the previous day that the president, too, could become subject to a prosecutorial probe over her alleged involvement in the state scandal. “There are many questions regarding an investigation into the president. My answer is that all people, including the president, are equal before the law,” said Prime Minister-nominee Kim Byong-joon.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong also said he would propose the president respond to a prosecutorial investigation.By Bae Hyun-jung","her mistakes the president ,the president also urged ,over choi scandal president ,agree to prosecutors questioning ,scandal president park geun","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47596592  0.69610751

Choi, a 60-year-old civilian who has no background in policy and is a daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min, allegedly traded barbs with the prosecution over whether Choi can be seen as an accessary to abuse of power during the warrant application hearing. Choi has denied most of her charges. She maintains that she does not even know the ex-presidential aide of policy coordination An Chong-bum. Choi left the Seoul Central District Court after attending nearly two-hour hearing. Her lawyer told reporters that Choi candidly made statements in the courtroom and she would accept the court's decision.One of the charges the prosecution brought against Choi is that she collaborated with a former presidential aide to force local conglomerates to contribute money worth 80 billion won  to the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation. She also allegedly pulled strings for her company the Blue-K to strike a contract with the state-run Grand Korea Leisure.The prosecution views An, who resigned from his post last weekend and was put under emergency detention on Wednesday night, as a main suspect. Choi was charged as an accomplice as she holds no public office. Another charge against Choi is attempted fraud, which critics in the legal circle say contradict her alleged charges of embezzlement. The prosecution obtained evidence that she attempted to funnel 700 million won from the K-Sports Foundation into her company the Blue-K. The charge of fraud, which means Choi stole asset from others, can be applied when the K-Sports Foundation and Mir Foundation are seen as not belonging to Choi. But a series of allegations suggest that Choi is a de-facto owner of the foundations. Criticism surfaced over the charges the prosecution brought against Choi as critics argue that the charges only carry light punishment and do not accurately reflect what she did.   Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, blasted the prosecution for charging her with abuse of power and attempted fraud carrying lower punishment. It said that she should be charged with bribery. Choi can face up to life sentence for bribery. But abuse of authority carries less than 5 years in prison and 10 million won for penalty.As the court granted the prosecution a warrant, it has up to 20 days to investigate the suspect and decide whether or not to indict her.The prosecution continued to grill those involved in the influence-peddling scandal Thursday.Prosecutors questioned an executive director, surnamed Kim, from Samsung Group as a witness as part of the probe into allegations that Choi Soon-sil forced local companies to pay money into the embattled foundations. Samsung is the third conglomerate to be investigated over the suspicions after Lotte and SK, among 53 companies from 19 business groups. Samsung‘s affiliates allegedly donated some 20 billion won to the foundations. Samsung paid 2.8 million euro into Widec Sports, founded by Choi, to help her and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra to buy a horse. Chung, a 19-year-old horseback rider, is suspected of entering Ewha Womans University on the back of her mother’s influence. The prosecution are looking into financial transactions at Samsung’s affiliates. Investigators are questioning the ex-presidential aid An for the second consecutive day to find out whether he abused his authority to raise donations for the embattled foundations and whether president Park directly ordered him to help the operation of the foundations. An allegedly said that local firms voluntarily contributed the money to the foundations, denying his alleged abuse of authority. He also initially said he had voluntarily participated in raising donations out of loyalty to President Park, but later admitted that Park was involved in running the foundations. The prosecution also summoned the former head of Poreka, an in-house public relations company for Posco, under suspicions that he forced a mid-sized ad company, which bought Poreka, to hand over its shares to a third party in collaboration with Cha Eun-taek, one of Choi’s confidants.The prosecution is looking into bank accounts belonging to Cha, who is accused of exerting influence on state-backed projects using his ties with Choi, and companies related to him.It is adjusting schedule to summon for questioning Cha, who fled to China in September amid the snowballing scandal.

Lee Jong-kul asked Park which part contained shameful content.“I can feel such tinge throughout the whole book,” was the president’s answer, which immediately kindled endless parodies on the internet.Unperturbed by such mockery, Park once again adopted an abstract term in advocating the need of the state-published textbooks.“One who doesn’t know one’s history becomes a person with no soul, and without a proper history education, one’s soul may only turn abnormal,” she said the following month, this time in a Cabinet meeting.Following a series of reports revealing the president’s reliance on Choi from clothing selection to personnel appointments, some suspect that Park’s incomprehensible choice of expressions may have come from the pseudo-pastor’s daughter.“President Park has often flustered the people with answers that may not be deemed those spoken by a civilized state leader, but now the question is solved,” said the runner-up opposition People’s Party in a recent statement following the outbreak of the Choi scandal.The president has also often come under fire for her “third-party perspective” when speaking, stepping aside from the responsibility as state leader.“The government should come up with countermeasures,” Park said in June last year, following the outbreak of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome.Her address, describing herself as an outside observer aloof from the government for which she is chief, was jeered as an “out-of-body experience” speech technique.Meanwhile, recently escalating calls for the president’s resignation have sparked renewed interest in a now-ironic lapse made by Park several years ago.“I hereby resign from my 15 years of presidency, during which I have shared the people’s joys and sorrows,” said then-presidential aspirant Park in November 2012, a month ahead of the 18th presidential election in which she would ultimately prove victorious.Having intended to say “lawmaker post” instead of “presidency,” the startled Park immediately retracted her words and rephrased the sentence, vowing to focus on the presidential campaign.At the time, the slip of tongue was taken as being triggered by the tense circumstances, especially as Park had until then been known as a taciturn and dispassionate character.By Bae Hyun-jung","late cult leader choi ,cult leader choi tae ,her days as lawmaker ,choi scandal sheds new ,hye has often bewildered","['the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29888928  0.53006214

Mindful of criticism over the president’s lack of communication, Kim also introduced plans to set up consultative mechanisms with the ruling and opposition camps as well as civil society. Kim Byong-joon “There are many questions regarding an investigation involving the president. My answer is that all people, including the president, are equal before the law,” said the nominee, who served late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.“Despite mixed interpretations over the Constitution exempting the president from prosecution, my position is it’s possible to investigate her. But given her status as head of state, we need to be prudent about the procedure and method.” Kim’s nomination came amid surging calls to hold the president accountable for the influence-peddling scandal involving her decades-long confidante. Lawmakers have also been urging Park to launch a neutral Cabinet led by a prime minister with personnel management authority.But the three opposition parties, which dominate the assembly, vowed to reject his mandatory confirmation hearing, taking issue with Cheong Wa Dae’s unilateral announcement without any prior discussions.  Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, reaffirmed the stance after the conference, saying the intra-opposition agreement remains intact regardless of the nominee’s “personality, qualifications or appeals.” The minor opposition People’s Party echoed the view, issuing a statement calling for Kim to table his bid for the premiership.  The ruling Saenuri Party, in contrast, urged the opposition forces to join the confirmation hearing or “let the confusion and instability deepen,” saying Kim’s appointment would facilitate their demand for the neutral Cabinet. The scandal is essentially rooted in the lopsided presidential power and assistance mechanism, the nominee said, raising the possibility to recommend Park’s withdrawal of her party affiliation if the issue would further hamper state management. “I am well aware of the doubts and criticism about me, particularly given the problems that arose in the run-up to the nomination due to a brief breakdown of the Cheong Wa Dae system,” Kim said. “I regret it myself, and will do my best to fulfill my responsibility and this historical calling,” he added, pausing for a moment to hold back tears. During a one-on-one meeting last Saturday, Park agreed to let him take over economic and social policies and suggest new members of the Cabinet, Kim noted. Though still opposed to some of her initiatives such as the reintroduction of state-authored history textbooks and a planned deployment of the US missile shield, he was confident that any disagreement could be resolved through talks and compromise.  Kim also displayed resistance to Park’s recent call for talks on a constitutional amendment for a change in the current single-term, five-year presidency, which he said ought to be driven by the people and the assembly. “With the president facing national criticism, the National Assembly, both its ruling and opposition sides, is a source of strength to engineer the government,” Kim said, soliciting their support. “I will create a standing consultative body that will provide the strength. And in that process, a neutral Cabinet will be formed … and I am also considering overhauling the Prime Minister’s Office.” By Shin Hyon-hee","law at news conference ,president park geun hye ,100 percent the constitutionally ,scandal president park geun ,for scandal president park","['Park Geun', 'Kim Byung - joon', 'Kookmin University']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.02454544 0.22912101 0.10286799],Shin Hyon-hee,Politics,11,2016,"liberal president roh moo hyun ,university pledged to exert 100 ,her decades long confidante lawmakers ,the law at news conference ,calls to hold the president","['Park Geun', 'Kim Byung - joon', 'Kookmin University', 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Cheong', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'Democratic Party', 'People ’s Party', 'Kim', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Kim', 'US', 'Kim', 'Park ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim', 'Cabinet', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",12,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.02454544 0.22912101 0.10286799]

Political talk is shifting in that direction, with Park being pressured to face the music. Park’s Prime Minister-designate Kim Byong-joon, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong and several lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party on Thursday publicly floating the possibility -- or even necessity -- of Park being investigated.“My stance is that  is possible under the current Constitution,” the prime minister-nominee said in a press conference. The remark echoed the view of Justice Minister Kim who said earlier in the day that if deemed necessary, the prosecution would seek to question Park. Civic activists hold banners reading “Park Geun-hye Out” at a rally in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, Thursday. “I think President Park is well aware of the gravity of this case. Should the need  arise with the progress of the ongoing prosecutorial investigation, we may appeal ” he told lawmakers at a parliamentary session. South Korea’s Constitution exempts the president from prosecution, except in cases of insurrection or treason. While the president is exempt from criminal liability, there are mixed interpretations in legal circles as to whether she is also exempt from investigation. The minister said the mainstream interpretation of the Constitution limits the prosecution’s use of investigative power on the incumbent president, for example, barring a raid on her residence.But if Park is cooperative, the probe can reach beyond those limits, he added. According to a survey released Thursday by Realmeter, a local pollster, 70.4 percent of respondents think Park should be grilled. President Park is facing accusations that she let her civilian friend Choi interfere in key state affairs in a critical crisis that even threatens her presidency.  The scandal erupted last week when a local TV channel reported that it had found over 200 presidential documents, including presidential speech scripts, on a trashed tablet PC purportedly used by Choi.  The embattled leader admitted to having sought Choi’s help on speeches last Tuesday, but has since made no further comment on other allegations. A growing number of Saenuri lawmakers think that Park voluntarily going under the prosecutorial probe may be the only way to salvage the current conservative administration and regain public confidence.“Party chair Lee Jung-hyun may officially propose it to Park, asking the president to embrace the measure,” an unnamed party member was quoted by local media as saying. Over the weekend, the state prosecutors investigating the Choi scandal sought to search the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, but were denied access to the premises.Cheong Wa Dae, citing security reasons, instead offered to provide documents that the investigators requested. Historically, no incumbent president has been subject to a prosecutorial investigation in South Korea. In 2003, public prosecutors considered launching a probe into the then-President Roh Moo-hyun who was embroiled in a bribery scandal. Though the president said he would undergo the investigation, the prosecutors later decided not to pursue the matter. In 2008, prosecutors conducted a probe into then President-elect Lee Myung-bak, who was accused of having been involved in a stock price manipulation scheme, but the investigation took place before he was sworn in, in 2009.  By Korea Herald staff /","president park face probe ,ridden confidante political talk ,scandal ridden confidante political ,political talk is shifting ,woong and several lawmakers","['Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Justice', 'Kim Hyun - woong']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45922309  0.62223315

It is to prevent public officials from getting advantages for free,” Kim said. She also stressed that efforts to set proper guidelines should continue in order to successfully implement the law.

Han Gwang-okThe embattled president already appointed two new senior secretaries for civil affairs and public relations Sunday amid mounting calls for a sweeping personnel reshuffle of both her office and Cabinet.With the latest appointments, Park replaced three of her 10 senior secretaries, as well as her chief of staff."" has been appointed as he is well suited to assist the president from the citizens' perspective and stably manage state affairs given his deep knowledge and various experience, as well as the values of reconciliation and inclusion he has upheld,"" presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk told reporters.The 74-year-old Han, a former four-term lawmaker, served as a chief of staff to late liberal President Kim Dae-jung who ran the country from 1998 to 2003. In 1998, he also served as head of a tripartite panel consisting of representatives of employees, employers and the government.  Hur, the new senior secretary for political affairs, formerly worked as a journalist for several local media outlets including The Kyunghang Shinmun and local broadcaster KBS. He also served as a lawmaker from 2008 to 2012. On Wednesday, Park tapped Kim Byong-joon, a former policy adviser to the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, as new prime minister and nominated the new ministers of finance and public security. Opposition parties, however, oppose what they call the ""unilateral"" nominations.At the center of the massive scandal gripping the country is Choi Soon-sil, whom critics portray as the ""eminence grise"" of the Park administration.Choi is alleged to have used her decadeslong ties to the president to meddle in state affairs, particularly presidential matters, such as Park's wardrobe, public speeches and even the selection of presidential secretaries. The 60-year-old woman is also suspected of having peddled undue influence in the creation and operation of two nonprofit foundations dedicated to promoting Korean culture and sports. She is being investigated to see if she misappropriated money from the foundations.The scandal has sent Park's approval rating plunging to a woeful single digit and prompted nationwide calls for her resignation.","thursday appointed her new ,staff president park geun ,her new chief of ,thursday appointed her ,appointed her new chief","['Park Geun - hye', 'Han', 'the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion', 'Hur Won - je']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52382088  0.69819462

Choi, a 60-year-old civilian who is a longtime friend of Park and the daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min, is accused of regularly accessing presidential documents, exerting influence on government policies and receiving favors the president herself condoned.Choi was taken into custody late Monday on 48-hour detention, hours after she appeared before the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul for questioning. Already dubbed the “shadow president” by public and the media, Choi has denied most of the charges. She claimed a tablet PC with records of receiving emails containing presidential documents did not belong to her, although it contained her selfies and other personal files.Song Gi-ho of Lawyers for a Democratic Society, also known as Minbyun, said Wednesday that Cheong Wa Dae had told him Choi does not have clearance to handle classified information. This means whoever showed Choi the classified presidential documents could be punished by up to two years in prison or up to five years in prison if the documents were related to diplomatic secrets.She was provisionally charged with obstructing the exercise of rights and attempted fraud. The court is to deliberate on the warrant Thursday at around 3 p.m. and is expected to reach a decision later that day.If the court grants the prosecution a warrant, it has up to 20 days to investigate the suspect and decide whether or not to indict her.An Chong-bum, a former senior presidential secretary. Earlier in the day, investigators summoned former Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum on his alleged involvement in raising funds worth some 80 billion won  for Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation, which was allegedly a cover to siphon money to Choi.“I will take responsibility for any wrongdoings,” he told media after appearing for questioning. He refused to comment on whether he forced local conglomerates to make donations to the foundations, whether he knew Choi personally and whether he had acted under Park’s orders. Choi has claimed she has no personal connection to An. While An denied the allegations, testimonies of those involved in the scandal have indicated otherwise.Jung Hyun-sik, a former secretary-general of the K-Sports Foundation, said he requested 8 billion won from SK Group under orders from An and Choi. Officials from Lotte Group reportedly told the prosecution it had been coerced to “donate” 7 billion won.Lee Seung-cheol, vice chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries, reportedly also told investigators that Cheong Wa Dae officials had asked the FKI to pressure the companies.But according to local news agency Newsis, An said he contacted the companies regarding the two foundations under direct orders from Park, and was never in contact with Choi. He reportedly also said there was a “direct deal” between Choi and Park, in an apparent refusal to take the fall for the president.Data by local conglomerate watch website Chaebul.com showed that 53 corporations had donated to the foundations. Of those, 12 were logging deficits.Investigators are also mulling summoning Park’s aide Jeong Ho-seong for questioning next week. Local media reported last week that he had delivered a thick folder of files to Choi from the presidential office nearly every night, which were then returned to Cheong Wa Dae and made into actual policy.Prosecutors are also looking into allegations that Samsung Electronics handed some 3.5 billion won to Choi via a paper company jointly established by Choi and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra. Chung is suspected of receiving unlawful favors while attending Ewha Womans University and of receiving a loan from KEB Hana Bank.The prosecution on Tuesday visited eight banks with a search warrant to acquire financial transactions of those suspected of being linked to the scandal, including TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek, who is accused of exerted influence on state-backed projects using his ties with Choi. The Education Ministry has also launched an investigation into Ewha Womans University on allegations surrounding Chung.

Their checkered relationship began in 2004 when the 62-year-old nominee was policy chief for late President Roh Moo-hyun. Park was chair of the then-main opposition Grand National Party, the predecessor of the current ruling Saenuri Party. They clashed over real estate, welfare and other policies, and the discord deepened as Park’s opposition staged a stringent protest against Roh’s drive to relocate the administrative capital to Sejong City. Kim had won the trust of the liberal president in the campaign period and spearheaded the initiative as head of the Presidential Committee on Government Innovation & Decentralization before working at Cheong Wa Dae.  Kim Byong-joon, a professor of Kookmin University, gives a lecture at the Convention of the Saenuri Party election in Seoul on May 2015. In 2006, Kim, who taught public administration at Kookmin University, stepped down less than two weeks after being appointed as deputy prime minister for education amid the opposition’s offensive over thesis plagiarism allegations.  Yet he continued to serve Roh as a special policy adviser until returning to academia at the end of the president’s term in 2008. In recent months, Kim has been vocal in criticizing the Park administration’s policies, such as on the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks. During a lecture for Saenuri lawmakers last May, he lashed out at them for only engaging in a “power game” instead of serious policy discussions, which he said led to the party’s landslide defeat in the April general election.  Until recently, Kim had been floated as a likely candidate to succeed Rep. Park Jie-won as the minor opposition People’s Party’s interim chief. Park’s latest selection of Kim as prime minister is seen as an attempt to defuse the opposition camp’s calls for accountability over the Choi Soon-sil debacle and the creation of a neutral Cabinet. Though Kim is credited for his sound policy views and personal integrity, his path to the Prime Minister’s Office already faces hurdles as the three opposition parties dominating the parliament have pledged to veto his mandatory confirmation hearing. A fresh source of contention also emerged Wednesday over the nominee’s ties to the father-in-law of Woo Byung-woo, the disgraced former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs implicated in the Choi scandal. In 2013, Kim reportedly attended the funeral of Lee Sang-dal, the owner of a construction company, lauding his “confidence in clean, righteous and transparent management.” Opposition lawmakers raised suspicions that Woo may still be wielding influence though he has been sacked. Kim’s remarks at the funeral could also prove problematic, given the ongoing investigation into tax evasion allegations involving Lee’s family company. In a meeting with reporters Wednesday, Kim said he was there because Lee was head of a fraternity of fellow countrymen from Goryeong County, North Gyeongsang Province, and he did not know Woo at all. Even if he passes the hearing, his future role would chiefly hinge on how much sway Park is willing to hand over. In nominating Kim, Cheong Wa Dae apparently took into account demands for diluting the president’s administrative powers by making way for the prime minister to actually exert his constitutionally guaranteed right to pick other Cabinet members and request their dismissal. The designation of Park Seung-joo as the candidate for the new public safety and security minister was based on Kim’s recommendation. Yet despite her election pledge to empower the premiership, Park has given so little leeway to her prime ministers throughout her nearly four years in office, especially in personnel affairs, they have been nicknamed “proxy speech readers.”The latest nominations also triggered backlash even among some ruling party legislators due chiefly to the absence of prior consultations with not only the assembly, but other presidential aides who testified they heard the announcement from media.

Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon “Her unilateral appointment of new Cabinet members is an act of belittling the people,” the mayor said, calling for the conservative president to resign immediately. President Park is facing accusations that she let her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil meddle in state affairs. She chose Kim Byong-joon, a former policymaker for the liberal administration of President Roh Moo-hyun, as the new prime minister. The embattled president apparently did not have any prior consultations with any political party -- not even her own Saenuri Party. Political groups have been discussing how to form a neutral Cabinet. “The president, without even making a sincere apology , unilaterally named a new prime minister on her own. This is an insult to all the people who have been calling for truth and justice,” Rep. Ahn said. Calls for President Park to be ousted have been growing among civic groups, political minorities and the public since the scandal erupted last week.  So far, mainstream political parties, including the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, have tried to distance themselves from extreme voices. The Justice Party, a far-left minority with six lawmakers, demands the president leave her office. Mayor Park also vowed to join social movements to bring down the president, saying he will support all kinds of peaceful demonstrations that take place in Seoul.

She had returned to South Korea over the weekend after nearly two months of staying in Europe. The 60-year-old is suspected of influencing state affairs via her decades-old friendship with the president. She is also accused of siphoning off funds from two nonprofit organizations that received some tens of billions of won in donations from local firms. Prosecutors are currently looking into whether Choi and others involved in the matter pressured the companies to donate, using ties to the president.Choi is known to have been denying most of the allegations raised against her. Public outrage over the scandal has been escalating, with Park's approval ratings dipping to a woeful single digit.Faced with growing calls from the public to take responsibility, Park carried out a partial reshuffle of her secretariat Sunday, followed by another one on Wednesday. The president will soon fill other vacant positions, according to presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk. Park, however, has not issued an official statement regarding the scandal since she apologized in a nationally televised address last week for handing over drafts of presidential speeches to Choi and letting her edit them. Choi -- the daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min, a leader of a questionable religious group who died in 1994 -- does not hold any official governmental post. Park is known to have developed a friendship with the Choi family after her mother and then-first lady Yook Young-soo was assassinated in 1974.","warrant to arrest woman ,state prosecutors on wednesday ,political scandal state prosecutors ,monday prosecutors put choi ,political scandal rocking the","['Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41775674  0.28664333

""I will take responsibility for any wrongdoings."" He declined to further comment on allegations raised against him and said he will ""tell everything truthfully to the prosecution.""The summons came a few days after Park directed all her top secretaries to submit resignations for the latest scandal and accepted a portion of them, including An's, on Sunday.Earlier on Wednesday, President Park carried out another round of reshuffle, tapping Kim Byong-joon, who served as policy advisor to late President Roh Moo-hyun, as the new prime minister.Prosecutors, meanwhile, have been accelerating their investigation into allegations surrounding Choi, suspected of interfering in state affairs and amassing huge profits using her ties to the president.They said they are also looking into suspicions that the country's largest conglomerate Samsung Group gave some 2.8 million euros  to Widec Sports in Germany, established by Choi, between September and October last year. The German company is suspected to having been set up to receive funds from the foundations.

But there are...","Supporters of President Park Geun-hye are quickly turning their backs on her amid the snowballing allegations that her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil meddled in state affairs. A latest poll showed that Park’s popularity rating neared the unprecedented 10 percent range, with her popularity notably shrinking even in her traditional strongholds -- North Gyeongsang Province, Daegu and the over-60 age group. But there are still avid fans showing unwavering support for President Park, with many blaming North Korea, those who sympathize with North Korea and even the media for “framing” the president. The website called “Park Samo” -- an abbreviation for a group of people who love Park Geun-hye -- still has some 67,000 members, with a host of comments left to cheer up the president. “Park’s parents died while protecting his country. Park is a patriot who has married this country and worked hard for prosperity of this country,” Lee Seok-in, the chief of the minor right-wing Daehan Party, told The Korea Herald. Daehan Party members have staged a rally near Cheonggye Stream in central Seoul, condemning the media for “inciting division among the public” by reporting on allegations despite Park’s public apology. “The Choi Soon-sil allegations are unconfirmed and they might have been raised by left-wing, North Korean sympathizers,” he said. “What is important now is that we stand united for our country against North Korea. It is not time to drag down our patriotic president.”Ahn Jae-chul, president of The World Peace Freedom United, said President Park is the only person who can keep South Korea safe from North Korea’s military provocations.“I am not defending Choi Soon-sil. She should be investigated and punished accordingly. Choi is to blame for the current chaos, not our president. Choi put Park in a difficult position by abusing her power,” he said. “North Korea sympathizers are cashing in on the situation to further create confusion.” Park Gi-bo, a 80-year-old retiree who was hanging out with his friends at Tapgol Park in central Seoul, said that it is surprising to see the public calling for the resignation of the nation’s leader.“Park is anyway the president we elected. She has done so well in ruling the country so far. We should support her until the end of her presidency,” he said. “How can state prosecutors attempt to raid Cheong Wa Dae, the palace for the president?” “Back in our day, people who talked about our leader like that were taken to prison.”Some were understanding of Park’s reliance on Choi, attributing it to the solitary life she has led after losing her parents at a young age.“Park must have been used by Choi,” a 67-year-old security guard surnamed Bae said. “I pity our president.”Her mother, former first lady Yuk Young-soo, was assassinated in 1974 by a pro-North Korean agent when Park was only 21. Her father Park Chung-hee was killed by his own intelligence chief in 1979.  A political expert called the loyalty toward Park “political mercy.” “Park’s loyal supporters feel sympathy for the president, thinking that their leader was betrayed by Choi,” said Bae Jong-chan, chief director at Research & Research. “Emotional support for Park overrides rational criticism in this situation.”“As the public continue to call for her to resign, they will likely solidify their support for Park.” But most supporters of Park said they have had enough of the president in light of the scandal. “I supported President Park for her conservative policies. But President Park has crossed a line this time by ignoring the Constitution and remaining silent about the allegations surrounding Choi Soon-sil,” said Colin Kang, 28, who voted for Park in the 2012 presidential election. “It is no more than blind faith to support Park at this moment,” he said. “It is embarrassing that the president tainted the image of conservative values through her personal actions.”Kim Ki-chul, a 70-year-old retiree, said that Park clearly made a mistake and hurt the pride of her supporters.“She should admit to her wrongdoing and clarify all the suspicions,” he said. “But she should firmly complete her presidency without stepping down to stop the country further plunging into chaos.” Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live, said that the withdrawal of support toward Park signals distrust and skepticism about the whole governing system.“When a scandal is about political ideology and policies, the fall in popularity among core supporters is limited,” he said. “But such a corruption scandal can face strong backlash within the support base.”By Ock Hyun-ju","her popularity notably shrinking ,unshaken supporters of president ,snowballing allegations that her ,her longtime friend choi ,popularity notably shrinking even","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park ’s', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Daegu']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.35796708  0.34961212

In order to address the problem, political analysts said, the president should transfer her power to what they described as a “neutral Cabinet” and limit her role to “nominal head of state,” such as that of the United Kingdom. “President Park is not able to exercise her power and has lost legitimacy completely,” said Yoon Pyeong-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University in a phone interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday.The professor said the president is also “incapable of” dealing with foreign affairs and security matters, noting those issues are as important as other domestic issues to South Korea. “Park should back down from the role of president,” Yoon said. Since Park apologized for leaking presidential speeches by Cheong Wa Dae staff members to Choi Soon-sil, Park’s long-time friend, a series of other allegations have emerged that Choi also had access to secret documents dealing with Seoul’s approach to North Korea.  Confronted with mounting political pressure that has sent her approval ratings to an all-time low, the president ordered the resignation of her senior presidential secretaries, and Cheong Wa Dae has vowed to conduct a personnel overhaul. But the president has been accused of not taking what critics view as her “biggest crisis” seriously. Cheong Wa Dae blocked prosecutors from seizing their documents and the president has yet to make any official further comments after her two-minute apology last week.   Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy, said the only solution to overcome the crisis is for the president to allow prosecutors to investigate her. Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party insisted the incumbent president shouldn’t be subject to prosecution and, therefore, investigation. “It seems to me that the president is holding back the effort to address the current crisis,” said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy “Park shouldn’t sit down and watch the prosecutorial investigation like an outsider.”Regarding the political parties, analysts said that both the president’s governing Saenuri Party and the opposition bloc should agree to build “neutral Cabinet,” in which the Assembly elect a prime minister who names other Cabinet members. Until now, rival parties have differed over how to form a new Cabinet. Opposition parties, who control the Assembly, pledged to block a Saenuri-led Cabinet, saying the ruling party is trying to elect key posts, including the premiership, in their favor.Analysts said that while they understand the concern over Cheong Wa Dae and Saenuri’s sway over the formation of new Cabinet, Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party should stop political bickering and push for the measure. “Now, the ball is in the court of the Minjoo Party,” said Lee Nae-young, a professor of comparative politics at Korea University. “While letting the president elect a Prime Minster, Minjoo can recommend only neutral politicians.” Professor Lee warned that if the main opposition continued to be reluctant, the public would assail their motive of opposition. If the people begin to assume they are only thinking about their interests in the 2017 presidential election, they would face trouble,” said Lee. The beleaguered Saenuri, the analysts said, should overhaul themselves by replacing its leadership dominated by faction close to the president. Instead, more centrist members should take over and try to better resonate with average voters critical of Park’s leadership. “Saenuri leadership has been working for a front office for Cheong Wa Dae and thus their role has come to an end” said Analyst Yoon Tae-gon, adding that Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, standard-bearer of pro-Park faction, should give in to mounting pressure for resignation.  Pointing to the role of civil society who brought down authoritarian governments in the 1960s and the 80s through grassroots protests, the analysts said that the government should let the protesters speak out and express their views. “Any establishment in society has never given up their power voluntarily,” said Professor Yoon. “What is happening is power struggle between the president and civic society. The president and her inner circle should let the public speak out.”By Yeo Jun-suk","undermined south korea democracy ,burgeoning scandal involving president ,choi scandal undermines confidence ,scandal involving president park ,the problem political analysts","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Cabinet']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.34039617  0.52200621

Investigators are expected to request an arrest warrant Wednesday.Choi Soon-sil Jung Hyun-sik, a former secretary general of the K-Sports Foundation, told local media that An had instructed him to demand 8 billion won from SK Group.According to data from Chaebul.com, a total of 53 corporations had donated a combined 77.4 billion won to the foundations. Hyundai Motor led the group with 6.88 billion won, followed by SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics with 6.8 billion won and 6 billion won, respectively.But 12 companies had made contributions while reporting losses, fueling suspicions that they were pressured to make the donations. The prosecution has already raided An’s home and his office in Cheong Wa Dae to look for evidence concerning the allegations.The prosecution has stepped up its investigation into the Choi scandal, visiting eight banks with a search warrant as of Tuesday to investigate the financial transactions of those with links to the scandal.In a bid to acquire financial transaction records of those related to the allegations, investigators visited headquarters of eight banks -- Woori Bank, Standard Chartered Bank Korea, Shinhan Bank, KB Bank, KEB Hana Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Citibank Korea and Nonghyup Bank -- to collect relevant documents.The data requested by the prosecution includes those related to Choi and TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek, who is suspected to have played a role in founding the two aforementioned entities and interfering in several state-backed culture projects.The sweeping search indicates that the investigators have commenced a comprehensive crackdown on the financial records of those related to the scandal.Among the banks searched, KEB Hana Bank is suspected of granting Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra loans under unlawfully favorable conditions.Rep. Jung Jae-ho of the minor opposition Minjoo Party of Korea has alleged that Chung and Choi had been granted a loan of 250,000 euros  last year, which they supposedly used to buy real estate in Germany. The Financial Supervisory Service is conducting investigation into the allegation, and National Tax Service chief Lim Hwang-soo told Parliament on Monday that the NTS is investigating possible tax evasions by Choi and Chung.Prosecutors are also investigating a claim that Choi was allowed to freely enter and leave Cheong Wa Dae. Local daily the Hankyoreh, citing officials from the presidential office, reported that Choi had frequently visited Cheong Wa Dae from 2013 until recently without going through inspection or identification process. The gate that Choi used was reportedly one used exclusively by Cabinet members, who go through identification.Park’s former Chief of Staff Lee Wong-jong had said that it was not true “as far as I know.” The prosecution has questioned Choi’s associate Ko Yeong-tae and former Cheong Wa Dae staff on the allegation, including Park’s personal trainer Yoon Jeon-choo, officials said Tuesday.It has been rumored that Yoon was able to work in the presidential office on Choi’s recommendation. When asked about the allegation, Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Jung Youn-kuk said that the presidential staff would cooperate with the investigators “the best they can.” The presidential office Sunday refused to cooperate when prosecutors attempted to execute a warrant to search Cheong Wa Dae, citing reasons of national security. Instead, Cheong Wa Dae staff voluntarily submitted what they said were relevant documents.By Yoon Min-sik","scandal south korean prosecutors ,tuesday senior presidential secretary ,the scandal that president ,presidential secretary faces investigation ,korean prosecutors plan to","['south korean', 'Presidential', 'An Chong - bum', 'Park Geun', 'Policy Coordination']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31576586  0.37761363

A spate of key initiatives are suddenly seen at a halt, including ambitious labor reform, industrial restructuring and economic revitalization, as well as the appointment of the heads of several state-run organizations. Most are showpiece programs the president had been pushing for even in the face of robust protests from labor lobbies, unions and other critics before the peddling of influence scandal involving Park’s longtime friend broke out in earnest late last month. Among the hardest hit was the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, which was found to have provided financial and administrative support for two culture and sports foundations virtually set up as Choi’s slush funds. Embroiled in the scandal, Vice Minister Kim Chong stepped down last Sunday, while numerous ministry officials are now being probed. The ministry is now striving to root out traces of Choi and her associate, TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek, as they are suspected of having orchestrated not only major cultural projects but also personnel management. Minister Cho Yoon-sun During a meeting with senior agency officials Monday, Minister Cho Yoon-sun pledged to thoroughly overhaul the programs in question and take “all legal and administrative steps,” including their dismantling, while improving rules on incentives, contracts and human resources. “The atmosphere in general is indeed subdued, but many think with this is the incident we needed to revamp various parts of our work and organization,” a ministry official told The Korea Herald on customary condition of anonymity. “Overall, there is a lot of soul-searching going on around here, and an internal review has already started.”With the opposition dominating the National Assembly, a flurry of pending economy-related bills designed to ease regulations, boost the sharing economy and nurture new industries face a grim outlook. Five ambitious labor reform bills and one for bolstering the service sector will almost certainly be killed, given staunch resistance from opposition parties and labor unions that see that the texts, if passed, would make it easy for large conglomerates to sack non-regular workers and accelerate health care privatization. “Though we’re not directly related , there are widespread feelings of a letdown to some extent, as we watch the development,” a Labor Ministry official said. On the personnel front, many core posts remain vacant, as the selection process and background checks have been frozen since the resignation of top presidential secretaries in charge amid the scandal. The positions include the vice foreign minister and chief executives of state-funded institutions such as the Korea Petroleum Quality & Distribution Authority and Korea Securities Depository. Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul has been carrying on with the current job nearly a month after being appointed ambassador to the UN. The helpless mood appears to be intensifying, as fresh allegations surface on a daily basis, deepening uncertainties over not only domestic policy, but also foreign policy initiatives. At stake is a trilateral summit with China and Japan, initially scheduled for late this year, though the sides have not yet hammered out a date, agenda or other details. Some observers have also raised concerns over a possible setback on plans to deploy a US missile shield here by next year and to ink an intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo. In another worrisome sign, the government has delayed next week’s meeting between Park and some 100 officials from defense contractors intended to discuss ways to promote the industry, tackle corruption and ensure transparency. Many officials at the foreign and unification ministries have displayed shock and disbelief at the allegation Choi may have edited or taken a look at Park’s landmark speeches, which should have been kept confidential until their delivery, including an address in Dresden, Germany in March 2014. “A presidential speech is crafted after compiling materials from all relevant agencies at the highest level, so who writes or changes which part is like a black box,” a Foreign Ministry official said. “I’m quite sure that Choi’s role in foreign policymaking has been minimal, if any, and yet thinking someone like her has been covertly meddling in the process is inconceivable.” As ambiguities rise, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Monday launched a meeting with vice premiers on the economy and social affairs, as well as the foreign, defense and interior ministers. During the session, Hwang stressed solid security posture as “the top priority for now,” calling for close monitoring of the North Korean military and the implementation of diplomatic and defense programs “without a hitch.” “We need to inform through overseas diplomatic missions that the government’s major policies are in normal operation so as to prevent any trouble in external cooperation and exchanges and investment,” he said. “The Culture Ministry, for its part, should carry out a comprehensive, outright inspection of potentially problematic policies and initiatives and take stern measures, as culture and arts are high-value-added sectors linked with our future butter and bread.” By Shin Hyon-hee  Staff reporters Ock Hyun-ju and Rumy Doo contributed to the report. --Ed.","officialdom impotence policy vacuum ,concerns over officialdom impotence ,over possible government vacuum ,presidency in tatters ,government vacuum spate",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73591357 -0.00734399

The unfolding scandal is also hurting dozens of fledgling venture startups whose previous high hopes are now seriously endangered. The government-run project for startups, named “Cultural Creation and Convergence Belt,” or “cel,” was launched in December last year. The project was one of President Park’s major initiatives, promising to offer a variety of support measures including rent-free offices and an overseas investment fair for culture-related startups such as computer game developers, animation producers and webtoonists. Since the launch of the project, 93 startups have been selected to receive government support ranging from help with planning to commercialization targeting global markets. Cel Venture Complex These startups, however, are facing a make-or-break crisis due to the revelations surrounding Choi, who is accused of interfering in state affairs, and President Park. Last Thursday, cable channel TV Chosun revealed documents that detailed what appeared to be government-led initiatives, including the cel project, with notes scribbled in what seemed to be Choi’s handwriting.The startup companies in question have already moved into the venture complex building in central Seoul set up by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the government body in charge of Park’s cultural projects. An executive of a startup at the state-run center expressed concerns in an interview with The Korea Herald on Monday on condition of anonymity. He said, “I feel like I have suddenly become a criminal or something.” Like the other startups that received government support, his company beat the odds of 13 to one to win a spot at the center last year. “My employees and I were proud back then,” he said. The venture cluster, praised by President Park for playing a pivotal role in boosting the cultural industry, however, turns out to have been masterminded by Cha Eun-taek, a former director of the Cultural Creation Conversion Headquarters. Cha had led many of the state-run cultural project’s key initiatives until recently. Cha, a close acquaintance of Choi, is now accused of receiving preferential treatment to win the influential position at the organization. The official of the startup said he had never heard of Choi or Cha until the scandal broke out. “All I know is that they have done wrong, and now because of that, politicians are talking about cutting off state funding to anything related to those two.”Opposition parties, including The Minjoo Party of Korea have vowed to suspend all budgets linked to the influence-peddling scandal. The budget for the cel project was 90.4 billion won  this year, and another 127.8 billion won was on request for next year by the Culture Ministry.“Some are saying that from next year, we might lose our office here. So we have started looking for a new office to lease. We have done nothing wrong except having applied for the government’s incubating program and somehow people are asking me if my company has anything to do with Cha.”  Cha Eun-taek , former director of Korea Creative Content Agency Song Seung-gak  and former Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok at the state-run incubation center ahead of its official launch in 2015. Another startup worker said what worries him the most is the “loss of trust in the eyes of foreign investors.” He said “The most crucial reason for me to join the government-run complex here was to attract foreign investors with support from the government.” “Small startups like us need assistance, both from local and foreign investors,” he added. “A scandal like this can easily scare investors away from the cluster. Any investor with the knowledge of the political turmoil would be discouraged.” The Culture Ministry on Saturday said it would put some of its major initiatives linked to Choi on hold -- including the startup project. However, it refuted all allegations that Choi peddled influence in the ministry.An expert with knowledge of the startup industry said on condition of anonymity that “it is important to recognize the purpose of the Cultural Creation and Convergence Belt project, which is to create a sustainable ecosystem for startups here to be more competitive outside home. Eliminating the startup fund altogether would not address the real issue.”Choi is now under investigation at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul.By Bak Se-hwan","startups is struggling ,help startups is struggling ,startups is struggling to ,scandal major state run ,hye the unfolding scandal",['Park Geun - hye'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57424283  0.2309923

Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a cult leader who has a decades-long connection with Park, is embroiled in a series of allegations that she strong-armed conglomerates to make massive donations to two nonprofit foundations and embezzled money.   Choi Soon-sil, President Park Geun-hye's longtime friend at the center of an influence peddling-scandal, cries upon appearing at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office to face questioning on Oct. 31.Besides reviewing the president's speech drafts and confidential documents without any official government position and abusing her influence, the 60-year-old is suspected of getting preferential treatment from local banks for loans and other financial transactions.Hours after Choi appeared before prosecutors to face questioning on Monday, authorities raided the headquarters of eight banks -- Woori Bank, Standard Chartered Bank Korea, Shinhan Bank, KB Bank, KEB Hana Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Citibank Korea and Nonghyup Bank -- to confiscate documents related to her financial transactions.Choi is known to have taken 500 million won  in loans from KB Bank using her land in PyeongChang in the eastern province of Gangwon as collateral, industry officials with knowledge of the matter said. According to an opposition lawmaker, Choi and her 20-year-old daughter also received a loan of around 250,000 euros  from KEB Hana Bank by using their land in PyeongChang in late 2015, just months before moving to Europe. KEB is currently under investigation by the Financial Supervisory Service, a financial watchdog. The investigators also asked for financial documents of Cha Eun-taek, a well-known advertisement director and Choi's close aide as he is under suspicion of meddling in government's cultural projects, they noted. Choi, who returned from her two-month stay in Germany on Sunday, was placed under detention late Monday. Choi's summons comes less than a week after prosecutors raided the offices of Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation, which are suspected of raising massive funds from conglomerates with the help of the Federation of Korean Industries , a major business lobby group. Choi is under suspicion of playing the role of the behind-the-scenes power broker by forcing conglomerates to donate money to the funds using her connection with presidential aides and high-ranking officials. According to the data compiled by corporate tracker Chaebul.com, a total of 53 companies donated a combined 77.4 billion won to Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation, which were established in 2015 and early this year, respectively. Among them, 12 companies gave out money to the foundations although they logged deficits last year, raising speculations about whether their donations were voluntary as claimed by foundation officials. Hyundai Motor Co. donated the biggest amount of 6.88 billion won, followed by SK Hynix Co. with 6.8 billion won and Samsung Electronics Co. with 6 billion won. Some companies didn't record the donations in their regulatory briefings, sparking questions over the source of the funds and violation of accounting rules.","prosecutors raid banks related ,prosecutors raid banks ,prosecutors have raided ,massive influence peddling scandal ,sil prosecutors have raided","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.01787242  0.3630971

Choi is a private citizen with no security clearance."" hope everyone will keep calm for the sake of the nation until the truth behind various allegations is verified,"" Jung told reporters.Photo taken Oct. 30, 2016 shows presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk speaking during a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. Asked if Cheong Wa Dae can offer investigators the records of Choi's past visits to the presidential office, the spokesman pledged to cooperate with the ongoing investigation as long as the disclosure of the records does not violate any security rules.A local media outlet on the day reported that Choi had frequently visited Cheong Wa Dae, using a vehicle of the presidential office, which was driven by an official.Such an allegation has continued to surface for several weeks.During a parliamentary audit last month, former presidential chief of staff Lee Won-jong said, ""I have never seen, heard or known .""Last night, Choi was put under emergency detention after being grilled by prosecutors over a host of allegations against her. Choi was summoned a day after she returned home from Europe where she is thought to be hiding for nearly two months.Choi is suspected of using her decades-long ties to the president to meddle in state affairs, particularly presidential matters such as Park's wardrobe, public speeches and even the selection of presidential secretaries. The woman, which some critics call the ""eminence grise,"" is also purported to have peddled undue influence in the creation and operation of two nonprofit foundations, dedicated to promoting Korean culture and sports, and may have misappropriated money from the foundations.The political scandal has also been spreading into the realm of shamanism as Park's political foes and critics highlight her longtime relationship with Choi's family.Choi is the fifth daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min.The late Choi, who used to lead a religious cult, had reportedly advised Park since her mother, Yook Young-soo, was assassinated by a North Korea sympathizer in 1974. After Choi's death in 1994, his daughter, Soon-sil, is purported to have taken her father's place -- a reason why some observers portray the current relationship between Park and the junior Choi as ""shamanistic."" Related to such accusations, the presidential spokesman on Monday denied the allegations and said he was ""dumbfounded"" that such claims are being made at all.","snowballing scandal the presidential ,peddling scandal involving president ,calm amid snowballing scandal ,amid snowballing scandal the ,scandal the presidential office","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Jung Youn', 'Cheong']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51609844  0.08532691

She'd returned from Europe on Sunday after nearly two months. Under criminal law, investigative authorities can put a suspect under emergency detention if they have reasonable grounds to believe the suspect has committed a crime to warrant the death penalty or life sentence, and to believe the suspect is a flight risk who may also attempt to destroy evidence.""Choi has denied all of the charges against her, and we're concerned that she may destroy evidence,"" a prosecution official said. ""She has fled overseas in the past, and she doesn't have a permanent address in Korea, making her a flight risk. She is also in an extremely unstable psychological state, and it's possible an unexpected event could occur if she is released.""Choi appeared at the prosecutors' office around 3 p.m. Monday.""I am so sorry,"" she told reporters before entering the office.""I have committed a deadly sin. Please forgive me.""Her lawyer Lee Kyung-jae later said she was trying to express her feelings, adding her statements cannot be deemed as holding any legal meaning. ""She deeply regrets the fact that she caused such a huge commotion,"" he told reporters in front of the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office. ""She thinks she should receive due punishment if there was any .""As she got out of a black sedan in black clothes, covering her face with a black hat and a scarf, some hundreds of reporters who had been waiting since early morning surrounded her. It was the first time she appeared in public after the scandal surfaced.Some citizens engaged in surprise protests as she showed up, chanting and picketing ""Down with Park Geun-hye!"" and ""Arrest Choi Soon-sil!"" The prosecution immediately released a statement, expressing regret over the chaos that occurred.The woman, who holds no governmental post, has been accused of influencing state affairs via her decades-old friendship with the president. Choi is also suspected of siphoning off funds from two nonprofit organizations that received some tens of billions of won in donations from local companies in the name of supporting various cultural and sports projects. The scandal has been snowballing as the president on Tuesday apologized in a nationally televised address over part of the allegations raised against her and the confidante, admitting to asking for Choi's feedback on dozens of presidential speeches before they were made public.Many called for Choi to be arrested upon arrival.Her attorney Lee said he had asked the investigators to delay the questioning for a day to give her time to rest, as she is not in good health due to pre-existing medical conditions and the long journey. She is currently taking pills for panic disorder, according to Lee.Choi is a daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min, a leader of a questionable religious group who died in 1994. Park is known to have developed a friendship with the Choi family after her mother and then-first lady Yook Young-soo was assassinated in 1974.Faced with growing calls from the public to take responsibility for the scandal, Park carried out a partial reshuffle of her secretariat Sunday. The chief executive will soon fill in other vacant positions, according to presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk. The latest scandal has sent Park's approval rating to the 10 percent range, the lowest point seen during her presidency that began February 2013, according to local pollster Gallup Korea.On Saturday, thousands of protesters took to the streets of downtown Seoul to demand her resignation.","questioning prosecutors on monday ,emergency detention after grilling ,detention after questioning prosecutors ,prosecutors on monday ,prosecutors on monday placed","['Park Geun - hye', ""Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03260309 0.1234019  0.14809695],임정요,Social affairs,11,2016,"the president on tuesday apologized ,emergency detention after grilling her ,pollster gallup korea on saturday ,prosecutors on monday placed choi ,tuesday apologized in nationally televised","['Park Geun - hye', ""Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Korea', 'Lee Kyung - jae', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Choi', 'Yook Young', 'Jung Youn', 'Park', 'Gallup Korea', 'Seoul']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03260309 0.1234019  0.14809695]

The ministry dispatched an on-site inspection team comprising 12 ministry officials to the Seoul-based university. The inspection centers on Chung Yoo-ra, a horseback rider and the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, the woman accused of meddling in state affairs through her ties to Park.Special inspectors dispatched by the Education Ministry enter a building at Ewha Womans University in Seoul on Monday for a two-week on-site investigation. The university is suspected of providing preferential treatment to Jeong Yoo-ra, the daughter of President Park Geun-hye’s now infamous friend Choi Soon-sil. Chung is suspected of being unfairly admitted into the university and receiving favorable grades despite missing most of her classes and repeatedly submitting assignments past deadlines.The ministry is set to look into why the school added horseback riding to a list of categories open to student athletes in 2014, right before the dressage rider’s admission the following year, and whether the Asian Games gold medal that Chung obtained after the application deadline was considered in the application process.The ministry will also probe whether professors gave her overly generous grades despite her not turning in assignments, and whether the school changed its academic policy to excuse her long absences from class. Amid the snowballing allegations, Choi Kyung-hee, president of Ewha Womans University, resigned on Oct. 19. The inspection came amid the escalating probe into the influence-peddling scandal involving Choi, as she returned to Korea on Sunday for prosecutorial questioning. Chung’s whereabouts remain unknown. Critics urge the ministry to widen its probe to look into allegations the woman’s university secured eight of nine state-funded projects by the Education Ministry in return for providing special treatment to Chung. According to measures to crack down on irregularities in university admissions released by the Education Ministry in March, Chung’s entrance into Ewha can be canceled and she can be expelled from the sports industry if the allegations prove true. Choi, who is accused of pulling strings for her daughter, could also be subject to punishment and the university could be partially banned from recruiting students. Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education also launched an on-site inspection on Monday at Chung’s high school, Cheongdam High School, which is also suspected of receiving kickbacks from Choi and giving preferential treatment to Chung.The high school in the affluent district of Southern Seoul is accused of creating a program in 2011 to accept dressage athletes in what critics see as an attempt to accept Chung into the school. Chung entered the school in 2012. Chung allegedly attended the school for only 28 out of 193 days in her senior year in 2014, with the school excusing her for participating in training and competitions, according to official documents issued by the Korea Equestrian Federation. The regional education office is slated to look into Chung’s records of attendance, academic records and the authenticity of the official document by the KEF to see whether special favors were given to Chung.By Ock Hyun-ju","ministry probes choi daughter ,daughter of president park ,daughter of president ,the daughter of president ,daughter the ministry","['the Ministry of Education', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Seoul', 'Chung Yoo - ra']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57544678  0.23430437

Under such a system, it is likely that the main opposition party may have the right to name a prime minister.The concept, which inevitably involves the weakening of the presidential power, is usually considered an alternative governance which may only be adopted in state emergency situations.“The adoption of the neutral Cabinet effectively means the suspension of the presidential power,” said Shin Yul, professor of politics at Myongji University.But the idea of such a powerful Cabinet is largely limited by the nation’s Constitution, which states that the Cabinet is to “assist the president” and to “govern the administration under the order of the president.”The “responsible prime minister” system, on the other hand, is an abridged version of the neutral Cabinet as it merely reinforces the prime minister’s powers within the current frame of president-centered governance.While the two options stand at odds, Cheong Wa Dae has so far been largely against the idea of a neutral Cabinet, citing the possibility of political chaos.“It is undesirable to bring together  which hold very different ideas and policies,” Park had said in a lunch meeting with media chiefs in April.The time and extra effort needed to completely overhaul the current Cabinet is another roadblock for the presidential office, which would rather wrap up its personnel reforms and resume the suspended state affairs.“The president will embrace the gist of the neutral Cabinet proposal,” a ranking official of Cheong Wa Dae told reporters Monday.“But as the neutral Cabinet plan contains various controversies, it is likely that  will choose the responsible prime minister system, which effectively takes on the core features of the neutral Cabinet system.”One of the plausible candidates for the prime ministerial post is Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, who in turn is likely to be succeeded by the Finance Services Commission chairman Yim Jong-yong.The Saenuri’s list of suggestions included Kim Chong-in, a former economic adviser to Park who moved to the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. Kim is largely considered to be relatively neutral politically, sympathetic to both reform-leaning conservatives and mild progressives.Others were Sohn Hak-kyu, former chief of the Minjoo camp, and Kim Byong-joon, professor at Kookmin University, who had served the former liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration.Professor Kim, when asked about the possibility of a neutral Cabinet, had answered that it was a valid opportunity to test a semi-presidential system before moving onto a constitutional revision.None of the aforementioned candidates, however, have confirmed receiving an official offer from the administration or if they would accept such a call.By Bae Hyun-jung","new pm president park ,new pm president ,to new pm president ,constituting new neutral cabinet ,reshuffling her secretariat","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47711697  0.39520448

Sk...","Hard pressed by public anger over the so-called Choi Soon-sil scandal, Cheong Wa Dae had little choice but to dismiss top presidential confidants in a gesture of communication and reform.However, the move has created a fiasco for the already-struggling presidential office which has largely been losing its grip over state governance, with only 14 months of President Park Geun-hye’s single five-year term remaining. Skepticism also continues to linger on the efficacy of the measure, a decision which may have been agonizing for the president but is still deemed insufficient to other politicians. The president has recently been struck by a series of revelations showing that a friend of hers -- Choi Soon-sil, who is a civilian -- has long manipulated key state affairs. After days of public bashing and nationwide protests, Park on Sunday carried out a partial reshuffle of her secretariat.A view of Cheong Wa Dae Among the replaced officials was Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, whose liability for a chain of corruption allegations and consequent resignation has been a subject of political feuding since July. Woo was substituted by Choi Jai-kyeong, a former prosecutor just like his predecessor, while Senior Presidential Secretary for Public Relations Kim Sung-woo was replaced by Bae Sung-rye, a former spokesperson for the National Assembly.The resignation of Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong, Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum and Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won were all accepted but their respective successors are yet to be decided.The reshuffle, though extensive in that it included most key senior officials, was a minimal alternative, as Park earlier Friday had ordered all of her top secretaries to submit their resignations en masse.But the real “shake-up” for the president was that she sent away Lee Jae-man, Jeong Ho-seong and Ahn Bong-geun -- the three secretary-level officials considered to be the most irreplaceable aides for the reclusive state chief.Often dubbed the “doorknob trio” -- referring to the widely spread rumor that they have been monopolizing all communication channels with Park since her political debut -- the three have long been under pressure to step down, especially after the presidential aide scandal broke out last week.Park’s reluctant separation from her most trusted aides heralds a deadlock in the administration, especially for a president who is said to be exceptionally reliant on her secretaries when considering governance. “President Park will soon carry out an additional reshuffle ,” spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters, suggesting that the successors for the given posts have not yet been fixed.Even potential candidates who have received offers are said to have declined.“I hesitated upon the offer as we are in the midst of a grave state crisis,” Yonhap News Agency quoted the newly appointed civil affairs chief Choi as saying to an acquaintance.“But as a longtime servant to public duties, I felt that my ethical duty was not to look away from such a call .”Another point of dispute is that Choi, who is replacing the scandal-ridden Woo, is the nephew of Choi Byung-yul, a former chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party and chief editor of the nation’s top conservative newspaper Chosun Ilbo.The fact that he is also a former prosecutor, two years senior to Woo, raised speculations that Woo himself had selected his own successor and that he still has influence over the incoming secretariat.Such suspicions largely dampened the Blue House’s claim that Choi was chosen for his relatively unbiased political position and expertise in high-profile corruption cases.","already struggling presidential office ,struggling presidential office ,the already struggling presidential ,already struggling presidential ,struggling presidential office which",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.88813329  0.80519015

Ko has surfaced as a key figure in the corruption scandal that is shaking the nation after Choi denied ownership of the tablet PC in which confidential documents including unedited manuscripts of the president’s speeches were found. Choi, 60, claimed the laptop was Ko’s, saying she does not even know how to operate a tablet PC. Ko Young-tae Ko, a former fencing player and now the chief of a handbag manufacturing company that supplies products to the president, was summoned for two probes that each lasted 40 and 24 hours.As he was leaving the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday, Ko told reporters that the tablet PC was not his.He said he has “truthfully told the prosecutors what he has seen and experienced,” and that “everything will come to light once the probes are over.”Ko and Choi are rumored to have met at an entertainment house where young men target rich middle-aged women as clients. Ko told reporters that he came to know Choi “while supplying the president with bags” at around the end of 2012. He said he had never seen Choi use the tablet PC.Regarding his position at the foundation The Blue K, Ko said he was “merely a staff member, not a representative.”Meanwhile, Choi reported to the Prosecutors’ Office for questioning at 3 p.m. By Lim Jeong-yeo","controversial presidential confidante choi ,controversial presidential confidante ,the controversial presidential confidante ,returned home monday afternoon ,controversial presidential","['Ko Young - tae', 'Ko', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40612403  0.50390399

Former senior policy secretary Ahn Jong-beom, one of the government officials suspected of helping establish illegally funded sports foundations where the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil is known to be the de facto head, had used the daepo phone to keep in contact with key figures in the prosecutors’ probe.  Ahn’s application for resignation was accepted by the presidential office Sunday, amid wide calls from political parties and ordinary citizens for the president to reshuffle her Cabinet.The Prosecutors’ Office has banned Ahn from leaving the country.It is widely known that the nation’s top officials often use daepo phones to disguise identities.Data compiled between the beginning of 2011 and June 2016 from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning show that the number of identified daepo phones reached 18,317 in the cited period. Considering the secretive nature of such phones with borrowed names, more daepo phones than what the official tally suggests are being circulated in the country, as people seek to conceal their identities in illicit activities despite regulations and punishment. Based on the Telecommunications Business Act, those who make and sell daepo phones are punishable by a maximum of one year in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won . Those who buy, borrow, or use daepo phones are punishable by up to 3 years in prison or a maximum fine of 100 million won.

Yet political and public pressure has only continued to mount on the commander in chief, with opposition and even ruling party lawmakers calling for a launch of a neutral Cabinet to take over some key executive duties from Cheong Wa Dae. Park appointed Choi Jai-kyung, a lawyer who served as a former deputy minister for planning and coordination at the Justice Ministry and head of the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office’s central investigation unit, to be the new senior secretary for civil affairs, replacing Woo Byung-woo.  Presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk speaks at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Sunday. Bae Sung-rye, a former National Assembly spokesperson and television journalist, was tapped to succeed Kim Sung-woo as the top press secretary. But the president has yet to decide on the replacements of Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong, Ahn Chong-bum, the senior secretary for policy coordination, and Kim Jae-won, the senior secretary for political affairs, Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters. Park has also accepted the resignations tendered by her three closest aides -- Jeong Ho-seong, Lee Jae-man and Ahn Bong-geun -- who have been working for her for nearly two decades. The announcement came a day after all of the 10 chief presidential secretaries offered to step down in the aftermath of the scandal. Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong submitted his resignation Wednesday. Woo and Ahn Chong-bum are suspected of assisting in Choi’s raising of over $70 million in slush funds from major conglomerates, while the three longest-serving assistants have allegedly been playing a bridging role between the president and Choi. Yet with the scandal continuing to unravel and Park’s leadership in free fall, the ruling and opposition parties ratcheted up calls for a more sweeping personnel overhaul to forestall any potential government vacuum.Also on Sunday, the ruling Saenuri Party convened an emergency meeting of senior members and agreed to recommend the president form a neutral Cabinet, while reaffirming its demand for an across-the-board shake-up of Cheong Wa Dae staff. “We urge the president to set up a neutral Cabinet that could be approved by the ruling and opposition parties and trusted by the people,” Saenuri spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-won told reporters, adding the prosecution should carry out a thorough probe into the scandal given the return home of the disgraced Choi. The concept has been gaining traction as leading opposition figures relay their proposals, including the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea’s previous head Moon Jae-in and minor opposition People’s Party’s Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. Senior ruling party members such as former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil have also expressed support for the move. Other lawmakers and experts have floated a “premier with responsibilities” scheme intended to split the president’s administrative powers by ensuring the prime minister’s actual exercise of his right to nominate Cabinet members and recommend their dismissal as enshrined in the constitution.On the campaign trail in 2012, Park herself said she would empower the premiership as an election pledge. Yet she has given little authority to her prime ministers throughout her nearly four years in office, especially in personnel affairs. Earlier in the day, former Gyeonggi Gov. Sohn Hak-kyu urged Park to designate a new premier and the rival parties to forge a coalition. Ahn, for his part, called on the president to also hand over her diplomatic authority to a prime minister approved by the assembly. Minjoo Party Rep. Min Byung-doo offered to launch a campaign to collect 10 million signatures calling for the establishment of a neutral Cabinet, legislative action for prosecution reform and the minimization of presidential power until the scandal is cleared.“Even if the president would not make the request, the National Assembly ought to agree on a prime minister candidate and demand her nomination,” Sohn said at an event to celebrate his new book in Gangjin County, South Jeolla Province. But the plan poses challenges given persistent strife within the parliament and a seemingly limited pool of candidates who could win bipartisan endorsement. It could be a more time-consuming process than other options due to the scale of the entailed reshuffle and parliamentary and administrative tasks to follow. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also cast doubt over the idea during last week’s parliamentary session, saying, “It will likely result in a mere war of words with no progress in state management.”Among the names being mentioned for the new premiership or head Cabinet post are Sohn, former Minjoo Party interim chief Rep. Kim Chong-in, former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik and former Gyeonggi Province governor and lawmaker Rhee In-je. News reports suggested the Saenuri leadership recommended Kim Chong-in and Sohn as promising premier nominees during a meeting with Park on Friday, and already sounded out Kim’s interest in the role.

The apology failed to calm the public who held a candlelight rally in central Seoul on Saturday demanding answers from Park.Since evidence -- computer files obtained by local channel JTBC -- surfaced last Monday that Choi has meddled in state affairs, there have been calls for the President to step down. The consecutive reports showed Choi making key policy decisions for Park, ranging from wardrobe choices to editing speeches.She is also suspected of raising some 80 billion won  in slush funds from conglomerates through the Mir and the K-Sports foundations, which are backed by the government.“Choi returned back home voluntarily in response to a prosecutorial summoning and shall faithfully cooperate in the investigation,” said Lee Kyung-jae, legal representative speaking for Choi and her daughter, at a press briefing held two hours after Choi’s landing. Choi did not make her appearance.“We have asked the investigators in charge for some time so that Choi may recover from her recent health challenges, as well as from the long trip,” the lawyer said.The prosecution also said, shortly after Lee’s press briefing, that it will not immediately summon Choi. “Choi has expressed her sincere apologies for causing frustration and disappointment to the people,” the lawyer said.But he refused to elaborate on the charges raised against her, claiming that it is the investigators role to find out the truth by questioning Choi.Meanwhile, tension escalated between the prosecutors and Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday as a search and seizure of the offices of key presidential officials is expected to take place.

The idea that Choi -- a civilian -- has been influencing presidential decisions has been met with shock and disappointment. “I have to say that this incident was very shocking and I am still in disbelief with what happened,” Hamza Lupin, a Moroccan working at a Korean construction company who has lived here for seven years told The Korea Herald. Protesters wearing face masks of President Park Geun-hye, her controversial confidante Choi Soon-sil and Choi's horseback rider dauther during a rally in Seoul on Wednesday. “The leader of the 11th world power, freely elected by the people of Korea, let herself be influenced by an unknown third party to the point of being instructed on policy, speeches and even clothing style. Incredible!” Korea has an important role to play on the international stage and cannot afford such displays of “poor and amateurish statecraft,” he added.The scandal erupted last week when cable TV channel JTBC reported that it found a trashed computer containing over 200 confidential files that was purportedly used by Choi. Among the files were drafts of presidential speeches with apparent signs of editing by the owner of the computer, as well as a raft of presidential documents, including sensitive information on inter-Korean relations.Fahad Abdullah, a young Bangladeshi studying at a university in Seoul, predicted that most young Koreans would probably “hate the president more” after this scandal.“What she did is not right because she was entrusted by the citizens who have voted for her and made her president. Trust once broken is difficult to rebuild,” Abdullah said. Professor Michael Heinz at the Graduate School of Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul offered a few points for Koreans to think about. If the president was found to have done something illegal, to that extent, she should be prosecuted. Yet, having a mentor and asking the person for “help in writing a speech or even making policy is not a crime and should not be seen as such,” he said. “I do wonder if this story would be as scandalous if President Park were conferring with more conventional religious figures,” he added. Choi, who is a decades-old friend of President Park, is also the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a self-proclaimed pastor who later founded his own religion. Park’s relationship with Choi dates back more than 40 years to 1974 when the then 22-year-old Park was grieving the loss of her mother to a bullet meant for her father, military strongman Park Chung-hee.Online expat communities are rife with debates and theories on the issue.“As an American outsider, I’m thinking that she was traumatized by the death of her mother and this ‘psychic’ was the only link she had to replace her mother,” an anonymous commentator wrote on online community “Ask a Korean.”“It’s actually kind of sad when you think of it that way,” the person added.Michelle Kim, a Korean-American entrepreneur, said the story about the Park-Choi relationship may be sensationalized. “Shamanism isn’t bad. In fact many business leaders consult with gurus that are experts in shamanism and the tarot  system that Korea uses. This is all just sensationalized rhetoric,” she said.Teresa, a professor at a local university here, questioned how the suspicious ties between Park and Choi could go on unchecked until last Monday when the scandal erupted.“Apparently all of those in Cheong Wa Dae and the companies related  would have known about Choi, as this isn’t the first time she’s made an appearance on the news,” she wrote on a Facebook group page for expats residing in Korea.“There has been public outcry but seriously not enough attention has been put on it. Naver results aren’t as high as they realistically should be. Foreign media isn’t reporting on it much,” she added.","scandal surrounding south korea ,scandal expats are finding ,choi soon sil scandal ,scandal surrounding south ,working at korean con","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Hamza Lupin', 'Moroccan', 'korean']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.32256076  0.56355757

Park canceled a luncheon with members of a committee on the reunification of the peninsula and instead met with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, to discuss her course of action. Yet no words came from Cheong Wa Dae as of Friday evening as to what she will do to settle the unrest. The Blue House, earlier in the day, said the president was “contemplating” options, which includes the overhaul of Cabinet members and presidential aides. Pressing Park to promptly conduct the personnel reshuffle, the Saenuri leadership on early Friday threatened to resign en masse. The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea pledged to suspend bipartisan efforts to investigate the scandal unless the president first conducted an overhaul and took responsibility for causing public uproar through her relationship with her confidante Choi Soon-sil.  President Park Geun-hye Among others, it insisted on the replacement of the Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination Ahn Jong-bum and Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo, both of whom were embroiled in the scandal but have vowed to keep their positions. Sources expect the reshuffle to take place next week.As for the calls for Park to relinquish much of her power to a “bipartisan government” including a new prime minister, the presidential office appeared to be against the idea. “Despite the shock from the scandal, the president maintains a steadfast commitment to running the country,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said.   The unravelling scandal erupted Monday when cable TV channel JTBC reported to have found over 200 confidential presidential files on a trashed computer purportedly used by Choi. It revealed that Choi edited Park‘s speeches and had access to other documents, some containing sensitive issues such as inter-Korean relations. A survey from Gallup Korea released Friday shows Park’s daily approval rating was down to 14 percent on Thursday, the lowest since her inauguration in February 2013. A large-scale anti-Park rally is scheduled to be held in Seoul on Saturday. Meanwhile, Jo In-geun, a former speechwriter for Park, came forward to the media Friday, after days in hiding since the scandal first broke. He denied the initial revelation that Choi Soon-sil edited the president’s speeches. The presidential aide has been suspected of leaking the confidential document when he was in charge of speech writing between 2012 and 2014.  Jo In-geun, President Park Geun-hye’s former speechwriter, is surrounded by journalists in front of his office in Yeouido, Seoul, Friday. “It never came across to me that someone may have edited the speeches without my knowledge,” the former secretary said. He worked at Cheong Wa Dae until July this year. “I don’t even know who Choi is until I saw the news report.” The initial TV report suggested that the speech scripts were appeared to have been edited by Choi up to three days ahead of its delivery by the president.The scandal also shifted the fortunes of political parties. Minjoo saw its poll number outpace that of Saenuri for the first time under the Park administration. Minjoo‘s approval rating stood at 29 percent, while Saenuri was at 26. The main opposition bloc accused Saenuri of failing to recognize its own responsibility for the scandal. It denounced the ruling party for defending the president and dismissing the infamous scandal as a political attack fabricated by the opposition bloc. Minjoo Chair Rep. Choo Mi-ae said Friday that until Saenuri apologized for their acts leading up the revelation of the scandal, her party would halt negotiations with Saenuri over the operation of an independent counsel to investigate the case.Alongside the apology, Minjoo also attached another two conditions to their return to the negotiation table: Dismissal of Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs who was embroiled in the scandal, and resignation of all the officials “having worked for Choi Soon-sil.”The announcement came amid partisan bickering over the procedure to appoint the independent counsel. Fearing that the current law would undermine the prosecutor’s independence, Minjoo asserted that the lawmakers should pass a new law that prevents special prosecutors from being appointed by the president. “People are outraged at Saenuri for coming to the table without any apology and trying to have the president appoint the prosecutor that would investigate herself,” said Choo, adding that the president herself should undergo investigation. “It is a farce.”   Though Saenuri leadership refused to budge, dissenting calls emerged from Saenuri members outside the faction close to President Park. They said that the leadership should shift their position and embrace Minjoo’s proposal to pass a new law to name an independent counsel. “When we decided to adopt the independent counsel, we wanted to end the crisis as soon as possible. In that regard, it is not a bad idea to accept  proposal,” said Rep. Choung Byoung-gug in an interview with local media.  By Yeo Jun-suk","affairs park canceled luncheon ,park canceled luncheon with ,park canceled luncheon ,canceled luncheon with members ,friday as the scandal","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32611477  0.26281443

Kim Moo-sung. YonhapHis remark came a day after Minjoo Party of Korea’s former leader Moon Jae-in suggested the nation elect a new Prime Minister to navigate through the turmoil. The main opposition’s presidential hopeful also said that a new justice minster should be appointed to investigate the cronyism scandal. But the government appeared to be reluctant to heed the call. Earlier in the day, Cheong Wa Dae maintained silence over the call, saying that it had “no comment” when asked by reporters whether it would reshuffle the presidential office and Cabinet members. Incumbent Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn echoed the government’s position. “I have concerns whether  would benefit the management of the state. I’m afraid it would end up just as talk without achieving anything,” Hwang told the lawmakers at the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the Justice Party, a far-left minority with six lawmakers, said Thursday that it will start outdoor rallies to unseat President Park, becoming the first within South Korea’s political establishment to officially call for her to be ousted over the unraveling fiasco. “A majority of the public think President Park should be stripped of ruling power,” said Rep. Sim Sang-jeung, the party’s chairwoman. Minor Justice Party leader Rep. Shim Sang-jeung. YonhapA poll released on the day showed 42 percent of the public want Park out of the presidential office – either voluntarily or by impeachment.Despite the agreement to launch a special probe into the unfolding scandal involving Choi, political parties remained divided over how to run the independent prosecutors.  Saenuri said the government can rely on current laws to adopt the special counsel, but Minjoo countered that the Assembly should enact a new law to name the prosecutor with an authority to investigate the president. According to the Act on the Appointment of Independent Prosecutors, the president can elect the counsel among seven candidates proposed by the Judiciary branch, legal community and the Assembly. Minjoo lawmakers fear that the president and Saenuri could choose the prosecutors in their favor because they have sway over only two seats assigned for opposition parties. The other five seats, they said, would be filled with candidates close to the government. If the new bill clears the Assembly, the lawmakers would decide the scope and period of the independent prosecutors. The current law stipulates that the special counsel must finish their investigation within 90 days after they begin their work. Saenuri, on the other hand, maintained that the current law should be applied and that the incumbent president should be exempt from being prosecuted. According to the current law, the president is not subject to charges for criminal offense during his or her tenure. By Yeo Jun-suk","bipartisan government political bigwigs ,bigwigs call for bipartisan ,parties thursday urged president ,political bigwigs call for ,to build bipartisan government","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.78766     0.29461351

255,255,Public fury grows over ‘Choi Soon-sil gate’,"Public outcry continued to grow Thursday, with more university students, professors and civic groups denouncing President Park Geun-hye over the scandal involving her close confidante.

While the embattled president has remained silent since her two-minute apology Tuesday, calls are growing for Park to take responsibility for the state crisis, with some even demanding her to step down.Students from a total of 15 universities across the country criticized Park for “destroying democracy and shaking the nation’s foundation,” by allowing Choi Soon-sill to use their relationship to interfere in state affairs. “We elected Park Geun-hye as a president in 2012, but since then, the power has transferred to Choi Soon-sil,” said students from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in their statement. “All the allegations make us doubt who the president of this country is.”The president is “downplaying suspicions” and “showing no remorse despite her violation of the Constitution,” students of Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology said in a statement. Earlier on Wednesday, students from Ewha Womans University, whose top management is suspected of giving special favors to Choi’s daughter Jeong Yoo-ra in the admission process, called for a thorough investigation. Students from Sogang University, Park’s alma mater, also demanded the president stop tarnishing the name of the school. More statements slamming the president and her confidante are set to follow, with several student bodies at major universities including Seoul National University and Korea University collecting opinions from students. Marking the first public condemnation of President Park by professors, a total of 32 professors from Sungkyunkwan University issued a statement Thursday morning. “We are ashamed of being members of this society,” they said. “The current president has no ability and conscience to lead the country. She deserves to be impeached, but it would not be desirable that she leaves the presidential office with only one year left.”Calligrapher Kang Byeong-in writes “President Park, causing chaos in politics, should resign,” in Korean, as a civil organization announces a declaration denouncing the president in Jongno, central Seoul on Thursday. They urged the president to form a comprehensive, neutral Cabinet which can take charge of state affairs from now on.A group of professors from Kyungbuk National University said in a statement that the president led the country into chaos due to her incompetence, irresponsibility, unfairness and involvement in corruption. “The meddling in state affairs by the president’s close aide was not even seen in the feudal age and it has shaken the foundation of the country’s identity as a democracy,” they said. “Park, who hurt Koreans’ pride and plunged the country into chaos, should step down.” Several civic groups have held, and will continue to hold, candlelight vigils and rallies across the country, demanding President Park resign. Lawyers groups, such as Seoul Bar Association and Lawyers for a Democratic Society, also called for an extensive probe into the case and punishment in accordance with the result.Two university students held a surprise rally at a convention center in Busan -- near where President Park attended a forum -- chanting “Park Geun-hye, step down. Arrest Choi Soon-sil.” They were caught and brought in for questioning on charges of violating the public assembly act. Some 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets calling for Park’s resignation in a large-scale rally held by labor unions, student groups and civic organizations along the Cheonggye stream near Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul from 6 p.m. on Saturday.Despite President Park’s rare apology in a televised address Tuesday over the leak of confidential information to Choi, the public’s anger appears to be far from eased. Choi is suspected of using her ties with the president to raise donations from conglomerates, embezzling donations for personal gain and having access to classified information about the president’s speeches and state polices. “I think ‘Choi Soon-sil gate’ only shows President Park Geun-hye is the leader gripped by an autocratic way of ruling the country,” Kim Se-min, 30-year-old office worker in Seoul, told The Korea Herald. “This scandal is an international embarrassment for Koreans.”“I supported President Park Geun-hye for her integrity in the hope that she could revive the economy like her father Park Chung-hee did,” said Cho Hee-jin, 52, a stay-at-home mother. “I am disappointed and feel sorry for the president that she had only a few friends like Choi Soon-sil who she can rely on and trust.”By Ock Hyun-ju","civic groups denouncing president ,two minute apology tuesday ,hye over the scandal ,groups denouncing president park ,groups denouncing president","['Park Geun', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.08242296  0.35005862

She is also suspected of having peddled influence to have her daughter admitted to a private college and of leaking confidential documents from Cheong Wa Dae. The Cultural Ministry has been accused of offering special treatment to the two private entities led by Choi, who allegedly twisted the arms of The Federation of Korean Industries, a business lobby group, to raise money worth 80 billion won  from conglomerates including Samsung, Hyundai and LG. “We will do our utmost to get to the bottom of the case. There will be no exception to our investigation,” said Lee Young-ryul, who leads the special investigation tem. “I feel a grave sense of responsibility for running the investigation on the national scandal.” Prosecutor Lee said that his team would seek to bring Choi, who is said to live in Germany, back to Korea using “every means available.” Earlier in the day, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong testified before lawmakers that the authorities have coordinated with their German counterparts to extradite her. The move came amid mounting criticism that the investigation was long overdue as the probe took place about a month after the charges against Choi were filed. Choi had already left Korea to Germany then. Mindful of the public pressure, Prosecutor General Kim Soo-Nam ordered “prompt and thorough” investigation led by the special investigation squad, whose report to Kim will be limited to the results, not developments, of the investigation. The decision appeared to stem from the concern that Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs whose job involves overseeing prosecutors, could meddle in the investigation amid the allegation that Woo himself was involved in the cronyism scandal.The prosecutor’s special investigation team is expected to work until an independent counsel is appointed. Historically, prosecutors have launched special probe teams targeting political and business scandals. Most recently, the special squad was organized in 2007 to investigate whether Samsung operated slush funds to offer bribes to high-profile government officials, including higher-ups in the prosecution.

Lee Jung-hyun  chief of the ruling Saenuri Party, talks with Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-sik at a meeting of the party's supreme council in Yeouido, Seoul, Thursday. But considering the investigators’ passive stance so far over the corruption allegations involving the president’s aides, observers have cast doubts on the efficacy of this new prosecution unit.The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office said Thursday it established a special investigation task force to dig into the alleged interference in state affairs by Choi Soon-sil.The key plan is to expand the conventional seven-member team which has focused on investigating the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation, organizations suspected to have functioned as fundraising tools for Choi.Also, the new team is to act independently from the SPO and only submit final reports to Prosecutor-General Kim Soo-nam, in order to prevent possible political pressure from above, officials said.The initial goal is to have Choi repatriated. Her precise whereabouts have been unknown since she left for Germany in July on a supposed overseas equestrian training trip for her daughter.“The ministry is taking all necessary measures to bring Choi back home,” said Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong at the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee meeting.“We have an obligation to keep information confidential in terms of judicial cooperation , so we cannot provide all the details.”Amid escalating public fury and reproach, Choi broke her long silence on Thursday through an exclusive interview with Segye Ilbo.“I helped  around the 2012 presidential election on how to express her state of mind  as I was close to her heart,” the interview quoted Choi as saying.Though Choi admitted to reviewing some confidential documents, including presidential speeches, she firmly denied having any untoward intentions in doing so, mirroring Park who had earlier claimed to have consulted Choi “only with pure intention” to thoroughly review the content.“I didn’t think it would be such a big problem, nor did I even know  were state secrets,” Choi told the reporter.“I wasn’t trying to become a lawmaker or grab power in any way, but only meant to help out of good faith, but now I am so sorry to have caused trouble, especially for the president.”Despite her apologies, however, Choi added she has no plan to return home, where she is certain to face additional questioning as well as the prosecutorial probe.“I am currently experiencing a nervous breakdown, as well as cardiac trouble,  thus unable to fly back immediately,” she said. “Once I recover, I shall ask for forgiveness and face the due punishment.”Faced with Choi’s explicit refusal to return, Cheong Wa Dae also voiced a call to the fugitive presidential aide.“The people are in great shock, and  should come back as soon as possible in order to clear up doubts,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters.This was the closest the Blue House has come to denouncing the disputed figure and consenting to her summoning since the scandal broke out.Even when President Park stepped out to offer a rare apology to the nation Tuesday, she only admitted to her connection to Choi and bowed to the camera, without further calls for investigation.By Bae Hyun-jung","thursday to repatriate choi ,home for questioning prosecutors ,on thursday to repatriate ,thursday to repatriate ,choi home for questioning","['Park Geun', 'Choi']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.0789872  0.19347051 0.23330225],Korea Herald,Politics,10,2016,"thursday to repatriate choi soon ,on thursday to repatriate choi ,thursday to repatriate choi ,thursday through an exclusive interview ,summoning since the scandal broke","['Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - sik', 'Yeouido', 'Seoul', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'the Mir Foundation', 'K - Sports Foundation', 'Choi', 'SPO', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'Choi', 'Germany', 'Choi', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Choi', 'Segye Ilbo', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Dae', 'Jung Youn', 'the Blue House', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",6,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.0789872  0.19347051 0.23330225]

President Park Geun-hye is running out of options -- and out of time, too.The long silence she has maintained amid the snowballing corruption allegation against Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo over the past several months did little to soothe the public’s anger.Her hurried call for the long-delayed constitutional revision – which was deemed an obvious attempt to blur over persisting political scandals -- was soon overshadowed by fresh evidence that a secret confidante of hers meddled in key state affairs.The president’s reluctant “apology,” which did little more than acknowledge the inappropriate string-pulling, only moved public sentiment from doubtful to utterly astounded and furious.What’s worse is that her approval rating had already fallen to a record low last week, and it is largely anticipated to dip further this week.But Cheong Wa Dae once again resorted to silence, all while seeking its way out of its worst political controversy, which has thrown the entire nation into a state of shock.“We have no comment to make on the issue,” was the only official response coming from spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk on Wednesday, following two consecutive days of revealing reports on the extensive political leverage of Choi Soon-sil, a presidential aide whose existence had long been under cover.As for the president herself, she abided by her already arranged schedule, meeting with top officials of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and attending a promotion ceremony for key military officials.But the accumulating reports on Choi’s involvement in confidential state affairs, as well as the aggravating public sentiment, are increasingly weighing down the president, pressing her to make an active gesture other than silence.Plausible scenarios include Park’s defection from the ruling Saenuri Party, voluntary resignation from power or a complete overhaul of the Cabinet. There is also the possibility of impeachment, as is the suggestion from some opposition camp figures.But all inevitably involve a fatal blow to presidential authority, which makes it difficult for the president to engage, especially with only 14 months remaining in her five-year term.Key leading figures of her Cabinet, such as Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong, on Wednesday claimed they do not “cling to their current post,” alluding to their possible resignations, if so required.But a Cabinet reshuffle that excludes the president is not such a likely strategy, as Park explicitly admitted her long-suspected ties with Choi, as well as the latter‘s involvement in state documents and presidential speeches.Also, as the prosecutorial probe on senior secretary Woo is ongoing, the Blue House faces a dilemma over whether or not to include him in the reshuffle list.A more realistic choice is for the president to defect from her home party, as demanded by the so-called non-Park figures who wish to distance themselves from the feud-ridden president.It seems that the problem in this case, however, is that Park may still continue to face a bashing, such as a special probe by an independent counsel, an idea to which the Saenuri consented in an unanimous vote. An opposition-motioned impeachment, too, is possible, on condition of a two-thirds approval of the 300-seat floor.Meanwhile, a recent nationwide survey by local pollster Realmeter showed Park’s approval rating standing at 28.5 percent on Oct. 17-21, just before the exclusive reports on Choi‘s influence-meddling. This was the first time the president‘s rating had fallen below the 30 percent mark since she took office in February 2013.By Bae Hyun-jung","is against embattled president ,in seoul on tuesday ,apology over the leak ,south korean president park ,against embattled president park","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Civil Affairs Woo Byung - wo']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36627233  0.38421616

Scrambling to come up with a recovery plan, Saenuri leadership Wednesday decided to join in the opposition-led move to have an independent investigation look into the allegations surrounding Choi Soon-sil. Its leaders earlier in the day proposed to the president a sweeping reshuffle of her secretaries and Cabinet members. Some want to draw a line between the embattled state leader and the party, calling for her to leave Saenuri. For the liberal opposition, the question is how far they want to push this, with some calling for the impeachment of the president. “Theoretically, it is possible” to impeach the president, said Rep. Shim Sang-jeung, a leader of the minor opposition Justice Party at a press conference Tuesday when Park admitted to sharing presidential speeches with her longtime friend Choi, who has never served in public office.Minjoo Party of Korea Chairman Rep. Choo Mi-ae speaks during a party meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. Joining the fray was some outspoken liberal politicians such as Seongnam City Mayor Lee Jae-myeong and Jung Chung-rae of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. They urged the party leadership to promptly begin proceedings for impeachment.But the proposal has gained little traction as the leaderships of political parties have doubts on whether the president’s wrongdoing would constitute grounds for impeachment and whether the political maneuver would work in their favor. Former Minjoo leader Rep. Moon Jae-in urged that the president should order a complete resignation of her Cabinet members and appoint a new prime minister who can exercise bipartisanship amid the political crisis. “It is the only way to bring the faltering nation back on track,” he said. “I am sincerely hoping that the president will not abandon her last duty as the head of the state. It is in the best interest of herself and the nation.” “Most people don’t want our government system to be suspended. Fortunately, I and our party members agree with that,” said People’s Party’s leader Rep. Park Jie-won. The president can be subject to impeachment when violating laws in performing official duties. The motion requires approvals by two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly and two-thirds of the Constitutional Court’s nine-member panel appointed by the president. Back when a coalition of conservative and centrist parties passed the motion to impeach the late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 for violation of political neutrality, the top court rejected the motion, saying that the allegation did not constitute grounds for the impeachment.    Faced with a torrent of backlash from the public, the then opposition Grand National Party, a forerunner to Saenuri, was defeated in the 2004 general election by the progressive Uri Party, the then ruling party that preceded Minjoo. “Even if the Assembly were to agree on proposing impeachment, I don’t think it would be approved by Constitutional Court,” said Seoul National University law professor Cho Guk, who worked at a reform committee for Minjoo. “It is an expression of political outrage.” Alarmed by the impeachment call, the ruling Saenuri Party’s leadership sought out options to salvage the beleaguered party, ranging from a shake-up of presidential aides and Cabinet members to demanding the defection of the president who is a Saenuri member. Leaders of the Saenuri Party, including Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun , attend a meeting of Saenuri lawmakers at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap“We agreed to ask the president to replace anyone involved with the scandal, regardless of how much they were involved,” Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun told reporters after a meeting with members of the party’s supreme council Wednesday. Dissenting lawmakers outside the faction close to President Park continued to denounce the party leadership for failing to address the scandal, urging Saenuri leadership, mostly belonging to the pro-Park faction, to resign en masse. Some conservative media outlets and online communities, meanwhile, floated the idea of impeaching the president. Chosun Ilbo has introduced the Chinese character for resignation in their papers and an impeachment call has appeared in Ilbe, an ultraconservative online community.

Her house and the FKI office were also included in the raid.Prosecutors said they have confiscated related documents and hard disks so they can conduct a thorough investigation. The raids came a day after Park offered a rare public apology over a leak of dozens of presidential speeches to Choi before they were made public.Acknowledging her ties to Choi, which go back decades, the president said she asked for consultation ""out of the best intent"" to be more thorough in her works. Still, the controversy has been growing after local broadcaster JTBC, who first reported on the document leak, said late Tuesday that there were other documents handed over to Choi, indicating her possible broader intervention in state affairs.Choi -- the daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min and ex-wife of Park's former secretary Chung Yun-hoi -- does not hold any official government position. Park earlier said Choi helped her from the time she was a lawmaker until the early stage of her presidential term, without elaborating on the specific dates.Also on Wednesday, prosecutors summoned a former head of The Blue K, where Choi is known to be the owner, to investigate whether any money was unlawfully funneled to her. Blue K is suspected of trying to get funding from the Mir and K-Sports foundations.","prosecutors raid scandal ridden ,wednesday raided two nonprofit ,prosecutors on wednesday raided ,state prosecutors raid scandal ,raided two nonprofit foundations","['Park Geun', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'the Mir Foundation', 'the K - Sports Foundation', 'Seoul']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.08154677 0.16389841 0.43376794],임정요,Social affairs,10,2016,"wednesday raided two nonprofit foundations ,over corruption suspicions the seoul ,state prosecutors on wednesday raided ,raided two nonprofit foundations allegedly ,on wednesday raided two nonprofit","['Park Geun', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'the Mir Foundation', 'the K - Sports Foundation', 'Seoul', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'FKI', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Park', 'Chung Yun - hoi', 'Choi', 'the Blue K', 'Choi', 'Blue K', 'K - Sports']",17,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.08154677 0.16389841 0.43376794]

The Intelligent Electronic Monitoring System will track wearers and collect more data about them, which ministry officials said will be used to anticipate and deter repeat crimes. South Korea requires sexual abusers, kidnappers, murderers and other criminals to wear electronic devices that track their locations. However, the effectiveness of the current monitoring system introduced in 2008 has been questioned in recent years, as there have been numerous cases in which the wearers either broke or damaged the anklet, and reoffended. The new controlling devices will focus on the prevention of crimes, the ministry said. A Justice Ministry displays different models of electronic monitoring anklets that have been used since 2008 at the ministry’s head office in Seoul on Oct. 20. The new anklet, which is still being developed, will collect data about wearers and their surrounding environment, location and biometrics such as heartbeat and body temperature. This will be sent in real-time to a central control center. The center will then analyze the information based on past criminal techniques and their movement patterns to predict the risk of the ex-convict committing another crime. “We are currently at the stage of testing a number of sample anklets,” an authority from the ministry said. “We are now trying to raise the accuracy of the predictions.”The new device is also designed to be made with new, harder-to-break materials, the ministry said. “The department will come up with a new material to strengthen the durability of the device.”The justice body first used medical silicon for the anklet band in 2008 and added thin stainless metal after several cases of abuse occurred.As of May this year, the number of anklet-wearing criminals stands at 2,501, a big rise from 151 in the first year of its introduction. A man with a handmade gun cut off his electronic monitoring bracelet and killed a policeman near Opaesan in northern Seoul on Sept. 19, while a 37-year-old man surnamed Seo was arrested after breaking off his anklet on the same day and running away to Seonyudo, an island in North Jeolla Province. By Jo He-rim","plans to outfit criminals ,deter repeat crimes south ,future crimes as part ,deter future crimes ,tags to deter crimes","['the Justice Ministry', 'the Intelligent Electronic Monitoring System', 'South Korea']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40016973 -0.06812194

This photo, captured from local broadcaster JTBC on Oct. 25, 2016, shows copies of presidential speeches obtained from the files of a computer from Choi Soon-sil's office in southern Seoul. In a shocking revelation, local cable TV channel JTBC reported late Monday that it found over 200 documents purportedly leaked from Cheong Wa Dae on an abandoned computer used by Choi. These included presidential speeches and addresses for various meetings and important national occasions. Signs of editing were also spotted, it claimed. The prosecution plans to get from JTBC the desktop computer where the presidential documents were reportedly found. A civic group filed a complaint Tuesday, demanding all those responsible for the leak be duly punished. Later on Tuesday, the president admitted to the leak, saying she sought Choi’s opinions on her speeches and addresses out of pure intentions. Calls are mounting that the prosecution should question Choi, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.The probe was initially about two nonprofit foundations, Mir and K-sports, allegedly set up and run by Choi. The entities, within less than a year, raised a combined 75 billion won  from major conglomerates, such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG. Choi is suspected of having inappropriately peddled influence in the creation and operation of the two foundations. On Tuesday, Lee Yong-woo, an executive of the Federation of Korean Industries, an association of large business groups, was called in by investigators over his involvement in the fundraising campaigns. Mir and K-Sports are established under the auspices of FKI.","drafts for presidential speeches ,over 200 confidential files ,leaked documents by korea ,staff state prosecutors investigating ,widen to leaked documents","['Korea Herald', 'State', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35282972  0.12149671

Park may take credit for one thing nonetheless. She has been largely free from scandals involving family members, which pestered the presidencies of many of her predecessors, especially in later years.  Albeit not her own, one family has tirelessly risen to the center of controversy -- that of Choi Soon-sil, Park’s old friend who is the daughter of her late mentor Choi Tae-min and the ex-wife of the president’s former secretary Jeong Yoon-hoe. The 60-year-old Choi is suspected of having peddled influence in the launch and operation of two nonprofit sports and culture funds alongside Ahn Chong-bum, the senior presidential secretary on policy coordination. Choi Soon-sil The Mir and K-Sports foundations were respectively set up in October 2015 and January 2016 with 48.6 billion  and 28.8 billion won in donations -- collected over the course of less than a week -- from major conglomerates including Samsung, Hyundai Motor, LG and SK. Soon after they were set up, the organizations began taking charge of cultural events during Park’s overseas trips. A fresh allegation has also emerged that they have been bankrolling the training of Choi’s horseback rider daughter by providing financial support to her through two paper companies, Widec and The Blue K.The scandal intensified late Monday upon JTBC news reports revealing 44 of Park’s speech scripts that had been retrieved from a computer left behind in Choi’s deserted office in Seoul. The texts, which should have been kept confidential before they went public, appear to have been edited by Choi up to three days ahead or as short as 12 hours before they were given by the president. The disclosure is in line with remarks by Choi’s confidant in an earlier media interview that “the only thing she is good at is revising the president’s speeches.” Lee Sung-han, a former secretary general of the Mir Foundation, said in another interview with the Hankyoreh daily released Tuesday that Jeong Ho-seong, one of Park’s closest aides, delivered a file as thick as 30 centimeters to Choi “almost every night” and transferred her instructions back to Cheong Wa Dae, which later turned into actual policies. Choi also ran meetings with two to five people to discuss issues ranging from Park’s schedule to inter-Korean policy and cabinet shakeups. “The structure was in fact like Choi orders this and that. There was no issue on which the president could make a decision alone -- it was only possible with Choi’s approval,” Lee was quoted as saying.The relationship between Park and Choi dates back to the late 1970s, when Choi’s father was head of a volunteer corps designed to promote the Saemaul Undong rural development movement of the president’s late father and longtime strongman Park Chung-hee. Choi Soon-sil then chaired the organization’s student unit. Choi’s involvement in presidential affairs has hardly been a secret since Park Geun-hye became president. She even wore a traditional hanbok picked by Choi during her swearing-in ceremony, according to other news reports. In 2014, another major scandal broke out after a leak of documents from the presidential office alleging Choi’s husband had been deeply interfering with human management issues and other elements of statecraft. Yet the prosecution quickly closed the case amid criticism over its perceived slack investigation despite the suicide of a working-level police officer and the sacking of then presidential secretaries for civil affairs. Before being imprisoned for writing and handing over the papers to reporters, Park Gwan-chun, a police superintendent who was working at Cheong Wa Dae, left a now famous saying: “In terms of the rank of power in the current administration, Choi comes first and Jeong second, followed by the president herself.” By Shin Hyon-hee","woman behind scandals plaguing ,scandals plaguing park throughout ,her government slipshod response ,the woman behind scandals ,woman behind scandals",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.06565899  0.2327114

Choo Mi-ae, chairperson of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea.“The constitutional amendment was used as a tool to cover the Choi Soon-sil corruption scandal and to prolong the life of this administration which has already lost the people’s support.”The Minjoo Party chief thus blasted the president’s proposal to amend the nation’s Constitution, a surprise agendum brought up during Park’s parliamentary speech on the previous day.The president‘s proposal, though it raised suspicions she was trying to divert the public’s attention away from the persisting corruption charges of her aides, gained approval to a certain extent. The key point was to alter the current five-year, single-term presidency which, according to the president and a number of lawmakers, no longer fits the political reality nowadays.But the issue has quickly dwindled as the JTBC report pinned the spotlight on the Park-Choi connection, undermining the leverage of the president‘s message.“It is now President Park who should be subject to  investigation,” the party’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho said.“Incumbent president or not,  should speak out the truth on this matter which is sending shock waves throughout our nation.”Rep. Park Jie-won of the runner-up opposition People’s Party sarcastically claimed the president would not be able to submit a constitutional revision bill now that the de facto power Choi has fled.And this time, the president’s home party did not take to her defense, considering the given scandal a roadblock ahead of next year’s presidential election.“I am utterly ashamed of the recent series of news reports, which show that top confidential presidential documents were leaked en masse,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk in a party meeting.“Should the reports be true, President Park should personally take the stand and offer her explanation.”Rep. Ha Tae-keung, a non-mainstream member of the party, suggested that discussions for constitutional revision should be held off.“We should realize that this major corruption scandal may ultimately destroy the people‘s trust, not only for the current administration but for our party as well.”By Bae Hyun-jung","leak scandal shakes park ,presidential speeches the report ,awkward silence tuesday following ,leak scandal shakes ,confidential documents including presidential","['Cheong', 'Dae', 'Park Geun - hye']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24837625  0.04777124

If the documents are genuine, Park is likely to face a major crisis over violations of related security laws and involving her personal confidante in state affairs.  South Korean President Park Geun-hye delivers a speech in the former East German city of Dresden in this 2013 file photo. The draft for Dresden Declaration in March 2013 was one of the speeches found on the computer of Park’s confidante Choi Sun-sil on Monday. YonhapThe files on Choi’s computer are mostly documents sent from Cheong Wa Dae, including drafts of speeches by Park. It appears the 60-year-old Choi received the draft versions for presidential addresses, up to three days before the speeches were to be delivered. Evidence of editing was also found, according to the Monday report by JTBC, a cable TV channel which broke the story.The discovery came a week after JTBC first reported that Choi edited President Park’s speeches in advance. The report touched off a strong dispute as Choi, who holds no public office, should not be given any access to confidential presidential documents. Lee Won-jong, chief of staff at Cheong Wa Dae, flatly denied the allegations, saying they “would not be possible, even in a feudal state.” The drafts of presidential speeches are not thought to be accessible even to Cheong Wa Dae officials, except for a very small number of close aides to Park. Lee is now under fire for making the feudal state comment that appears to be contradicted by the evidence on Choi’s computer. Cheong Wa Dae cut off communications with reporters shortly after the story of Choi’s PC surfaced, repeating the perfunctory message that it was checking the facts, fueling speculation about the authenticity of the documents. A snapshot from JTBC’s report on MondayA reporter from JTBC obtained Choi’s computer near her office before it was destroyed. Choi is rumored to have masterminded the establishment of the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation -- both of which are at the center of an unfolding corruption scandal. Choi is suspected to have pushed chaebol groups and their lobbying organization to donate to the foundations. Choi’s daughter, named Chung Yu-ra, recently came under a firestorm of criticism for getting special favors from Ewha Womans University, including special admission and generous handling of her academic records, even though she missed most of the classes. Taking responsibility for the Chung Yu-ra scandal, Ewha’s president resigned last Wednesday while professors and students staged a massive protest rally.

""In order to fundamentally address pending issues facing our nation and achieve sustainable development, it is inevitable that we alter the overall framework of our state management through a constitutional revision in line with changes that have taken place so far,"" Hwang said during a Cabinet meeting.In her parliamentary speech on Monday, Park said her government would begin ""working-level"" preparations to rewrite the Constitution, last amended in 1987. She also said the government will set up a body to handle the revision with a view to making the changes within her presidential term that ends in February 2018.At the Cabinet meeting, Hwang also called on ministers to make ""active"" efforts to ensure that the budget plans -- worth 400.7 trillion won  -- for next year will pass the National Assembly on time. The legislature is required by law to pass the budget bill by Dec. 2, although it frequently misses the deadline.The prime minister, in addition, stressed the importance of close cooperation between the government, enterprises and workers so as to make the next economic ""leap"" forward amid a series of economic challenges from home and abroad.","on the government tuesday ,speaks during cabinet meeting ,day after president park ,the government tuesday ,government tuesday to carry","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul']",10,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.01756399 0.42848793 0.33123404],임정요,Politics,10,2016,"called on the government tuesday ,her parliamentary speech on monday ,hwang said during cabinet meeting ,rewrite the constitution last amended ,the government tuesday to carry","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul', 'Hwang', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang', 'the National Assembly']",13,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.01756399 0.42848793 0.33123404]

During her parliamentary speech to call for cooperation in passing the nation’s budget bill for next year, Park pledged to make every effort to achieve the revision before her term ends in February 2018.“I have reached the conclusion that  may no longer delay the discussions on constitutional revision, which was also one of my election pledges,” Park said.“As of today, I will embrace the people’s call for constitutional amendment as a national political agenda and set up what is needed to achieve this goal.”The key point of the revision is to change the currently single five-year presidential term which, according to the president, has made it difficult for the government to pursue consistency in policies.President Park Geun-hye gives her 2017 budget speech at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. “The single five-year presidential term system, which has been in effect since the 1987 revision, might have suited the democratization movement era in the past, but no longer fits our current situation,” she said.The state leader’s sudden drive for the basic law reform is a change from her former passive stance on the issue. Park had previously disapproved of any full-fledged talks on the issue, citing more urgent tasks such as economic challenges and North Korea’s military provocations.Though the revision was one of her core election campaign pledges in 2012, it was the opposition-leaning National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun who rekindled the topic after taking office this year.Park’s explanation was that the discussion on rewriting the Constitution had to wait until the “right time.”“I have so far put off the talks on constitutional revision, not only to focus on national security and economic challenges, but also to prevent a further split in public sentiment,” Park said.“But in order to fundamentally renew the frame of state management, I have judged that it is crucial to set up a mid- and long-term system that may boost our nation into the ranks of advanced countries.”She also cited the “forthcoming political schedule,” referring to the presidential election slated for December 2017, to urge for speedy progress of the revision.Considering that a constitutional revision takes at least 110 days from bill submission to actual effectuation, the referendum to ask for the people’s approval is anticipated to be held no later than March-April next year. One of the plausible scenarios is that it will be held along with the April by-election so as to minimize costs.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae approved of the president’s active involvement in the issue.“Either the president or the majority of the National Assembly is entitled to call for a constitutional revision, so President Park may directly submit a government-motioned bill,” said Kim Jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, at a briefing.He also added that it is best for the state leader to steer the discussion as the given talks may be held back when faced by individual political interests.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party welcomed the president’s gesture, praising her initiative.“This is the best day since this administration kicked off, as the president took the lead in establishing a decentralized power system,” said Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the party’s former chairman and one of the presidential aspirants for next year’s race.Kim, who has often stood at odds with the party’s mainstream pro-Park faction, also dismissed the idea that the president may have brought up the issue to divert public attention away from the ongoing corruption scandals involving some of her closest aides.The opposition camp remained cautious over its stance, approving of the constitution revision in general but expressing doubts on the president’s underlying political intentions.Moon Jae-in, former chairman and ranking presidential runner of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, said that he will defer his judgment on the president’s speech.“President Park has so often underlined that the constitutional revision talk will act as a ‘political black hole’ to overshadow all other agendas, especially in the later part of the presidential term when economic revitalization should be prioritized,” Moon told reporters.“Now that she mentions , it makes me wonder whether she is in need of such a black hole .”Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the runner-up opposition People’s Party revealed his uneasiness more blatantly.“My concern is that the president may be attempting to cover up the suspicions involving Woo Byung-woo and Choi Soon-sil,” the presidential aspirant told reporters.The senior presidential secretary Woo and the daughter of presidential mentor Choi have been at the center of a series of corruption allegations, but Park has so far refrained from directly mentioning their faults.Ahn also pointed out the irony of Park’s constitutional revision drive, referring to her past opposition to the two-term presidency.Back in January 2007, when the late former President Roh Moo-hyun spoke of a constitutional amendment based on a four-year, two-term presidency, then-opposition party chief Park called him a “bad president,” accusing him of prioritizing political interests over the people’s happiness.By Bae Hyun-jung","monday proposed the amendment ,most controversial political debates ,debates during her parliamentary ,next year park pledged ,for constitutional revision president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40964431  0.36454916

Hong was indicted for general obstruction of traffic. The second and the third indictments involved Hong’s graffiti works on construction site walls nearby the Hongik University subway station in Seoul in November 2015. Hong had left graffiti of the late former president Park Chung-hee and his daughter and incumbent President Park Geun-hye, resulting in two indictments for destruction of property.   On Facebook, Hong said she was questioned not as much for the damage of property but for her actions of satirizing the head of the state.According to Hong, investigators asked her about why she produced the works, whether they were targeting the president and what she meant by “Sayonara ,” all of which Hong felt were irrelevant to her accusation of property damage. Hong claims that other graffiti, containing swear words and obscenities, was left untampered with on the construction site walls where her satirical works were.  Hong further claims the purported victim of the case, the owner of the construction site, never filed for a complaint but the police contacted him first for comments.The young activist is relaying the court developments on her Facebook page. She plans to seek to form a class action suit, along with other artists. regarding the government’s art censorship and encroachment of freedom of expression by Nov. 11, when a court hearing is scheduled.

It also called in two current working-level officials from the Mir Foundation.At the heart of the scandal surrounding these foundations is Choi Soon-sil, known to be an acquaintance of the president. Choi is the daughter of Park’s mentor Choi Tae-min and the ex-wife of the Park’s former secretary Chung Yun-hoi.Choi is suspected of having inappropriately peddled influence in the creation and operation of the two foundations. Opposition lawmakers have also raised allegations that she might have misappropriated funds from the foundations that have since been disbanded. Choi does not hold any titles in Mir or K-Sports, although she is indirectly connected to the owner of The Blue K, a company created to support athletes and fuel sports-related exchanges.An Chong-bum, currently the senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, is also purported to have exerted influence to pressure major companies to dole out money in the creation of the two foundations.On the same day, the prosecution also questioned a government official who was in charge of approving the establishment of the Mir Foundation last year.A day earlier, the prosecution questioned two director-general-level officials at the culture, sports and tourism ministry.

President Park Geun-hye’s chief of staff Lee Won-jong answers a question from a lawmaker during a parliamentary audit on Friday at the National Assembly in Seoul. Speaking for such sour public sentiment is the stern appraisal by a coalition of representative civic groups, which graded the parliamentary audit performance an “F” in its midway report last week.“I believe that the final evaluation will not be much different either,” was the pessimistic prediction of Hong Geum-ae, commissioner of the nongovernmental organization Watchdog for State Audit.“Rival parties have been so preoccupied with their respective political battles that they found relatively little time to pay attention to the audit itself.”The three-week state audit, which was slated to start on Sept. 26, went astray from the very first day amid the inter-party feuding over the suggested dismissal of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo.After the opposition parties jointly submitted a motion to dismiss the newly appointed minister for ethical lapses, the ruling Saenuri Party immediately lodged complaints, especially against Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, who put the motion to a floor vote.The attitude and remarks coming from Chung, whose affiliation with the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea is suspended due to his position as legislative chief, were a violation of political neutrality, the Saenuri Party claimed.The party’s boycott of the audit sessions, as well as the hunger strike staged by its Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, clouded key pending issues such as North Korea’s nuclear program, restructuring of the ailing shipbuilding industry and follow-up actions on the recent earthquakes in the southeastern part of the peninsula.Even after the audit resumed its track, rival parties failed to pay sufficient focus on the given agenda.The opposition fixed its eye on clarifying the extensive political influence-peddling suspicion, involving close aides to President Park Geun-hye, while Cheong Wa Dae and Saenuri remained reserved on the issue, only refusing to send key figures as witnesses in the audit.At the peak of the political deadlock was the audit session on the 16 metropolitan and provincial education offices earlier in the month.During the two-day session on Oct. 6-7, the parliamentary committee for education, culture, sports and tourism was dominated by the dispute over the Culture Ministry’s approval of two dubious foundations -- Mir and K-Sports.The two disputed organizations, under the alleged influence of mysterious presidential confidant Choi Soon-sil, are suspected to have exerted pressure upon the Blue House and the industrial circles to raise donation funds.The later part of the audit was pushed out of the limelight by a recently-published memoir of former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon, which made allegations against the main opposition party’s former chairman and top presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in.In his book, Song stated that the former Roh Moo-hyun administration had contacted North Korea in 2007 to ask whether Seoul should vote to adopt the UN resolution condemning Pyongyang’s human rights situation. Seoul ended up abstaining in the vote.The Saenuri Party took this disputed claim as a counteroffensive opportunity and blasted Moon for his alleged “collusion” with the communist North and also for his vague explanation of the matter.Between the political brawls were controversial remarks made by interpellators, many of them going viral.Rep. Han Sun-kyo of the Saenuri Party came under fire for his sexually offensive mockery of his female opposition counterpart. Rep. Eoh Kiy-ku of the Minjoo Party posed allegations against the wrong person, mistaking him for the son of a ranking government official, for which he later recanted and apologized.“There is nothing wrong  to speak out on what is wrong, but the question is whether everybody should rush to ask the same question over and over,” Hong said.“It is crucial that the opposition plays its proper role and carries out a thorough state audit in order to regain the people’s trust and hope, which is not the case now.”The state audit was adopted in the nation’s initial Constitution in 1948, was scrapped in 1972 under the former President Park Chung-hee and revived in 1987, as a product of democratization.Allowing the legislature to monitor the administration, the system not only sought a balance of state powers, but also opened doors for ambitious young lawmakers to make their name with insightful researches and cutting remarks.But with the soaring number of subject government organizations and the limited length of time, the yearly event largely turned into what the public saw as a political show.“Under our presidential system it is nevertheless crucial that the legislature maintains its monitoring function over the administration,” said Shin Yul, professor of political science at Myongji University.“The problem is not the state audit system itself but the way that it operates.”By Bae Hyun-jung /","disgraced with political brawls ,kicked off in june ,political brawls when the ,this year parliamentary audit ,political brawls when",['National Assembly'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69861782  0.1763384

278,278, Moon in hot seat over ambiguity on memoir scandal,"Faced with attacks from both conservative foes and fellow liberals, Moon Jae-in, in 2012, had urged political parties to stop questioning his ability to deal with inter-Korea relations as a presidential candidate.“They are relying on McCarthyist tactics to launch yet another vicious ideological attacks,” Moon had said, then running for the country‘s top job on the ticket of the New Politics Alliance of Democracy, ...","Faced with attacks from both conservative foes and fellow liberals, Moon Jae-in, in 2012, had urged political parties to stop questioning his ability to deal with inter-Korea relations as a presidential candidate.“They are relying on McCarthyist tactics to launch yet another vicious ideological attacks,” Moon had said, then running for the country‘s top job on the ticket of the New Politics Alliance of Democracy, a precursor to today’s Minjoo Party of Korea.Throughout the 2012 race, Moon had struggled with an allegation that the former Roh Moo-hyun administration compromised its position with North Korea on a territorial dispute. Having served the Roh administration as the presidential chief of staff, Moon was eventually defeated by then Saenuri Party‘s candidate Park Geun-hye.Moon Jae-in With about a year left to the 2017 election, a similar challenge appears to loom over Moon’s second presidential bid. The opposition party’s frontrunner is being denounced for accepting the proposal to inquire of North Korea about whether Seoul should vote to adopt a 2007 UN resolution condemning Pyeongyang’s human rights situation.The scandal presents Moon with a question about his presidential bid: Will the 63-year-old activist-turned-politician, who has ranked the most favorite presidential candidate among the opposition bloc for months, succumb to the same fate as he did in the previous election? “It is a whole different situation,” said Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. “Back then, Moon fell into the trap made by Saenuri. But now, I don’t think Saenuri knows what they are doing. The fight won’t last long.” But the squabble has persisted longer than the whip expected and -- regardless of whether Saenuri had indeed engineered the political fight -- the pressure appeared to mount against the opposition parties’ frontrunner. Saenuri has pulled out all the stops. Casting Moon as a “sympathizer” to the North, the conservative party established a special committee to investigate the case and considers a plan to press charge against him for violating national security law. Their attacks have been fueled as Moon remained defensive. Since the allegation first surfaced, he has neither confirmed nor denied whether he approved of the proposal to ask North Korea about Seoul’s UN votes. When asked about the allegation by the reporters on Tuesday, Moon replied “We promised not to ask these questions, didn’t we.” A day earlier, he said that he “didn’t quite remember” about the meeting where Moon and former Cabinet members attended to discuss the voting issue. Instead, Moon continued to rebuke Saenuri attacks as a stint, accusing conservative lawmakers of labeling opposition lawmakers for advocating pro-North Korea ideology to divert the public attention away from the bribery scandal surrounding President Park’s close associates. “Whenever elections approache, Saenuri has always employed McCarthyist tactics,” Moon told reporters on Wednesday. “It is like a chronic disease. I will use  as an opportunity to fix such bad behavior.”His strategy, however, did not resonate well with other liberal heavyweights such as the People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park jie-won, one of the staunchest advocate of rapprochement policy toward Pyeongyang. “I doubt Moon has the leadership to navigate through a crisis,” said Park, who defected from then main oppostion NPAD that Moon had led before the latest April general election. “Instead of flip-flopping, I urged Moon to come forward and tell the people about the truth. He needs to end this debate.” Known for professional integrity and ethical behavior during his stint as the president’s chief adviser, Moon entered politics as a lawmaker in 2012 after the former president Roh took his own life in 2009 amid a bribery scandal involving his associates. Though being defeated by President Park in the 2012 presidential election -- the tightest race in South Korea’s modern history -- Moon was elected as the leader of the NPAD on the back of rank-and-file members royal to president Roh and his liberal values. But his tenure was marked by constant strife between the pro-Roh faction and its dissenters. The internal feud prompted some liberal heavyweights such as former presidential hopeful Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo to create his own People’s Party.Political analysts noted that the memoir scandal could be watershed moment for Moon, who last month launched his own think-tank with more than 600 political and economic experts in what observers saw as “de facto” declaration of presidential bid. “If he passes this test, it would place him on a frontrunner status,” said Seoul-based political think tank Moa Agenda Strategy in its weekly report. “But he would be in serious trouble, if he shows ambiguity on the issue.”By Yeo Jun-suk","ambiguity on memoir scandal ,vicious ideological attacks moon ,presidential candidate ,political parties to stop ,2012 had urged political","['Moon Jae - in', 'inter - korea', 'McCarthyist', 'Moon', 'the New Politics Alliance of Democracy']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43491545  0.09978047

Students of Ewha Womans University stand in protest at the school campus in Seoul on Oct. 17, demanding that university chief Choi Kyung-hee resign.Jeong’s mother Choi is suspected to be a political bigwig peddling influence in state affairs behind the scene. Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, the late pastor who is said to have served as a mentor for President Park. The scandal erupted at a time when the school and its president were reeling from a bitter confrontation with students who opposed the president’s now-aborted plan to set up a state-funded college of continuing education for working women.They have staged the sit-in since July 28, demanding Choi’s resignation, continuing it even after she decided to withdraw the plan on Aug. 3.  The students ended the protest after the announcement of her departure.   The resignation came an hour before the university professors were set to hold a rally in front of the main hall of the university to call for Choi’s ouster in the afternoon.  “If allegations that Jeong received special treatment in the admission process and the school changed the policy to protect her from the crisis are proven true, it would pose a threat to the foundation of the university,” said the professors. “We are really sorry that we did not stand up for the students earlier. We promise to fight on behalf of our students from now on. Students sacrificed too much in this lonely fight.” By Ock Hyun-ju","president quits amid scandals ,university stepped down tuesday ,womans university stepped down ,tuesday amid snowballing allegations ,daughter of president park","['Ewha Womans University', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Jee - song)“I']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31435725  0.46243054

Some political watchers now say the issue may linger on for months, exerting significant damage on Moon ahead of the presidential election slated for December next year.“This is not just about evaluating the sayings and doings of an individual politician, but about restoring the  damaged diplomatic stature,” said Saenuri Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun at the party’s emergent meeting.Moon Jae-in  conserves with Song Min-soon  in this file photo from April 2007. The given dispute stemmed from the book “Moving the Glacier,” a political memoir published last week by Song Min-soon, who served as foreign minister under the former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun administration while Moon was presidential Chief of Staff.Song argued that the Roh administration had decided to withdraw a vote after hearing negative response from the North, which conflicted with a claim by former government officials that the decision had been made before contacting the North.Saenuri’s chief also reiterated his earlier use of the controversial expression “covertly colluding” to describe Moon’s alleged inquiry to North Korea back in 2007 about whether Seoul should vote to adopt the UN resolution condemning Pyongyang’s human rights situation.“A matter that may decide the people’s fate should not be discussed covertly,” Lee said.“Yet  did it in secret, which leads to suspicions that there may have been other similar cases .”Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, too, blasted Moon, especially on his recent claim that he did not “remember the details” of the disputed event.“Should the memoir be true, this is an abandonment of sovereignty and an obvious treason to the nation,” he said.“Moon keeps changing his words, without even clarifying the suggested suspicions. It is hard to believe that a man like this assisted the president.”The party’s vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup refuted the opposition’s claim that Saenuri was using the issue to launch an ideological attack on presidential hopeful Moon.“Our goal is not to launch an ideology-based battle against Moon, but to find out the truth about this sensational case and to report it to the people.”The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, while refraining from detailed comments, is expected to mention the issue in the president’s meeting with senior secretaries. The top officials’ meeting, which was suddenly called off Monday, is likely to take place Thursday, just a day before the parliamentary state audit on the Blue House.Facing such mounting aggression, Minjoo set forth a counterargument, defending its former chairman and accusing the ruling party of clouding corruption scandals.“The Saenuri Party is riding on a melting glacier, which will soon disappear like a mirage,” said floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho at a party meeting.Key party officials also discredited Song’s memoir, claiming that the then-Roh government’s communication with the North was but a notification of an already-made decision, not bilateral consultation.“Saenuri is a party which raised a groundless suspicion, which turned out to be false, and never apologized for it,” said Rep. Kim Kyung-soo, one of the closest aides to Moon.He was referring to an allegation raised in 2012, ahead of the presidential election, that the late President Roh had tried to nullify the inter-Korean sea border in the West Sea -- the Northern Limit Line. The suggestion is seen as having delivered a substantial blow to then-candidate Moon.Meanwhile, Moon remained reticent over the memoir dispute, even expressing uneasy feelings over related questions.“I understand that you agreed not to ask those questions,” Moon said, in answer to reporters’ questions during his visit to a child care center in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province.“You should go ask your questions to those who have a good memory .”By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential hopeful moon jae ,opposition top presidential hopeful ,heavyweight moon on tuesday ,tuesday the main opposition ,top presidential hopeful moon","['Moon Jae - in', 'Saenuri Party', 'Moon', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48634642  0.49979115

Former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon, in his memoir released last week, said that presidential aides and cabinet members serving at the previous, liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration had inquired of North Korea about whether Seoul should vote to adopt a 2007 UN resolution condemning Pyeongyang’s human rights situation.In the book titled “Moving the Glacier,” the 68-year-old retired diplomat claimed that his objection to the inquiry was shot down by others including former Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in, who then served as presidential chief of staff. “I insisted that we should approve the vote for longer term; It was quite obvious what sort of answer we would get if we asked North Korea ,” he wrote. “After a long debate, we concluded that we should ask. I couldn’t argue anymore. Walking out of the meeting, I felt so ashamed of myself.”The eight-page description -- an excerpt from the 550-page volume -- puts Song, who now works as the president of the University of North Korean Studies, into the national spotlight as his former colleagues disputed his claim and political parties subjected his book to partisan conflict. Former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon is flanked by reporters as he arrives at his office in Seoul on Monday. Song argued that the Roh administration decided to withdraw the vote after hearing negative response from the North, but the previous government’s policymakers countered that they had already decided on the abstention before contacting the North. When abstaining from a vote on the 2007 UN resolution, the Roh administration described the move as a decision based on “unique circumstance” between the two Korea who had just held summits about a month before. A year earlier, the South had approved a similar UN motion, but it happened after the North’s nuclear test. Then presidential chief of staff Moon, who discussed the voting issue with Song and other former Cabinet members, said Monday that he did not remember exactly what happened. He had not clarified his position beforehand. “ say I was leaning toward the position of the Foreign Minister  but shifted my position toward the majority . Well, I don’t quite remember,” said Moon in an interview with reporters MondayThose who attended the meeting with Song asserted that the memoir contains information based on an “inaccurate memory,” reflecting a “biased view” from the former minister who wanted Seoul to take a more assertive tone against Pyongyang, working in tandem with the international community and the United States.“I don’t think Song’s book is accurate because memoirs are often self-centered,” Lee Jae-jung, who was the unification minister at the time, said in a media interview Monday. Advocating abstention, he had clashed with Song throughout the decision-making process, Lee recalled. The former minister, one of the staunchest advocates of the Roh administration’s rapprochement policy toward the North, argued that their decision to contact North Korea was not to “inquire” about Pyeongyang’s position, but to “notify” of Seoul’s decision adopted by the majority of the presidential aides and Cabinet members.Kim Man-bok, who then headed the National Intelligence Service, also disputed Song’s claim that he himself was the one who first proposed the idea of asking the North. He denounced Song for leaking classified information and vowed to testify before the lawmakers to prove himself. Describing the mounting controversy over his book as “unhelpful” to building effective policies toward North Korea and its nuclear threat, Song maintained that his memoir contains the truth and urged the people to see the book in a boarder context. “Pulling just one piece of the book dealing with two Koreas’ unification and North Korea’s nuclear weapon does not do any justice to anyone,” Song told reporters in the afternoon. “My book is based on records, not memories.” The former minister went on to defend the accusation that his book, published just a year away from the 2017 presidential election, has a political motive targeting the opposition bloc’s front-runner Moon while aiding politicians close to him such as the outgoing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Rep. Park Beom-kye of the Minjoo Party claimed that Song devoted hefty portions of his book to praising the tenure of Ban, who served as foreign minister between 2004 and 2006 before Song took over his job. “I began writing the book three years ago and tried to publish it last year to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 19 Joint Statement,” Song said, referring to the landmark 2005 agreement calling for verifiable denuclearization of the North. “But it took a year more than I thought,” he said. Moon Chung-in, professor emeritus of Yonsei University, disputed that Song’s memoir has a political purpose, noting that the book is an account of the bureaucratic struggle between a hawkish foreign minister and dovish unification minister over how to deal with North Korea.“As far as I know, Song is not the type of person to promote certain presidential candidates,” said Moon, who held high-profile posts dealing with relations between the two Koreas during the Roh administration. “Song just wanted to write about his legacy as a foreign minister.” By Yeo Jun-suk","bribery scandals involving president ,with memoir while lawmakers ,scandals involving president park ,tat over bribery scandals ,scandals involving president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Song Min', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'North Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27539498  0.38319013

Jeong, whose father is President Park’s ex-aide Jeong Yun-hoe, has been accused of entering the prestigious university on the back of her mother’s connections and receiving good grades despite long absences from the school and submission of assignments past deadlines. “Jeong did not attend any classes, excusing herself for participating in a horse-racing competition, but she earned a grade. The school even offered a personal guide for her to complete her seasonal course,” said Choi Eun-hye, president of the student council from Ewha Womans University at a press conference held on campus Monday. Members of Ewha Womans University‘s student council hold banners condemning the school‘s alleged admissions fraud and preferential treatment to the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, a close friend of President Park Geun-hye, at the university campus in Seoul on Monday. “Other students athletes  retire early  because the academic schedule is too tight and Ewha Womans University does not excuse them,” she said. “The reason that the university gave special treatment to Jeong is because she is a daughter of a powerful person.““President Choi Kyung-hee should take responsibility for her failed communication, undemocratic operation of the school and involvement in corruption,” she added.An anonymous student, who said they took the same class as Jeong during the last semester, put up a poster on one of the school buildings’ wall on Sunday, calling for an apology from her professor.“I had so many sleepless nights doing my coursework during the last semester,” said the student. “How come Jeong can take home a ‘B’ when she did not turn up for a lecture even once?”“Why do students who stay up all night, complete coursework and attend every class earn a lower grade than Jeong did?”Post-it memos were plastered on the wall after the poster was taken down. Some of the memos read, “If you have any conscience left as a professor, please stop this” and “I will also ride a horse. Give me credit.”Some professors claimed they were instructed to select Jeong, who belongs the nation’s dressage team, despite her inadequate qualifications. The school allegedly changed its school policy starting in 2015 to expand admissions for student athletes in wider categories including horse-riding, which students claim targets Jeong. It is also suspected considering the gold medal she earned at the 2014 Asian games past the application deadline. An association of professors from the school vowed to stage a rally Wednesday afternoon to demand Choi step down over the allegations. In her defense, Choi stated that there was no “preferential treatment” for the 19-year-old student. “One thing I can say for sure is that there was no preferential treatment. I will candidly clarify all the suspicions brought up by the media,” she told reporters ahead of the closed-door meeting with Ewha students and faculty members in the afternoon. Opposition lawmaker Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party called Jeong the most powerful person in Korea in the party’s emergency meeting at the parliament. “For her, Ewha Womans University changed its school policy and gave her grades despite her absence. These things that do not make sense take place only for her,” he said, urging a prosecutorial probe into the case. “Choi Soon-sil and Jeong Yoo-ra are shaking the top education institute for women and insulting its students as well as the public.” Jeong took a leave of absence from the school last month amid growing allegations. The mounting controversy appears to continue to deal a blow to President Park, who has been embroiled in a series of corruption scandals involving her close confidants since her inauguration in 2013. Jeong‘s mother Choi is suspected to be a political bigwig pulling strings behind the scene. Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, the late pastor who is said to have served as a mentor for President Park. Choi has been thrown into spotlight after opposition lawmakers accused her of being deeply involved in managing the Mir and K-Sports Foundations. The foundations allegedly raised large sums of donations from the nation’s major conglomerates thanks to Choi’s influence-peddling.

283,283, Former foreign minister thrust into spotlight over controversial memoir,"While lawmakers continue their political tit-for-tat over bribery scandals involving President Park Geun-hye’s close associates, an unlikely figure has shifted political talk in a completely new direction.

Former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon, in his memoir released last week, said that presidential aides and cabinet members serving at the previous, liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration had inquired of North Korea about whether Seoul should vote to adopt a 2007 UN resolution condemning Pyeongyang’s human rights situation.In the book titled “Moving the Glacier,” the 68-year-old retired diplomat, known for his assertive stance against the reclusive regime’s dismal human right condition, claimed that his objection to the inquiry was shot down by others including former Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in, who then served as presidential chief of staff.  Former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon is flanked by reporters as he arrives at his office in Seoul on Monday. “I insisted that we should approve the vote for longer term; It was quite obvious what sort of answer we would get if we asked North Korea ,” he wrote. “After a long debate, we concluded that we should ask. I can’t argue anymore.”After hearing a negative response from the North, Song said, the Roh administration decided to withdraw the vote that the government had approved a year earlier. Song described the incident as one of the moments he “felt ashamed of” his 33-year-old career. The eight-page description, an excerpt from the 550-page book, put Song, who now works as a president of the University of North Korean Studies, into the national spotlight as his former colleagues disputed his claim and political parties subjected his book to partisan conflict. Those who attended the meeting with Song asserted that the memoir contains information based on an “inaccurate memory,” reflecting a “biased view” from a former minister who tends to adopt a more assertive tone against Pyongyang by working in tandem with the international community and the United States. “I don’t think Song’s book is accurate because memoirs are often self-centered,” a former Minister of Unification Lee Jae-jung said in a media interview Monday. The former minister noted that he agreed on the abstention and clashed with Song throughout the decision-making process. The minister, one of the staunchest advocates of the Roh administration’s rapprochement policy toward the North, argued that their decision to contact North Korea was not to “inquire” about Pyeongyang’s position, but to “notify” of Seoul’s decision adopted by the majority of the presidential aides and Cabinet members.Kim Man-bok, a former director of the National Intelligence Service, also disputed Song’s claim that the former chief was the first one to propose the idea of asking the North. He denounced the minister for leaking classified information and vowed to testify before the lawmakers to prove himself. Describing the mounting controversy over his book as “unhelpful” to building effective policies toward North Korea and its nuclear threat, Song maintained that his memoir contains the truth and urged the people to see the book in a boarder context. “Pulling just one piece of the book dealing with two Korea’s unification and North Korea’s nuclear weapon does not do any justice to anyone,” Song told reporters in the afternoon. “My book is based on records, not memories.” The minister went on to defend the accusation that his book, published just a year away from the 2017 presidential election, has a political motive targeting the opposition parties’ front-runner Moon Jae-in while promoting politicians close to him such as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Rep. Park Bum-kye of the Minjoo Party claimed Monday that Song devoted hefty portions of his book to praising the tenure of Ban, who served as foreign minister between 2004 and 2006 before Song took over his job. “I began writing the book three years ago and tried to publish it last year to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 19 Joint Statement,” he said, referring to the landmark 2005 agreement calling for verifiable denuclearization of the North. “But it took a year more than I thought,” Song said.

Mir and K-Sports, established less than a year ago under the auspices of FKI, raised a combined 75 billion won  from major conglomerates, including Samsung, Hyundai and LG. The unprecedented amount and speed of the fundraising led to speculation that contributors faced certain pressure.While opposition lawmakers blasted key witnesses on the launching process of the two foundations, the ruling party mostly defended the FKI’s role as representative arbitrator between the government and the industrial circles.It was Rep. Park Young-sun of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea who spearheaded the inquiry, pushing Lee to clarify his alleged connection to Cheong Wa Dae.“Where did you get the idea  and how do you talk to Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum?” Park asked during the session.The lawmaker also raised suspicion that conglomerates would not have contributed such a large sum if not without political pressure, thus alluding to the involvement of higher powers.The FKI official avoided detailed answers, instead simply offering an “apology” on behalf of the federation.“Regardless of what happened,  apologize to the people for causing trouble,” Lee said.But when asked for more details, he repeatedly claimed to be “unable to answer” as the issue is currently under prosecutorial investigation.This immediately provoked protests from opposition lawmakers who pointed out that witnesses on parliamentary floors are obliged to answer.In a clear contrast, Rep. Park Myung-jae of the ruling Saenuri Party claimed the FKI’s role as fundraising mediator was legitimate and the two disputed foundations have been free from political clout.“The FKI is practically the only organization which may coordinate and represent the industrial circles in major agendas and for this reason has always been subject to criticism from the opposition,” the Saenuri lawmaker said.Meanwhile, the federation faced a growing pressure to disband, with some of its significant members gesturing at defection.Of them is Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, funded by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, which on Wednesday announced its withdrawal from the FKI, citing the recent controversies.CEOs of key state-run banks -- Korea Development Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea and Export-Import Bank of Korea -- also said earlier this week they are considering doing likewise.“The disbandment is entirely for the FKI to decide,” said Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Yoo Il-ho during the committee’s audit.“Even when it comes to public organizations, the government is not entitled to force them to defect.”Rep. Lee Un-jo of the Minjoo Party that the opposition would unite in submitting a resolution within this week to demand for the voluntary dissolution of the FKI, which she described as a “channel for back-scratching” between the government and the industrial world.The FKI was established in 1961, supposedly to foster a cozy relationship between big businesses and former President Park Chung-hee, who sought to lift the country out of poverty by supporting big businesses.

Their common stance is that the current basic law fails to properly reflect social and political changes since 1987, when it was last revised.Adding to the pressure were the Saenuri’s leadership figures, including the party’s Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who is deemed one of the closest confidants to the president.“It is not time to legislate a lasting Constitution which is led by the people and which reflects the people’s opinion,” Lee said in a parliamentary representative speech last month.His speech, though it did not elaborate further on the details of the revision, drew political circles’ attention as it came despite the president’s apparent reluctance toward the given agenda.Backing the party’s chairman, floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk also alluded that the ruling camp may establish a special task force to lead the constitutional revision, once the ongoing state audit ends later this month. Meanwhile, constitutional law professor-turned-lawmaker Rep. Chong Jong-sup recently canceled an impending seminar on the revision, boosting conjectures that the presidential house has already exerted pressure upon the party.By Bae Hyun-jung","rising talks on constitutional ,may raise political tension ,house dampens rising talks ,an impending constitutional revision ,monday suppressed rising speculations","['Cheong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47214997 -0.05266802

Chung Jin-suk said. “The one who would be most delighted by the news that we suspend the THAAD deployment is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Moon should have more sense of responsibility on security issues.” Moon on Sunday urged President Park Geun-hye to temporarily halt procedures for the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system here and divert her efforts toward renewing diplomacy that could help persuade Pyeongyang to abandon its nuclear ambition. “The government has made abundantly clear that it will not accept the North’s nuclear ambition by deciding to deploy the THAAD and selecting where the weapons will be installed,” the liberal politician wrote on his Facebook account. “I don’t think a temporary delay would cause a major disruption of the plan.”The remark appeared to signal a change in Moon’s tone toward the contentious issue, observers said. The politician, who had previously called for an “outright withdrawal” of the THAAD deployment, said that he understands that it is difficult for the Korean government to backtrack on the bilateral agreement made in July with the US to install its advanced missile system.  Moon Jae-in, potential presidential canditate from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Instead, Moon stepped up his demand for the government to seek parliamentary approval on deploying THAAD, arguing the move would incur financial burdens on taxpayers and thus constitutes an international treaty that must be approved by the legislative body. Under South Korea’s Constitution Article 60, the National Assembly has the right “to consent to the conclusion and ratification of treaties pertaining to mutual assistance or mutual security, and treaties which would incur grave financial burden on the state or people.” Moon claimed the deployment would cost more than previously thought because the government has to purchase private property for it. The Defense Ministry announced in September it would deploy THAAD batteries at a location on a golf course owned by Lotte Group. Saenuri’s Chung, however, rebuked Moon’s argument that the THAAD deployment is subject to parliamentary approval, echoing the government’s assertion the decision to introduce the weapon system does not constitute treaties but an “implementation arrangement” under the Korea-US Mutual Defense Treaty and Status of Forces Agreement.By Yeo Jun-suk","party on monday assailed ,presidential hopeful like moon ,south korea disappointed at ,controversial us led missile ,harsh criticism the ruling","['Saenuri Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Moon', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50876737  0.28493112

Should the victim suffer an injury that takes 12 weeks or more to recover from, a minimum term of 10 years is to be demanded.Additional penalties will be called upon those who assaulted the physically vulnerable, such as women, children, the disabled and the elderly, or upon those with previous criminal convictions, according to officials.According to National Police Agency data, phone fraud has been on a steady rise since 2007, standing at 7,239 cases as of the end of last year. The number of accomplices and the amount of damages, too, has been increasing over the same period.“The given crimes, inflicting tangible damages to the safety and assets of the people, require systematic and severe punishment,” said an official of the SPO.By Bae Hyun-jung","phishing and robbery culprits ,prosecutors monday the supreme ,stronger penalty intensified sanctions ,robbery culprits to face ,injuries according to prosecutors",['the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22683206  0.42157841

In the process, he reportedly told Keangnam that he could use the influence of his uncle to directly contact the Qatari king.In March 2015, the debt-ridden firm went into receivership, and its chairman Sung Wan-jong committed suicide a month later amid allegations of embezzlement.Ban Joo-hyun has yet to respond to the sentence, which was delivered in his absence.","lobbying scandal last year ,590 000 over fraud ,major lobbying scandal last ,damages to south korean ,scandal last year sources","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean', 'the Seoul Northern District Court', 'Ban Joo - hyun', 'Ban', 'Ban Ki - sang', 'qatari']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35644883  0.19032919

Saenuri and the presidential office have argued the dismissal motion was politically motivated and had nothing to do with actual wrongdoing.The Saenuri, in addition, claimed the vote itself did not follow parliamentary rules, although Chung argued all due procedures were respected.The two side's relationship further deteriorated when a voice recording obtained by the ruling party showed Chung saying that the Saenuri should not ""ask for something for free,"" indicating the speaker may have wanted to utilize the dismissal motion to force concessions on other issues that are important to the opposition. Chung is originally from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea but left the party in accordance with the South Korean law that the speaker cannot belong to a party.Observers said the ruling and opposition bloc may seek to reach a compromise by reviewing the so-called ""Chung Sye-kyung prevention law,"" proposed by Saenuri's party whip, which calls for clearly stipulating the political neutrality of the parliamentary speaker.Existing law only stipulates that the National Assembly speaker ""cannot be a member of a party from the second day of designation during the term."" Thus, the proposed bill is set to make the political neutrality not a moral value, but a legal responsibility of the speaker.""While the majority of lawmakers in Saenuri are opposed to making concessions, we are looking into other ways as Chung is unwilling to budge,"" said Rep. Cho Won-jin of Saenuri, who heads an emergency committee on the issue.Pundits added although Chung is clashing with the ruling party, the Saenuri is also currently feeling the heat, as its boycott of the parliamentary audit can cost it public support.Others said that with the speaker showing no signs of resignation, Saenuri does not have the seats to oust Chung from his post, requiring the party to make compromises.Accordingly, some Saenuri members have said opting for a new parliamentary law will be more beneficial for the party because it can save face while sending a message to the general public that Chung's actions need to be checked to ensure smooth running of the National Assembly.","parliamentary speaker amid deadlock ,political pundits said sunday ,lawmakers eye new law ,impatient over prolonged discord ,resolve the latest deadlock","['the National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59044325  0.55389184

Kim is a member of the parliament's national defense committee. ""A malicious code has been identified and it seems to have taken advantage of the vulnerability of the routing server,"" he said. ""In a cautious measure, the server has been separated from the network.""The server is tasked with security on computers that military has for Internet-connection purpose. Around 20,000 military computers are known to have been connected to the server.Kim said that chances are ""very low"" that the latest hacking led to a leak of confidential information given that the military's intranet is not connected to the server. An investigation is underway to figure out where the hacking originated. He said that it has yet to be confirmed whether the North was involved but noted that military authorities are leaving that possibility on the table.The defense ministry later confirmed that the hacking of the cyber command, saying that it is working on figuring out how the malicious code got into the system. Despite the incident, it said that the military Internet system remains up and running.","hacked last month lawmaker ,latest cyber attack rep ,command hacked last month ,the latest cyber attack ,latest cyber attack","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'Kim Jin - pyo', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50365978  0.19732335

Prosecutors accused the suspect of receiving some 50 million won  from his high school friend, identified only by his surname Kim, in return for lobbying local prosecutors who were investigating the businessman on fraud and embezzlement charges. The prosecutor Kim is also suspected of abetting his friend in the destruction of key evidence when the investigation into the two of them was launched.Senior prosecutor Kim Hyung-joon sits in a car at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office on Sept. 29,as he is transferred to a detention house after prosecutors arrested him on charges of bribery. The allegations came to the surface when the businessman Kim disclosed their connection to the local media after a Seoul court sought a warrant to formally arrest him late last month. He was arrested after attempting to flee.

A corruption scandal flared up last year after Sung left a note and a recorded interview claiming that he gave money to eight politicians, including Lee and Hong, as well as President Park Geun-hye's former and then chiefs of staff.Prosecutors indicted Lee and Hong, while not prosecuting the others, citing a lack of evidence and the statute of limitations.Lee stepped down as the country's prime minister after the suspicions mounted.A lower court had sentenced Lee to eight months in jail, suspended for two years, acknowledging the recorded interview as credible evidence.The high court, however, said it lacks credibility as it was made right before Sung committed suicide, harboring anger towards the former prime minister. Sung hanged himself on April 9 just hours before a court hearing that would have determined the legality of his arrest regarding embezzlement charges.In regards to Hong's case, there was a testimony made by Sung's aide, who delivered the money, which backed up the allegations in addition to the recorded interview. A district court has said the testimony was credible enough as the aide testified consistently from the start of the investigation to the court hearing.""I am very sorry for causing concerns to the public,"" Lee told reporters after the ruling was delivered. ""But, prosecutors should refrain from excessive execution of their authority.""Prosecutors said they will review whether to appeal the ruling after analyzing it.","tuesday overturned jail term ,ex pm over bribery ,on tuesday overturned jail ,court on tuesday overturned ,tuesday overturned jail","['Lee Wan - koo', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Lee', 'Sung Wan - jong']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1408079   0.0222506

Lee Jung-hyun prepares to deliver a speech at a morning meeting arranged by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Monday in Seoul. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea has proposed raising corporate taxes, which were reduced in the previous administration, claiming the system increases by allowing wealthy business owners to fill their coffers instead of pushing them to invest and hire more.It has introduced a revision to the Corporate Tax Act to raise the richest companies’ corporate tax rate from 22 percent to 25 percent. It would apply to companies with annual earnings of at least 50 billion won.Under the current code, 10 percent is levied on companies with income of less than 200 million won, 20 percent on those earning up to 20 billion won and 22 percent earning more than 20 billion won.The revision would affect some 417 companies, or 0.14 percent of corporate tax targets, through which the Minjoo Party contends would lead to an additional 4.1 trillion won in tax revenue per year.The main opposition with 121 seats in the 300-member National Assembly have also claimed that the government was implementing expansionary fiscal policy while cutting taxes, which it said led to the rise in the national debt by some 40 trillion won annually. The third-largest People’s Party with 38 seats has also expressed agreement with the Minjoo Party.The ruling Saenuri Party and the critics have argued that an increase in corporate taxes could drive local first to relocate overseas and distract foreign investment. Some critics have also claimed that a hike in corporate taxes will eventually hurt the employees, shareholders, investors and consumers that could lead to a cut in wages and reduction in household income. They also cite the trend in other economies such as the US, Japan and Singapore that have been lowering their corporate taxes to attract investment and create jobs.Lee, meanwhile, said that the corporate tax rate was cut even during the progressive governments.“They claim that a 3  hike would lead to extra 3 to 4.1 trillion won, but it is said that the National Tax Service has already collected 16 trillion won through system overhaul.”","prevent corporate tax hike ,sternly opposes corporate tax ,corporate tax hike ruling ,vows to prevent corporate ,opposes corporate tax","['Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party']",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.13508321 0.02471313 0.42906526],Korea Herald,Politics,9,2016,"sternly opposes corporate tax he ,on monday promised business representatives ,and sternly opposes corporate tax ,sternly opposes corporate tax ,has proposed raising corporate taxes","['Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'Lee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'Seoul', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party', 'National Assembly', 'People ’s Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'US', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'Lee', 'the National Tax Service']",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.13508321 0.02471313 0.42906526]

According to data from the Korea Internet and Security Agency submitted Friday to Mun Mi-ock of the opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, Koreans reported up to 18 million unwanted calls and messages to the agency this year, as of the end of August 2016, the agency said. In 2013, the figure was nearly 33 million, but fell to 22 million in 2014 and 14 million in 2015, the data showed.However, the number of reported telemarketing calls has spiked, with 10 million cases this year, close to the total for last year and 14 times more than the 880,000 cases reported in 2013. On the other hand, advertisements through email and text messages, dropped drastically, with 5 million reported this year, down from 21 million in 2013. The new anti-spam legislation in 2014 seems to have contributed to the phenomenon. The amendment to the Information Communications Network Act allows the distribution of commercial marketing only if agreed upon by online users, strengthening controls on commercial text messages and emails. But businesses and telemarketers make unwanted calls a lot more often as an alternative, according to people with knowledge of the mobile communication industry. Marketers often use robocalls -- automated telephone calls that deliver a recorded message -- and as a result they are able to avoid penalties, an official of the Korea Internet and Security Agency said. “When people answer prerecorded or live telemarketing calls, they get frustrated and hang up,” the official said. “But one must submit a record file when reporting to the authority.

Hwang Ki-chul, who served as the chief of naval operations from 2013 to 2015, not guilty of pressuring his subordinates to forge a document in 2009 to help a firm win the contract. Prosecutors suspected that he made them manipulate a quality assurance document for a sonar system built by the parts supplier for the country's first domestically built rescue and salvage ship. The supplier was introduced by a friend of then chief of Navy Chung Ok-geun, according to prosecutors.Hwang, who was in charge of the nation's project to build the Tongyeong at the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, was suspected to have played a role in underhand dealings in order to get promoted. The top court, however, said there is a lack of evidence proving that Hwang forged the document to give favors to the company, adding his alleged motive is unclear. In August, a district court also acquitted Chung of allegations he orchestrated the scheme, citing a lack of evidence. The 3,500-ton Tongyeong was found to be fraught with problems and failed to participate in rescue operations in a ferry tragedy in April 2014 that killed more than 300 people.","navy chief over corruption ,friday upheld the acquittal ,chief over corruption charges ,acquittal of former navy ,acquittal of ex navy","['Navy', 'the Supreme Court', 'Hwang Ki - chul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18021223  0.27199355

Gyeongju is set to be granted emergency relief and the financial support needed to restore the area. Its residents will receive tax benefits and cuts in utility bills, as well as counselling services to help them overcome post-traumatic stress disorder. Members of a civic environmental group hold a press conference condemning the government’s countermeasures against earthquakes and calling for the suspension of the country’s nuclear power plants in front of the Sejong Center for Performing Arts in downtown Seoul on Thursday. Relevant ministries and municipality estimated that the damage in the city could be worth more than 7.5 billion won  after an on-site investigation. Gyeongju, which is some 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul, was struck by a 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Sept. 12. It was the strongest ever recorded by the Korea Meteorological Administration in the Korean Peninsula. A city is declared as a special disaster zone upon approval from the president when its public facilities are damaged due to large-scale natural disasters or accidents, and when municipalities are in need of financial support from the central government. Gyeongju has already received 2.4 billion won from the Public Safety Ministry and 2 billion won from the Interior Ministry, respectively, in special subsidy taxes to restore damaged facilitiesAftershocks will continue to take place in the Korean Peninsula in the months to come, but there should be no more quakes stronger than 5.8 magnitude, the nation’s weather agency said. A 3.5 magnitude earthquake struck the city on Wednesday morning, two days after a magnitude 4.5 quake shook the nation Monday night. Among a total of 423 aftershocks recorded as of Thursday afternoon, most were assessed to be weaker than magnitude 3. Only two aftershocks recorded a magnitude of between 4 and 5, while 15 tremors have ranged from 3 to 4.The Korea Meteorological Administration said that it has decided to install more than 100 additional seismic monitors nationwide to detect earthquakes within seven seconds of the disaster striking the county.“It is very unlikely that a quake stronger than magnitude 6.5 will hit the nation again,” said Koh Yoon-hwa, the chief of the KMA, at a news briefing held to inform the public of the interim results of an analysis on the nation’s natural disaster warning system and what could have caused the series of earthquakes. “It is possible to see aftershocks within the range of magnitude 3 to 4,” the KMA said. “It is difficult to predict when aftershocks will end and it is likely for them to last in the weeks and months to come.” The KMA added that the epicenter of the foreshock in Gyeongju was 700 to 800 meters away from that of the main quake. “We found out that foreshocks, major quakes and aftershocks were seen as moving in the southwestern direction,” the agency said. Nearly 90 percent of the aftershocks, including the powerful ones with a magnitude of 4 and over, took place within 2.5 kilometers from where the major 5.8 magnitude quake occurred, the KMA said. Almost 70 percent of the aftershocks took place within two days after the quake rattled the country, with the quakes hitting a depth of 15.2 kilometers on average. “Currently, it takes 50 seconds to detect earthquakes stronger than magnitude 5 and notify relevant agencies and areas of the tremors, but we will reduce it to seven to 25 seconds,” said the KMA. “In order to do so, we will increase the number of seismic monitoring facilities from the current 206 to 314 by 2018.”“Starting in November, the KMA will directly notify the public of the occurrence of natural disasters in association with the Cell Broadcasting System,” the agency said. “We believe we can measure the seismic activity within 10 seconds and notify the public within two minutes through text messages by 2017.”The current system of sending alert messages to the public has been criticized for failing to inform them in time. The weather agency sends mobile alert messages in times of natural disasters after going through the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. When the 3.5 magnitude aftershock jolted the country Wednesday, warning messages were sent to the public some 10 minutes after residents felt the shaking. On Monday night, the website of the Public Safety Ministry as well as the weather agency, which provide information on how to evacuate in case of quakes, also crashed due to heavy traffic. The KMA also said that a team of eight relevant officials will be dispatched to Gyeongju to conduct an on-site investigation for six months from Sept. 20 to investigate the causes and impact of the series of quakes. In response to the latest earthquakes, President Park Geun-hye ordered a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s national quake response system at a meeting with top aides at the presidential office on Thursday. “It has been confirmed that the country had several problems in the process of responding to quakes because we have perceived our country as safe from such natural disasters,” she said.“As it is possible that aftershocks  continue to take place, relevant ministries and officials should maintain readiness to more promptly and accurately promote public safety,” she said.  Relevant ministries and state-run agencies are scrambling to assess, prevent and minimize the damage caused by quakes. According to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, it will revise relevant acts so that the special subsidy taxes of the Interior Ministry, the Education Ministry and the Public Safety Ministry can be used to reinforce public facilities to make them more earthquake-resistant. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced Thursday that it will inspect all major social infrastructure including bridges, tunnels and airports in the quake-stricken southeastern region. Currently, 91.5 percent of major public facilities are designed to withstand quakes in the country, the ministry said. A team of more than 420 officials from relevant state-run agencies will be put on the field to check the safety of some 5,300 public facilities in the region by the end of this year. It also aims to make express trains, expressways and bridges earthquake-resistant by 2018, ordinary trains by 2019 and intake towers by 2020. The ministry announced plans Wednesday to revise construction codes to require all new structures that are two stories or above in height to be earthquake-proof. The Korea Electric Power Corp. will also raise the level of safety of electric facilities in nuclear reactors and substations by enhancing their ability to endure quakes. By Ock Hyun-ju","designated quake stricken gyeongju ,designates quake hit gyeongju ,quake stricken gyeongju north ,govt designates quake hit ,quake hit gyeongju as","['Gyeongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3600719   0.77677459

On her left are An Chong-bum and Woo Byung-woo. The former is suspected of leading some dubious fundraising while the latter is suspected to be connected to a high-profile corruption scandal. YonhapHer remarks was taken as a counterattack against the opposition camp’s burgeoning aggression that the president allegedly raised illegitimate funds through the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation via a close associate. Lawmakers of The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party suggested that An was the invisible hand in the process, with some alluding that he was acting as proxy for the president herself.As for an exclusive report by Hankyoreh, which claimed that An played a key role in the recent conflict between the Blue House and special inspector Lee Seok-su, the presidential office flatly denied this. “ does not have access to the details of the special inspector’s probe,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters.The reason that inspector Lee stood at odds with the presidential office and ended up resigning from his post, according to the daily, was because he touched upon An’s alleged connection to the disputed fund-raising of the two foundations.The newspaper also quoted an anonymous member of Lee’s probe team, who claimed that these two conglomerate-funded foundations were a vulnerable point for Park and her close aides.The source was quoted as saying that when Cheong Wa Dae accused Lee of disrupting national order upon Lee’s alleged information leak to the press, the presidential office was responding not just in regard to Woo’s case, but potentially trying to keep the target from moving onto An.“ seems to have been perplexed that the two ‘inviolable’ foundations should become the target of probe.”The two organizations rose to the center of political debate this week, following the opposition parties’ argument that they raised massive funds from conglomerates by pulling strings in the government through a close associate of Park.The two foundations reportedly not only received the government’s approval for establishment within a single day, but also raised 48.6 billion won  and 28.8 billion won in funds, respectively, from leading conglomerates.Meanwhile, former Deputy Prime Minister and the ruling Saenuri Party senior lawmaker Choi Kyung-hwan also came under fire for allegedly exerting pressure on the hiring process of a state-run corporation.Park Cheol-gyu, the former director of the Small Business Corp. who is currently in trial for business obstruction charges, claimed that he had received direct orders last year from Choi to hire a person who used to work as an intern in Choi’s office.The lawmaker, who is also a central figure in the party’s pro-presidential clique, has so far refrained from offering a statement on the issue.By Bae Hyun-jung","dubious political fundraising slandering ,political fundraising slandering remarks ,top aide illicit fundraising ,profile corruption charges involving ,political fundraising slandering","['Park Geun - hye', 'an Chong - bum']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16929244  0.00730477

Cho Eung-cheon, a former presidential secretary for civil service who turned his back on Cheong Wa Dae in 2015 after leaking internal documents about a presidential aide.The lawmaker’s claim is that Choi Sun-sil -- the daughter of a deceased mentor to the president and wife of Park’s closest aide Jeong Yun-hoe -- intervened in the Blue House’s personnel appointments and exerted influence to rake in funds for the two foundations, with which she allegedly held close ties.“Choi was the person who ordered the 3.4 million won  hanbok that President Park wore at her inauguration ceremony and delivered the clothes to Park in person,” Rep. Cho said.“She has also been running personal errands for the president, procuring jewelry and other accessories from Cheongdam-dong .”He added that Choi even exercised leverage in having Woo Byung-woo appointed as senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. Calls have been mounting from opposition circles since July to dismiss Woo over a number of irregularity allegations, including his monetary ties with high-profile corruption figures.President Park Geun-hye The presidential office flatly denied all charges.“There is no need to mention the given allegations as they are not true,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters Tuesday.Senior presidential secretary for policy coordination An Chong-bum, who was also accused of abusing his power to secure funding for the foundations, similarly denied connection to the issue.Reacting to Cheong Wa Dae’s response, opposition parties called for a special investigation into the case.“The establishment and funding process of these two foundations are leading down to a high-profile corruption, possibly involving top presidential aides,” said the Minjoo Party’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho at a party meeting.He pointed out that the two organizations won government approval for their establishment in a single day and collected over 80 billion won as “voluntary donations” from conglomerates.Achieving the process in such a short time would be close to impossible, if not for the foundations’ special connection to government influence, according to Woo.Rep. Park Jie-won, floor leader and interim chief of the People’s Party, pledged to kick off a state investigation or independent counsel to look into corruption charges surrounding the state leader.Rep. Roh Hoe-chan, floor leader of the progressive minority Justice Party, even claimed that President Park was using the two foundations to collect secret funds for her retirement, citing a similar case involving former President Chun Doo-hwan.To take their argument further, opposition members of the parliamentary committee for education, culture, sports and tourism prepared to summon key figures from Cheong Wa Dae and the two foundations for the forthcoming state audit.The list includes senior presidential secretary An, Mir Foundation chairman Kim Hyung-soo, K-Sports Foundation chairman Jeong Dong-chun and a number of senior conglomerate officials.Members of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, however, have said that the opposition is exaggerating the allegations for political aims and that its charges may discourage future donations by financial circles.By Bae Hyun-jung","months with corruption scandal ,scandal involving top presidential ,presidential aide denied wednesday ,for months with corruption ,scandal involving park confidant","['Park Geun', 'the Blue House ’s']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.26196086  0.32769218

Of them, 13 were executive officials of major conglomerates or top government officials in the financial sector.On the list were former head of the state-run Korea Development Bank Hong Ky-ttack and incumbent CEO of the nation’s stock operator Korea Exchange Choi Kyung-soo. Chaebol figures included Korea Securities Finance Corp. CEO Jung Ji-won, Hyosung Vice Chairman Lee Sang-woon, Samsung Life Insurance Vice President Kim Nam-soo and others.Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yongOpposition circles -- The Minjoo Party of Korea and runner-up People’s Party combined -- also tapped Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo as key witnesses. The suggestion, however, has been opposed by the ruling Saenuri Party.The opposition claims the Samsung heir’s presence is essential in order to clarify whether or not he expanded his corporate governance by having Samsung Foundation purchase stocks of the group’s effective holding company Samsung C&T.;“Such stock purchases are much alike the process in which group Chairman Lee Kun-hee succeeded corporate power from his father Lee Byung-chull in the past,” said Rep. Park Yong-jin, a Minjoo Party member of the National Policy Committee, calling for elucidation.The conservative Saenuri Party, on the other hand, is raising its guard against the opposition’s aggressive witness calls, citing ineffective past practices in which an excessive number of witnesses were summoned during the audit period.“Having business leaders as audit witnesses and disgracing them with no practical reason will only deteriorate the credibility of their company and also of the nation,” the party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said Tuesday, urging more precautions in summoning corporate figures.Party chief policymaker Rep. Kim Gwang-lim pointed out that some 40 percent of the witnesses in the restructuring hearing earlier this month did not receive a single question throughout the hours-long process.“The parliamentary audit is not an inspection of private firms and thus should not turn into a show-off,” Rep. Kim said.Aware of public resentment against parliamentary inefficiency, the opposition also consented to the need to downscale the range of witnesses.“ lawmakers formed a consensus that the selection of witnesses should be kept to the minimum,” said the Minjoo Party‘s Vice Floor Leader Rep.

Daewoo Shipbuilding provided some 4.4 billion won  for the firm's research projects between 2012 and 2013, but the funding stopped following Kang's retirement, according to prosecutors. The KDB is the financially troubled shipbuilder's largest shareholder. Kang headed the bank from 2011 to 2013. While admitting to having advised the shipyard to invest in the company, identified only by the initial B, he has declined any wrongdoing involved in the process. ""I have worked for this country my whole life,"" Kang told reporters before entering the prosecutors' office. ""I didn't do anything shameful while working as a public official.""Kang Man-soo, former chief of the Korea Development Bank, is surrounded by reporters before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul to be questioned over a high-profile corruption case involving a local shipbuilder on Sept. 19. The summons comes less than a week after prosecutors indicted the biotech firm's head, identified only by his surname Kim, on charges of fraud and other irregularities.Prosecutors also suspect that the 71-year-old Kang was involved in unlawfully giving loans to Hansung Enterprise Co., a local seafood maker, in 2011. The company chief, Lim Woo-kun, went to the same high school as Kang. Kang served as the country's finance minister from 2008 to 2009 before working as the special adviser to the president for the economy during the Lee Myung-bak administration from 2009 to 2011.His alleged irregularities came to the surface after prosecutors launched a full-fledged probe into the shipyard earlier this year. A number of company executives have been indicted over their involvement in the corporate corruption scheme thus far. The shipbuilding industry, once regarded as the backbone of the country's economic growth and job creation, has been reeling from mounting losses caused by an industrywide slump and increased costs.The country's top three shipyards, including Daewoo Shipbuilding, suffered a combined operating loss of 8.5 trillion won last year due largely to increased costs stemming from a delay in the construction of offshore facilities and the industrywide slump, with Daewoo alone posting a 5.5 trillion won loss.The shipbuilders have recently drawn up sweeping self-rescue programs worth 10.35 trillion won in a desperate bid to overcome the protracted slump and mounting losses.","kdb summoned over corruption ,summoned over corruption allegations ,monday as state prosecutors ,corruption allegations former head ,over corruption allegations","['the Korea Development Bank', 'Kang Man - soo', 'Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.', 'dae']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23028082  0.0193714

Kim Seang-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party, the Korea Communications Standards Commissions did not take any disciplinary action regarding gender-related slurs by commentators during live broadcasts of the recent Olympic Games.The organization is a broadcast and internet censorship body responsible for ensuring fair and clean broadcast content here. YonhapIn August, main broadcasters SBS and KBS were hit by heavy criticism as their commentators were seen making slews of controversial remarks.During the women’s 48-kilogram judo match, SBS commentator Kim Jeong-il remarked, “She competes roughly despite her tender-looking skin,” referring to the world’s top judo competitor Urantsetseg Munhbat from Mongolia.KBS commentator Han Sang-hon also came under fire after he said of beach volleyball players, “Beauties are for the beach, bikinis are for the sea.” He also said, “The beach is somewhere where you  must definitely go with girls. If you go there only with other men, what else would you do except eat some barbecue?”KBS commentator Choi Seung-don described Korean female epee fencer Choi In-jeong as “an athlete with such good looks that she can even participate in a beauty pageant, along with her skills in fencing as well as piano.” Such slurs led to hordes of people criticizing the broadcast commentators and demanding the watchdog take disciplinary measures.“What does a competitor’s sports ability have to do with gender or good looks? I also felt sexually harassed when I heard commentator’s remarks as a female viewer,” said a 27-year-old woman surnamed Kim, who watched the beach volleyball event.However, despite the series of inappropriate remarks aired during the live Olympic Games broadcasts, the KCSC on Aug. 31 only reviewed two cases and did not take any disciplinary action or give warnings to any of the commentators in question. It said it found “no errors in their remarks.”Rep. Kim said that inappropriate remarks broadcast during the Olympic matches led to viewers’ discomfort, calling for the KCSC to step up efforts in monitoring and controlling remarks made during broadcasts.“Many TV viewers here felt discomfort due to commentators’ irrelevant remarks, the KCSC should come up with decisions to strengthen monitoring and give warnings to broadcasters to meet nationwide social consensus,” remarked Kim.By Kim Da-sol","olympic commentators sexual remarks ,olympic commentators sexual ,olympic commentators ,sexual remarks ruled unproblematic ,discrimination lawmaker said monday","['Kim Seang - tae', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Korea Communications Standards Commissions']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63974011  0.52181268

In that vein, his remarks helped ease Seoul's concerns that Moscow's opposition to THAAD would weaken its will to pressure Pyongyang into renouncing its nuclear ambitions.""Putin did not publicly raise the THAAD issue after the summit, which signals that Moscow may not take serious issue with THAAD in the future,"" said Park from Handong Global University.The scholar also noted that during her summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Park created fresh momentum to narrow differences with Beijing over THAAD by proposing a trilateral dialogue involving Seoul, Washington and Beijing. The Park-Xi summit was held on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in the eastern Chinese city on Monday.""Park moved to bring China into the three-way dialogue platform to discuss the THAAD issue, which I think will offer much-needed momentum to bridge gaps over the security issue,"" the professor said.Park’s argument that the need for THAAD will “naturally” dissipate once Pyongyang’s escalating nuclear and missile threats are eliminated also helped China to understand the deployment plan, analysts said.During the summit, Xi renewed his opposition to THAAD, but reaffirmed Beijing's ""firm"" stance in favor of the peninsula’s denuclearization and peace and stability in the region, Kim Kyou-hyu, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs, said.Above all, the greatest outcome of Park's summit diplomacy was a stern, unmistakable message against Pyongyang's unceasing provocations that she helped elicit from the leaders of the four major powers, observers said.During the trip, Park opened a barrage of warnings against Pyongyang, stressing that the continuation of reckless provocations will lead the reclusive state down the ""path of self-destruction.""Following his summit with Park on Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama warned that the North's provocations will only invite more pressure and further deepen its isolation. He also stressed that Washington's commitment to the defense of the South is ""unwavering.""Obama, in addition, emphasized Washington's pledge to provide extended deterrence to South Korea in an apparent move to allay mounting security concerns among South Koreans over the North's growing military threats.What is likely to be the last meeting between Park and Obama took place on the sidelines of multiple summits with the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  in Vientiane. Obama will leave office in January next year.Wednesday's summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe capped Park's diplomacy with the major powers. At the summit, Abe called Pyongyang's missile provocations ""indescribable violence"" and agreed to strengthen trilateral security cooperation with South Korea and the U.S.Park's trip, however, fell short of finding a ""fundamental"" solution to the prolonged standoff, Park from Handong Global University said.""Before her trip began, there were hopes that she could find some sort of breakthrough in the nuclear stalemate with Pyongyang,"" the professor said.

Choo Mi-ae said that her decision to visit the disputed former president was “inappropriate,” highlighting that Chun has yet to admit his involvement with the massacre during the Gwangju May 18 democratization uprising back in 1980. The meeting, if not cancelled, would have taken place on Sep. 12.“My purpose was to embrace various  spectra but I agree that the party and the people were right ,” she said at the party‘s Supreme Council meeting.She also added that “bitter self-reflection upon the past dictatorship and massacre should take precedence over tolerance and unity,“ suggesting that her move to reach out to Chun had been rash. The Minjoo Party of Korea‘s chairperson Rep.

Both former presidents are largely denounced by liberals over their suppression against democratic movements.Choo claimed that her plans included asking Chun to visit the May 18 National Cemetery and pay tribute to the victims for whose deaths he is held accountable.But the plan was thwarted by resistance within the party. On Thursday, the party’s Supreme Council unanimously vetoed the controversial meeting, while rank-and-file members also exerted pressure upon the leadership to withdraw the plan. Some party members accused the new leader of lacking coordination with the leadership in advance and using the event to promote her political profile.“There is concern that Choo is trying to play politics in her own interest,” a ranking party member said on the condition of anonymity.By Yeo Jun-suk","former president was inappropriate ,leader on friday apologized ,the disputed former president ,friday apologized over her ,disputed former president","['Chun Doo - hwan', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Chun']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83968526  0.39214888

The committees declined to make the report public, since it's classified.But the sanctions law calls for the report to set forth ""a detailed plan for making unrestricted, unmonitored, and inexpensive electronic mass communications available to the people of North Korea,"" which is believed to be referring to such devices as small radios, USB drives and DVDs.The report is the latest in a series of measures by Washington to increase pressure on Pyongyang over its human rights record. In July, the U.S. imposed its first-ever sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for his role in the country's human rights violations.North Korea is one of the world's most closed nations, with the autocratic communist regime in Pyongyang keeping a tight lid on outside information in an attempt to keep its people oblivious to how bad their leaders are.

Lotte Holdings is Lotte's de facto holding firm based in Tokyo.Prosecutors had originally summoned Shin to undergo questioning Wednesday, but he declined, citing health issues. Shin asked the prosecutors to visit him and carry out the interrogation.The prosecution has been investigating Lotte Group since early June over alleged slush funds, embezzlement and other irregularities.Last week, a Seoul court designated a nonprofit subsidiary of a local law firm as legal guardian of the founder, saying he lacks the ability to make business decisions due to illness and old age.","prosecutors on wednesday visited ,prosecutors visit lotte founder ,before interrogation state prosecutors ,state prosecutors on wednesday ,prosecutors on wednesday","['Lotte Group', 'Shin Kyuk - ho', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Hotel Lotte', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67296398  0.22798735

Describing the president as the only change agent to national reform, the central-left floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won urged the president to hold a summit with North Korea and pursue constitutional amendment to change the five-year single-term presidency. The president has so far rejected both calls. “The president is the root of all the problems and the solution,” the chairman said. “If the president changes herself, politics will change accordingly. The president should stop acting on her own and try hard to listen to the people.” The People’s Party’s interim chief and floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won delivers his parliamentary address at the National Assembly on Wednesday. The floor leader devoted much of his speech to politically sensitive issues, in contrast to Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, who focused more on the economy than politics in her parliamentary address a day earlier, Park Jie-won also reiterated his call for the resignation of Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs embroiled in a corruption scandal, and demanded that the government seek parliamentary approval for its decision to adopt the US advanced missile system. The People’s Party has officially decided to oppose the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here, citing its questionable efficacy and diplomatic fallout.Throughout the 40-minute speech, the 74-year-old lawmaker -- often dubbed by the media and pundits as a “seasoned politician” for his negotiating skills and political maneuvering -- offered bold initiatives for the 20th Assembly whose regular session began last week.This included the long-stalled summit between the two Koreas. The former chief of staff for the late President Kim Dae-jung, who held a historic summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jung-il, suggested that President Park sit down with the North’s Kim Jung-eun before her terms ends in 2017.As a long-time advocate of the former President Kim’s “sunshine policy,” Park urged the government to renew food aid to Pyeongyang and offer them rice and tangerines produced in the South. Aware of the right-wingers’ criticism, he said that the aid would not be used to help the North’s nuclear program.He also urged the lawmakers to create a special parliamentary committee and independent investigative agency to overhaul the nation’s judiciary branch that is rife with bribery scandals involving former and incumbent prosecutors and judges.

According to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, the special inspection team -- consisting of four prosecutors and 10 investigators -- will look into bribery allegations involving senior prosecutor Kim Hyung-joon. “In regard to the case, the special inspection team will thoroughly conduct a probe and punish those who committed wrongdoings accordingly,” the prosecution’s audit department said.  The launch of the inspection team comes after the 45-year-old prosecutor was accused of accepting bribes worth 15 million won  from a businessman, surnamed Kim, in return for pulling strings for him to have his alleged embezzlement and fraud cases dismissed. The two attended the same middle and high schools. A businessman suspected of embezzling company funds, surnamed Kim , is taken into custody at Seoul Seobu District Prosecutors‘ Office on Monday. Kim is also suspected of bribing a senior prosecutor who was his high school classmate. The accusations came as the businessman revealed to local media that he had served as a “financial sponsor” for the prosecutor by providing him with money and meals on a regular basis. In screen-captured text messages exchanged between the two released by a local media outlet, the prosecutor asked for money from the businessman on multiple occasions. In the wake of a widening probe, the prosecutor allegedly advised the businessman to remove evidence of their dubious ties by checking his residence and office and changing his cellphone, according to the messages.The accused prosecutor denied the allegations, saying that he borrowed the money and paid it back in about a month. He also reportedly said that the financial transactions were not related to the legal case. The businessman reportedly claimed that other prosecutors are also involved in the corruption case after he was arrested Monday. He said he would reveal names of the prosecutors during the questioning. The case has already spilled over to the prosecution, which faces allegations that its local office had attempted to cover up the incumbent prosecutor’s alleged wrongdoing by belatedly launching an inspection and asking the police to hand over the case. It is also suspected of dismissing the police’s earlier applications for search warrants into the businessman’s residence.Earlier in the day, the Justice Ministry suspended the prosecutor from his post for two months in accordance with the prosecution’s request. This is the latest in a series of corruption scandals involving judges, prosecutors and lawyers, placing the integrity of the nation’s justice system in question.According to government data obtained by Rep. Hong Il-pyo of the ruling Saenuri Party, 46 prosecutors and 10 judges were punished for wrongdoings from 2011 to 2015. Such misdeeds included drunk driving, violations of rules, failure to maintain dignity and bribery. Among them, 13 prosecutors and judges were punished for receiving kickbacks. Only two faced dismissal, the heaviest punishment. On Friday, the prosecution arrested an incumbent senior judge, identified by his surname Kim, on suspicion of accepting kickbacks from ex-Nature Republic CEO Jung Woon-ho. Jung allegedly asked the judge to hand down a heavy sentence to cosmetics-makers who distributed fake Nature Republic products. In June, prosecutor-turned-lawyer Hong Man-pyo was arrested over suspicions that he evaded taxes and used his connections in the judiciary to seek a lenient ruling for his client Jung.Ex-senior prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon was indicted in late July on charges of benefiting from shady stock transactions and accepting bribes worth 950 million won from Kim Jung-ju, the founder of the nation’s largest game-maker NexonBy Ock Hyun- ju","incumbent prosecutor received kickbacks ,received kickbacks from businessman ,prosecutors and 10 investigators ,probe of prosecutor scandal ,prosecutor received kickbacks","['the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Ki']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22736739 -0.06235485

I promise to take stern measures following what comes to light,” Yang said during an opening speech at an emergency meeting of local court chiefs. Yang Sung-tae, chief justice of the Supreme Court, leaves an emergency meeting Tuesday after delivering an apology over the recent series of corruption scandals involving senior judicial officials. YonhapThe apology came four days after the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office arrested Kim Soo-cheon, a 56-year-old judge of the Incheon District Court, on charges of receiving some 170 million won  in kickbacks from Jung Woon-ho, the former CEO of local cosmetic firm Nature Republic.In return for the bribes, Jung allegedly asked the judge to hand down a heavy sentence to cosmetics-makers who manufactured and sold fake products of Nature Republic in the market. Ahead of the meeting aimed at addressing the corruption cases, Yang claimed that all members of the judicature should bear due responsibility.“The corruption case should not be seen as an individual judge’s deviant behavior. The fact that this wrongdoing took place within the justice system is reason enough for our apology,” he said. “All judges share an indefinite level of mutual responsibility in terms of work ethics.”In his 10-minute solemn speech, Yang underscored the importance of “integrity” and “trust” in the judiciary. “The wrongdoing of a judge poses a threat to the whole justice system and damages our pride and confidence,” Yang said. “Judges, who have strived to walk down the honorable path, are in panic, as their morality is being doubted, but those more hurt and disappointed are the public who trusted and supported the judiciary.”During the meeting, chiefs of local courts discussed how to improve ethics standards and to strengthen the internal inspection of judges involved in bribery allegations. Yang is the third chief justice in the nation’s judicial history to issue a public apology over corruption scandals involving judges. The first such apology from a chief justice came in 1995 when 10 court officials in charge of auctions at Incheon District Court were indicted on suspicions of embezzling a massive amount of money. Chief Justice Yoon Kwan at the time had apologized following the incident. In 2006, then-Chief Justice Lee Yong-hoon made an apology after Cho Kwan-haeng, a former senior judge of the Seoul High Court, was arrested on charges of receiving cash and gifts worth 100 million won from a broker. The ex-judge was sentenced to 10 months in jail in 2008, suspended for two years. The allegation involving Kim is the latest in a series of corruption scandals involving former and incumbent legal professionals, which has dealt a blow to the reputation of the nation’s justice system. The judge-turned-lawyer Choi You-jeong is currently standing trial on suspicions of taking advantage of her status as a former judge to seek a favorable ruling for the ex-chief of Nature Republic. In return, she allegedly received 5 billion won in attorney fees.  In January last year, Choi Min-ho, who was a judge then, was arrested for allegedly taking hundreds of millions of won worth of kickbacks from a private moneylender. He was sentenced to three years in prison.Later in the day, Prosecutor General Kim Soo-nam ordered a thorough investigation into corruption allegations involving a senior incumbent prosecutor and pledged stern action against “those who commit wrongdoing.” Suspicions surfaced Monday that the prosecutor Kim Hung-joon had taken a total of 15 million won in bribes from a businessman. In return, Kim allegedly pulled strings for the businessman to have the alleged embezzlement and fraud case dismissed.Kim denied all the accusations, while the businessman claimed that he served as a “financial sponsor” for the prosecutor. By Ock Hyun-ju","apologizes for corruption scandal ,tuesday offered public apology ,justice apologizes for corruption ,for corruption scandal supreme ,scandal ridden businessman","['Supreme Court', 'Yang Sung - tae', 'Yang']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15823089  0.10978281

Kim Moon-soo, a former Gyeonggi Province governor and a presidential hopeful within the ruling Saenuri Party, claimed that in order to eradicate high-profile corruption scandals, it is crucial to build an independent body dedicated to probing senior officials’ wrongdoing.His remarks were presented in a video clip on his Facebook account, in which Kim referred to Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs who has been dogged by a series of dubious financial deals and alleged influence-peddling.Kim’s stance stood at odds with the Saenuri Party which has considered such an organization as politically-motivated, claiming that lawmakers would be granted the authority to investigate a case without the consent of judiciary and executive bodies. The feud escalated Thursday when Assembly Spearker Chung Sye-kyun brought up the issue in his parliamentary speech. The Saenuri members left the general meeting hall in protest and demanded that the speaker step down in apology of his remarks that leaned toward the opposition. The bill on the independent probe agency was introduced in August, upon the motion of 71 lawmakers from the The Minjoo Party and the People’s Party. According to the draft, an independent investigation may be launched when one-tenth of the 300-member Parliament calls for the process.By Yeo Jun-suk","the ruling party sunday ,the infamous bribery scandal ,top presidential aide showing ,scandal involving top presidential ,infamous bribery scandal involving","['Kim Moon - soo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40968409  0.62819952

The Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office arrested the 56-year-old judge at around 2:30 a.m., identified only by his surname Kim, without a warrant, citing his unstable mental state. The arrest came 17 hours after the prosecutors grilled him over his ties with the 50-year-old business tycoon. An “urgent” arrest can be made in only exceptional cases where there are risks of suspects fleeing or being mentally unstable. The prosecution needs to apply for a warrant within 48 hours to formally arrest him.  The senior judge is suspected of buying a secondhand SUV, which had been owned by Jung, at a below market price and being paid back a portion of the money from the purchase in 2014.   Kim and Jung were allegedly close and went on a trip to Vietnam together. The travel expenses were mostly covered by Jung, the prosecution said. In return for the kickbacks worth hundreds of millions of won, Jung allegedly asked the judge to hand out a heavy sentence for suspects who sold fake products of Nature Republic in the market.  In three rulings regarding the cosmetics firm from September to November last year, Kim reportedly delivered a sentence, heavier than a lower court, on some suspects, which many suspect is a result of Jung’s illegal lobbying, prosecutors said. The judge denied all accusations. The judge took a leave of absence on Aug. 16 in the face of looming suspicions over his dubious deals with Jung. He will be on leave until February. The prosecution is also looking into why the judge kept several 1 million won checks issued by Jung. The judge argued that the money was to offer condolences at a funeral. Jung himself was indicted last October on charges of illegal gambling from 2012 to 2014 in Macau, the Philippines and other overseas locations. The lower court handed down a one-year prison term, but the appeals court reduced it to eight months. A series of corruption allegations involving business owners and high-ranking judges, prosecutors and lawyers have marred the reputation of the nation’s justice system. In June, prosecutor-turned-lawyer Hong Man-pyo was indicted over suspicions that he evaded taxes and peddled influence in the judiciary to seek a lenient ruling for his client Jung. The prosecutors also indicted judge-turned-lawyer Choi You-jeong on charges of taking advantage of her status as a former judge to seek a favorable ruling for Jung. In return, she is suspected of having received 5 billion won in attorney fees. Ex-senior prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon was indicted in late July on charges of benefiting from shady stock transactions and accepting bribes from Kim Jung-ju, founder of the nation’s largest game maker Nexon. The prosecution on Wednesday released a set of measures to fight irregularities involving legal professionals, though critics said that it was insufficient and a repetition of former policies. The measures include the establishment of task forces under each district prosecutors’ office to probe corruption cases involving lawyers and brokers and a plan to operate new teams specialized in intelligence gathering and monitoring high-ranking prosecutors.By Ock Hyun-ju","judge arrested over bribery ,arrested over bribery ,office arrested the 56 ,arrested over bribery the ,profile corruption scandal plaguing","['Nature Republic', 'Jung Woon - ho', 'the Seoul Central Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2905826   0.1260868

Kim is also suspected of traveling to Vietnam with Jung, with the businessman paying most of the travel expenses, according to prosecutors.  This image shows Jung Woon-ho , former chief of cosmetics brand Nature Republic, who is at the center of a sprawling lobbying scandal. Last year, Kim delivered a sentence, heavier than a lower court, to a defendant who was indicted for selling fake products of Nature Republic. Prosecutors said they will grill Kim on why he did not ask for reapportionment on three cases that involved the cosmetic firm, despite his close relations with Jung. After the allegations were raised, Kim asked for a leave of absence earlier this month and the country's top court allowed it till February.A number of former and current legal professionals and businessmen are standing trial in relation to the sprawling scandal.Jung himself has also been held in detention as prosecutors sped up their investigation.

324,324,[HERALD INTERVIEW] Freshmen lawmaker accuses elites of advocating ‘faux security’,"Freshman lawmakers are not typically respected as sources of expertise at the National Assembly. But Rep.

But Rep. Kim Jong-dae is an exception, especially on a topic that often dominates debate among prominent politicians or presidential hopefuls: national security.  “My decades-old journey for security issues culminates here,” Kim said in an interview with The Korea Herald at his office in the 20th Assembly, where he serves as a member of a parliamentary committee dealing with national defense and military issues. Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the minor Justice Party. Ahn-hoon/The Korea HeraldBefore being elected as a lawmaker in April, the 52-year-old worked as a parliamentary aide between 1993 and 2000. A graduate of economics at Yonsei University, Kim has mostly served in areas related to security issues for progressive politicians and leaders.His past posts included an administrative officer for security at the transitional committee for then President-elect Kim Jae-jung in 1998 and a defense committee member for the transition committee for then President-elect Roh Moo-hyun in 2003.He has also served in defense-related committees for the two governments and the military, and been chief editor for defense magazines and journals.Now, as one of a few opposition lawmakers with a background in security, the first-termer of the minor Justice Party aims to challenge the country’s national security elites under conservative presidencies, who he accused of advocating “faux security.” “Solid national security requires the government to take responsibility for its actions,” said Kim. “But I don’t think that the past conservative governments have done that. Instead, they always tried to find an excuse to blame someone for their failure. That is what I call ‘faux security.’” Kim argued that over the past eight years -- during the administrations of Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye -- the security challenges facing South Korea have escalated, with Pyongyang continuing to conduct military provocations and Seoul failing to contain or prevent them.He pointed to North Korea’s attack on South Korea’s Cheonan ship in Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, and the North’s latest nuclear and missile tests -- grave security risks followed by an equally boisterous collision among South Koreans on how to contain the situation.In the process, Kim said that the past two governments eventually pinned the blame on liberal parties or progressive activists, while taking sterner positions against the North.“ North Korea is not an answer to every security failure that the government has made,” he said. “What we should do, instead, is to figure out what the threats are and how to manage them. Otherwise, it is like blaming an environmentalist for snakes on a mountain.”A “security debacle” is once again unfolding, he said, over the controversy surrounding the government’s decision to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.  According to the lawmaker, bilateral negotiations over the THAAD deployment was done without proper communication with the general public and political parties, both of whom, he said, were completely out of the loop throughout the process. “Everyone had assumed that the government would lay out its position toward the THAAD in October,” he said, referring to a remark by Defense Minister Han Min-koo, who had told lawmakers on July 5 that the negotiations were still underway and that he was not briefed about the result. “But suddenly, the government convened the National Security Council on July 7 and one day later, they announced that the deal was finalized,” Kim said. “At that moment, I felt like there was nothing I could do as a lawmaker. I felt so powerless.” Some politicians and experts suggested that while THAAD might not be able to offer seamless protection from the North’s evolving missile and nuclear threat, the advanced missile defense system is so far the best option available and its deployment will eventually do less harm than good. But Kim dismissed this view as unprofessional. He asserted that there is no weapon that does “less harm than good” because analyzing exact costs and benefits are prerequisites.Using the US government’s effort to downsize its military budget -- otherwise known as sequestration -- as an example, Kim highlighted that every defense agency around the world is working hard to avoid budget duplication, particularly on military spending, amid efforts to tighten fiscal policy. “Using a vague calculation to assess military requirement is the last thing  when determining military requirement,” he said. “It is an amateurish approach that would be taken by ordinary citizens, not by security officials or experts.” The lawmaker went on to counter the government’s claim that deployment of the THAAD batteries has nothing to do with full-fledged participation in the US-led Missile Defense, saying that the US itself acknowledged that the THAAD is a part of its global missile system. To make his case, he cited a report published in May 2015 by the US Government Accountability Office. The report described the THAAD as intended to “increase integration with other Ballistic Missile Defense elements.” Such capability of the weapon system, he argued, is what prompted vehement opposition among Chinese policymakers, who viewed it as a “strategic asset” that might shift the balance of power in favor of Washington. “THADD has triggered a clash in which US and China compete for regional dominance,” he said. At the center of the conflict, he added, lies the THAAD X-band radar capable of watching over mainland China. “It makes THAAD crucial to the US-led Missile Defense and continues to unnerve the Chinese.” Faced with mounting criticism from China, President Park Geun-hye and the ruling Saenuri Party’s lawmakers have expressed worries that Beijing’s protest amounts to an infringement of the country’s sovereign right to take self-defense measures. But Kim said that Beijing’s concerns are partly “legitimate” as historically most countries have often expressed themselves regarding their neighbors’ military steps. “Back in the Cold War, the US and Soviet Union had intervened with each other to ensure that both states do not have strategic missile systems,” he said. “Otherwise, the balance of terror would have been compromised and led to potential conflicts.” One of the other reasons why the government should take China’s concerns seriously, he added, is that Beijing has raised its retaliatory measures against Seoul to an “alarming level,” which means a dramatic setback in socio-economic ties of the two countries. Having conducted extensive studies on threat analysis, Kim and his colleagues have divided threat levels into seven categories. Currently, China is taking a “level three measure,” he contended, which involves fostering anti-Korea sentiment, but it has not included government-led sanctions.According to Kim, it was the US presidential nominees who escalated the debate over THAAD. North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January this year, he argued, has energized both Democrat candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump to set an assertive tone and advocate the THAAD deployment. The lawmaker suggested that while it was hard to tell what would happen if Trump were to be elected -- because there seemed to be no credible advisor group on his foreign policies -- Clinton would shift the country’s stance on THAAD if Koreans continue to oppose the move. “Though Hilary Clinton approves of THAAD right now, the stance is likely to change,” said Kim, who said that he had met with staff members of the Clinton campaign during his visit to the US. “I doubt she would push ahead with the plan against strong opposition by the Korean people.” By Yeo Jun-suk[HERALD INTERVIEW]","faux security freshman lawmakers ,interview freshmen lawmaker accuses ,freshmen lawmaker accuses elites ,security freshman lawmakers ,herald interview freshmen lawmaker","['the National Assembly', 'Kim Jong - dae', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5507533   0.16103058

(Yonhap)Lee, part ...","Special inspector Lee Seok-su, who had been tasked with investigating a scandal-marred senior presidential aide, offered to resign Monday amid a widening probe into his alleged information leak.  A special team of prosecutors probing allegations surrounding senior presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo leaves after searching the office of a company headed by Woo’s wife in Seocho-gu, southern Seoul. Lee, part of a probe involving civil affairs presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo, is suspected of exposing details of the investigation into Woo’s case to a local media outlet through a messaging app. Under law, a special inspector can face a jail term of up to five years for leaking information about an ongoing probe. “I concluded that there is nothing more I can do as a special inspector in a situation where documents related to the ongoing probe were searched for and seized,” he told a local media outlet after tendering his resignation. The resignation came only a week after he vowed not to step down from his post over the allegations. Earlier in the day, the special task force in charge of investigating Woo’s alleged corruption charges and Lee’s alleged info leak raided eight locations, including Lee’s office in central Seoul. It seized the cellphones of Lee and an unspecified reporter from local broadcaster MBC.Led by Yoon Gap-geun, chief of the Daegu High Prosecutors’ Office, the special task force also stormed Woo’s family-owned company Jeonggang in southern Seoul, as well as an office of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in central Seoul, in connection with embezzlement and influence-peddling allegations. Woo has been under investigation for allegedly misappropriating funds from the company to lease a luxury sedan and pay for his and his family members’ phone bills. He is also accused of using his position to help his son get assigned to a relatively easy post as a policeman during the military service.The prosecution also raided the nation’s largest game-maker Nexon, which is suspected of buying real estate owned by Woo’s family in southern Seoul, allegedly at a rate much higher than market price, in 2011. The company resold it one year and four months later, upon the withdrawal of its plan to build its new headquarters in Seoul. Woo has flatly denied all accusations. The former inspector Lee asked the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office to open a formal probe into his alleged charges of embezzlement and abuse of power last month.Over the weekend, a special task force was brought in to question Yoon Young-dae, the head of nonprofit organization Spec Watch Korea, who had filed a complaint against Woo. The civic group raised suspicions that Woo evaded taxes when he inherited shares from a golf company and that he turned a blind eye to former prosecutor Jin Kyung-jun’s dubious stock transactions.Prosecutors additionally took statements from the head of a right-wing and Catholic organization, also surnamed Lee, who had filed a complaint against ex-special inspector Lee.

Kim Jin-tae, the chief journalist was Song Hee-young, the chief editor at South Korea’s top daily newspaper Chosun Ilbo. Song allegedly went on a tour in 2011 involving a private jet flight, yacht cruise and golf trips in Europe.“Having heard that the chief journalist made a counterargument, I could not but mention his actual name,” said the lawmaker who, in his initial press conference last Friday, had kept Song’s name and affiliation under wraps. Rep. Kim estimated the total cost of Song’s trip at some 200 million won , unlike Chosun Ilbo’s claim that Song was on a business trip to cover the Greek financial crisis, which only cost about 2 million won.Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party suggests data on Monday to back the allegations that a chief editor of Chosun Ilbo enjoyed an extravagant tour under financially-troubled shipbuilder DSME’s expenses. Yonhap“But his itinerary included not only Greece, but also Italy and UK, where Song toured famous tourist spots such as Naples and Rome, and his yacht ride cost over 33 million won per day,” Kim said.“Song also turned out to have played golf in London, free of charge, which seems to be quite unrelated to the sovereign default of Greece.”DSME, which came under fire after recording a massive net loss last year, is currently under probe over alleged frauds involving its former CEO and its publicist.Song offered his resignation in the afternoon, hours after the Saenuri lawmaker’s accusations.By Bae Hyun-jung","news editor lawmaker lawmaker ,korea top daily newspaper ,dsme bribed chief news ,bribed chief news editor ,chief news editor lawmaker","['Saenuri Party', 'Chosun Ilbo', 'Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering', 'Kim Jin - tae', 'Song Hee - young', 'South Korea ’s', 'Chosu']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44763151  0.49277702

Pyongyang’s latest provocation was its test-firing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile last Wednesday, which Park described as a “tangible threat to national security” that has now gone beyond simply being a source of concern. “North Korea will never give up efforts to downsize its nuclear weapons,” the president said. “Should it succeed in mounting a nuclear  on a ballistic missile, the survival of our nation and our people will be at risk.”Underlining national security, she alluded that the opposition circles and local communities should withdraw their protest over the installment of the US anti-missile defense system.“It is in times like these that we should all unite and join forces in defending our country,” Park said.On the same day, the Defense Ministry said that it had selected three candidate sites within Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province, for the THAAD deployment, taking a step forward in the feud-ridden agenda.In a move to add pressure on the communist neighbor, the president also cited the North Korean Human Rights Act, which is to take effect from Sept. 4.“North Korean human rights is an urgent humanitarian issue, as well as the founding stone for a peaceful peninsular unification,” Park said, urging related organizations to give wider publicity to human rights within the reclusive state.The president’s remarks came just days before she was set to depart for Russia on a three-nation tour encompassing China and Laos. On the sidelines of consolidating diplomatic and economic ties with each state, Park is expected to call for regional cooperation in pressing North Korea into abiding by the UN Security Council resolution on denuclearization. By Bae Hyun-jung","measures against north korea ,against north korea nuclear ,president park geun hye ,north korea nuclear ,against nk nuke president","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea ’s']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13258192  0.1375429

Choo, widely referred to as a key figure of the so-called Moon Jae-in faction within the party, is anticipated to play crucial role in paving the way for Moon to be tapped as the party's standard bearer for the 2017 presidential race.Moon, who stepped down from the party's top post earlier this year following internal strife, is regarded as a strong presidential contender among the liberal sector of South Korean politics.Political pundits also expect Choo will make numerous progressive changes in the party's policies, compared to her predecessor Kim Chong-in, who tended to advocate a neutral posture.","incumbent president park geun ,late presidents and vowing ,incumbent president park ,of incumbent president park ,tribute to late presidents","[""South Korea 's"", 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'Park Chung - hee', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.17189504  0.59963208

Ahn Hee-jung, are instead likely to test the waters and seek for alternative forces to drum up their own support in or outside the Minjoo Party, observers said.The incoming leadership led by fifth-termer Rep. Choo Mi-ae, who garnered a whopping 54 percent of the votes, is likely to set the tone for the Minjoo Party’s critically wishy-washy policy platforms, to draw the line clearer against the conservative ruling Saenuri Party. Her leadership is also expected to scale down the image reshuffle led by her predecessor Rep. Kim Chong-in who have been trying to place the party more towards the center from progressive.Some observers viewed the latest feat by the pro-Moon faction to pave the stable ground for the party to assemble around a single, most convincing, candidate.Former Minjoo Party chairman Moon Jae-in  claps while attending the party’s national convention to elect the new leadership in Seoul on Saturday. The opposition candidate is to go up against a ruling party rival to be championed by the Saenuri’s new leadership under Rep. Lee Jung-hyun with a strong allegiance to President Park Geun-hye and her airtight supporters. Among the presidential hopefuls dubbed to represent the Saenuri Party include UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.But others suggested Moon’s renewed grip may further bring down the Minjoo Party’s struggling attempt to refresh its underdog image by capturing the attention of the moderates.Of the eight Supreme Council members, picked along with the party chairwoman, six of them are considered to be loyal to Moon. They include Rep. Yang Hyang-ja, a former Samsung Electronics executive, who joined the party upon Moon’s persuasion. She earned almost half the votes.The eight each represent regions sectioned into Seoul/Jeju, Gyeonggi/Incheon, Gangwon/Chungcheon, Jeolla and Gyeongsang, as well as target constituent groups including seniors, women and youths.They will be joining floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho as the party’s first official leadership upon the April 13 general election. Woo is considered reformative unassociated with the Moon faction.The party is set to elect two more members of the Supreme Council in October.Members of the party’s reform committee, meanwhile, saw disappointing records. Rep. Kim Sang-kon, who had headed the committee came at the bottom with 22.08 percent of the votes against Choo.While former floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul, considered representative of the so-called non-mainstreamers against the pro-Moons, managed to become a runner-up.Meanwhile, Choo has been pledging zero-tolerance against factional challenges against whoever becomes the party’s leading presidential hopeful. Choo has worked closely with Moon as a member of the Supreme Council members while he served as the party chairman. Choo, in her acceptance speech, called out to each one of those considered as Moon’s rival that included Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, Park Won-soon, Ahn Hee-jung, Lee Jae-myeong and retired Minjoo member Sohn Hak-kyu.“I will absolutely maintain a fair presidential primary. I urge all of you to join and create a clean, historic primary,” Choo said.But critics suggested her dominance could egg on Moon’s rivals to seek alliances with alternative forces that may include those from the third-largest People’s Party comprised mostly of Minjoo Party defectors. They had left in intense factional feud surrounding Moon ahead of the parliamentary race.Recently, Seoul Mayor Park reportedly held an informal meeting with former senior advisor Sohn Hak-kyu. Park visited Sohn residing in Gangjin, South Jeolla Province, upon his political retirement after the failed presidential bid in 2012. While Sohn has repeatedly shunned such speculation, the former Gyeonggi governor is widely expected to rejoin politics ahead of next year’s presidential election.On Saturday, People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won shared drinks with Sohn and openly urged him to join his party. Rep. Kim Chong-in, who served as the Minjoo Party’s interim leader through the parliamentary race, also hinted at his continued role in keeping the Moon forces in check, by saying “It is worrisome that the party is tilted towards one faction.” Kim, formerly a key member of President Park Geun-hye’s presidential campaign strategists, has also been public about criticizing the Minjoo Party’s “outdated idealism” that he said has failed to woo the moderates.Moon’s potential rivals, meanwhile, offered courteous reaction to Choo’s win.“Now that we have found our direction, it is hoped that we can advance straight towards changing the era and the future along with the people,” Park Won-soon said.In a telephone interview with a local media, Ahn Hee-jung congratulated Choo and other elected members, and said, “I hope that the Minjoo Party can create the new alternative for the Republic of Korea though unity and harmony.”Seongnam City mayor Lee, for his part, said Choo’s win was widely expected and added that he believed the new chairwomen would do a good job. Moon, meanwhile, posted on his Facebook page a message that read, “It is hoped that we can all join hands around the new leadership and step together towards changing the administration.”","other potential presidential candidates ,won soon seongnam mayor ,pro moon leadership ,his presidential bid ,boost to his presidential","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myeong', 'South Chung']",10,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.3713645  0.3225736  0.0994223],Korea Herald,Politics,8,2016,"race recently seoul mayor park ,parliamentary race recently seoul mayor ,race recently seoul mayor ,party leading presidential hopeful ,boost to his presidential bid","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myeong', 'South Chungcheong', 'Ahn Hee - jung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul', 'Saenuri', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Moon ’s', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Supreme Council', 'Moon', 'Yang Hyang -', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Moon', 'Seoul / Jeju , Gyeonggi / Incheon', 'Gangwon / Chungcheon', 'Jeolla', 'Gyeongsang', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'Moon', 'the Supreme Council', 'Kim Sang - kon', 'Choo', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Choo', 'Moon', 'the Supreme Council', 'Moon ’s', 'Kim Boo - kyum', 'Park Won - soon', 'Ahn Hee - jung', 'Lee Jae - myeong', 'Minjoo', 'Sohn Hak - kyu', 'Moon ’s', 'People ’s Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Moon', 'Seoul', 'Park', 'Sohn Hak - kyu', 'Sohn', 'Gangjin', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Gyeonggi', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - win', 'Sohn', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon', 'Kim', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon', 'Choo ’s', 'Park Won - soon', 'Ahn Hee - jung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Lee', 'Choo ’s']",7,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.3713645  0.3225736  0.0994223]

Ahn Cheol-soo on Sunday strongly indicated a second presidential bid, vowing to change politics, the lives of the people and the administration with “reasonable reform.”Speaking at a press conference after hiking up Mudeungsan in Gwangju, Ahn said, “I would like to revisit Mudeungsan next winter when it will be covered by propitious snow. I would like to once again meet the morning of Mudeungsan that spells an end to the outdated era to open a new one.” Ahn Cheol-soo The mountain that towers over Gwangju has historically and spiritually been considered a symbol of the defense against external invasions, as well as for the fight for democracy.Pledging his foremost task would be to do away with the extremes of both sides, he said he would exert all efforts to change the administration, politics, generation and entire system.“Next year’s presidential election will be a confrontation of the past and the future.”Connoting himself as the representative of “reasonable reform forces,” Ahn said the results in the April general election showed such yearning among the Korean people.The People’s Party, which Ahn co-founded, swept almost all seats in the Gwangju and Jeolla Provinces, traditional strongholds for the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea.The party that is mainly composed of Minjoo Party defectors has gained an upper hand in the National Assembly by holding the 38 casting votes the make a difference between the Saenuri Party’s 129 seats and the Minjoo Party’s 121 seats.Ahn, who entered politics with a bang as a presidential candidate in the 2012 election, was forced to abandon his dream previously amid calls for a single candidacy among opposition candidates to go up against then-rival presidential candidate Park Geun-hye of the Saenuri Party. He withdrew his bid on Nov. 23, just weeks before Election Day and expressed support, albeit reluctantly, for the candidate of what was then the Democratic United Party Moon Jae-in.The People`s Party`s former co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo speaks during a press conference in Gwangju on Sunday. The doctor-turned-entrepreneur-turned-politician has proclaimed “new politics” as his mantra, and has been enjoying relatively high support ratings among presidential hopefuls. His party, which collected several bigwigs representing the politically vocal Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, has since been taking a centrist approach to varying issues and policies.In the latest survey by pollster Realmeter on Aug. 25, Ahn was ranked third among presidential hopefuls after UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at 24.1 percent and Moon Jae-in at 17.7 percent, coming in at 9.7 percent. Tailing Ahn was Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon at 6.3 percent in the survey conducted on 1,518 eligible voters.Ahn, born in Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province in 1962, won his first term at the National Assembly by running as an independent for the Nowon-C constituency in northeastern Seoul in the by-election in 2013. He started to work on founding his own party, but later united with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, a successor to the Democratic United Party and precursor to The Minjoo Party of Korea, in 2014.He became the co-chairman along with Kim Han-gil, but both resigned after the party’s defeat in the following by-elections. Ahn and Kim later went on to establish a new party of their own, the People’s Party, together with former justice minister and six-termer Chun Jung-bae in January this year.He won his second term in his constituency in the general elections in April.Ahn, who has referred himself as the Bernie Sanders of Korea, has sought to distance himself from the established politics of gimmicks.He resigned from the co-chairmanship in June this year upon a kickback scandal involving the party’s key campaigners during the parliamentary election.During his Sunday press conference, Ahn said, “I will devote my all to serve the demand to change the politics, the lives of the people and the era, and to respond to the orders that we, the People’s Party, must accomplish the administration change.”Forecasting that next year’s race will be a collision of beliefs for the future that will set the future of the country, Ahn said his party will open all doors, self-create challenges and continue to break through them to earn the final choice, referring to the presidential election.“When you look closely at the meaning of the  general elections, it was a judgement against the two major rivaling parties. The flow of the proud public sentiment will explode in next year’s race,” he said, adding that he anticipated seeing a radically high voter turnout.","second presidential bid vowing ,press conference after hiking ,indicated second presidential bid ,presidential bid vowing ,revisit mudeungsan next winter","['the People ’s Party ’s', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Mudeungsan in Gwangju', 'Mudeungsan']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.517645    0.80329704

Lee Jong-kul and Kim Sang-gon who posted 23.8 percent and 22 percent, respectively.Rep. Choo Mi-ae poses for a photo during the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea's national convention held in Seoul on Aug. 27.It marks the first time for the party to elect a female head from the so-called ""TK region"" comprising Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, which has traditionally been the ruling Saenuri Party's stronghold.The lawmaker, from the southern city of Daegu, first started her political career through the help of late president Kim Dae-jung. She also had played a crucial role in the election campaign of late president Roh Moo-hyun. But Choo later faced challenges in her political career after voting in favor of impeaching Roh.The lawmaker, however, successfully made reconciliations with politicians of the so-called pro-Roh faction, claiming that participating in the impeachment attempts was the biggest mistake of her career.Reflecting this, followers of the party's leading presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in, who inherited the Roh faction since his death in 2009, gave full support to Choo, allowing her to win the top party post.The result is anticipated to give Moon a second chance to run in next year's presidential election and try to recoup his defeat by incumbent President Park Geun-hye. Moon stepped down from the party's top post earlier this year following internal strife.Political pundits said the result reflects the party members' desire to choose a strong leadership that can unite the party. If other hopefuls won the race, the party could have fallen into a more intense battle to pick presidential candidates, they added.""Next year's presidential election must focus on the livelihood of the people,"" Choo said, adding she will now focus her efforts on successfully leading the party down the road.The result is also set to bring major ""progressive-leaning"" changes to party policies, including its stance on the deployment of an advanced US missile defense system in the country, they also said.Choo's predecessor, has maintained a neutral stance against the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the country, which bought criticism from some of Minjoo's progressive lawmakers.Choo earlier vowed she will take a tougher stance in regards to THAAD.The move will also apparently further weigh down the party's relationship with the conservative ruling Saenuri Party, which claims the missile defense system is integral to defending South Korea against Pyongyang's evolving nuclear and missile threats.Pundits said Choo, however, is anticipated to face challenges down the road due to her history of supporting the move to impeach Roh, which is considered as ""unpardonable"" for some liberal officials.Her background as being born in the right-leaning region of Daegu, on the other hand, can help Minjoo gain groundin the conservative southeastern part of the country, they added.On Saturday, the party also named new heads of women, elderly and youth committees.Yang Hyang-ja, a former executive at Samsung Electronics Co., was elected to head the women's committee after beating incumbent Rep. Yoo Eun-hae.","new chairwomen to replace ,of korea elected rep ,saturday signaling progressive leaning ,choo five term lawmaker ,chairwomen to replace kim","[""South Korea 's"", 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Choo Mi', 'the Gwangjin District of Seoul', 'Kim Chong - in']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27781251  0.57163966

The runner-up opposition People’s Party and the progressive minority Justice Party stood at 1.4 billion won and 384.6 million won, respectively.The Minjoo Party’s high figure was largely due to by Rep. Kim, who turned out to be the richest not only among newly-registered lawmakers, but among the entire 300-member legislature. Rep. Kim‘s assets thus outran those of Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, former co-chief of the People’s Party and computer vaccine developer, which stood at 192.9 billion won.With Kim out of the count, his party’s average dipped below that of the Saenuri, down to 1.6 billion won, and the assembly‘s total average to 1.9 billion won.The largest part of his assets were his 204 billion won worth of Webzen stocks, 5.8 billion won in bank deposits, and real estate amounting to 2.9 billion won, data showed.In contrast, Rep.

He is suspected of pushing an advertisement firm to produce election campaign videos, worth some 80 million won , for free. Cho Dong-won appears for questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday. The related prosecutorial investigation kicked off in July, after the National Election Commission filed a complaint against Cho along with one of his colleagues and the head of the ad company.The videos in question included the “Run, National Assembly” series, which had featured then-chairman Kim Moo-sung and other leadership members reaching out to communicate with the people.The current law, which bans nonmembers from providing the party with free goods or services, hands down a maximum five-year jail term or 10 million-won fine.Cho, a renowned advertisement copywriter, first joined the ruling party ahead of the 2012 general election.

The ruling Saenuri Party leadership, while signaling some consent to the need for Woo’s resignation, denounced the opposition’s idea of an independent counsel, calling it a political trick to set the ground for the battle leading up to the presidential election next year.National Assembly speaker Chung Sye-kyun joined the fray by saying on Monday that Woo’s case should be handed over to a special prosecutor so that the presidential house and political parties may focus on more urgent agendas.The Saenuri Party immediately shot back.“It is against the National Assembly Act for the parliamentary speaker to openly side with the opposition,” Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said Tuesday at a party meeting.“How can we expect the speaker to play his given role as mediator, if he backs the opposition 100 percent.”Speaker Chung has currently defected from The Minjoo Party of Korea due to his parliamentary post and its obligation of political neutrality.“ requires the approval of the full parliamentary floor and the Saenuri Party clearly holds a different view with the opposition on this issue,” the floor leader added.Chung Jin-suk remained stern against Woo, suggesting last week that it may be time for the president to let the senior secretary go, as he would face a prosecutorial probe over his alleged abuse of power.“I, along with a majority of our party members, think that it is inappropriate for an incumbent senior presidential secretary to answer prosecutorial questioning,” he told reporters last week.He had also posted on his Facebook account earlier that day that “it is time for Woo to make the big decision and to argue for his innocence as a civilian .”The dispute regarding Woo also appears to have spilled over to National Police Agency chief nominee Lee Chul-sung, who is under fire for his past criminal record of drunk driving. It was Woo who, as senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, had vetted Lee.But the presidential office gestured at going ahead with the police chief’s nomination.“ will take place as according to legal procedures,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters. The Assembly has failed to wrap up its review on Lee within the 20-day deadline, upon which the president can request a report on the parliamentary hearing on a nominee. If the Assembly fails to send the report, the president can bypass the parliamentary step and make the final appointment.By Bae Hyun-jung","inspector prosecutors said tuesday ,prosecution to probe presidential ,prosecutors said tuesday ,to probe presidential aide ,prosecutors said tuesday that","['the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'Yun gap - geun', 'the Daegu High prosecutor ’ Office', 'Lee Se']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03173613  0.71226686

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office is looking into the case.Park Geun-ryoung Park Geun-ryoung, 62, is suspected of exaggerating her influence, borrowing 100 million won and failing to pay some of it back. She was fined 5 million won last year on different fraud charges.Her husband, Shin Dong-wook, was quoted as telling Yonhap News that while she borrowed the money and failed to pay some 40 million won, she has been paying interest.Reports said Lee had questioned the younger Park at his office in central Seoul last month.The former head of the Korean Children’s Center has been estranged from President Park over differences on a number of issues for decades, including her marriage to Shin who was jailed for putting up defaming posts on the older Park in 2012. Investigation into Park Geun-ryoung is to be the first implementation of the special inspector’s role since the system was first introduced in 2014. Last week, Lee also referred the case of senior secretary Woo Byung-woo for abuse of power and other corruption allegations. Reporting a case is considered a tougher action than referring a case.Lee himself has been embroiled in controversy after reports that he illegally leaked information about his investigation into Woo to a local media outlet. The special inspector, named by the president, can investigate the president’s spouse and close relatives as well as senior members of the presidential secretariat when corruption allegations surface. The inspector can refer or report the case to the prosecution when a certain amount of evidence is gathered.","park estranged sister probed ,sister probed for fraud ,park estranged sister ,estranged sister of president ,ryoung the estranged sister","['Park Geun - ryoung', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Seok - su', 'Lee', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Park Geun - ryoung', 'yonhap)park Geun - ry']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40337059  0.55100292

The ruling Saenuri Party and opposition parties continued to debate on whether high-profile government officials should testify on allegations that they secretly plotted a massive injection of government funds into the financially struggling shipbuilding sector. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea has been insisting that they will hold back passing the budget bill unless the Saenuri Party agrees to include the officials in the witness list. They include former Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan and senior presidential secretary for policy coordination An Chong-bum. The officials allegedly held a secret meeting at Cheong Wa Dae in October last year and agreed to inject some 4.2 trillion won into Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., the nation’s No. 2 shipbuilder which has been weighed down by deficits and allegations of irregularities.The Saenuri Party, however, has asserted that Choi and An should not be included in the list and that the bill must be passed regardless of the approval of the list. The two officials, President Park Geun-hye’s close confidants, also refused to attend the hearing.The main parties had originally agreed to pass the budget bill on Monday. Officials said that if the plan fails to clear the legislative hurdle by the end of this month, the budget plan will be scrapped. Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk attends a party meeting to discuss the delayed review of the extra budget at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldThe government asserted that the budget bill should be passed as soon as possible to maximize its economic benefits, highlighting that a delayed implementation would make it ineffective in addressing the financial woes facing the nation.“Timing is the key to the supplementary budget, but I’m afraid that we have passed the right timing,” Minister of Strategy and Finance Yoo Il-ho said during a meeting with government agencies. “It is unfortunate, frustrating and devastating.” Yoo noted that the nation’s economy will face grave financial challenges in the third quarter when the government is slated to end the individual consumption tax cut and enforce the anti-graft act that some economists say will dampen consumer spending. As a back-up plan, the Finance Ministry is reportedly planning to incorporate some of the supplementary budget into next year’s budget plan which is expected to be proposed by the government on Sep 2. But the officials expressed worries that there is little time to finish the process. The Saenuri Party doubled its attack on the opposition bloc and accused some hard-liners of the Minjoo Party of breaking the agreement to meet the Monday deadline.“ is shaking up the very basic rule of parliament,” said the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. Chung charged that the faction close to the former president Roh Moo-hyun was behind the stalemate. The criticism came after the Minjoo Party officially endorsed a plan to conjoin their action on the extra budget bill and the witness list. The center-left party asserts that the officials in question, who oversaw the nation’s financial policy, must explain themselves before moving to discuss the new budget plan.  “A parliamentary hearing is a prerequisite for a swift passage of the supplementary budget,” said floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. “We will not agree with the budget request without hearing a proper explanation from those dealing with taxpayers’ money,” The People’s Party, meanwhile, appeared to have a less staunch approach. The third-biggest party on Tuesday hinted at the possibility that they would yield on the witness list for the time being to pass the budget bill in time. The centrist party’s lawmakers urged the parties to continue their negotiation at the National Assembly’s Special Committee on Budget -- a parliamentary committee designed to review the government’s budget proposal.“The continuous deadlock  only hurts our economy,” said the People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won. “We’re sincerely hoping that the parties accept our proposal. We can both pass the budget bill and hold the hearing.”By Yeo Jun-suk","hearing on controversial government ,grim as rival parties ,parliamentary hearing on controversial ,11 trillion won billion ,controversial government led restructuring",['Saenuri Party'],10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.18039529 0.26001006 0.19098371],Yeo Jun-suk,Politics,8,2016,"parliamentary hearing on controversial government ,into the financially struggling shipbuilding ,third biggest party on tuesday ,the financially struggling shipbuilding sector ,economy will face grave financial","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Finance', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'an Chong - bum', 'Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Choi', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the National Assembly', 'Ahn Hoon', 'Korea HeraldThe', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'Yoo', 'the Finance Ministry', 'the Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Chung', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the People ’s Party', 'the National Assembly ’s Special Committee on Budget', 'the People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - won', 'Yeo Jun - suk']",11,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.18039529 0.26001006 0.19098371]

""As the North Korean regime has been repressing its people with its continued reign of terror while ignoring the livelihoods of its citizens, even the loyalty of North Korea's elites has begun to crumble,"" Park said during the session which was held as the annual South Korea-U.S. military drills kicked off its two-week run.""As signs of serious cracks emerge, the likelihood of unrest in the regime is increasing,"" she added.Thae Yong-ho, North Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain, recently defected to South Korea with his family -- a case that observers here say highlights that the loyalty of the North's elites towards its leader Kim Jong-un has been eroding. Thae, who Seoul officials say has been ""disillusioned"" with the repressive regime, is among many other elites who have sought asylum in South Korea or elsewhere.Park also stressed that to prevent internal unrest and further defections by North Koreans as well as create confusion in South Korean society, the North could undertake various types of provocations or terrorist acts, including those in cyberspace.

Following the NSC meeting, Park chaired a Cabinet meeting.Calling for national unity in overcoming security challenges, the president noted that Pyongyang is moving on an ""extremist path"" that aims to keep South Korea on edge.""I call on Cabinet members to accurately grasp the crisis situation and sternly respond to acts that foment internal division and conflict,"" she said during the Cabinet meeting.Park, in addition, underscored that based on a robust defense posture, the South should make the North ""clearly realize that it would self-destruct should it refuse to change tack"" and move towards denuclearization.","provocations unrest president park ,defection of north korean ,nk provocations unrest president ,recent defection of north ,unrest president park geun","['Park Geun - hye', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'National Security Council', 'north korean']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32686543  0.62307405

Seoul and Washington made a joint decision in July to deploy the advanced antimissile battery at an artillery base in Seongsan-ri to protect against North Korea’s ballistic missile threats.But the plan had sparked concerns over possible adverse effects on human health and the natural environment, especially as the mentioned spot is just 1.5 kilometers away from residential areas.President Park Geun-hye recently said that it was possible to consider the relocation of THAAD within Seongju, after requests from Seongju-based politicians including Rep. Yi Wan-young of the ruling Saenuri Party.One of the most prominent candidates for an alternative spot has been a Lotte-owned golf course in the adjacent Chojeon-myeon, which is further from residential areas than the artillery base.The committee has since then been split over retaining its initial demand and opting for the “plan B.” Sunday’s meeting was adjourned with 23 for, one against the plan B option while nine forfeited.The focal point of the committee’s agreement was threefold; for the ministry to review a place besides Seongsan-ri, cancel plan to dismantle the committee and for the committee members’ collective action.But the Defense Ministry did not address the request, saying it will make a statement when an official request is made via Seongju county office.The county office is expected to make the official request on Monday.By Yoon Min-sik","afternoon and voted on ,gyeongsang province on sunday ,meeting in the afternoon ,afternoon and voted ,held an emergency meeting","['North Gyeongsang Province', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Seongsan - ri', 'Seongju']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22732249  0.46671507

The lawmakers belonging to the Security and Public Administration Committee questioned him on his drunk driving in 1993 that led to an accident. The questioning session was halted midday, as the opposition lawmakers refused to continue questioning him following his admission that he did not disclose his occupation when he was caught driving under the influence and causing the accident.National Police Agency chief nominee Lee Chul-sung  attends the National Assembly’s hearing on Friday. “I was in a daze and in great shame while being investigated and failed to reveal my job at the time,” he said. He added that he was therefore not disciplined. Lee was working for the police agency in Gangwon district at the time. There were reportedly no casualties in the accident and he was fined 1 million won . He also said that while it would have been appropriate to come forward, he had no such opportunity.The opposition lawmakers immediately took issue with this and refused to question him further, saying the incident proved he was not fit for the post.“This shows that fundamentally he is not qualified. What good would it do to hold a hearing on a person who is completely unqualified?” said Rep. Park Nam-choon, The Minjoo Party of Korea’s representative member of the committee.They also grilled him on the suspicion of him allegedly plagiarizing his master’s thesis for Yonsei University in 2000 and on the debate over the police’s allegedly excessive crackdown on past protests by labor union members of a state broadcaster and by residents opposing construction of a high-voltage transmission tower in Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province, as he was then the authority in charge.Lee defended the measures as having abided by the law and principles.Lee also said that he will fully cooperate with the prosecution’s probe into Woo Byung-woo, a senior presidential secretary on civil affairs embroiled in corruption allegations.Lee began his law enforcement career in 1982 as a constable at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in 1982 and passed the commissioned officer candidate exam in 1989. He has since served as the head of police stations in Gangwon Province and Seoul’s Yeongdeungpo branch.He was also in charge of public relations for the NPA and served as the commissioner for the Gyeongnam  Provincial Police Agency.","friday grilled national police ,past drunk driving accident ,police chief nominee grilled ,committee on friday grilled ,retiring npa chief kang","['the National Assembly', 'National Police Agency', 'Lee Chul - sing', 'Lee', 'Kang Sin - myeong', 'Dae']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23695457  0.20388588

Local broadcaster MBC reported Tuesday that he illegally told an unidentified reporter that he would refer Woo’s case to the prosecution if he continues to deny any wrongdoing.Lee on Thursday formally advised the prosecution to launch a probe on Woo for suspected embezzlement and abuse of authority.The latest allegation further complicated the controversy surrounding Woo, who is now pressured not only by the opposition parties but also some members of the ruling Saenuri Party to resign. President Park Geun-hye refused to sack Woo in the Cabinet reshuffle earlier this week.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s lawmakers hold a press conference demanding presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo’s resignation at the National Assembly on Friday. “ is a grave breach of the law and a matter that can’t be tolerated,” senior presidential secretary for public affairs Kim Sung-woo told reporters. “In order to prevent such acts from sabotaging the nation’s essence, we need to find out how and why the leak happened,” he said. According to the law, a special prosecutor can face a prison sentence of up to five years for leaking information related to an ongoing investigation. Lee took a leave of absence Friday and did not release any public statement as of the afternoon. A prosecutorial probe on Woo will be the first case in which an incumbent presidential secretary for civil affairs is subject to the prosecutors’ investigation. Woo’s job responsibilities include verifying nominees for high-profile posts including prosecutors’ office and supervising irregularities in presidential offices. Woo has been suspected of abusing his authority to help his son get special treatment during military service. He is also accused of misappropriating funds from a company run by his family. But other charges, including suspicious monetary transactions over a costly piece of Gangnam real estate in 2011, were excluded from the investigation since the deal had taken place before Woo took office at the Blue House. The exclusion, in turn, prompted another debate over the limited authority of the special inspection system. Created in 2014 as part of President Park’s election pledge, the system allows special inspectors to look into any irregularities involving government officials. The inspectors are appointed by the president and granted three years of tenure. They are selected among lawyers with more than 15 years of legal experience.  “ would not budge, as if the presidential office is gripping its neck. Every time I asked them for information, they pretended not to hear my request,” MBC quoted Lee as telling the reporter in question. “There is nothing I can do if Woo retains his post,” he said. While Cheong Wa Dae lambasted the leak allegation, the opposition parties slammed the presidential office for attempting to deviate from the core of the scandal, and repeated their calls for Woo to step down.The Minjoo Party leader Rep. Kim Chong-in called Cheong Wa Dae’s criticism a “distraction” to undermine investigation into the president’s close aide. “It is quite odd for  to talk as if the special prosecutor did something wrong. We ask that Cheong Wa Dae think about whether the people will accept  attempt to demean the special inspector’s role,” he said. Even some Saenuri lawmakers, such as its floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, suggested it may be time for Woo to leave. Chung said Friday that Woo’s resignation is a “common-sense measure” and that most party members agreed with his view. The four-term lawmaker outside of the faction close to President Park also wrote a similar message on his Facebook account a day before.Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, however, remained reserved. The former presidential secretary for public affairs said that the authorities should get to the bottom of allegations involving both presidential aide Woo and prosecutor Lee. He did not comment on whether he thought Woo should resign.By Yeo Jun-suk","corruption scandal of presidential ,scandal of presidential aide ,dae denounces alleged leak ,corruption allegations surrounding senior ,reviewing corruption allegations surrounding","['Lee Seok - su', 'Woo Byung - woo']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44796124  0.28644469

356,356,[Reporter’s Column] When words fail to deliver,"After 3 1/2 years in office, President Park Geun-hye is still often faced by considerable disapproval over her rigid way of speech, but then again, eloquence may be the least of the numerous qualifications required of a state leader.It is, in fact, the integrity of the embedded message that essentially matters, as does the accuracy of the stated facts -- both values the president appears to have failed to embrace on ...","After 3 1/2 years in office, President Park Geun-hye is still often faced by considerable disapproval over her rigid way of speech, but then again, eloquence may be the least of the numerous qualifications required of a state leader.It is, in fact, the integrity of the embedded message that essentially matters, as does the accuracy of the stated facts -- both values the president appears to have failed to embrace on a number of occasions.Most recently at the heart of public contention was Park’s Aug. 15 Liberation Day address, marking South Korea’s 71st anniversary of independence from 35 years of Japanese colonial rule.Content aside, the speech was primarily criticized for two reasons -- one was her erroneous statement of a major historical event and the other a purported denial of the legitimacy of the independence movement.“Today is a historical day, marking the 71st anniversary of National Liberation Day as well as the 68th year of the nation’s foundation day,” was how Park started off her address.This was a reiteration from last year’s corresponding address which contained the exact same sentence, only with one added to the respective figures. YonhapThe opposition’s claim is that referring to Aug. 15, 1948, as the birth of modern South Korea stands at odds with the Constitutional Law, which states that the nation found its roots in the March 1 Independence Movement in 1919.The partisan feud peaked when Moon Jae-in, former chairman and top-ranking presidential hopeful of The Minjoo Party of Korea, denounced the president’s comment as “ahistorical, unconstitutional and silly.”The ruling Saenuri Party immediately shot back that the official establishment of the Republic of Korea was in 1948 and that the opposition was trying to politicize the issue as they have no intention to disregard the de facto government.It was amid such quarrelling that the president publicly lost face to a senior independence fighter who blamed her for distorting history and undermining the independence uprising against Japan during a presidential luncheon.“ not only counters the Constitution but also dismisses our history,’ Kim Young-kwan, a 92-year-old former independence fighter, calmly but resolutely told the president.The outspoken remark made last Friday as part of his thank you speech for the event, neither received a relevant response from whom it addressed, nor discouraged her from making the disputed address three days later.Her stance hence triggered backlash, as well as suspicions that by brushing aside the independence movement, she was trying to defend her father, late President Park Chung-hee, who had largely been pro-Japanese.The fact that Park did not mention a word about the wartime sex slaves during the ceremony commemorating Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule added to such speculations.In addition, the president came under fire once more for wrongly stating, during the same disputed address, that renowned independence fighter Ahn Jung-geun died in Harbin, instead of Lushun Prison where he passed away later in 1910 after assassinating a ranking Japanese official.Her denouncement of the “self-deprecating” generation -- most likely referring to the youth -- and emphasis on the “can-do” spirit may have been well-received by older supporters but was heavily criticized and even parodied by others.Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk may have a point in arguing that the president’s words should not be stretched beyond their literal meaning.But what the presidential office should also remember is that those precise words have been delivered by the state leader, whose authority has been bestowed by the Constitution and whose responsibility is to suggest a vision to the nation. Liberation Day is the only one of five national holidays on which the president delivers a congratulatory address.On this occasion, it should not be farfetched for people to hope that they receive a message of inspiration, pride and unity from the Blue House rather than one loaded with political motive, division and errors.By Bae Hyun-jung","disapproval over her rigid ,after years in office ,considerable disapproval over her ,both values the president ,years in office president",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47811759  0.21844125

""North Korea should first face up to the reality that the international community denounces Pyongyang's nuclear and missile provocations.""Inter-Korean ties have further deteriorated since North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket in the following month.So far this year, the North has fired off numerous ballistic missiles, including six intermediate-range Musudan missiles, which can theoretically fly as far as the U.S. territory of Guam.Since Seoul and Washington agreed in July to place a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on the mountainous southern county of Seongju, North Korea has vowed to take unspecific ""counteractions"" against the move.Analysts said that North Korea is likely to make another provocation ahead of joint annual military drills between Seoul and Washington slated for late this month.","wednesday condemned president park ,wednesday condemned president ,on wednesday condemned president ,korea on wednesday condemned ,condemned president park geun","['North Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Park', 'North Korea']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46297336  0.56489688

He has also overseen the comprehensive government plan to fight the fine dust.Cheong Wa Dae explained that Cho has ample knowledge and ability to coordinate on overall government policies including the environment sector.“We expect Cho to closely cooperate with other ministries to harmoniously resolve pending issues such as climate change and fine dust, as well as creating future growth engines such as environment friendly energy towns,” it added.

Their campaign against the so-called “Hell Joseon” mentality has prompted criticism from the younger generation, liberal-minded opposition lawmakers and their backers. They counter that the government fails to understand public frustration over worsening income disparity and youth unemployment.Hell Joseon is a term that compares Korea to a feudal kingdom where social hierarchy is so entrenched that young people feel deprived of the opportunity to climb up the social ladder.President Park Geun-hye walks by political leaders during a ceremony to mark the Liberation Day on Monday at Sejong Center for Performing Arts in Seoul. In a speech on Tuesday marking Liberation Day, President Park urged people to steer their mindset beyond “self-depreciation” about their lives and toward “positive energy” that she said has brought Korea economic prosperity.“There are some newly coined words popular with the public. They are designed to ignore our proud modern history and cast Korea as a hard place to live,” said Park. “Self-depreciation and pessimism will never bring us development,” she said. According to a poll released in July by the Seoul-based job-hunting portal Job Korea, almost 90 percent of respondents said they view the country as Hell Joseon. Among them, college students aged between 20 and 29 are the most critical. In a move to dispel such widespread pessimism, the president cited Korea’s miraculous economic success during the 1970s and ’80s, otherwise known as the “Miracle of the Han River,” as an example to show “how great Korea is and how resilient Koreans are.” Her appeal was echoed by the Saenuri Party. Its newly elected leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who often depicts his political rise as a rag-to-riches story, suggested that people should take pride in the country’s achievements. The party is planning to launch a campaign to boost patriotism. Its concerted move is thought to be its typical platform, as it highlights the positive aspects of the country’s modern history marred by dictatorship and oppression, attributing economic achievements to the legacy of late President Park Chung-hee, the father of Park.The conservative-leaning move was supported by other Saenuri Party members.“I don’t think even the fellow party members who are young grasp exactly what the government has being doing ,” said Yoo Chang-soo, a 42-year-old Saenuri official who was elected last Tuesday as a member of the party’s Supreme Council. “The president’s remarks reflect her willingness to address this issue,” he said.But the opposition parties dismissed the president’s appeal as an anachronistic move, arguing that the approach is empty political rhetoric that does not lay out any concrete measures to analyze and improve the pessimistic prospects of the nation. “ was just an old-fashioned approach,” said the People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won. “The speech only reminded us of the time when late president Park pushed his agenda during his tenure,” he said. Kim Man-Heum, a political pundit who heads the Korean Academy of Politics and Leadership, agreed. “Instead of simply instilling hope and optimism into people’s minds, the president should have told them exactly what she can do and how she will address their frustration,” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk","minded opposition lawmakers ,attack on widespread pessimistic ,minded opposition lawmakers and ,perspective harms public morale ,opposition lawmakers and their","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party ’s']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.66193801  0.05505228

Kim Jin-tae, the top court nominee said that the National Security Law has a role to play, particularly at the time of a continuing military standoff between the two Koreas.Kim, currently a professor at Seoul National University's School of Law, noted that through a set of past revisions to the law, concerns about the pitfalls in its interpretation and enforcement have been ""considerably"" reduced. Critics argue the law could be arbitrarily interpreted to undermine people's basic rights. Under the law, South Koreans are barred from supporting or praising the North. They are also banned from joining a pro-Pyongyang organization or having unauthorized contact with the communist state.On the issue of the so-called ""conscientious objectors"" who refuse to join the military based on their religious beliefs, the nominee said that the nation should explore ways to comprehensively protect the objectors' freedom."" should ponder harmonious solutions between the freedom of conscience and a military duty,"" he said. ""Based on national consensus,  should actively consider opening ways  to carry out alternative services  with a rigorous screening process and conditions.""Throwing his weight behind the abolition of the death penalty, Kim pointed to the possibility of misjudgment in court proceedings.But he stressed that measures to prevent any side effects from the abolition should be crafted.Although South Korea keeps the death penalty, it has not carried out any executions since 1997 -- the reason why Amnesty International, a global human rights watchdog, has classified the country as ""abolitionist in practice.""The National Assembly is set to hold a confirmation hearing for Kim on Thursday.

However, its extensive range of regulation and murky details is still causing confusion among the general public.Below are some of the key questions and answers. An official enters the office of a team preparing for the effectuation of the antigraft law at the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission office in Sejong city. Q. How and why was this law legislated?A. It was in June 2011 that the original draft was motioned by then-ACRC chairperson and former Supreme Court justice Kim Young-ran, from whom the byname of the bill was initiated. The concept of the bill had started off from the recognition that the conventional bribery clauses in the Criminal Law were insufficient to curb the rampant customs of providing valuables or services to public officials in exchange of other benefits. It also reflected the widening public rage over a series of high-profile corruption cases in 2010-2011, in which ranking prosecutors turned out to have received expensive gifts or cash from legal brokers. But due to disputes over the scope of the application, the bill had been stalled for years. It was the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014 that drew attention to the lax public administration system and consequently rekindled the talks on the antisolicitation bill.Q. Who are subjected to the bill?A. Government officials as defined by the Government Officials Act and the Local Officials Act, along with executive and staff members of public service-related organizations, educational institutions, and media companies are subjected to the law. The spouses of the corresponding officials are also subject to the regulation. As of February this year, the aggregated pool involved some 4 million people and 39,965 organizations. Despite the protest that the bill violates the principle of excessive prohibition by including media employees and teachers, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of it, clearing the way for its effectuation.Q. What are the sanctions?A. Those who have received valuables worth 1 million won  or less are to be handed down a fine of maximum five times the received amount. When the amount of the valuable exceeds 1 million won, both the giver and the receiver are to face a maximum jail term of three years or a maximum fine of 30 million won. The former case requires a business connection between the two counterparts, while the latter does not. In case of illicit solicitation, the corresponding sanctions are either a maximum jail term of two years or a fine of 20 million won. Under dual liability, even the employer of the violators may face an equal level of financial penalty. Also, the law’s enforcement ordinance places a ceiling of 30,000 won, 50,000 won and 100,000 won for meal, gift, and condolence or congratulatory cash gifts, respectively.Q. How does one report cases of violation?A. Anyone can file a report. Reports may be submitted to one’s affiliated organization, investigation agencies, the Board of Audit and Inspection, and the ACRC. Related proof is required so as to prevent false reports. Monetary reward is to be paid out to those who have handed in reports that are related to public interests.Q. Does the subject pool include foreign teachers, non-teaching director of educational foundations, newspaper printing staff? Are lawmakers bound by the same level of restrictions as any other officials?A. Yes, the sanction clauses are to be applied regardless of nationality, position, or rank. The same is for lawmakers, though there is an exceptional clause that exempts elected officials when it comes to listening civil complaints within the range of socially accepted rules.Q. What if a teacher, after receiving a present worth 500,000 won from a parent, donates it to an orphanage?A. He or she would still face sanctions. Also, the intention of the law is to punish the illicit transition of valuables, regardless of its use or disposal afterwards.Q. What if a media chief editor, senior government official and conglomerate executive member, who are all alumni and longtime friends, met for dinner and the conglomerate executive picked up the tab?A. The regulation is to be applied just the same, as long as there is a job function connection between the participants. But if, for example, the government official belonged to the Health Ministry and the conglomerate member to a semiconductor company, leaving little possibility for mutual business transactions, the occasion may be excluded from the subject of the law’s application.Q. What if a public official received, from someone with a job relation, 50,000 won in congratulatory money and a wreath worth 70,000 won, each amount within the given amount ceiling?A. The official would still face sanctions as in such cases, the amount of the wreath is to be added up with that of the cash, totaling at 120,000 won. Also, when the giver has offered 100,000 won as personal condolence money and another 100,000 won in his company’s name, the two categories are to be summed up. But legal circles have been calling for more flexibility concerning congratulations and condolences. When it comes to actual goods, however, the rule is to be applied strictly. For example, if an official was offered a meal worth 100,000 won from a company director and received a gift worth 500,000 won from its chairman, the subject amount would be 600,000 won due to the correlation between the two activities. Also, in this case, the corresponding company will be facing a fine for lack of supervisory duty.For further details or individual case studies, one may contact the ACRC or the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The KCCI said earlier this month that it kicked off a special task force, consisting of lawyers from six representative law firms, to provide consultations concerning the antisolicitation law and ask for the authoritative interpretation of the ACRC when necessary. The service will be available until January next year.By Bae Hyun-jung","corruption and civil ,september 28 guidebooks have ,is still causing confusion ,improper solicitation and graft ,regulation and murky details","['the Improper Solicitation', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41506392  0.55870354

Cheong Wa DaeBut felons and political offenders, especially those convicted for corruption charges, were not included in the list.The minister’s announcement was delivered shortly after an extraordinary Cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae.The pardons were part of the nation’s celebration of the 71st anniversary of independence from Japan’s colonial rule.Among the beneficiaries was Lee Jay-hyun, the chairman of the nation’s largest food and entertainment conglomerate CJ Group, who also suffers from a rare disease of the nervous system.“I have based my  decision on the opinions of all levels of society, seeking to promote national unity and economic recovery,” the president said in her opening speech at the Cabinet meeting.“The intention was to help small-sized merchants resume their way of living.”Park also said on Thursday, during a meeting with senior secretaries, that the current economic challenges are pressing upon the lives of the people, alluding to an extensive range of pardons for petty crimes.Her remarks were largely in answer to Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the newly elected chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party and also one of her closest confidants, who had called for “large-scale” pardons for convicts of minor economic crimes.But other imprisoned or paroled businessmen -- such as Hanwha chairman Kim Seung-yeon, SK Group executive vice chairman Chey Jae-won and LIG Nex1 vice chairman Koo Bon-sang -- were left out.Regarding the disputed pardon for the allegedly ailing conglomerate chief, the government cited medical experts’ concerns about Lee’s deteriorating health conditions.By Bae Hyun-jung","pardons to 876 convicts ,friday granted special pardons ,800 convicts including high ,president park geun hye ,park pardons ailing cj","['Park Geun', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2165492   0.4204959

The pardons are part of celebrations to mark the 71st anniversary of Korea's independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. South Korean presidents usually grant special pardons in commemoration of major national holidays.Regarding the pardon for the ailing CJ chairman, the government said that the decision was made in consideration of views by experts that it would be difficult to carry out his jail sentence due to his deteriorating health. "" was included on the pardon list based on humanitarian considerations and to offer him a chance to contribute to the nation's economy,"" the government said in a press release. Last year, the business tycoon was given two and a half years in jail, along with a fine of 25.2 billion won , for embezzlement, breach of trust and tax evasion.The pardon list did not include other convicted business leaders such as Hanhwa chairman Kim Seung-yeon, SK Group Vice Chairman Chey Jae-won and LIG NEX1 Vice Chairman Koo Bon-sang.Politicians and civil servants, who were convicted of corruption, were also excluded from the list, the government said, stressing that the pardons this time were carried out in a ""restrictive"" way that the general populace can agree to.The president also offered pardons to 1.42 million people who have been given penalty points or had their driving licenses suspended for traffic offenses between July 13 last year and July 12 this year. Those who were penalized for drunk driving, road rage, hit-and-runs and deadly traffic accidents were excluded from the pardon list.Civic groups showed mixed reactions over Park's special pardons, while business circles largely welcomed them.Ko Kye-hyun, the secretary-general of the local civic group Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice positively evaluated the pardons, saying that they would serve the purpose of promoting national integration.""As the pardons were mostly for those running small businesses or those convicted of livelihood-related crimes, it serves the purpose of revitalizing the economy,"" he said in a statement.But Ahn Jin-geol, co-secretary-general of the liberal People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, denounced the decision to set free the CJ chairman, pointing to the ""serious"" crimes he committed.The Federation of Korean Industries, meanwhile, welcomed the pardons to some of the convicted businesspeople, expressing hope that the pardons would become an opportunity to breathe fresh life into the country's economy.A day earlier, new ruling Saenuri Party leader Lee Jung-hyun called on Park to offer ""large-scale"" pardons to those convicted of minor economic crimes so as to give them another chance to contribute to the country's economic growth.","870 people president park ,crimes on friday three ,people president park geun ,extraordinary cabinet meeting park ,president park geun hye","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'yonhap)among', 'CJ Group', 'Lee Jay - hyun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2845329   0.7835412

Earlier this week, the Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office charged the six, including the former CEO surnamed Moon, for allegedly providing money or other kickbacks known in the industry as rebates to doctors in exchange for prescribing its products.A total of 23 people, including six publishers of medical publications and doctors, have also been indicted on charges of engaging in kickback-related deals, such as receiving illegal payments, the sources said.Moon and other executives allegedly provided doctors with money and other forms of financial support through medical journals, the sources said.  Novartis Korea, however, rejected the allegations of being aware of such illegal acts, arguing that unfair trade practices were committed by only a small number of executives.Earlier, the government declared war against the long-running illegal practice in a bid to ease the financial burden of patients and reduce price ballooning. The prosecution has since indicted executives from local pharmaceutical firms and doctors in line with the government's efforts.Novartis AG produces medicines for such diseases as hypertension, leukemia, dementia, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.","illegal kickbacks to doctors ,executives indicted for illegal ,indicted for illegal rebates ,illegal rebates six incumbent ,of providing illegal kickbacks","['south korean', 'swiss', 'Novartis', ""the Seoul Western District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Moon']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.08765849 -0.00274928

Lee Jung-hyun, the newly elected chairman of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, may have vowed an end to factionalism and regionalism, but his obvious intimacy with President Park Geun-hye is expected to deepen the crack between the pro-presidential and non-Park cliques.While the pro-Park group set to tighten its bond with Cheong Wa Dae during what remains of Park’s term in office, the fringe group is expected to struggle for power recovery, especially with next year’s presidential election in mind. Rep. Lee Jung-hyun attends the ruling Saenuri Party's Supreme Council meeting on Wednesday, the day after being elected as chairman. “One would be unqualified as a ruling party lawmaker if  thinks that standing up to the president and to the government is the equivalent of justice,” said Rep. Lee on Wednesday.His remarks came during a meeting with Kim Jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, who visited the party’s headquarters to deliver the president’s congratulatory message in person. The former presidential secretary for public affairs thereby expressed disapproval of those who do not align themselves with the president, urging for stronger ties between the Blue House and ruling party.Such a gesture of support for President Park was also taken as the new party chief putting pressure on the non-Park group’s presidential hopefuls, including former party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and returned defector Rep. Yoo Seong-min.It is consequently U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose bid in the 2017 presidential race as a pro-Park figure is largely anticipated, who is likely to benefit from Lee’s tight grip over the non-Park rivals.Rep. Lee, despite skeptical views on his political equity, vowed to stand against factional agendas.“From this moment onward, there can be no factions whatever in the Saenuri Party,” he said at the party‘s national convention Tuesday in his acceptance speech.While the pro-Park cliques focused on the new chairman’s forte, such as his rare position as a re-elected Saenuri lawmaker in the progressive-leaning Jeolla region, dissenters pointed out his lack of communication and unconditional loyalty for the state leader.Backing up such concerns, Rep. Lee had come under fire earlier this year for attempting to censor news broadcasting in favor of the presidential office.A voice record file released by former KBS broadcasting chief Kim Shi-gon in late June showed that Lee, who was Cheong Wa Dae’s press secretary in 2014, had demanded KBS revise its media coverage on the Sewol ferry sinking.Following the ferry tragedy, which left more than 300 dead or missing, the lackluster rescue operation by the now-defunct Korea Coast Guard sparked public anger and led to the breakup of the organization. It also triggered criticism of the government’s lack of proper disaster management capacity.“The KBS report  will make people think that this incident took place because of the KCG,” Lee was quoted as saying.He also said, according to the voice file, the president “happened to have watched” KBS on the corresponding evening, demanding the broadcaster tone down its coverage of the issue.By Bae Hyun-jung","the newly elected chairman ,ruling conservative saenuri party ,park ally to reopen ,with president park geun ,between the pro presidential","['Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'non - park', 'Park ’s']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55331075  0.50658077

The last meeting between her and the party leader took place on Dec. 7, 2014 when former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung steered the party. Lee was also visited by Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won, who brought along a congratulatory orchid from the president. The two shared views on how to cooperate in the future.New Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun  receives a congratulatory orchid from Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Kim Jae-won at the party’s headquarters on Wednesday. Lee, a third-termer representing a progressive-leaning constituency in Jeolla Province, was elected party leader in a contest between the faction close to President Park and its dissenters. Lee, often viewed as the standard bearer of pro-Park faction, defeated runner-up Rep Joo ho-young by a margin of about 12,000 votes in a party electorate of 69,817. In his acceptance speech, Lee vowed to express himself and deliver the party’s opinion “quickly and accurately” to Cheong Wa Dae, who has been criticized for its lack of efforts to communicate with political parties when pushing for contentious initiatives such as welfare reform. He reiterated the same message Wednesday, saying “If Cheong Wa Dae and the government heads in the wrong direction, we would tell them about it. We will criticize or cooperate with them depending on the situation.” The Saenuri Party’s previous leadership had often suffered from a strained relationship with the presidential office. Most notably, former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min often voiced dissent over the president’s policies, leading him to resign from his positon. Meanwhile, the new leadership is planning to deny the members of the Supreme Council an opportunity to speak during the council meeting broadcasted by media outlets in a move to singularize the party’s message. Saenuri Party secretariat Park Myeong-jae said that the party chairman and floor leader would be the only ones to make public remarks. Previously, members of the Supreme Council were allowed to speak freely so that the media could report unscripted versions of dissenting opinions. “The plan aims to reveal the party’s coordinated position on the issue where party members are divided,” Park said.

Lee Jung-hyun began his political career in 1985 by joining the Democratic Justice Party, South Korea’s ruling party, where he was a rank-and-file member from 1980 to 1988. He then joined the Saenuri Party’s precursor Grand National Party and won his first lawmaker’s seat in 2008 through proportional representation.  Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the newly-elected leader of Saenuri Party, speaks while campaigning for the ruling party leadership last Wednesday in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. Lee came into the spotlight after running in the 2012 election as a conservative candidate representing the liberal stronghold Gwangju. Though he was defeated by a narrow margin, his bid was hailed as a rare attempt to break the nation’s entrenched regionalism. Although without a parliamentary seat, Lee secured himself a solid place in the party by acting as a trusted mouthpiece for then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye. His humble manner, candor and close relations with the media helped Park through a number of campaign struggles.In 2013, he was appointed as senior presidential secretary for political affairs, and afterwards, served as the senior secretary for public relations until he ran in the 2014 by-election. He was elected in South Jeolla Province, becoming the first conservative politician to be elected in the southern region since 1985. The 57-year-old politician is viewed as a staunch loyalist to President Park and this has often put him in the hot seat. In June, Lee was accused of having attempted to manipulate a public broadcaster’s coverage about the Sewol tragedy in favor of the government. By Yeo Jun-suk","hyun the newly elected ,his first lawmaker seat ,party new leader rep ,won his first lawmaker ,lawmaker seat in 2008","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'the Democratic Justice Party', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Grand National Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenu']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40129709  0.75512969

Lee Jung-hyun, a standout loyalist of President Park Geun-hye, was elected Tuesday as the new chairman to lead the ruling Saenuri Party, reconfirming the formidable grip of the president, despite her looming lame-duck period, and paving the way for her faction to lead the party through next year’s presidential election.Lee’s rise to leadership also marked the conservative party’s first-ever chairman to be born and based in the nation’s progressive-leaning southwestern region.With Lee at the helm, presidential hopefuls considered close to Park -- namely U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- are likely to get a boost in their anticipated bids. Other potential candidates such as former chairman Kim Moo-sung, ex-whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min and former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, on the other hand, are likely to face a tougher journey toward party nomination.  President Park Geun-hye reaches out to shake hands with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who later won the chairmanship at the party’s convention in Jamsil, Seoul, Tuesday. “It is with a heavy sense of responsibility, rather than joy, that I hereby accept the Saenuri Party’s chairman position,” said Lee at Jamsil Indoor Gymnasium, where the party’s national convention was held.The party’s national convention was its first since this year’s April 13 general election defeat and its fourth since the name change from Grand National Party to the current Saenuri Party in February 2012. The day’s events included an internal election to select a new chairman and a five-member Supreme Council.Lee was elected through a nationwide in-party vote, combined with public polls. Some 69,817 electorate members voted prior on Sunday, while some 9,100 representative officials cast their ballots at the scene of the national convention.Along with Lee, five Supreme Council members were elected -- Reps. Cho Won-jin, Lee Jang-woo, Kang Seok-ho, Choi Yeon-hye and Yoo Chang-soo, a majority of which were based in the conservative stronghold Daegu and Gyeongsang provinces.“From this moment, there can be no faction whatever within the party,” the chairman-elect said, urging the party to leave factional feuds behind and move forward. Lee will be joined by already-elected reformist floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.Lee became the party’s first official chairman since the general election in which the Saenuri Party suffered a crushing defeat, temporarily giving away a parliamentary majority to opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party. Since June, the party has been steered by an interim leadership, with nonparty member and former Constitutional Court justice Kim Hee-ok as chief.With his two-year term as chairman, it is Lee who will be leading the party into the nation’s 19th presidential election, which is slated for December 2017.“I will single out presidential candidates who may survive the tight race and assume the nation’s future power,” Lee said.He also pledged to fix the current candidate nomination system, alluding to the party’s nomination feuds during the run-up to the April race. Amid deepening strife between the pro-presidential nomination committee and nonmainstream leadership, a number of nomination dropouts chose to defect from the party.His leadership also assumes greater power upon a change in party regulations that bestows higher authority to the chairman, rather than sharing power with the Supreme Council members.Lee’s win followed an appearance and speech by President Park earlier in the day, which was widely seen as a move to support her former senior secretary.“The role of the incoming leadership is to make sure the nation does not falter or split,” Park said in her opening speech, urging the party to end factional brawls and to regain public trust.Lee’s “reformative” pledge, meanwhile, has already faced some skepticism, as many attributed the factional divide to the pro-Park clique’s monopolization of power in the first place.“Those who should take responsibility  are once again reaching out for power, turning a deaf ear to the people’s warning,” said Rep. Joo Ho-young, who came second to Lee in the chairmanship race. Joo, who was seen to represent the non-Park faction, was tailed by Reps. Lee Ju-young and Han Sun-kyo.Having left the party following candidacy exclusion and then making his return to the party afterwards, Rep. Joo is seen as a symbol of the party’s reformist group and a victim to factional fighting.By Bae Hyun-jung","hye was elected tuesday ,next year presidential election ,elected tuesday as the ,party first ever chairman ,elected tuesday","['Lee Jung - hyun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4978576   0.39171129

They also fear that their hometown could become a military target in case of an armed conflict on the peninsula.Some opposition politicians and scholars have also voiced their opposition, arguing that the deployment would strain ties with China and Russia, which argue that THAAD would undermine regional stability and their security interests.During her speech, Park also pointed out that some politicians are trapped in an ""ideological and partisan"" mindset even at a time when the communist country is threatening South Korea by advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities.","curb thaad criticism president ,hye on tuesday stepped ,criticism president park geun ,fostering antagonism among citizens ,criticism president park","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07133618  0.51517504

The government has refused to ease restrictions on the mapping service unless Google censors sensitive installations. Relevant agencies meet with the Internet giant on Aug. 12. “If the government does a special favor , it will be violating its own laws and principles,” said Rep. Shin Cheol-yeon of the People’s Party on Aug 4. The opposition parties are planning to raise their objections to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, which overseas mapping policy. The debate over map data has come to the fore as smartphone users in South Korea are unable to play “Pokemon Go,” a GPS-based augmented reality game that invites users to roam the streets to capture virtual monsters.Popular augmented reality smartphone game “Pokemon Go” was able to operate aboard a cruise boat traveling on the sea near southern city Ulsan on July 27. The city government said it would hold an event to capture Pokemon every evening on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. YonhapThough the game’s developer and distributor Niantic, a spin-off from Google’s parent Alphabet, has yet to specify the reasons for not making the game available here, industry watchers speculate it is because full-fledged services of Google Maps are not available. South Korea is one of the few places in the world where the mapping service is restricted. Google claims it needs to export Korea’s map information to offer signature functions such as 3-D maps, walking and driving directions and car navigation features.But the government refuted the argument, suggesting the GPS-based mobile game does not require detailed geographic information to operate properly. “The launch of ‘Pokemon Go’ in South Korea has nothing to do with Google’s request for map data,” an official said. According to South Korean law related to management of map data, geographic information is prohibited from being released overseas without the authorization of the president and transport minister, or a consensus among heads of government agencies dealing with security issues.The exception clause was included in 2014 as part of President Park Geun-hye’s deregulation initiative aimed at improving innovation in business. Encouraged by the amendment, Google last month made a request to the Transport Ministry to access the country’s map information.But the outcome of the negotiations -- with a decision expected to be announced after the meeting on Aug. 12 -- remains to be seen, as the government has offered a counterproposal that bothers Google: removal of sensitive facilities in South Korea from the company’s global map images. The government has insisted images of key facilities, such as the presidential office and military units, be either blurred or camouflaged because the nation is still technically at war with North Korea and needs to protect itself from potential security threats.Google, however, has said South Korea cannot be treated differently from other nations. The Internet company noted that the Google Maps’ geographic images are virtually the same in all nations and that changing the system in favor of South Korea would pose difficulties. Google’s domestic competitors have mostly criticized the move. Lee Hae-jin, chairman of South Korea’s leading search engine Naver, urged Google to abide by Korean law, comparing the U.S. company’s request to an attempt to engage in “unfair” business practices. “The point is to ask  to place its server in South Korea, not to block its service altogether,” said the chairman at a press conference on July 15. “Google’s technology is advanced enough to run its server here. Just asking the government to change the law doesn’t make sense when they failed to meet their obligations as a business firm,” he said. Google Maps divides up the world into rhombus-shaped cells. Under this system, the northeastern tip of South Korea -- including Sokcho and Ulleungdo Island -- are categorized as part of North Korean territory, allowing “Pokemon Go” to be played there. Eager to play the game, South Korean Pokemon fans and game enthusiasts have flocked to Sokcho since July. If the game officially launches in Japan, South Koreans may be able to access the service in the southeastern city of Busan as well, industry watchers said.By Yeo Jun-suk","government parties resist google ,parties resist google map ,parties resist google ,resist google map push ,resist google map","['south korean', 'Google ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49340394  0.05097668

The president thereby referred directly to the six first-termers of The Minjoo Party of Korea who flew to Beijing on Monday for a three-day visit, despite criticism not only from Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, but also from within their own party leadership.The group, led by China expert Rep. Kim Young-ho, pledged to meet with Chinese officials and scholars to discuss Seoul and Washington’s joint plan to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in the southern part of the peninsula by year 2017.The Minjoo Party’s leadership has not confirmed its official stance on the issue but its ranking members, including interim chief Rep. Kim Chong-in, have been expressing dissent over the visit.Kim noted that the group of Minjoo lawmakers, by conveying their opposition to the government’s decision, will encourage the Chinese media to continue its objections.The latest remarks by Park and her team showed Cheong Wa Dae displaying a change in its disposition, taking on a more aggressive tone from the previous week.“By saying that they should reach out to China and take the matter in their own hands,  show that they have no understanding of the diplomatic efforts the government has made so far,” the president said.Her remarks echoed the address made by her senior secretary for public affairs over the weekend.“No matter what their true intention is, their visit will eventually reinforce China’s stance and intensify our internal divide,” senior presidential press secretary Kim Sung-woo told reporters Sunday.Presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk said last Thursday: “The Foreign Ministry will make the due measures, if necessary,” concerning the rising level of criticism over THAAD by some of China’s state-affiliated newspapers.The president also reconfirmed her will to push ahead with the THAAD deployment by any means.“Every day, I face fierce protests, but I am ready to take blame at any level if only to protect the people who have chosen me as their president,” Park said.“I ask that the political circles, too, cooperate in safeguarding the nation and the people.”By Bae Hyun-jung","dismissed chinese media criticism ,park bashes opposition over ,also dismissed chinese media ,visit to china president ,dismissed chinese media","['Park Geun - hye', 'China', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'North Korea ’s']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50862885  0.28046739

YonhapThe program provides some 3,000 selected young people, who have lived in Seoul for more than a year and work less than 30 hours a week among those aged between 19 and 29, with 500,000 won  per month for up to six months.But the ministry ordered the municipality to take back the money distributed to 2,831 applicants, maintaining the municipal government failed to seek “agreement” from the ministry and thus violated legal guidelines on policy setting.The ministry has long opposed the program, saying it does not constitute a “fundamental solution” to youth unemployment. The ministry said that such a measure creates “moral hazards” among the youth by making them dependent on free cash. Seoul City, on the other hand, argued it has “discussed” the youth support program with the ministry for the past six months, which gives ample legal ground for the municipality to push the policy. The municipality said it does not need to seek “approval” or “permission” from the central government according to law. An association of Seoul district chiefs also condemned the welfare ministry for “violating local autonomy” stipulated in the Constitution in a press release on Sunday, further calling for the withdrawal of its decision.  The young generation, too, voiced opposition over the ministry’s decision, which they saw as a gesture of “distrust.”“Young people need social trust and public support in order to endure hardships and make a leap forward,” said youth rights organization Min Snail Union.By Ock Hyun-ju","city government said sunday ,dismisses the petition seoul ,court dismisses the petition ,petition seoul city will ,week against the ministry","['Seoul City', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare ’s']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5815028  -0.09201092

The program also includes an after-school program for elementary school children to support working mothers.The government currently offers 400,000 won  per employee to each company that has the flextime system in place. The president has said she would consider increasing the amount to 600,000 won.In June, Park visited Air Korea Ltd., an affiliate of South Korea's Hanjin Group conglomerate that boasts a comprehensive program, including the flextime system.

The election is slated for next Tuesday. President of South Korea, Park Geun-hye ""The planned meeting is intended to listen to public views on state affairs, ,"" presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk told reporters.A former Saenuri leader criticized Park's plan to meet lawmakers as the ""wrong"" move.""I think her pursuit of a meeting with lawmakers from a particular region ahead of the party convention is wrong,"" Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters. Kim who has been at odds with the president has been seen as trying to build up his own support base within the party ahead of next year's presidential race.During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the commander-in-chief said that she would make active efforts to address complaints from the residents in the southern town of Seongju, the site where Seoul and Washington have agreed to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery.Photo taken April 14, shows presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk speaking during a press conference at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. Residents in the town have strongly opposed the deployment plan, concerned that THAAD's powerful radar system could pose health risks and hurt their agricultural crops. Seoul officials have called such concerns misplaced.Strong opposition also comes from those who are worried about the possible negative impact of the deployment on the relations with China and Russia that argue THAAD would escalate regional military tensions and hurt their security interests.","meeting with lawmakers unrelated ,leadership race the presidential ,dae on wednesday dismissed ,park meeting with lawmakers ,dismissed suspicion that president","['Cheong', 'Dae', 'Park Geun', ""Saenuri Party 's"", 'Dae', 'Daegu', 'North Gyeongsang Province']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49806374  0.18080941

The “Kim Young-ran Act,” named after the former head of the nation’s anticorruption watchdog, will place a ban on public officials, journalists and school staff from receiving monetary benefits from those related to their job function. Political parties have been suggesting that the president ease some of the restrictions set by the law through ordinances. She did not, however, mention feud-ridden senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo, once again bypassing the high demand from the opposition for his dismissal, or an imminent Cabinet reshuffle speculated to take place this week.Presiding over a Cabinet meeting on the second day of her return from summer leave, Park reconfirmed the decision by Seoul and Washington to install a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.“I feel torn by anxiety that conflicts should persist over the THAAD deployment, while North Korea is continuing to improve its nuclear and missile capacity,” the president said.She thus addressed the residents of North Gyeongsang city Seongju, who have opposed the deployment, citing health and environmental risks.“It was based on thorough spot inspections and simulations that we selected Seongju as the ideal station for THAAD, but distorted stories and groundless rumors have been threatening the foundation of our national security,” she said.“If we fail to take such basic defensive steps as the THAAD deployment, how may we safeguard the safety of our nation and of our people?”Reminding the audience that she lost her parents in an “excruciating painful” experience, Park claimed her only remaining mission is to protect the country from threats, one of which is the communist neighbor’s military provocations. Park’s parents, former President Park Chung-hee and first lady Yuk Young-su, were assassinated in 1979 and 1974, respectively.Park also pushed the parliament to pass the government’s supplementary budget bill to input some 11 trillion won  into corporate restructuring and job creation.“Should this supplementary budget bill, which may help create up to 68,000 new jobs, fail to effectuate in time, it is the workers who will take the full blow of restructuring,” Park said.By Bae Hyun-jung","the president also urged ,antigraft law president park ,hye on tuesday reiterated ,tuesday reiterated her call ,geun hye on tuesday","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37435365  0.97740215

It will also slap a 41-percent tax on individuals with an annual income above 500 million won.Minjoo said its revision plan mainly centers on placing more burden on the upper brackets while providing more benefits to low-income earners.Accordingly, the main opposition said it aims to give more tax benefits and subsidies to low-incomers as well as small businesses.""The government has been seeking to bolster economic growth through tax-cuts for the rich, which has ended in failure,"" Rep.

Presiding over a Cabinet meeting, the commander-in-chief reiterated that the decision by Seoul and Washington to deploy a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery to the southern town of Seongju was one that was made based on ""long deliberations and exhaustive reviews.""""I am apprehensive that  are spreading various kinds of strange and groundless rumors rather than scientific evidence that has been clearly proven, and that these tales are shaking the foundation of security,"" she said.President Park Geun-hye speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Aug. 2. ""If we cannot take basic defensive steps such as the deployment of THAAD, how can we safeguard the well-being of the nation and its people?"" Noting that she lost her parents in ""excruciatingly painful"" ways, Park stressed that ""the only mission left for her as president"" is to protect the nation and people from various types of threats posed by the communist state. Park's parents -- former President Park Chung-hee and first lady Yook Young-su -- were assassinated in 1979 and 1974, respectively.""To this end,  has been striving to persuade countries in the entire world to stop their aid to North Korea and closely cooperate with our country to make the North abandon its nuclear and missile programs,"" she said.It is the latest in a series of recent statements by the president to defend the allies' decision to deploy THAAD to Seongju. Residents in the southern town have strongly opposed the deployment plan, concerned that THAAD's powerful radar system could pose health risks and hurt their agricultural crops.Pointing to the political division over the envisioned deployment, Park underscored the need for political circles to muster up their ""wisdom and strength"" to prevent further division in the country's society. She added that division among South Koreans is what Pyongyang has sought to foment here.Pledging to ""actively"" address complaints from the residents in Seongju, the president said she will meet lawmakers and local administrative chiefs that represent Seongju and surrounding areas.Commenting on the anti-graft law, which is slated to go into force on Sept. 28, the president instructed her government to draw up measures to minimize any adverse impact on the local economy.The so-called Kim Young-ran law, named after a former head of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, aims to bring more transparency to the dealings of public officials, journalists and private school faculty.The regulations under the law make it illegal to accept meals exceeding 30,000 won , presents in excess of 50,000 won, and money for congratulations or condolences of over 100,000 won -- a reason why local businesses claim that the law would seriously dampen consumption.""The important obligation for the government at this point is to minimize its negative impact on the economy while firmly preserving the basic spirits of the law,"" Park said.","hye on tuesday renewed ,tuesday renewed her appeal ,deployment president park geun ,geun hye on tuesday ,cabinet meeting the commander","['Park Geun - hye', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'Cabinet', 'Seoul', 'Washington']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18991259  0.69531977

Over the past couple of weeks, the Justice Party has been engulfed in a heated internal division over their official stance on a recent laborer dismissal controversy involving a radical feminism online community “...","While factional strife has often dominated debate among major parties in South Korea, the nation’s minor progressive party has recently found itself embroiled in an unusual political debate here: feminism. Over the past couple of weeks, the Justice Party has been engulfed in a heated internal division over their official stance on a recent laborer dismissal controversy involving a radical feminism online community “Megalian.com.” The website has gained prominence for its harsh attack against the country’s widespread misogyny, often using vulgar or degrading words which the organizers contend is a parody of misogynistic slurs made by male members on the extreme right-wing online community, Ilbe.The controversy originally erupted when online game maker Nexon let go of its voiceover actress Kim Jae-yeon, who had caused a stir after posting a photo of herself in a feminist T-shirt sold by the Megalian, which had a print that said, “Girls do not need a prince.”Slews of protests against the photo followed from men, who are the game maker’s major customers. The company and the actress later said the dismissal was a mutual decision.The explanation, however, did little to calm the debate, fueled by the Justice Party, which on July 20 released a statement denouncing Nexon for violating the right to free speech by dismissing a laborer for her personal disposition. Justice Party chairwoman Rep. Sim Sang-jeung  “Individuals’ opinions should not be used as rationale for imposing restriction on their professional work,” the party’s Arts and Cultural Committee said in a statement. “We cannot help but regret the fact that there are those who are deprived of their right to work on such a wrongful ground,” the committee said. While the statement did not support or clarify the party’s stance on the actual controversial feminist group, the release was immediately rebuked by the party’s own members, who accused the party leadership of supporting the radical group without their consensus.The party’s website was flooded with scathing comments from some rank-and-file members who criticized the party for endorsing the extreme feminist movement. They forced the party to withdraw the statement and threatened to quit the party otherwise.“I have never been more embarrassed with our party than I am today. I’m pretty sure most defectors think that way,” an anonymous party member left a comment on Sunday. “I thought we are aiming to build the same world, but it is not the case anymore,” it said.  In a desperate move to calm the situation, the party’s leadership on Monday last week decided to withdraw the statement, saying that the comment had failed to deliver what it originally intended. The new statement did not specify whether the party still stood by what they view as “wrongful dismissal,” inviting further criticisms from its members.It is not the first time that the progressive party has split over political agenda and witnessed an exodus of its party members. In 2008, the Democratic Labor Party, which was then the only progressive party, split into two progressive groups following the failed presidential election bid and controversy over their political position toward North Korea.“It is like the 2008 division all over again. We are seeing more party members quitting than that” said the party spokesman. Though the exact number of defectors are not readily available as of Aug. 1, more than a hundred comments were inquiries about the procedure of leaving the party.The Justice Party was established in 2012 with key members who had defected from the DLP. Many of its grassroots members are comprised of either middle-aged labor union members or tech-savvy young voters in their 20s and 30s. Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University, said that the unique composition of the Justice Party is the reason why the debate over feminism is more likely to occur in progressive parties than their conservative counterparts.“The established parties mainly consist of politicians from the old generation and they are not familiar with such topics. But the younger generation cater more closely to the online community and are hence better aware of topics that make headlines there,” Kim said.By Yeo Jun-suk","controversy involving radical feminism ,radical feminism online community ,political debate here feminism ,involving radical feminism online ,recent laborer dismissal controversy","['South Korea', 'the Justice Party']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5250693   0.08130729

They denounced it as “fake compensation.”The company said the final plan was based on three rounds of talks with victims and their families, following its corporate values of “respect, fairness, transparency and accuracy.”Reckitt Benckiser head Ataur Rashid Safdar Under the final plan, Oxy will compensate up to 350 million won  to victims categorized upon government investigation as group one and two. Up to 1 billion won will be compensated for infant and child victims’ deaths due to the severity of suffering and the difficulty in calculating potential earning losses.However, victims argued that the final plan does not cover all victims as it leaves out those classified under categories three and four, whose suffering were deemed less directly connected to Oxy’s products.As of May, there were 309 victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants classified in categories three and four, compared to 221 victims in categories one and two. The scale goes from one to four, with the lowest being highly certain that health damage resulted from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants. “While more than half of victims are named in categories three and four, Oxy has not mentioned a single word about compensating them,” said Choi Ye-yong, the head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health during a press conference in Seoul on Monday.He also added that the amount suggested by Oxy is far less than what should be paid when punitive damage is applied to the company. Current Korean laws do not recognize punitive damages.Whether to pass the legislation on punitive damage has been a hot topic between rival parties as well as at the Supreme Court recently. The relevant bill is pending due to worries that it may cause double punishment for defendants.The purpose of punitive damage is to punish the defendant for misconduct and deter the defendant and others from similar misbehavior in the future. Companies may face compensation payment from two to three times more than the amount of victims’ damages.Civic groups have been arguing that the recent cases of Audi Volkswagen Korea’s emission-rigging and Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s distribution of toxic humidifier disinfectant should be punished based on punitive damages.Meanwhile, Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- released its first newspaper advertisement in local dailies on Monday.Along with an apology, the advertisement by RB Korea detailed the application process for victims to receive compensation from the company.Starting August, each victim’s case will be analyzed by Oxy to finalize the compensation amount, considering the previous and future medical costs, potential earnings lost and emotional distress.This kind of official apology by the company comes 4 years and 11 months after the first death from the use of Oxy’s toxic humidifier disinfectant.

Lee Geum-ro, the chief of the prosecution’s special team for the Nexon bribery case, announces the probe result on Friday. Jin Kyung-joon, 48, allegedly received about 920 million won  in kickbacks from Kim Jung-ju, 47, the chairman of Nexon’s holding firm NXC between 2005 and 2014, the prosecution said. It is the first time that an incumbent high-ranking prosecutor has been indicted in the prosecution’s 68-year history. The indictment comes 23 days after a special investigation team launched a probe into the vice-ministerial level prosecutor over suspected dubious stock dealings. The scandal came to light early this year after he reported a massive increase in his wealth in 2015. The prosecution suspects that Jin took 425 million won from Kim in 2005, bought Nexon’s unlisted shares with the money and sold them at 1 billion won to buy Nexon Japan’s shares in 2006. As Nexon Japan’s stock value soared in 2011 upon entering the stock market, Jin made about 12 billion won in profits through a sale of the shares. The prosecution also acquired evidence that Jin had used a company car under the name of Nexon from 2008 to 2009 and pocketed 30 million won to take over the car. Over 11 occasions between 2005-2014, he purportedly received about 50 million won from Kim for his family’s travel expenses. Jin also allegedly submitted falsified documents to the public official ethics commission from 2010 to 2015 to disguise the shares as a loan he borrowed from his mother-in-law, which the prosecution saw as obstructing justice. A series of suspected crimes that took place between 2005 and 2008 will be seen as all connected, which extends the seven-year statute of limitations for offering bribes in 2005 and gives the prosecution power to charge the Nexon founder Kim with bribery. For Jin, the 10-year statute of limitations for taking bribes runs out in November. Prosecutors said the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office will continue investigating the Nexon founder Kim over allegations of embezzlement and breach of trust, which a civic group SpecWatch believes have caused damages worth 2.8 trillion won in the company. Seo Yong-won, the CEO of Hanjin Group, was also indicted on charges of making business contracts worth 10 billion won with a cleaning company run by Jin’s brother-in-law when he was then vice president of South Korea’s largest carrier Korean Air in 2010. Jin is suspected of peddling influence over Seo in exchange for favors in the investigation into allegations of Hanjin Group chairman Cho Yang-ho’s tax evasion. Jin dropped the case, but the prosecution said that it could not find links between the closure of the probe and the business deals. Meanwhile, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office announced its plan to establish a committee comprising four taskforce teams in an effort to reform the prosecution’s top-down culture. The move follows Jin’s corruption scandal and the death of a young prosecutor who committed suicide allegedly due to his senior’s verbal and physical abuse. By Ock Hyun-ju","nexon over alleged bribery ,friday indicted senior prosecutor ,dismiss the disgraced prosecutor ,prosecutor nexon founder indicted ,nexon founder indicted over","['South Korea ’s', 'Nexon', 'Justice Ministry']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21041435  0.41157907

All ranking government officials and lawmakers are required to disclose changes in their personal wealth annually.Nexon allegedly gave 425 million won to Jin in 2005 for him to buy 10,000 shares of the company, which ultimately helped the senior prosecutor amass some billions of won in profit through stock transactions by 2015.Jin is also suspected of receiving over 50 million won from Kim between 2005 and 2014 for his family's travel expenses and pocketing another 30 million won to take over a car leased by Kim's company.

However, the administrative penalty that nullified his driver’s license might be subject to presidential pardons. Gangwon Pyeongchang Police, who are taking charge of the criminal case, passed Bang to the prosecutors on July 22 and requested his administrative region revoke his driver’s license. Gyeonggi Nambu Police, who are in Bang’s residential area and are therefore dealing with the administrative side, has followed up on July 27. The revocation of Bang’s driver’s license was based on the system of traffic violation demerits. For the accident he caused, Bang received a total of 680 demerits -- 90 demerits for each death he caused, 15 demerits for each seriously injured person, 5 demerits for each person with minor injuries, and 2 demerits for each shocked person. He was additionally penalized 10 points for violation of the obligation to drive safely. The 680 demerits he received became grounds to take away his license. The current law stipulates that a collection of more than 121 demerits in a year automatically leads to revocation of a license, which cannot be reinstated for one year. The one-year limit period applies to cases of violation of central line and illegal U-turns that resulted in casualties. Causing traffic accidents while driving under the influence and hit-and-runs are subject to a 5-year ban.Bang admitted to dozing while driving but denied any drinking, subjecting him to a one-year ban. If special pardons are carried out on Aug. 15, Bang might be legally able to reinstate his driver’s license even sooner. In light of this information, the public is fiercely lambasting the lax regulation for traffic offenders. Many people are voicing their opinions online saying that it is against common sense to allow a person to drive just one year after causing an accident that killed lives.Bang has a previous record of license suspension in 2014 after being found a three times offender of drunk driving. He regained his license in March 2016.Gyeonggi Nambu Police said that nothing has been decided for this year’s NID, however, it is true that the government had let go of the drivers who had lost their license for accumulated demerits.

This, in fact, has nearly overshadowed other allegations that include a dubious real estate deal, connection with a scandal-ridden prosecutor, tax evasion and other possible irregularities.There has been an outpouring of news reports on the junior Woo and his alleged privileges that suggest his father’s suspected influence-peddling. But the latest development also raises questions on whether enough attention is being paid to the gravity of the alleged breaches of conduct and suspected violations of the law by Woo. It also raises the question of how much responsibility high-ranking officials should take for the morality of their children.Members of the Center for Military Human Rights Korea hold a press conference on their petition against the son of Woo Byung-woo, a scandal-ridden senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, alleging preferential treatment during his military service. Is it inevitable -- or even necessary -- to examine high-profile officials’ children to judge their parents’ integrity? Or is the media often so tempted to abuse its right to report and overstep boundaries into private lives?The answer is yes, to both questions.In fact, the public has reason to believe that those in power exercise political leverage to give unfair advantages to their children, or the latter abuses their parents’ status to reap benefits.Every once in a while, whether in state audits, personnel confirmation hearings or election campaign seasons, sons of high-profile figures draw flak for evading military service.Earlier this year, the Education Ministry revealed dozens of cases in which law school freshmen were encouraged to mention their high-profile parents during the admission process.Some of these “privileged children” would go so far as to abuse their connections and play a bridging role in massive monetary transactions and political lobbying. The most representative case was Kim Hyun-chul, the second son of the late President Kim Young-sam, who was arrested in the last year of his father’s term for being associated in a multitrillion insolvent corporate loan.It is these stories about “modern-day royal kids” that cause ordinary people despair over their own lack of high-profile family connections.The inheritance of wealth and power has also widened social disparity over the years, creating self-deprecating terms such as “earth spoon” to refer to the opposite of “silver or gold spoon.”But those who actually enjoy the privileges often seem to be unaware of what they have.“It’s not like  evaded his military service. I actually called him back from overseas so he could join the army as was his duty,” said Woo, while trying to clarify the allegations to Cheong Wa Dae correspondents last week.But his contention of innocence only aggravated the public’s fury as his son later turned out to have taken an internship at a ruling party lawmaker’s office without following the due hiring procedure. The junior Woo also was said to have taken frequent leave from his alleviated military duty, an unusual practice for an ordinary junior soldier which further boosted suspicions that his father’s political fame was somehow involved.So, yes, despite protests, the irregularity scandals involving the children of high-ranking officials need to be addressed, if only to get down to the root of their parents’ corruption allegations.But on the other hand, there have been many past cases when the excessive competition among the media infringed upon privacy or created unfounded charges against the children due to the position of their parents.In 2009, the daughter and son-in-law of former President Roh Moo-hyun were placed in the media spotlight for their $1.6 million purchase of a home in New York. Slews of detailed reports and even pictures of the house were reported, raising speculation over the source of their budget to buy the house. This was highlighted amid the prosecution’s full-fledged investigation into Roh’s alleged corruption.The former president eventually ended his own life on May 23 amid escalating pressure, and the allegations against his son and daughter ended in an anticlimax, without proof that they were ever true.South Korea’s aversion toward what are considered privileges of public officials as well as their children have also led to questionable regulations, such as those faced by diplomats. In 2014, Cheong Wa Dae appointed four ambassadors on condition that their children with dual nationality “reinstate” their Korean nationality. After a year, as the required measures failed to take place, the presidential office summoned the senior diplomats back home before their due term ended.With the number of diplomats’ children with dual or foreign nationality on an uptrend, standing at 152 as of last year, debate over the regulation is likely to escalate in the upcoming years, possibly leading to a constitutional petition.So, yes, the media should firstly at all times ask itself the following questions when expanding the range of its reports: “Are we keeping our integrity? Are we not abusing our power?”Because these are precisely the same questions that they pose to those in power.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com","scandal ridden prosecutor tax ,weighing on senior presidential ,criticism against his son ,with scandal ridden prosecutor ,senior presidential secretary woo",['Woo Byung - woo'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50870246  0.25071058

The Minjoo Party of Korea’s chairman Rep. Kim Chong-in called for the “readjustment” of the taxes on cigarettes, noting that the tax increase appears to be failing in its antismoking aims.In 2014, The Ministry of Health and Welfare decided to double the tax imposed on packs of cigarettes from 1,550 won  to 3,318 won. The Health Minister forecast that the tax increase would reduce the number of smokers by almost 8 percent. “The government should admit to using tax increases on cigarettes as an excuse to collect more taxes,” Kim said at a party meeting. “If they fail to deliver on a promise, they should readjust the policy. We urge the government to come forward on this issue.” The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Rep. Kim Chong-in  attends a party meeting on Wednesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldStatistics from market research firm Nielsen Korea showed last Wednesday that the number of cigarettes sold in the first half of this year was about 35.3 billion, a 13.9 percent increase from the same period last year. This was partly due to a low base effect as smokers stockpiled cigarettes before the tax hike came into effect in January 2015. Total sales are still below 2014 levels.Data from the Ministry of Strategy and Finance showed Friday that 2015 tax revenue from tobacco sales is estimated to reach about 5.9 trillion won , an increase of about 1.5 trillion won from the year before.By Yeo Jun-suk","leader slams tax hike ,party leader slams tax ,slams tax hike ,leader slams tax ,slams tax hike on","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Kim Chong - in']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27696449 -0.17632163

The Ministry of Justice is expected to make a final decision after holding a disciplinary committee.The prosecution launched the probe earlier this month, as Kim Hong-young, 33, who worked at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office, committed suicide in May.There have been allegations raised against the 33-year-old's superior that he had been harassing the victim, verbally and physically.After analyzing the deceased prosecutor's computer records, phone call log and the messages he shared with his friends through social media, the inspection team concluded that harassment actually took place.The prosecution said it would be inappropriate for the senior prosecutor to continue in his job when he habitually harassed and insulted his colleagues.According to the probe result, the senior prosecutor is involved in a total of 17 similar cases in 29 months, while he was at the district prosecutors' office and at the ministry.

Chung Jin-suk pledged to act as a bridge between residents and the government, and to take all necessary measures including holding a hearing on the matter.“We must immediately establish a consultation body that includes the residents, the U.S. military and the Saenuri Party, to solve this issue,” Chung said during his visit.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk is surrounded by residents protesting against the THAAD deployment as he leaves the district office building during his visit to Seongju-gun, North Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. Scores of placards were hung across the county to denounce the government’s decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system there. Despite the government’s persuasion, concerns over THAAD’s impact on health and environment remain high among locals. The residents have also been questioning the decision process of the deployment.The region, a traditional voter stronghold for the conservative party, has shown rapidly dropping support ratings for President Park Geun-hye and the ruling camp since the decision earlier this month.Upon Chung’s visit, some residents briefly blocked the entrance to the district office and carried out a performance enacting a “funeral of the Saenuri Party,” implying that their loyalty to it has died.Chung in response said, “No matter how important the country’s security may be,  cannot unilaterally force the Seongju region  if it turns out to inflict clear damages to the residents’ health or the region’s environment, as well as any economic burden.”Prior to visiting the district office, Chung and his team had also visited the nearby Seongsan artillery unit that has several MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air homing missiles. “Even though the Hawk missile also comes with the radar which also emanates electromagnetic waves, there are no problem as of now,” Chung said. Despite his visit to the region, the residents continued to demand the withdrawal of the deploymentdecision.","province tuesday to soothe ,party members visited seongju ,north gyeongsang province tuesday ,ruling saenuri party floor ,government decision to deploy","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'U.S.', 'Chung Jin - suk']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15295984  0.49490595

But the special probe, with its limited range of investigation, also seems to be a strategy to buy time for President Park Geun-hye, who has explicitly been supporting her aide amid the rising allegations.“I will carry out the inspection as is stated by the law,” Lee Seok-soo, the independent presidential investigator in charge of Woo’s case, told reporters on Tuesday on his way to his downtown office.Senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo The special probe, which kicked off over the weekend, according to Lee, is to last for a month and may be prolonged by another month upon presidential permission.The special inspection system was created in March 2014 to be in charge of any irregularity allegations of spouses and family members of the president and senior presidential secretaries. It was initiated based on President Park’s election campaign pledge to root out high-profile corruption in public offices.Lee’s team will be looking into allegations that Woo’s son was given privileges in obtaining his current military post. Woo is also suspected of understating his assets through his family-dominated company and allegedly skipping the verification process in the appointment of a scandal-ridden senior prosecutor.Depending on the result, the team may choose to summon Woo for questioning or hand over the case to the prosecution, which is currently holding off on its probe.The probe, however, excludes other suspicions that the senior official was involved in covert monetary transactions over a costly piece of Gangnam real estate in 2011, as the deal had taken place before Woo took office at the Blue House. It was this allegation that had put Woo in the spotlight earlier this month, as it possibly connected him to corruption cases involving arrested senior prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon.Cheong Wa Dae refrained from commenting, especially since President Park is taking the week off on a five-day summer holiday.“We have neither been informed of the special probe, nor know how it will proceed,” said an official of the presidential office.Considering the president’s recent show of support, it has been speculated that Cheong Wa Dae for now will not dismiss Woo, whose job includes overseeing discipline among the public servants and government organizations.“Those of you here  should not avoid denunciation ... until the time comes for you to clear your name,” Park had said at the National Security Council meeting last week. Although she did not mention Woo’s name, this remark was taken as support for her civil affairs chief.However, a growing number of members at the ruling party are suggesting it is time for Woo to step down.“It seems that Woo, with his series of allegations, is no longer able to perform his duty as senior presidential secretary,” said Rep. Kim Young-woo, a member of the party’s interim leadership council on Monday, calling for Woo’s resignation.His remarks, which the party spokesperson later described as “personal opinion,” reflected the concern that a prolonged scandal concerning a presidential aide will eventually deliver a blow to the presidential office and ruling camp.By Bae Hyun-jung","dae probes aide scandal ,woo officials said tuesday ,corruption allegations involving senior ,probes aide scandal ,involving senior presidential secretary","['Dae', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun - hye']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20052429  0.4796001

The efficacy and capacity of the advanced missile defense system have also been topics of debate, with pundits, military officials and the public discussing what THAAD can and cannot do.THAAD is designed to target ballistic missiles at higher altitudes in their terminal stages, most likely fired from the hostile North Korea. South Korean military said that the missile batteries can strike objects that are up to 200 kilometers in front of the system and/or 100 kilometers behind it.When its radar detects an incoming threat, the target is identified and engaged. Then an interceptor is fired from a truck-mounted launcher and uses kinetic energy to destroy the incoming missile at between 40 to 150 kilometers in altitude.Seoungju-gun residents hold a rally in front of Seoul Station in downtown Seoul on Thursday, protesting the government’s decision to deploy the THAAD system in their region. Theoretically, it could cover the U.S. military bases in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, which sits 170 kilometers from the THAAD’s expected base of Seongju-gun, North Gyeongsang Province. It would not be able to intercept high-altitude missiles targeting Seoul, where 10 million people reside.But whether THAAD can protect the Pyeongtaek area has been disputed by experts.Jang Young-geun, a professor of aerospace and mechanic engineering at Korea Aerospace University, recently revealed a simulation showing that THAAD would not be able to intercept a ballistic missile fired from near Mount Baekdusan adjacent to the North Korea-China border to Pyeongtaek.He explained that the missile detection and firing would take approximately 203 seconds, by which time the missile would be under the altitude of 40 kilometers.Activist Jung Wook-sik, who co-authored a book on military defense with Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the minor opposition Justice Party, said that the actual range of THAAD’s interception might be shorter than 200 kilometers -- estimating it would be around 150 kilometers -- considering the maximum interception range would be shorter in relation to the altitude, Apart from the missile batteries, the radar for THAAD is another contentious issue. The Lockheed Martin-developed weapon system uses X-band AN/TPY-2 radars developed by Raytheon. The radar can be deployed in two different modes depending on the needs of warfare: the forward-based mode provides a wider range of detection to acquire ballistic missiles in the boost -- or ascending phase -- of flight. The terminal mode detects the weapons in their terminal -- or descending -- phase.The latter is estimated to have a range of 600 kilometers, which would put North Korea's northern territory at range. But the former is expected to be able to cover up to 2,000 kilometers, putting China under range.China has been fiercely protesting the THAAD deployment, raising concerns that the U.S. weapon -- which would be operated by the USFK -- would put it under Washington’s surveillance.The South Korean Defense Ministry, who has maintained that THAAD is exclusively against North Korean threats, countered by saying that the radars would only be operated in the terminal mode. A military official at a base that operates the Green Pine radars pointed out that the AN/TPY-2 typically covers a relatively smaller area at a higher accuracy. “How can a radar that is about the size of a soccer goalpost cover the massive land of China? It’s absurd,” he said, asking not to be identified.Compared to Green Pine that can easily shift positions, the AN/TPY-2 for THAAD is conventionally in a fixed position. As the radars would be pointed toward North Korea, officials said this would make surveillance of China -- whose territory is mostly west of South Korea -- nearly impossible.But some have speculated that the allies may bring in multiple THAAD systems.During the parliamentary questioning, Rep. Kim Sung-chan suggested that two or three more THAAD systems should be deployed here, to which Defense Minister Han Min-koo agreed.The existence of more than one THAAD system means both terminal and forward-based modes could potentially be operated.Another limitation of THAAD, which the Defense Ministry has already admitted to, is that it would be useless in defending Seoul and the surrounding capital region, even if it was installed near the area. The Scud short-range ballistic missile launchers are mostly based near the capital, and the SRBMs typically fly at altitudes beneath the THAAD’s interception range.Despite its limits, experts say that THAAD is likely to significantly boost missile defense in South Korea. It currently has the Patriot missile system with PAC-2 batteries, which are slated to be upgraded to PAC-3 starting late this year.The missiles are said to be effective in defending against lower-altitude ballistic missiles, which the Seoul government described as adding to “multi-layered defense.”While the system will provide an upgrade to missile defense, pundits question whether it will be overwhelmed by Pyongyang’s large missile inventory. Michael Elleman and Michael J. Zagurek Jr. of the North Korea analysis website 38 North wrote that a single THAAD battery holds limited interceptors ranging from 48 to 96. Given that the North has hundreds of Scud missiles, they pointed out that mounting defense against the large number of incoming missiles will be difficult in terms of actual interception and radar detection.As the AN/TPY-2 radars are pointed toward the North, there will also be challenges in defending against submarine-launched ballistic missiles, they pointed out.By Yoon Min-sik","debate with pundits military ,its possible hazardous effects ,the advanced missile defense ,limitations since the announcement ,effects on the health",['the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16461264  0.41195545

The NSC meeting was convened two days after Pyongyang launched three ballistic missiles in an apparent protest against the allies' decision to deploy a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery to Korea's southern county of Seongju.""The government has made the decision to deploy THAAD as it judged that the deployment was the best way to protect the nation and the people from North Korea's threats,"" Park said, pointing out that there are continuing calls from some politicians and citizens to scrap the plan.""If there is any other way -- other than the deployment of THAAD -- to protect our people from North Korea's possible missile attacks,  make a proposal,"" the commander-in-chief added.Since Seoul and Washington announced the plan earlier this month, there has been considerable debate between proponents and opponents on the issue.Seongju residents, in particular, oppose the decision, berating the government for making the deployment plan without going through a fair and transparent process of soliciting their views. Many are concerned over rumors that the THAAD radar system could cause cancer and infertility, and hurt their agricultural crops.  ""I have recently been receiving much criticism and resistance,""Park said.

The communist country has fired its intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile multiple times this year, with its latest launch last month assessed as a success.Bordallo said that she believes THAAD deployment on the Korean Peninsula to be necessary due to North Korea’s threats. She added that that there has been no visible effects on the environment that can be traced back to THAAD, over two years after the initial deployment.The recent decision by Seoul and Washington to station the advanced missile defense system at the southern region of Seongju-gun, North Gyeongsang Province, has stirred controversy over its effectiveness, leaving some locals concerned over possible health and environmental issues.The Defense Ministry addressed the rumors on health issues by revealing its Patriot missile unit and Green Pine radars to the press last week, showing that the operational radars emit very low levels of electromagnetic radiation.It publicly measured the radiation levels near the Anderson Air Force Base in Guam to show that the THAAD electromagnetic radiation is near background level.The THAAD base in Guam is located some 3 kilometers away from the nearest residential area, while the THAAD base in Seongju will be 1.5 kilometers from the nearest village.By Yoon Min-sik and Joint Press Corps","no complaints on guam ,guam thaad guam congresswoman ,guam have welcomed the ,guam congresswoman told the ,of guam have welcomed","['U.S.', 'south korean', 'the Terminal High Area Altitude Defense', 'U.S.', 'Guam', 'Madeleine Bordallo', 'Guam', 'the U.S. House of Representatives', 'Guam']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29978079 -0.22087522

While Cheong Wa Dae cried foul and vowed strong counteraction in relation to the scandals, the ruling conservative Saenuri Party -- especially its reformist floor leadership -- increasingly showed signs of growing apart from the presidential office.The most recent trigger for the divide was the suggestion that senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo had covert monetary connections with key officials of high-profile corruption cases.“The given suspicions concern people that I neither know, nor met,” Woo told reporters Wednesday, adding he will not be stepping down from his post as demanded by the opposition circles.Earlier Monday, local news reports said that online game company Nexon purchased in 2011 an expensive area of land in Seoul’s affluent Gangnam district that had formerly been owned by the family of Woo’s wife.The report suggested that Jin Kyung-joon, a senior prosecutor recently arrested for bribery charges, may have acted as broker in Nexon’s purchase of the 130 billion-won  real estate.Woo is also accused of covertly defending Jung Woon-ho, the former chief of local cosmetics brand Nature Republic, who is now detained over a lobbying scandal. As a former prosecutor, Woo temporarily worked as attorney in 2013-2014.Despite Woo’s stern defense, the reports dealt a blow to Park and her team as the civil affairs official was seen as one of the closest confidants of President Park.The Saenuri Party leadership holds a meeting at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldAdding to the president’s dilemma are the allegations that Hyun Ki-hwan, a former senior presidential secretary for political affairs and another top aide, had pressured a Saenuri lawmaker to renounce candidacy in the April 13 general election so as to favor a pro-Park runner.Amid growing doubts surrounding Park’s aides, the ruling party leadership expressed unease toward the presidential office.“We will demand an immediate clarification from Cheong Wa Dae and the Ministry of Justice on allegations concerning Woo,” said floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. Further adding to the president’s woes is dissent in the conservative-leaning Yeongnam region, including the president’s hometown Daegu, over the government’s recent decisions not to build a new airport in Miryang and to deploy the much-disputed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province.Among the 25 Saenuri lawmakers in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, 21 held a joint press conference last week, asking for proper compensation for the THAAD installment in the region.By Bae Hyun-jung","her growing lame duck ,scandals the ruling conservative ,growing lame duck symptoms ,the scandals the ruling ,fading the ongoing allegations","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Dae', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26451179  0.48183608

If the measures are put in place, manufacturers of toxic humidifier disinfectants such as Oxy Reckitt Benckiser or Lotte, which together are responsible for around 100 deaths related to toxic humidifier sterilizers, can face a court order to pay up to 100 billion won in compensation. The amount could be enough of a burden to close down a business.Lawmakers belonging to a special committee on investigating the toxic humidifier disinfectant case attend a meeting at the National Assembly on Monday The minimum ceiling of compensation has been calculated from 100 million won, an amount a victim would get from a death caused by traffic accidents.Due to a standardized cap on the amount of compensation, courts have been receiving criticism that such a compensation scheme does not fully address the situation of deaths or suffering endured by victims from using the faulty products.According to the Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute data, a total of 3,698 victims filed damage reports from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant to the government as of last month. The KEITI under the Environment Ministry has been receiving damage reports since January 2014, after it was handed down the task by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September, 2011.Meanwhile, on Monday a civic group hosted a debate regarding the toxic humidifier disinfectant case and flawed legal system on toxic substances at the National Assembly.The event was attended by medical professors, members of the people’s solidarity for health and medical treatment and lawmakers belonging to a special committee on the toxic humidifier disinfectant case. Experts at the debate underlined the legal loophole in controlling the use of toxic chemical substances in household products here.“Ministries responsible for this incident also showed negligence and delayed response when the incident broke out, portraying a weak governmental management system,” said Professor Cheong Hae-kwan of Medicine School from Sungkyunkwan University.“Authorities should consider establishing a main control center, in order to develop diagnosis and treatment facilities on this kind of incident,” added Professor Jung. Kang Jung-hwa, a representative of The Voice for Consumers said that “it is necessary to establish an independent institution that manages the safety of consumers,” urging an active governmental system to investigate the cause and effect relationship of toxic humidifier disinfectant cases.Earlier this month, the National Assembly endorsed a plan to conduct a parliamentary probe into the toxic humidifier disinfectant case through a special committee to carry out investigations for 90 days and to discuss compensation measures.The committee, which comprises lawmakers from the rival parties, last week agreed to include the Justice Ministry on the probe list and decided to conduct an investigation into the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters in the U.K. in August.By Kim Da-sol","korean supreme court will ,pay up to billion ,monday judges at the ,billion won 880 000 ,exchanged views last week","['the south Korean Supreme Court', 'the Supreme Court']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5321309   0.45573318

We will also tighten monitoring and screening system for prosecutors to prevent recurrence of such an event.”Kim denied news reports that he would step down from his current post over the scandal.Prosecutor general Kim Soo-nam also apologized during a meeting with high-ranking prosecutors, vowing a thorough investigation into the case and heavy punishment such as the deprivation of Jin’s title and illegally-amassed profits. During the meeting, the participants laid out plans to expand the monitoring of asset growth and the stock investment of prosecutors whose duties are linked to stock information. The prosecution will also toughen regulations for prosecutors to register as a lawyer upon conviction of bribery.According to news reports, Woo’s wife had not been able to sell the real estate located 40 meters away from the Exit 1 of Gangnam Station for more than two years. She allegedly was able to finally sell it to Nexon at 130 billion won in 2011. The company sold it again a year and four months later, as it had withdrawn its plan to build new headquarters in Seoul. “There was no reason to ask Jin Kyung-joon to sell my wife’s property and I did not ask for it,” Woo said in the lengthy statement. “I have never met Kim Jung-ju or had a phone call with him.”News reports have also quoted legal sources who suspected Woo of having turned a blind eye to Jin’s possession of Nexon stocks in return for the gaming company buying his wife’s real estate. Woo was in the position to verify the backgrounds of high-ranking officials when Jin was promoted to senior prosecutor in 2015. Woo slammed what he saw as groundless, false reports, saying that many real estate agencies had approached his wife out of interest in the property and that she had paid 1 billion won in commission fees to a realtor for striking a deal. The realtor, who led Woo’s real-estate dealing, also dismissed the allegations over Jin’s involvement in the transaction in a phone interview with a local media outlet. The realtor said that more than 400 businessmen had shown interest in the real estate but had not purchased it due to disagreements over price. Woo, a former senior prosecutor who passed the bar exam in 1987 at age 20, is best known for leading high-profile investigations including the 2001 financial scandal involving C&G; Group chairman Lee Yong-ho and the 2009 bribery investigation involving former President Roh Moo-hyun.By Ock Hyun-ju","senior presidential secretary denied ,nexon buying his family ,presidential secretary denies link ,wife sold the property ,in scandal senior presidential","['Jin Kyung - joon', 'Nexon', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Jin']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79217386 -0.03878868

The arrest came 13 hours after the prosecution began interrogating prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon, who is suspected of taking kickbacks and benefitting from shady stock transactions with the money at Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. Senior prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon The prosecution suspects that Jin took 425 million won from Kim in 2005, bought Nexon’s unlisted shares with the money and sold them at 1 billion to buy Nexon Japan’s shares in 2006. As Nexon Japan’s stock value soared in 2011 when it entered the stock market, Jin later sold it for 12 billion won. The prosecution also acquired evidence that Jin had received a car worth 50 million won under the name of his sister’s husband in 2008. A series of suspected crimes that took place between 2005 and 2008 will be seen as all connected, which extends the 10-year statute of limitations for the 2005 case and gives the prosecution power to charge him with bribery. During the probe, Jin allegedly admitted that he had received the money, but said that he had intended to pay it back. Kim, who was summoned for questioning by the prosecution on Wednesday, allegedly admitted that he had offered the money mindful of Jin’s status as a high-ranking prosecutor. The prosecution plans to seek a detention warrant for Jin within 48 hours.The bribery scandal came to light early this year as the senior prosecutor reported a massive increase in his wealth in 2015.

If we lose the safety of the country and the people due to conflicting interests and enmity leading to competition, there will no longer be the Republic of Korea,” Park said.This is the second public mention of THAAD by Park, who had said during a meeting with senior secretaries last week that the deployment does not target any country other than North Korea.President Park Geun-hye speaks during the NSC meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. South Korea and the U.S.’ decision last week to deploy the missile defense system on the peninsula had sparked aggressive debate, such as over the system’s incapacity to cover the Seoul area, safety and health concerns, and a potential diplomatic and economic backlash.“Upon review, we have reached a decision that Seongju is the optimal candidate site. It is a safe region, so safe that even the thought of being worried sounds odd.”Park also called for continued communication with Seongju residents and added, “We should be repaying the residents  for having shared their region for the sake of national security.”Seongju residents, upon the government’s decision to deploy THAAD in the region, have fiercely opposed the decision such as by holding large-scare rallies. The county’s governor and local councilors have also gone on a hunger strike. The residents have demanded the deployment decision to be withdrawn amid speculation that the THAAD radar system’s signals might cause cancer and infertility. The Seoul government has consistently insisted the claims are groundless.In mind of the escalating opposition -- supported by a majority of the ruling party lawmakers representing the region’s constituencies -- Park assured that the radar would not pose health risks.Explaining that the radar will emanate electromagnetic waves some 700 meters above ground, Park said those in the area will hence have no reason to worry.She also added that the deployment of the THAAD system would ensure the safety of residents who live in the southern part of the peninsula by covering areas that existing PAC-2 missiles cannot cover. Sources said that Defense Minister Han Min-koo plans to travel to Seongju in the near future to explain the government’s position on the deployment.The ruling and opposition parties, meanwhile, agreed to hold plenary sessions from July 19-20 to discuss THAAD by calling in relevant government officials.While the ruling Saenuri Party is troubled by dissenting lawmakers representing the Gyeongsang provinces, the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea has yet to streamline its stance on the THAAD decision.","enmity leading to competition ,park calls for end ,end to unnecessary debate ,debate on thaad president ,geun hye on thursday","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Security Council', 'U.S.', 'the Republic of Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3591952   0.39171851

President Park Geun-hye speaks during the NSC meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. Upon Wednesday’s announcement that THAAD will be deployed in Seongju-gun, North Gyeongsang Province, residents and county officials from the small town had fiercely protested the decision, with the county mayor and local councilors launching a hunger strike and locals holding mass rallies. Officials measure the amount of electromagnetic exposure from PAC-2 radar to the press on Thursday. The allies’ decision to deploy THAAD as a protective measure against North Korea’s ballistic missiles last Friday had immediately stoked speculation about the candidate site. There has been widespread concern that the electromagnetic signal sent out by X-band radars -- microwaves similar to those sent out by mobile phones -- could be harmful to health and agriculture.U.S. military’s THAAD base in Guam is located about 3 kilometers away from the nearest residential area, while one in Seongju will be around 1.5 kilometers from the nearest village.In response to such concerns, the Defense Ministry unveiled the amount of electromagnetic exposure from the already-operational PAC-2 and Green Pine radars. South Korea currently operates a launcher and a radar for the Patriot missiles at the Air Force base in the capital region, located at a closer distance from a residential area than the Seongju-based THAAD would be. The Green Pine radar is operated in the country’s central region, and is 2-3 kilometers away from the nearest village.Both the Patriot and Green Pine launch units are on mountains, at around 300 meters and 400 meters above sea level, respectively.Military officials have asked not to disclose the exact location of the radars or the names of related personnel due to security issues.The recommended safe distance from the PAC-2 radars -- when in operation -- is about 120 meters, which officials said is an indicator that it has a stronger impact on health compared to a THAAD radar, of which the recommended safe distance is 100 meters. While the THAAD radar has a shorter safe distance, the output is known to be stronger. Officials said that the emission does not necessarily equal impact on health.  The military measured the electromagnetic wave exposure from a distance of 118 meters, 60 meters and 40 meters for six minutes each. Officials said that both the International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection’s guidelines and the local law limits the exposure to electric and magnetic fields of high frequencies -- emitted by both THAAD’s radar and the radar for the patriot missiles -- to 10 watts per square meter over a period of six minutes. Exposure to waves exceeding this amount would lead to body-heat stress and excessive local tissue heating.Members of student groups hold a rally supporting the government’s decision to deploy THAAD “for sake of the people’s lives and nation’s security,” in Seoul on Thursday. An official from the state-run Agency for Defense Development said repeated exposure to waves lower than the aforementioned standard would not be harmful to the human body, as it would not be enough to drive up body heat to do any damage. Electromagnetic fields measured from a distance of 40 meters from the Patriot missile radars peaked at 0.2826 and averaged at 0.0735 watts per square meter.Measured from 118 meters, the figures peaked at 0.0336 and averaged at 0.0065. As lower-frequency signals travel further, the permitted amount of electromagnetic radiation for lower frequency Green Pine radar was 6 watts per square meter. “Emission from the Green Pine is generally stronger than THAAD radar. At least its effect on health is evaluated to be greater,” explained a military official. The recommended safe distance for it is 530 meters.The peak emission measured at 30 meters from the radar was 0.2658, while one measured at 100 meters peaked at 0.3228. The one further received more waves due to the lack of obstacles.“I cannot definitively say that the same results would be applied for THAAD, but this shows a reasonable comparison as one radar is stronger than that of THAAD and another is weaker. And we can see that both are being operated safely in vicinity of a residential area,” said a military official.Members of student groups hold a rally supporting the government’s decision to deploy THAAD “for sake of the people’s lives and nation’s security,” in Seoul on Thursday. He claimed that none of the soldiers, maintenance personnel or the residents near the base have suffered from health-related problems linked to the radars.The Green Pine radar was installed late 2012, and has been operational since 2013. The Patriot launchers have been deployed for use since 2008.The official added that various factors, including the location, the altitude, the angle the radars are pointed at and others will affect electromagnetic exposure. The amount of emission conventionally decreases in proportion to the distance, but as in case of Green Pine, the surrounding environment can be a factor as well.But he pointed out that unlike the case of Patriot missile and Green Pine bases, a mountain stands in between the expected location of THAAD and the nearest county, indicating that any adverse effect on health would likely be lower. South Korea and the U.S. military are slated to reveal the Guam THAAD base on Sunday to the Korean media for the first time, and Defense Minister Han Min-koo is expected to visit Seongju as early as next week to persuade residents on the system’s deployment.

The delegations are carrying out the administrative process to receive approval from the both militaries,” the source was quoted as saying.The Ministry of National Defense declined to comment on the matter, saying nothing has been finalized yet.Signs opposing THAAD deployment are hung Tuesday in Seongju-gun, North Gyeongsang Province. Korea and the U.S. kicked off talks to station THAAD on the peninsula in February, on the heels of North Korea’s long-range rocket launch that followed its nuclear test in January. The Seongsan artillery unit has several MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air homing missile along with some 170 troops. Located at around 400 meters above sea level, the Seongju area has been considered one of the top candidates for THAAD due to its distance from populated areas.One of the main concerns among South Koreans over THAAD has been the negative effects its high-powered radar might have on the environment and health.Minister Han Min-koo told the National Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. military has conducted an evaluation on THAAD’s effects on the environment through the system based in Guam, and said that it will not harm the health and well-being of the people.Some observers pointed out that a Seongju-based THAAD radar would not be able to reach China, which has been one of Beijing’s biggest concerns. Beijing has said that deploying THAAD on the peninsula would hurt its “strategic interests.”It is also well out of range of North Korea’s multiple rocket launchers, which are presumed to be able to strike targets 200 kilometers away. Considering THAAD’s operating range, the THAAD base in Seongju would be able to provide coverage from the military bases in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province and in Gunsan, Jeolla Province, to the Gyeryong military headquarters in South Chungcheon Province. The military’s simulation reportedly showed that a single-unit operating THAAD can cover from half to two-thirds of the country, and can shoot down short, medium and intermediate-range missiles. But stationing the weapon system far from the inter-Korea border would spark concerns that it cannot protect Seoul and the capital region, where approximate 20 million people reside.The military is expected to use PAC-3 surface-to-air missiles to defend the region in such a case. According to the ministry’s 2017-2021 plans, the military is set to acquire and deploy the new patriot missiles by 2018. A military official explained that in case of an attack on the capital region, Pyongyang is more likely to use short-range Scud missiles, which conventionally fly at an altitude of 20 to 60 kilometers. THAAD mostly intercepts missiles at higher altitudes of up to 150 kilometers, although theoretically it could shoot down Scuds as well.He said this means the PAC-3 would be more efficient in intercepting such shorter range missiles.As for the multiple rocket launchers, the military said it was more important to strike the source of attack as such rockets are impossible to intercept with THAAD anyway.Other locations around the country considered to be potential candidates include Osan and Pyeongtaek in Gyeonggi Province, Chilgok in North Gyeongsang Province and Yangsan in South Gyeongsang Province.As is the case with Seongju, Yangsan has the distinct advantage of not being highly populated and being relatively far from China.It used to host South Korean Air Force’s air defense base, which makes it easier to set up a base for THAAD. But in addition to being too far to protect Seoul, the city is close to the Gori nuclear reactor, which Yangsan Mayor Na Dong-yeon argued will threaten the lives of the city’s entire population.Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province, is an ideal place from which to protect the Gyeonggi and Seoul area, along with its adjacent Gyeryong military headquarters. However, observers are pointing to the difficulties in acquiring additional land and newly stationing USFK soldiers as hindrances for THAAD deployment there. Close to the inter-Korea borders are Pyeongtaek, Osan and Wonju in Gangwon Province. In addition to them all falling under the range of North Korean artillery, Pyongtaek has the disadvantage of being close to a populated area. Apart from where THAAD ends up, the fierce objection by the people will prove to be an obstacle for local authorities. Citizens based in the aforementioned areas have via press conferences and statements opposed stationing THAAD near their homes.When Gyeonggi Governor Nam Kyung-pil said he would welcome stationing THAAD in the province, Pyongtaek-based civic groups released an emergency statement on Tuesday urging Nam to withdraw his remarks.Professor Kim Dong-yup of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies also raised concern that stationing a U.S. weapon system against objections from China and Russia may place the Korean Peninsula at the center of an international confrontation. China and Russia have raised objections to the prospect of having a U.S. weapon system adjacent to their territories, but Defense Minister Han urged Tuesday not to overestimate the impact of what he called “deploying a single artillery base.”","local media reported tuesday ,allies choose seongju for ,government sources yonhap news ,media reported tuesday citing ,the advanced missile defense","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Seongsan - ri']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27741528  0.94905853

Where the victim lived until his death. Their trial is ongoing.Before the boy’s death, Kim had deprived him of food, providing him with only one meal per day. She kept the weakened victim in a bathroom between November and February when the average temperature had dropped below zero degrees Celsius. She even occasionally drenched him in cold water and bleach. The bowl the victim ate from. As for the boy’s father Shin, 38, the prosecution said he had used his son’s custody as a tool to win a divorce suit against his ex-wife. Prosecutors described his actions toward his son as gross negligence, contributing to his death by doing nothing about the abuse. According to the prosecution’s claim, the victim’s death had been intentional. Following the victim’s death, the couple had discussed plans to conceive a baby. They left the victim’s body on their verandah for 10 days before burying him on a mountain. In the trial that took place Monday, Kim tried to take all the blame, crying for mercy for Shin and saying she would forever atone for her sins by praying for the victim.  Shin wept without saying anything, with his head bowed. The psychotherapist who counseled the parents told the court that Kim had suffered abuse by her stepmother in childhood and that those memories had resurfaced in their worst form in her actions toward the victim.

During a press briefing in central Seoul, the committee, consisting of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, the Justice Party, the nation’s two biggest umbrella labor unions and progressive civic groups, urged the government to abolish polices that favor the personal interests of family-controlled conglomerates.  Participants of a committee aiming to reform chaebol attend a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. “Since the 1997 financial crises, wealth inequality has widened in tandem with the Korean economy’s deepening reliance on chaebol. It’s because the government has shifted responsibility for economic crisis to laborers while protecting big businesses,” said Choi Jong-jin, the acting leader of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. “The chaebol system, which worsens inequality and destroys labor unions, should be reformed.” Chaebol or conglomerates, a legacy of South Korea’s development-focused economic growth, have contributed to rapidly growing the economy under business-friendly polices such as tax benefits and cheap bank loans.But they have been increasingly criticized of bending laws to hand over their businesses to their family members, allegedly exploiting subcontractors and securing control over their companies through cross-shareholding practices. The participants read out their demands to improve corporate governance in a statement and chanted “Let’s change chaebol!” Their demands include stricter regulations on succession of their businesses to their family members, heavier punishment on companies exploiting subcontractors and an increase in corporate taxes.The committee also released a plan to hold an event on July 22 in central Seoul to raise awareness of the campaign, with nearly 50,000 unionists and activists set to attend. “I expect the upcoming event to be a stepping stone for a social discourse on chaebol’s illegal business practices, The Justice Party will contribute to reforming the structure not just temporarily, in solidarity with workers,” said Kim Se-kyun, co-leader of Justice Party. “The core of economic democratization is to protect workers being exploited under the chaebol system.” In a survey of 800 Koreans released in 2015 by the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, 87.5 percent of them advocated reforming family-controlled companies. Nearly 35 percent of them pointed to the monopoly of power and illegal practices as the most serious problems in the chaebol system, followed by family-controlled corporate governance at 24.8 percent, intragroup deals between subsidiaries at 21.2 percent and cross-shareholding arrangements at 11.3 percent.

Still, prosecutors said it is unclear whether the reports and letters were actually sent to Pyongyang.Under the National Security Law, South Korean citizens are prohibited from contacting North Koreans without government approval or engaging in activities benefiting the North.The two suspects have been refusing to make a statement during the investigation, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors said they need to further analyze the confiscated articles to decide whether the suspects can be charged with espionage activities. Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency revealed camera footage of its agents arresting Kim, 52, at a PC cafe in southern Seoul at the parliament's intelligence committee.He was previously known to be a pastor who impersonated a human rights activist, but prosecutors said both suspects do not seem to hold regular jobs.","korean men indicted ,korean men indicted over ,pyongyang prosecutors said tuesday ,men indicted over alleged ,two south korean men","['south korean', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Lee', 'Kim', 'north korean', 'Vietnam']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23691285  0.85231102

The victim was a complete stranger to Kim.Kim waited for about 50 minutes for a woman to show up at the bathroom, according to prosecutors. When the victim came into the unisex restroom, Kim attacked her with a knife he had brought.The crime was committed due to Kim's mental disease, prosecutors said, wrapping up their monthlong investigation.  Flanked by police officers, the suspect behind the brutal murder of a 22-year-old woman leaves Seocho Police Station in Seoul on May 26, 2016. Kim has a record of being hospitalized for schizophrenia more than six times since 2009. Since he left the hospital for the last time in January, he had not taken his medication or received treatment and had lived on the streets since March, they said.During the investigation, Kim said he had been suffering from stress because of women.According to prosecutors, he said another unidentified woman threw a cigarette butt at him two days before the incident took place and made him decide to kill a random woman.Still, prosecutors said they cannot define the case as a hate crime against women. ""Hate crimes against women is not a legal term, and it is hard for us to say whether this case goes under the category or not when there is no fixed definition of what that is,"" a senior prosecutor said under the condition of anonymity.""The defendant does seem to have hostility and aggression against women in general, but we could not find evidence of him despising or discriminating against women,"" the prosecutor said. The reason behind the general animosity has not been identified.The case has sparked a nationwide debate over crimes targeting women in the country. Thousands of South Korean women took to the streets in May, paying their respects to the victim who ""lost her life for being a woman.""

The smuggled items include a Patek Philippe watch that costs more than a billion won here and several Hermes bags that cost upwards to 50 million won, according to the authorities.""The tax rate of luxury watches reaches up to 42 to 48 percent,"" a customs official said. ""They seem to have continued the wrongdoings as a high profit is guaranteed once the smuggling is successful.""

Choi Kyung-hwan speaks during a press conference at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldHis announcement came just hours before the party’s general meeting during which the interim leadership was set to discuss the blueprint for the national convention slated for Aug. 9.Choi’s words were confirmation of rampant speculations that his challenge to the party’s chairmanship at this point in time will have more cons than pros.Those in his faction loyal to the president reportedly had urged him to remain at the center stage so as to offer upmost support to Park, who is currently in the fourth year of her five-year term. But he has also faced pressure for the result of the April race in which the party lost a considerable number of seats, several of them in stronghold constituencies.Though he was not directly involved in the election strategy including candidate nominations and campaigning, the former finance minister was dubbed the “identifier of the true pro-Park” during the election season by selectively rallying for those considered to be firmly on President Park’s side.Choi, for instance, participated in the office opening ceremony of then-candidate Kim Jin-tae at Chuncheon, but was nowhere to be seen when non-Park candidates held their campaigns in Daegu. The southeastern conservative stronghold city is also where Choi holds his representative seat.His discriminative stumping triggered complaints from those outside the mainstream, who considered themselves to be at a disadvantage. But the tables turned after many of the pro-Park candidates lost in the race and the defeat was largely blamed on their dogmatic operation. Choi and his faction lost face and the upper hand, giving way to the rise of new reformist members, such as floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.“I was so often accused of manipulating the nominations that some even advised me to regain honor by running for party chairmanship,” Choi claimed.“But with only the people’s livelihoods and national development in my heart, I will once again sacrifice myself.”He then alluded to his support for Rep. Suh Chung-won, the eighth-termer the majority of the pro-Park faction is seeking to recommend as chairman candidate.Choi’s decision to take a back seat for the time being coincides with the burgeoning controversy surrounding another key pro-Park member, Rep. Lee Jung-hyun. The third-term lawmaker and former senior presidential secretary for public affairs is accused of attempting to censor news coverage critical of the government on the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking tragedy. Despite escalating attacks from the opposition against Lee that they cite as a representative example of oppressive incumbent government against freedom of expression, Lee is set to announce his bid for the chairmanship Thursday.By Bae Hyun-jung","the party crushing defeat ,feud when former deputy ,following the party crushing ,party crushing defeat ,party crushing defeat in","['Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Cabinet', 'Saenuri Party', 'Choi']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78997171  0.02379169

The court also said they did not have the intention to detain Kim.""The defendants asked Kim to come out and submit her computer or to open the door and let them check the computer,"" the court said. It added such action cannot be deemed as confining somebody, setting aside the question of whether that violates other laws.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said a former executive of a local defense firm, identified only by his surname Bae, is suspected of forging test results to sign a contract with the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.

Choung Byoung-gug, Kang Ghil-boo and Joo Ho-young; and main opposition Minjoo Party Reps. Kim Boo-kyum, Byun Jae-ill, Song Young-gil and Oh Jae-sae. Won Hye-young , a five-term lawmaker with the Minjoo Party of Korea, speaks during a gathering of senior lawmakers at the National Assembly on July 5, 2016. ""As this gathering is bipartisan one, I hope that this would play a role in discussions to enhance inter-Korean relations,"" said Won Hye-young, a five-term lawmaker with the Minjoo Party who led the launch of the gathering.At the first gathering, participants put forward their ideas of how to improve inter-Korean relations. Rep. Choung said that the current government's hard-line stance could be a way to improve cross-border ties."" took both soft-line and tough-line stances in the past. But the North is going its own way without seeking to reverse course,"" he said at the gathering. ""After all, taking a hard-line stance could be one of ways to normalize inter-Korean relations.""In a move to build a ""normal"" state-to state relationship, the Park Geun-hye administration has refused to offer unconditional aid to the impoverished neighbor and has taken a tough stance regarding Pyongyang's repeated provocations.The Park administration has also rejected Pyongyang's recent dialogue offers, saying that the overtures could be part of its deceptive tactics to ease international isolation and sanctions stemming from its past provocations including its nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month.The political circles have been divided over the issue of how to improve cross-border relations. The conservative ruling party has largely been leaning towards taking a tough stance in dealing with Pyongyang's provocative behavior, while the liberal opposition Minjoo Party has put more weight to the importance of cross-border dialogue and exchanges.","senior lawmakers launch bipartisan ,lawmakers launch bipartisan gathering ,opposition parties on tuesday ,lawmakers launch bipartisan ,missiles the lawmakers made","['inter - korean', 'Pyongyang', 'the National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64515084  0.38071814

Chung Jin-suk announced that all of the party's 129 lawmakers have been invited to a luncheon, which is scheduled to be held at the presidential office on Friday. This photo, taken on July 5, 2016, shows President Park Geun-hye attending a luncheon meeting with members of the Korea Freedom Federation at her office Cheong Wa Dae. Chung also said that the government, presidential office and ruling party will hold three-way talks on Thursday at Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn's official residence to discuss their cooperation over a range of issues including economic revitalization.""The  gathering will be a venue where  will vow to make the 20th National Assembly work harder and be more productive, and make all-out efforts to revitalize the economy and improve people's livelihoods,"" Chung told reporters.At the luncheon gathering, Park is expected to call for the party's backing for her government's efforts to push for economic reform, create jobs, spur growth and counter persistent military threats from a nuclear-ambitious North Korea.The luncheon will be the third of its kind. Park hosted similar events with the ruling party ranks in January 2014 and August last year.Friday's gathering was arranged after tensions between the party and presidential office flared up over the party's decision to reaccept a group of independent lawmakers who bolted from the party after failing to secure nominations for the April 13 parliamentary elections.Among the independent lawmakers was Rep. Yoo Seong-min whose relationship with the president soured last year after Yoo played a role in the passage of a controversial bill that Park strongly opposed.In a move to bolster communication with the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Park is reportedly seeking to invite parliamentary leaders, including National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and the chairs of parliamentary committees, for a lunch meeting sometime next month.Park has been seeking to set the tone for cooperative ties with parliament since the ruling party lost a majority in the 300-member legislature in the April 13 general elections.The opposition bloc now leads the legislature with the largest opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the minor People's Party holding 122 seats and 38 seats, respectively.Assembly Speaker Chung welcomed Park's reported plan to host the luncheon with parliamentary leaders.""I hope and anticipate that such efforts to  communication  will lead to  communication and cooperation between the government and legislature so as to help lessen the pains of the people,"" he told Yonhap News Agency over the phone.The Saenuri Party said that the plan is a ""display of Park's will"" to respect the legislature as a partner for the management of state affairs.""The meeting will be a timely and meaningful event at a time when the country faces a series of complicated pending issues at home and abroad,"" party spokesman Ji Sang-wuk said.","party lawmakers for luncheon ,luncheon this week president ,lawmakers for luncheon ,lawmakers for luncheon this ,dae for luncheon meeting","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.6458962   0.49887642

She is also a four-time world champion. On top of her prolific career -- which includes setting a new world record in Beijing by lifting a total of 326 kilograms -- Jang is known for her humility and optimism. Yet instead of focusing on the protagonist’s athletic career, the upcoming MBC series, tentatively titled “Lifting Fairy Kim Bok-ju” will dramatize the imagince romance, according to reports by local dailies. One commentary wrote: “The young lifter has no dating life because of her line of sports, but her life turns upside down as she falls for a doctor at an obesity and weight management clinic.” The writer of the show, Yang Hee-seung, reportedly spoke to Jang many times, taking into account her real-life experiences when writing the script.Some Koreans criticized the show, saying the script has no connection to Jang’s life and centers on lookism. “Why would a weightlifter visit a weight management clinic? That makes no sense,” an online commenter wrote via Twitter. Another asked, “Why does the show even need Jang’s perspectives if the story is about a weightlifter falling in love with a doctor at an obesity clinic?” Some also pointed out that the actress who has been cast for the lead role does not represent Jang and other female weightlifters. According to news reports, Lee Sung-kyung, a slim 25-year-old model and actress, has been chosen for the role. There have been many TV drama series and films in South Korea that feature plus-size women struggling with their body image. Director Kim Yong-hwa’s 2006 box office hit “200 Pounds Beauty” was about an overweight singer who undergoes intensive plastic surgery and dieting to become a pop sensation. Upon losing weight, she also finds herself in a fulfilling romantic relationship. In 2015, model-turned-actress Shin Min-a starred as an overweight attorney in the KBS2 drama series “Oh My Venus.” For the role, the slim-figured actress had to sit through a three-hour makeup and prosthetics session for each shoot. Many critics have pointed out that real-life plus-size actresses are seemingly invisible in the entertainment industry. “The problem with these narratives is that the women protagonists only become successful and happy after they lose weight ,” said professor Shim Mi-seon from Soonchunhyang University’s mass communication department. “The concept used in the upcoming series is definitely problematic. But there have been so many similar drama shows and films in the past and they were hugely popular. Few people find such narratives to be problematic and producers believe such stories attract more viewership.”Kim Bit-na, a spokeswomen for MBC, said she could neither confirm nor deny whether the script indeed features a romance between a weightlifter and a physician at an obesity clinic. Although it is true that actress Lee is currently being considered for the role, it has yet to be confirmed, Kim added. “All we can say for now is that it is about a young, female weightlifter and it is set to be broadcast in November,” she told The Korea Herald. “The script may change as we develop it further in the future.” By Claire Lee","female weightlifting champion jang ,life female weightlifting champion ,female weightlifting champion ,drama about female weightlifter ,weightlifting champion jang mi","['Koreans', 'South Korea']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.45053273  0.20798606

""These would only invite stronger sanctions by the international community and its regime, after all, will never be stabilized.""Last week, the North's Supreme People's Assembly, its rubber-stamp parliament, gave its leader Kim a new title: the chairman of the newly created state apparatus called the State Affairs Commission. The move is seen as further reinforcing Kim's autocratic rule.Kim was given the new title amid growing concerns that the country has been constantly developing its nuclear weapons technology and delivery capabilities. Last month, it claimed to have successfully carried out a test on the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile, escalating its threats to its potential adversaries including the U.S. and South Korea.Signaling her concerns about isolationist and protectionist tendencies in the world markets, Park said that the country should turn the current situation into an opportunity to emerge as a pivotal state championing free and open trade.""In the past, many of the developing states opted for isolationism while pushing for their economic development, but South Korea chose an externally-oriented strategy that promoted economic development and competition, and achieved an economic growth that startled the world,"" she said.""Our FTAs have now become our crucial economic assets,"" she added.Noting a recent series of terrorist attacks by the Islamic State jihadist group, including those in Turkey and Bangladesh, Park ordered the government to check any vulnerabilities in South Korea and ensure that terrorists cannot enter the country.","vigilance against korea president ,nuclear development during cabinet ,against korea president park ,tighter vigilance against korea ,during cabinet meeting park","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Cabinet', 'Park', 'South Korea']",10,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.38084143  0.23432615

The legislative body would gather relevant cases, canvass public opinions and propose the plan to parliamentary committees. The initiative has gained momentum since a number of lawmakers recently came under scrutiny for hiring family members to work at their offices. A total of 30 parliamentary aides have reportedly resigned in the wake.Rep. Seo Young-kyo.Among the hardest-hit is The Minjoo Party of Korea’ Rep. Seo Young-kyo, who is being pressed to resign for hiring her own daughter, brother and another relative during the previous term. Rep. Park In-soon of the Saenuri Party and Chung Dong-young of the People’s Party were implicated in similar allegations. “I don’t think we should deal with these ethical scandals on an emotional basis,” said the secretary-general. “Over the next two weeks, we are going to collect cases and opinions. I believe we will come up with a new measure no later than this month.” He added that new regulations should clarify the detailed scope of family and relatives banned from being directly hired by Assembly members, highlighting that there was no specific regulation for the hiring practices, often leading to arbitrary interpretation. There are clauses in parliamentary regulations related to the lawmaker’s ethical code of conduct, but they only stipulate that the representatives must supervise their aides and staff members and should not use their salary for illegitimate purposes. Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun had promised to support the move, saying the plan would soon be submitted to the House Steering Committee. The new measure is expected to be proposed as a parliamentary regulation, not new legislation.It was not the first time a lawmaker hired a family member. Most parliamentary aides and staff members were family members, relatives or close friends before the 13th Assembly, elected in 1988, adopted a formal hiring process. “Back in the day, there was no formal recruiting process for parliamentary aides. Since the job involved a high level of confidentiality, family members and close friends have been the ones the lawmakers trust with their jobs,” said a 45-year-old aide who requested anonymity.  The practice persisted throughout the 18th and 19th Assemblies. Including four-term lawmaker Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan who hired his brother-in-law as an aide, more than a dozen lawmakers, crossing party lines, have come under scrutiny for hiring relatives.In other advanced democracies, rules against nepotism have been addressed and enforced more strongly, such as in the U.S. Congress that stipulates specific cases in which lawmakers are forbidden from hiring relatives. A section of U.S. federal law covering antinepotism states that public officials shall not hire individuals with certain relationships. They include the official’s aunt, brother, daughter, father, first cousin, grandchild, half-sibling, husband, mother, nephew, sister and son.Some lawmakers, however, warned that a comprehensive ban on the hiring of relatives would deprive individuals of opportunities to choose their jobs and that competent relative should be given the chance to work unless they are immediate family members. “Truth be told, some lawmakers might hire family members because they are more competent than any other candidate. In that sense, it can infringe upon the individual’s right to employ and be employed,” said the Minjoo Party’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho.

But Park made a counterclaim last week that she falsely accused him of sexual assault.Park's agency has been asserting his innocence, staking his career and reputation on the line.

Ahn Cheol-soo had little to lose from his resignation as cochief of the People‘s Party on Wednesday. By assuming responsibility for the ongoing rebate scandal, he not only reemphasized his “new politics” slogan, but also shifted his focus to a more distant goal -- next year’s presidential race.But his retreat left his party with a leadership vacuum from the very first month of the new parliamentary term, hindering the rookie opposition party from making its presence felt.“I will make my best efforts as an ordinary member of the party,” Ahn told reporters Thursday at a policy workshop, making his first public appearance since his resignation.He also attended the parliamentary committee meeting on education, culture, sports and tourism, signaling that he would continue his regular legislative activities.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo attends a policy workshop arranged by his party at the National Assembly on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldDespite his humble gesture, however, his resignation was also widely considered an opportunity to consolidate his position as one of the top presidential hopefuls.“ should have responded more resolutely to the two  lawmakers,” he said at the Supreme Council meeting, prior to announcing his resignation.“I have always resented the way that conventional parties handled corruption scandals and do not want to echo their behavior.”Ahn and his cochief Rep. Chun Jung-bae stepped down from their leadership posts on Wednesday, taking responsibility for a widening kickback scandal involving some key party members.“Politics is about taking responsibility, which is why  Max Weber underlined ethical responsibility,” Ahn said, responding to previous criticisms that he had failed to stay true to his slogan of new politics.On the day before Ahn’s resignation, the party had shelved the sanctions against the proportional representatives in question -- Reps. Kim Su-min and Park Sun-sook -- to await prosecutorial indictment. The decision, though based on the party’s constitution, drew bitter responses.Adding to the pressure was his close ties with Rep. Park, who was not only the party’s secretary-general and chief campaign strategist, but also one of the closest aides to Ahn since his political debut in 2012.Stepping down was thus considered the only plausible option left for Ahn, who has his eyes set on the presidential election slated for December 2017. His popularity ratings, according to local pollster Realmeter, stood at 12.8 percent this week, trailing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and main opposition hopeful Moon Jae-in.Relieved from the political duties as party founder and initial leader, Ahn is expected to henceforth focus on his individual career as a lawmaker.So far in the current parliament, Ahn‘s legislative achievements have been limited to the proposal of a fair growth bill, which seeks to alleviate tax burdens for venture firms. Ahn was a venture businessman and the developer of a computer antivirus program before he stepped into politics.Some, however, had sought to dissuade him from stepping down, citing the impeding leadership vacuum.“Our priority is to deal with the given circumstances, not to escape from them,” said Rep. Park Joo-sun, the Supreme Council member and parliamentary vice speaker. But it was Ahn himself who refused to compromise.The resignation of the cochiefs left floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won in charge. Park was appointed to lead the party’s emergency committee until new leadership is elected. The party thus entered the same leaderless state as the two leading parties, both of which are to be steered by their respective emergency committees until their upcoming national convention.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party, after failing to establish a new leadership in the wake of the April 13 general election defeat, has brought in former Constitutional Court Justice Kim Hee-ok as its interim leader. The Minjoo Party of Korea has been led by conservative economic adviser Kim Chong-in ever since former party chief Moon Jae-in stepped down in an effort to end factional feuding within the party.","his new politics slogan ,next year presidential race ,reemphasized his new politics ,resignation over scandal underpins ,scandal underpins new politics","['Ahn Cheol', 'the People‘s Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68345338  0.51021153

Lee Jung-hyun, the former senior presidential press secretary, and a local news director was revealed Thursday, showing that Lee had requested the revision of a news story related to the deadly ferry sinking in 2014. The coverage was critical of the coast guard and the government.According to the document made public by the Union of Media Workers, Lee told former KBS director Kim Shi-gon that the cited report appeared to have malicious intent toward the now-defunct Korea Coast Guard.  Sewol Special Committee The sinking of the ferry Sewol, which left 304 dead or missing, remains one of the worst maritime disasters in Korean history. The lackluster rescue operation by the KCG had sparked public furor and the ultimate breakup of the group. The functions of the organization have since been transferred to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security under President Park Geun-hye’s orders.“From the perspective of the citizens, the KBS report will make them think that this enormous incident occurred because the KCG did not do their job right. ... How can you trample on the government like this, when we are not the direct cause ,” Lee was quoted as saying in the transcript. Kim was then seen assuring him it will be “taken into consideration.”Kim was accused in 2014 of saying that the 304 deaths in the Sewol tragedy was not that many compared to the number of traffic accident deaths that occur each year, subsequently resulting in his resignation.Complaining about direct pressure from Park herself, Lee was quoted as outright saying words like “remove it from the news,” “re-record ,” and “of all days, the president had to watch KBS today, please change the content.”He consistently stressed that the officials of Sewol, not the KCG, were solely responsible for the tragedy, and said state-run media should not be “wrongfully” criticizing the government.The 2014 news stories in question had pointed at the KCG’s questionable decisions and the lack of a proper chain of command that may have hindered the rescue operation.Earlier in the week, the special committee tasked with investigating the Sewol sinking filed charges against Rep. Lee and former KBS chief Gil Hwan-young for allegedly meddling with content of the news illegally.The related organizations said that the transcript was proof that the accusations were true, and called for a thorough investigation of the issue.Yoo Kyung-geun, the spokesman of a committee for the bereaved families of the Sewol tragedy, said that the transcript showed that the government has been “toying” with the victims.“Lee said that the Sewol tragedy happened because of the ship’s workers, not the KCG. Although Park said that  was all her fault, we now know what she was really thinking.”Rep. Lee was unavailable for comment when reached by The Korea Herald.The special committee on Sewol is slated to cease its 18 month-activity as of Thursday. The sunken ferry is to be salvaged after July.Rival parties remain at loggerheads over whether or not the committee should extend its term.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea has been calling for its extension, accusing the government and Saenuri of sabotaging the committee, while the Saenuri said that prolonging the activity is futile because its investigation has borne no fruit.By Yoon Min-sik","park aide pressured media ,ferry sinking in 2014 ,media during sewol tragedy ,the deadly ferry sinking ,director was revealed thursday","['Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Lee', 'the Union of Media Workers', 'Lee']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54414791  0.23235257

From a month earlier, industrial output also gained 2.5 percent.The May figure represents a turnaround from 0.5 percent and 2.6 percent on-year drops in March and April, respectively.Production in the service sector also expanded 3.4 percent from a year earlier and edged up 0.1 percent on-month.For all industries, output jumped 4.8 percent on-year in May and climbed to a 15-month high of 1.7 percent from a month earlier, the report said.Statistics Korea attributed the rebound in industrial output to the eased pace of declines in exports, which marked a 6 percent on-year fall in May, narrowing from 11.2 percent tallied in April.The latest data also showed that an index that measures the volume of exports jumped 5.8 percent on-year in May, the agency added.""The mining and manufacturing sector is directly affected by exports,"" said Eo Woon-sun, director of the short-term industrial statistics division at Statistics Korea. ""One more working day than a year earlier also lent support to the 4.3 percent on-year jump last month.""The country's exports have decreased for 17 straight months since January last year, the longest negative streak in Korea's history. And they are expected to extend the negative run to 18 months in June, as the latest customs data show that outbound shipments slumped 20.8 percent for the first 20 days of the month.Production of semiconductors largely contributed to the uptick, as it vaulted 28.3 percent from a year earlier, along with a 12.3 percent jump in petroleum goods output and a 3.2 percent gain in automobiles.May's average plant utilization in the manufacturing sector reached 72.8 percent, up 1.5 percentage points from a month earlier.Meanwhile, domestic consumption continued its upbeat pace last month to rise 5.1 percent on-year, following a four-month high, 5.7-percent on-year jump in March, on the back of robust sales of durable goods like passenger cars.Car sales soared 20.8 percent in May from a year ago on the back of the government-led excise tax cut program that resumed in January to boost consumption.From a month earlier, consumption also edged up 0.6 percent, turning around from a 0.5 percent fall in April. The on-month figure hit 4.4 percent in March, the highest monthly figure since February 2009 when it touched 5 percent.The finance ministry said industrial output and domestic consumption may backtrack to some extent in June as consumer and business confidence remained sluggish in recent months due to rising uncertainties at home and abroad.""The government will move swiftly to draw up an extra budget and implement planned economy-boosting measures to battle possible downside risks inside and outside the country,"" said the ministry.Earlier this week Korea unveiled a set of stimulus programs, including a 10 trillion won  supplementary budget, to buttress Asia's fourth-largest economy that has been suffering from waning exports and flaccid domestic demand.It cited that rising financial uncertainties throughout the world, triggered further by the recent British vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit, are feared to further drag down demand here.PNP Baribas, a France-based investment bank, also took a cautious approach, as South Korea's industrial output data have been highly volatile over the past year thanks to an up-and-down production of chips and cars, and their overseas demand.""Caution is needed in interpreting the headline print,"" the company said it a report. ""Korea's production data have been highly volatile over the past year, heavily distorted by the spurts of the production of motor vehicles and semiconductors.""It expected the Korean fiscal and monetary authorities to come up with more aggressive measures to revive a weak recovery momentum.""Data overall show signs of improvement, but more is needed to alleviate policy pressure,"" said the report. ""May data should not dissuade a Bank of Korea rate cut.""The Korean central bank slashed the base rate to a fresh record low of 1.25 percent in early June, saying that the economy needs a further support.","government report showed thursday ,expanded percent last month ,election campaigns deemed unconstitutional ,rebounded in may snapping ,journalists joining election campaigns","['Korea', 'Statistics Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52441257  0.32602146

Photo taken June 29, 2016, shows President Park Geun-hye  speaking during her meeting with economy-related ministers at her office Cheong Wa Dae. The president pledged to expand government support to encourage more companies to introduce the flextime system and other measures to prevent workers from quitting their jobs due to child care and other domestic affairs.""Our  objective is to prevent situations -- in which women find it difficult to return to their jobs after giving birth and rearing their children -- from happening in the Republic of Korea,"" she said.Over the last several years, Air Korea Ltd. has been running the program that reduces working hours for pregnant workers and offers ""automatic"" childcare leave after maternity leave, in addition to the flextime system.The company explained that after it fully introduced the flextime system in 2014 it could hire more female workers, who once opted to stay at home to focus on childcare, and saw its corporate productivity rise and its employee turnover rate fall.The government currently offers 400,000 won  per employee to each company that has the flextime system in place.Park said she would consider increasing the amount to 600,000 won.With state support, the number of companies with the flextime system surged to 4,512 last year from the 319 recorded in 2013.Park's visit to the company came less than a week after her visit to a local elementary school to promote an after-school program that her government has been expanding to help working mothers take better care of their children.The Park administration has been carrying out a campaign for work-family balance through a multifaceted program that encourages public and private firms to introduce the flextime system or a smart-work program that allows workers to work at home with the use of smart devices. The program also includes tailored childcare services for working mothers.The flextime system has been at the core of the government's campaign.According to a recent survey conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 300 local companies, 96.7 percent of the questioned employees said that the flextime system has helped them strike a balance between work and family. Moreover, 92 percent of the employers polled said that the system helped improve work productivity.","promote flextime system president ,geun hye on wednesday ,work family balance park ,president park geun hye ,hye on wednesday visited","['Park Geun - hye', 'Air Korea Ltd.', 'Korea', 'Hanjin Group']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58504707  0.85383922

In mid-January, the week following Pyongyang’s fourth nuclear test, she had taken the Southeast Asian country as a historic example of political feuding and social division.“When  Vietnam fell, intellectuals closed their ears, politicians spared themselves and the people were indifferent to politics,” Park said in her New Year’s statement to the people, urging South Korea to learn a lesson from history and break free from political strife.President Park Geun-hye speaks during a meeting with chief secretaries on Monday. The term “Vietnam” usually refers to the current Socialist Republic of Vietnam, but Park’s speeches indicated South Vietnam or the Republic of Vietnam which governed the southern half of the country in 1955-1975, until unified by force by communist North Vietnam.But the president’s repeated citation of Vietnam as a negative historic precedent, according to political observers, may kindle unnecessary diplomatic unease in the amicable partnership of the two countries.“Regardless of the president’s intention, the given remarks may create diplomatic friction with Vietnam,” said Choi Chang-ryol, a professor of politics at Yongin University.Also, the expression “collapse,” implying an accusing tone against the conqueror -- the political root of the incumbent socialist administration -- fails to properly reflect the current political reality, he added.Since establishing diplomatic ties in 1992, South Korea and Vietnam have been in a stable political and economic partnership.As of the end of last year, Vietnam was Korea’s fourth-largest bilateral partner in trade and third-largest investment destination, as well as a counterpart in a recently effectuated bilateral free trade agreement.President Park, too, made a state visit to the country in her first year in office and paid respects at the grave of deceased socialist leader Ho Chi Minh, making a gesture of amity to the socialist government.The Vietnamese Embassy in Seoul was not available for comments when reached by The Korea Herald.By Bae Hyun-jung","causes diplomatic unease president ,negative political analogy ,diplomatic unease president park ,crisis said the president ,diplomatic unease president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54006469  0.31224152

Though she downplayed the impact of Brexit, Park cautioned against potentially negative ramifications including volatility in the global financial market. ""We need to keep a close watch as global market uncertainties could have a negative impact on us any time through foreign capital flight and other developments,"" she said.To rapidly respond to Brexit-related situations, the government said it would continue to maintain a 24-hour monitoring system.The president also pointed to uncertainties in the Chinese economy and geopolitical risks stemming from a provocative North Korea as ""elements of economic burden.""During Tuesday's meeting, government officials also agreed on a series of measures to encourage the use of eco-friendly vehicles and strengthen deregulation efforts to boost the growth of new industries. The government, moreover, reaffirmed its resolve to push for its economic reform drive to ensure that the ongoing restructuring of the ailing industries, including the shipbuilding industry, proceeds smoothly.Park has pushed for a series of legislation to reform four major sectors -- labor, finance, education and public services. But the efforts have failed to make substantial progress due to a lack of parliamentary support.""We need to make efforts to quickly pass the legislation for labor reform, which is necessary to support those who have lost jobs in the restructuring process, by creating new jobs,"" she said.Later in the day, Park met with the ""Wise Men's Group"" in charge of North Korea's human rights issues. During the meeting, she was expected to touch on the latest missile provocations by the communist regime.Last week, Pyongyang launched what are believed to be two Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missiles. One launch failed, but the other flew some 400 kilometers and reached an altitude of about 1,400 km in an indication of some progress in the North's missile development efforts.In recent weeks, the president has continued to stress her resolve to make North Korea opt for denuclearization through strong sanctions and pressure, warning that Pyongyang will only face isolation and ""self-destruction"" should it stick to its nuclear program.","extra budget plan president ,quickly pass extra budget ,budget plan president park ,geun hye on tuesday ,during meeting with economy","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', ""South Korea 's"", 'Britain']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.2469687   0.31157586

A hefty portion of its four-year term was devoted to partisan standoff over contentious legislation, most of which has ended up turning into protracted ideological debates that soon eclipsed everyday matters.  Only about 45 percent of the submitted bills cleared the Assembly, placing it as the worst-performing legislature since the 15th Assembly elected in 1996.  Moving for a change this time, liberal-minded academics and civil activists set up an organization Sunday to highlight legislative agenda items they said would be “relevant” to people’s daily life -- such as removing cumbersome software access to websites and lowering the voting age for young people.  Government officials and lawmakers’ aide gather to attend the meeting held by standing committees at the National Assembly on Monday. Yonhap“The government-led policies have trouble being connected to the people’s daily lives,” said Lee Yong-mo, a professor of public administration at Konkuk University who cochairs the Center for Civic Awareness and Policy Making group. During the event attended by lawmakers from both liberal and conservative parties, the new organization vowed to end the use of ActiveX, a 20-year old Microsoft software framework that Internet users are required to install in order to access websites and services of many public agencies and financial institutions in Korea.Microsoft itself dropped support for the system in 2015 and the government has pledged to replace the program with a more solid accredited certificate system. The group said it would collect information from ordinary users, listen to what hinders their everyday use the most and allow the feedback to be reflected in legislation.  In the longer-term, the group pledged to focus on encouraging young people to engage in politics. Included in that are plans to lower the voting age to 19 from 20, a move that was previously rejected by the Constitutional Court in 2013, which deemed minors unfit to cast votes. Earlier in a similar move, Dajoonda political institute was launched in 2012 as a private organization to promote wider reflection of everyday issues. Starting as a small group with four founding members, it has grown into a political forum that includes such prominent politicians as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. “There are more young people than we think who want to engage with politics. The question is how to embrace them,” said Lee Dong-hak, a 33-year-old activist who was a member of a progressive party and a political commentator before running the organization. Translated as “a place to prepare for the next world,” the Seoul-based nonprofit organization discusses issues that resonate with average citizens and young people, including reducing college tuition and marriage costs. Among popular programs is a speech delivered by young activists and typical students. The speakers range from a young job seeker who suggested a change in the recruiting system for public teachers by extending the notification period of the exam categories to a contentious objector who became a movie director.Experts said these moves would play a “complementary” role in the political system dominated by legislative bodies that have often been preoccupied with grandiose political agendas and proved inefficient in addressing everyday issues. “It shows that politics has failed to incorporate the people’s daily issues into the legislative process,” said Jun Kye-Wan, a political analyst at Korea’s Knowledge Center. “They can advocate agendas that establishment parties have not dealt with in a complex society, such as sexual minorities’ and animals’ rights,” he said.

Kim Young-choon of The Minjoo Party of Korea on Sunday.Kim is currently chairman of the parliamentary Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee.Kim Young-ran, former Supreme Court Justice and Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief, who motioned the anti-graft bill to impose sanctions on public servants, journalists and teachers taking overpriced gifts, cash or service. YonhapThe subject of his anxiety is the ill on the prohibition of corrupt requests and bribery -- dubbed the Kim Young-ran law, taking its name from its initiator.The core of the anti-graft bill is to impose criminal fines on civil servants, teachers and journalists who have received meals, gifts, or cash gifts respectively worth 30,000 won , 50,000 won or 100,000 won or more. The bill, whose legislation notice period ended last week, is be confirmed as final draft this week and take legal effect in September this year.Dissenters within the political circles have either been calling for an alleviated monetary ceiling or the exclusion of the farming and fishing industries from the given sanctions.Reps. Yi Wan-young and Kim Jong-tae of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, both based in agricultural constituencies in North Gyeongsang Province, also made similar claims, gesturing to draft a revision of the disputed bill in the upcoming months.Rep. Kwak Dae-hoon, Saenuri lawmaker and member of the parliamentary Trade, Industry and Energy Committee, even argued that the implementation of the current draft would cause some 2.6 trillion won of financial losses to small businesses.Such concerns from the legislature were echoed by some Cabinet members, including Agriculture Minister Lee Dong-phil and Economic Deputy Prime Minister Yoo Il-ho.“I agree that the price ceiling should be raised for the sake of farmers and fishers, as well as self-employed businesspeople,” said Lee in a parliamentary policy discussion on Friday.Deputy P.M. and Finance Minister Yoo also said that the Kim Young-ran act, despite the public support for its bribery-curbing intent, could place constraints on the domestic economy.While the financial and parliamentary officials focused on the economic impact that the law is to have on the local industries, legal circles pointed out on what they saw as legislative flaws.In March last year, the Korean Bar Association had filed a petition to the Constitutional Court, claiming that the Kim Young-ran law infringes on the rights to equality by treating private schools and media organizations in accordance with government departments.In response, the Constitutional Court Chief Justice Park Han-chul said that the court will make its judgment by September, before the disputed bill takes effect.The bill in question, first motioned in 2011, intended at curbing the growing level of corruption cases involving influential public servants such as high-ranking prosecutors.But its draft, imposing criminal sanctions on public servants who take gifts or services worth 1 million won  or more, was shelved at the parliamentary state affairs committee due to its “ambiguous range of restrictions.”It was in the wake of the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014 and the consequent criticism upon public servants’ integrity that the dormant bill once again picked up momentum.By Bae Hyun-jung","circles while lawmakers argued ,lawmakers argued that agriculture ,political circles uneasy over ,lawyers accused the bill ,bill with forthcoming anticorruption",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86138606  0.00139114

He is suspected of receiving more than 500 million won  from the business association. Before entering the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, Choo told reporters that the 10-year-old ultraconservative organization has no ties to political and business circles.His group has been accused of staging rallies to advocate government initiative under instruction from Cheong Wa Dae. Its demonstration had often collided with liberal agendas and caused violent clashes with left-wing activists.  “There was no order from Cheong Wa-dae,” said Choo when asked by reporters whether the presidential office had been involved with prompting the rallies.  Korea Parent Federation Secretary-General Choo Sun-hee. YonhapThe Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice in April filed charges of embezzlement and violation of the law that forbids creating bank accounts under a false name. The civic group has claimed that the KFP had received the illicit fund under the names of North Korean defectors and distributed the money to those who joined the rally. The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions and six other labor groups pressed charges in May against a Cheong Wa Dae official for allegedly abusing his power to orchestrate rallies to push government agenda  – such as the contentious deal in 2015 between Korea and Japan over compensation for sex slavery victims.During an interview with weekly newspaper in April, Choo admitted that he received a text message from Huh Hyun-joon who he said had asked him to hold the rally. Huh has been working as an administrator for the presidential office’s communication department.But the activist said that he had “coordinated” with the official and had not followed instructions from him.

Kim Su-min appears for questioning at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday. The NEC has claimed that Rep. Park Sun-sook, then the party’s secretary-general who oversaw financial affairs, and Wang Joo-hyun, the deputy secretary-general, conspired with Kim. The court has since issued search warrants.Park is scheduled to be questioned on Monday.The prosecution was expected to zero in on what role Kim’s former company actually played and what type of service it was paid for. The party had explained that Brand Hotel was responsible for designing the party’s identity.The prosecution is also investigating another allegation raised by the NEC that the party exaggerated the expenses spent on producing election campaign materials in their application for state reimbursement upon the election.The NEC has reimbursed just 1.59 billion won out of the party’s reported 2.11 billion won spent on campaign materials, saying that the remaining 515 million won was deemed to have been spent excessively based on the general transaction trend.The rebate suspicion has rattled the third-largest party headed by entrepreneur-turned-politician Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, who has rose to political prominence with his new and clean politics mantra. Ahn has offered a show of regret over the allegation and promised to thoroughly investigate and deal sternly with anyone responsible.The party’s countermeasures committee for the case, chaired by professor-turned-politician Rep.

Ahn Cheol-soo on Wednesday urged the legislative body to come up with a comprehensive plan for reducing gaps in society, blaming the business and political elites for worsening socioeconomic inequalitiesDuring his debut speech as a party leader at the National Assembly, the entrepreneur-turned-politician also suggested that the political parties should set up a parliamentary committee to create more jobs in the future industry. People’s Party chairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo delivers a speech at the National Assembly on Wednesday. But the former presidential candidate tried to steer clear of sensitive political issues, including the ongoing debate over constitutional amendment, as well as his first-term lawmaker’s bribery scandal that has unnerved the party leadership.  “The defining theme of South Korea in 2016 is to reduce the gap ,” said Ahn. “I urge the parliamentary committees and Assembly speaker to take the initiative to build a roadmap to address the issue. … We should end an era where few elite dominate powers and wealth,” he said.  The 40-minute speech marked the end of the three-day parliamentary addresses delivered by the major parties’ leadership. The preceding speeches had also broached similar agendas such as pushing reform on conglomerate-dominated business structure. In order to successfully finish business within the four-year term, Ahn suggested that the parties should build a “road map” every year to figure out which gaps need to be fixed and which social sectors need to be tackled the most. The 54-year-old politician denounced the nation’s elites for abusing their powers in sectors ranging from business and politics to arts and sports. To make his case, he cited the infamous bribery scandal between the former chief of local cosmetic companies and the prosecutor-turned-lawyers.  “The cronyism among the power elites is so rampant in every corner of society,” said Ahn. “There is no hope or future for the country without justice in the legal system and taxation policy. We will fight against the elites with vested interest,” he said. In the speech, Ahn underscored the need for creating jobs related to the future industries such as science and education. He urged the lawmakers to build a legislative committee to determine budget and resources needed to push the agenda. The ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea echoed the need to build the committee, praising Ahn for delivering a “thoughtful” speech and pledging to take concrete measures to pursue the initiative. Ahn’s party holds the casting votes in the new Assembly with 38 seats to the Saenuri’s 129 seats and the Minjoo Party’s 122 seats. The former businessman suggested that that the world has begun the fourth Industrial Revolution and that Korea should take unconventional approaches to navigate through complex issues compounded by social transformation. Citing former Chinese Prime Minister Deng Xiaoping as an example, Ahn urged the reform-minded politicians to take note of the pragmatic leader who spearheaded wide-ranging social reform in China from the 1970s to the 1990s.    “Just as how Deng envisioned the plan for the nation 30 years down the road, the Assembly should figure out a future plan for South Korea as well,” he said, referring to the Chinese statesman’s famous “three-step” policy for China’s economic development within 70 years. Ahn, however, did not offer any comments on the constitutional amendment that has roiled political circles over the past weeks. The presidential hopeful had previously said that simply changing the terms of the presidency would not offer a solution to the problematic single-term five-year system. He took a similar stance on the bribery scandal surrounding first-term lawmaker Rep. Kim Su-min. The youngest lawmaker in the 20th Assembly has been accused of receiving kickbacks from advertisement companies during the political campaign. She has denied the allegation.  By Yeo Jun-suk","inequalitiesduring his debut speech ,wednesday urged the legislative ,third biggest people party ,the entrepreneur turned politician ,political elites for worsening","['People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41349405  0.67615467

The new Gimhae airport is in fact the new southeastern airport.”His comments were seen to be aimed at quelling local organizations and business interest groups of the two potential locations, especially those that had supported the site in Miryang that was considered a more likely choice. The two sites had been evaluated by French airport engineering company ADPi under the commission of the Land and Transport Ministry. They included Miryang, supported by constituents of Daegu, Ulsan and Gyeongsang provinces, and Gadeokdo Island supported by Busan residents.“While it has been a difficult problem, I believe that on our part, we have kept the  pledge,” Jung added.Park had pledged to push for the construction of a new airport during her 2012 presidential campaign, criticizing the previous government’s decision to scrap the plan that had been viewed as a political reward for the long-standing stronghold of the Saenuri Party.Her predecessor President Lee Myung-back, also from the conservative party, had issued a public apology after deciding to forego the costly project in 2011 saying it was “an inevitable choice for the people.”The new airport plan, floated since 10 years ago, had quickly become politicized as neighboring regions vied for the project. One of the initial choices of building more runways and expanding the existing Gimhae airport situated between Daegu and Busan was quickly overshadowed by the more voter-enticing option of building a brand new one that would be accompanied with vast business investment. The opponents to expanding Gimhae airport had cited the need to relocate the adjacent Air Force base.Cheong Wa Dae’s commentary, however, seemed to do little to calm the anger among locals that had campaigned to bring in the new airport, calling the decision a stopgap measure.“I am dumbfounded to hear  say that it was the optimum alternative, after having said all these years that extending Gimhae Airport was impossible,” said Rep. Yoo Seong-min who represents a Daegu constituency. He recently rejoined the Saenuri Party after defecting upon fallout with Cheong Wa Dae over a parliamentary revision act.The opposition parties also chimed in with criticism.“Upon this case, the government and politicians should avoid making promises or election pledges that prompt conflict among regions,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Rep. Kim Chong-in.The aftermath of the government’s latest decision is expected to persist as Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo, who had staked his seat to bring the new airport to the city, continues to protest. Municipalities of Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province said they will gather opinions of residents to decide whether to fight the government’s decision.","new airport presidential spokesman ,it broke presidential pledge ,build new southeastern airport ,building new airport presidential ,broke presidential pledge","['Dae', 'Dae', 'Jung Youn', 'Jung Youn']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2489922  -0.03839928

Hong was a prominent prosecutor who investigated major corruption cases that involved the country's former presidents. He stepped down from office in 2011, and has since worked as a lawyer.","indicted over lobbying scandal ,snowballing corruption scandal ,snowballing corruption scandal that ,prosecutor indicted over lobbying ,into snowballing corruption scandal","[""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Hong Man - pyo', 'Nature Republic', 'Jung Woon - ho']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30078375  0.12312857

Chung Jin-suk, the party's floor leader, apologized for having used ""rough and inappropriate"" language against interim leader Kim Hee-ok last week. Kim accepted the apology.   Their relationship soured Thursday after Chung called a request by Kim to delay a vote over whether to accept the independent lawmakers a ""grave criminal act."" Kim made the request as party members loyal to President Park Geun-hye strongly opposed the move to reaccept the defectors including one on bad terms with Park.   Despite Kim's request, the party's interim leadership voted to reinstate the seven independent lawmakers, a decision that made the party the largest political group at the National Assembly but further exacerbated a deepening factional feud.   Since the controversial vote, Kim had boycotted party affairs.   But after the meeting with Chung, Kim decided to resume work to ""fulfill his mission for party unity and reform,"" party spokesman Ji Sang-wuk said.   The spokesman added that the party will pick a new secretary-general to better assist the interim leader.   The former Constitutional Court justice was picked earlier this month to lead the party until it holds a leadership election in August. Among his challenging tasks is to revamp the fractured party and shore up public support following its crushing defeat in the April 13 general elections.   ""I should have treated him better and feel a sense of guilt,"" Chung told reporters after his talks with Kim. ""I feel really sorry.""   Before the talks between Kim and Chung, Kim criticized last week's meeting of the party's interim leadership, expressing his deep frustration over the ""absence of affection for the party and party colleagues.""   ""Under this situation, I feel deeply skeptical over how I can pull the party together and pursue reform,"" he told reporters.    At the center of the controversy was Rep. Yoo Seong-min, one of the seven independent lawmakers that the party has decided to welcome back.   The group of lawmakers loyal to the president, called the pro-Park faction, has been against Yoo, who clashed with Park over the passage of a controversial revision to the National Assembly Act last year. Park later vetoed the act.   Yoo, then the floor leader of the ruling party, played a role in the passage of the revision under an agreement with the opposition bloc. Park called the move ""politics of betrayal,"" in an apparent criticism directed at Yoo, who was once seen as loyal to the president.   Meanwhile, the members of the pro-Park faction plan to hold a meeting on Monday to address the ongoing factional conflict.","party floor leader apologized ,floor leader apologized ,cafe in southern seoul ,rift during their meeting ,floor leader apologized for","['Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim Hee - ok']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4697189   0.18537736

The Education Ministry plans to finish writing the book by this November and begin distributing them in March 2017. The measure prompted vehement opposition among liberal lawmakers who vowed to block the government’s plan upon beginning their term in the 20th National Assembly. Up to this point, South Korea had allowed multiple publishers to author the textbooks and certified them if they were deemed fit for education purposes. The opposition-led bill, if signed into law, would supersede the government decree announced last October that enforces reinstatement of the state-authored textbooks. The books are currently being confidentially authored by a team of scholars. The full list of authors has not been released for security reasons.Members attend a parliamentary committee meeting on education. “The adoption of state-authored textbooks clashes with constitutional value because the measure undermines diversity and neutrality in education policies,” said Rep. Lee Chan-yeol of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Lee is one of the 33 opposition parties’ lawmakers who drafted the bill. The bill, designed to revise the “Elementary and Secondary Education Act,” removes the decree’s clause that obligates schools to adopt textbooks authored by the government.The third-term lawmaker added that the government also took “illegal” measures in the process of reinstatement such as by setting up a secret body to supervise dissenters and allocating extra budget without legislative consultations. For the bill to become law, it must be approved by three-fifth of the lawmakers in a plenary vote. The number of combined seats held by the opposition parties is 161, 19 seats short of the three-fifths threshold in the 300-member Assembly.The Assembly’s education committee is currently chaired by the Minjoo Party’s Rep. Yoo Sung-yup. Yoo said he would see to it that his committee votes on the bill.The committee consists of 12 lawmakers each from the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party as well as four lawmakers from the People’s Party. The standing committee is the last stop before a bill is put to a vote in a plenary session. “If the rival parties fail to find a common ground, then we have to put the measure to a vote,” said Yoo in a media interview. “It’s a shame that we are forced to rely on legislative measure to address the issue,” he said. The move is the latest in a series of legislative coordination between the main opposition parties. Having secured parliamentary majority in the April general election, the Minjoo Party and the third-biggest People’s Party have pushed to ban state textbooks as one of their top legislative priorities. “We had already decided to coordinate with the Minjoo Party on the textbook issue.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office requested a state-run hospital in Gongju, South Chungcheong Province, to carry out a psychiatric test on the suspect’s state of mind before and after the crime, its officials said. “The hospital will keep experts around Kim and closely study his overall mental conditions to see whether his mental impairment prompted him to commit the murder,” said an official from the prosecutors’ office. Kim was arrested on charges of stabbing a 23-year-old woman to death at a public bathroom near Gangnam Station on May 17. He said he had committed the crime because he had been belittled by women, according to his testimonies. The case was sent to the prosecution in late May.The prosecutors’ request for a psychiatric test comes amid fierce debate over whether the crime was a hate crime against women or a crime committed by a mentally ill person.After profilers conducted an in-depth interview with the suspect, the police had concluded that the murder of the woman was an “accidental crime” by a man whose symptoms of schizophrenia had deteriorated at the time of the crime. Kim has been hospitalized for schizophrenia six times since 2008. But he had not taken medication since he was discharged from hospital in January. The case has resulted in many women coming forward to speak about their experiences of gender discrimination, triggering public calls for measures to curb hate crimes against women in the country. Government data and overseas research suggest that mental illnesses may not be major factors in committing crimes. According to Supreme Prosecutors’ Office reports, those suffering mental disturbances accounted for only 0.5 percent of all criminals in 2014 and 0.4 percent in 2013. In a 2014 study by the American Psychological Association on 143 offenders with serious mental disorders, only 7.5 percent of the crimes were associated with their illness.South Korea’s criminal law stipulates that offenders with the mental inability to make decisions or identify objects are subject to reduced sentences in prison. Such symptoms of mental illnesses include neurasthenia, schizophrenia, epilepsy and alcohol or drug addiction.

""Constitutional amendment is now a matter of will."" National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun speaks at a press conference on Thursday.Yonhap)Chung, who has recently left the opposition Minjoo Party of Korea due to a parliamentary rule, also pointed out that a major holdup in the discussion of the revision was the ""parochial view"" of the politicians who have approached the issue from the perspective of political interests.The issue of amending the Constitution resurfaced after Chung broached it during his speech marking the official launch of the newly elected National Assembly on Monday. The sensitive issue has long been pushed to the back burner due to fears that the debate over it could trigger intense political wrangling to the detriment of government efforts to focus on more urgent issues, including revitalizing the economy.Nevertheless, a series of big-name politicians, including Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, have continuously raised the matter. Despite calls for change getting attention, the discussions as a whole have yet to gain substantial momentum, since potential presidential contenders have remained silent on the issue.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae has maintained a cautious stance. It once likened the move toward constitutional revision to a ""black hole"" that would divert attention from more important economic issues such as those concerning people's livelihoods.Touching on how he would maintain relations with the Park administration, Chung said that he would help it if need be, but would also say ""no"" to government moves that he deems inappropriate. ""The criteria of my judgment is not power, but the people,"" he said. ""This is because the government may fail, but people must not fail.Chung also pledged to maintain ""close communication"" in the 300-member parliament and push for a legislature that focuses on ""working for the people"" -- not on pursuing partisan interests.""What people want us to do is only one thing -- stop fighting and work for the people and the nation,"" he said.

""This showed  will to focus more on bilateral relations and the North Korean nuclear issue.""Russia and China have strongly opposed the possible deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea, claiming it would undermine the strategic balance in the region. Seoul and Washington insist the missile defense system, if placed in the South, would be purely defensive in the face of North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats.Yun highlighted the effort Moscow showed in order to make his Monday meeting with Lavrov a success.""Because Russia is placing more importance on Asia, it has begun to give more attention to South Korea, and the expression it's begun to use recently is that South Korea is a key partner in Russia's foreign policy,"" Seoul's top diplomat said.Analysts say Russia is increasingly looking east for new business opportunities amid an economic crisis caused by low global oil prices and international sanctions against the country.As both China and Japan are seen as rivals in terms of geopolitics or territory, South Korea could be an optimum partner for Russia with all the necessary technology and resources but almost no source of tension between the two sides.In a speech at a conference of the Korea-Russia Dialogue forum, Yun said Lavrov agreed with him on the large potential for bilateral cooperation in developing Russia's Far East region.He also noted the similarity between Russia's new ""Look East"" policy, which centers on developing the Far East, and South Korea's Eurasia Initiative, which aims to draw countries in Asia and Europe closer by increasing rail, infrastructure and IT links.Yun is the first South Korean foreign minister to visit Russia in five years. His three-day trip included talks with Lavrov in Moscow on Monday and various events in St. Petersburg on Tuesday.The visit was seen as part of Seoul's efforts to strengthen the international sanctions regime against Pyongyang following its fourth nuclear test and its long-range rocket launch early this year.""In the past, Russia was very careful about mentioning North Korea,"" Yun said during the luncheon. ""They disliked criticizing the North even more and never used the word 'condemn' .""However, in a press conference following Monday's talks, the two ministers said they agreed not to recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state and to strengthen their cooperation for the North's denuclearization.""Russia has changed a lot in that it's showing its strength regarding the North Korea issue,"" Yun said.Moscow is a key stakeholder in efforts to dismantle the North's nuclear weapons program. It is one of five veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which adopted a resolution in March imposing the toughest yet sanctions on Pyongyang, and a member of the now-stalled six-party talks on the North's nuclear program.Before leaving, Yun visited a cemetery where he laid a wreath in front of a monument honoring Lee Beom-jin, Korea's diplomatic representative to the Russian Empire in the early 1900s. Lee fought for Korea's sovereignty in the face of Japanese aggression but killed himself at his St. Petersburg home in 1911 in protest of Japan's annexation of Korea.The foreign minister also toured a Hyundai Motor plant located northwest of the city, the only foreign-owned car plant in Russia that handles the entire production process from parts manufacturing to assembly.The South Korean automaker has expanded its presence in the Russian car market since it began local production in 2011. Last year, its share reached 20 percent of new cars.The 200 hectare plant produces some 200,000 cars annually for sale in and outside the country and employs more than 7,000 locals.From Russia, Yun headed to Bulgaria, where he is to hold talks with his Bulgarian counterpart Daniel Mitov later Wednesday.","ministry officials during luncheon ,korean soil during talks ,luncheon in st petersburg ,lavrov korean fm south ,officials during luncheon","[""South Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'korean', 'russian', 'Yun Byung - se', 'south korean', 'St. Petersburg', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.1453104   0.80743778

Chung Sye-kyun, sixth-term lawmaker of The Minjoo Party of Korea, was chosen for the top post, with Reps. Shim Jae-cheol of the Saenuri Party and Park Joo-sun of the People’s Party as vice speakers.“I will henceforth meet with the chiefs of the  three parties on a regular basis and respect the legislature as an equal partner in state affairs,” Park said.The president’s speech at the Assembly general meeting hall, the fifth of its kind since she took office in February 2013, came in the lasting aftermath of the April 13 general election, in which the ruling conservative Saenuri Party experienced a crushing defeat.It was also her first official encounter with the lawmaking body since vetoing a parliamentary advancement revision bill on May 27 that aims at allowing more frequent hearings, a move which deepened the feuds between Cheong Wa Dae and the opposition camp.“I believe that when it comes to the interest of the people, there can be neither ruling party, nor opposition party,” Park said.She also used the floor to once again call for the passage of government-led bills, including the labor reform bills which fizzled out in the previous parliamentary term amid partisan dissent.“The slow global economy and low oil prices have led to a supply-demand imbalance, posing a threat to our economy’s key businesses such as shipbuilding and marine transport,” Park said.“Without a drastic restructuring to cut down unnecessary costs, our entire economy could be in danger.”While admitting that the upcoming restructuring actions will result in mass layoffs, Park claimed that the most fundamental solution is to add momentum to the pending labor reforms.“Successful restructuring may only be possible when it is based on a virtuous circle of the labor market and a reinforced social network,” she said, citing a series of bills to expand unemployment allowance and to allow dispatch service of workers.Park also called for parliamentary support in pressing North Korea into giving up its nuclear armament, expressing guard against the communist regime‘s recent calls for communications.“Without denuclearization, talks of communications are but a deceit  to turn around the situations,” Park said, pointing out that the North continued its nuclear development even during denuclearization talks.“When it comes to security issues that directly involve the lives and safety of our people, there can be no compromise.”While the Saenuri Party described the president’s speech as implying true respect for the parliament, the opposition camp voiced resentment.“We take the president’s call for harmony and cooperation as a meaningful move, but more communication is needed on restructuring and North Korean nuclear issues,” the Minjoo Party’s spokesperson Rep. Park Kwang-on said through a statement.“It is disappointing that the president failed to mention government or corporate responsibility, placing focus on the labor market only.”It is also questionable whether intense sanctions are sufficient in addressing the peninsular peace issue, he added.By Bae Hyun-jung","new assembly president park ,with new assembly president ,the new parliamentary leadership ,new assembly president ,reform bills park vowed","['Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47057405  0.14958945

The boosted budget plan encompasses plans to establish missile defense systems against the North Korean missile threats -- which is also the key component of the annually announced five-year defense plans -- and to bolster welfare of the troops. According to the budget request submitted to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the ministry plans to spend 12.48 trillion won on enhancing its defensive capabilities, up 7.2 percent from this year. About 1.6 trillion won will be spent specifically on establishing the Korean Air and Missile Defense and Kill Chain systems against the North’s ballistic missiles, aimed to be complete by the mid-2020s.The indigenous defense system is part of Seoul’s plan to boost its self-defense capacities before South Korea’s regains wartime operation control of its troops from Washington. The OPCON transition, originally slated to take place in 2012, was delayed multiple times before the allies agreed on a conditional transfer around mid-2020s.About 7.8 percent of the budget is allocated to research and development, including the ongoing KF-X project to develop the country’s first homegrown fighter jets. The ministry also vowed to take care of the mental health of the conscripted soldiers by increasing the number of counselors from 369 to 406, and running a psychotherapy camp. It also raised soldiers’ salaries 10 percent, which means in the case of corporals, their 178,000 won monthly wages will be hiked to 195,800 won.Other plans include completing fortification of the military camps located in the islands near the de facto maritime inter-Korea borders in the West Sea and paving some 57 kilometer of road for strategic purposes.The Defense Ministry said it will coordinate with the Finance Ministry to confirm the budgets, which will be presented to the National Assembly for approval early September.By Yoon Min-sik","40 trillion won budget ,won 35 billion defense ,trillion won 35 billion ,35 billion defense budget ,2016 the boosted budget","['the Ministry of National Defense', 'north korean']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55531794  0.2500757

Of the 287 attending lawmakers out of the 300-member Assembly, 274 voted in approval of the motion to endorse Chung as the top lawmaker. Rep.

Chung Sye-kyun as its new speaker on Thursday, catapulting the sixth-term moderate lawmaker to the top parliamentary job in hopes of bridging partisan gaps in the opposition-controlled parliament. Of the 287 attending lawmakers out of the 300-member Assembly, 274 voted in approval of the motion to endorse Chung as the top lawmaker. Rep. Shim Jae-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party and Rep. Park Joo-sun of the third-biggest People’s Party were elected as vice speakers.The result came a day after the three major parties agreed to give the speakership to The Minjoo Party of Korea that holds the biggest number of parliamentary seats at 123. With Chung taking the speakership position, which automatically suspends his partisan membership, both the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party will have 122 seats each. Chung became the party’s nominee after beating his fellow sixth-term lawmaker Rep. Moon Hee-sang in an internal election. “The 20th National Assembly should be different from the previous assemblies,” said Chung during an acceptance speech. “I am going to make the Assembly  that deserves its name, serves in the interest of the people and upholds constitutional value,” he said.  New National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun. YonhapWith the former opposition party leader being elected as speaker, the liberal party has assumed the top legislative post for the first time in 14 years. The new speaker will serve for two years until 2018, the first half of the four-year Assembly term. Chung’s pledge to play a “proactive” role is widely expected to grant more legislative leverage to the opposition parties, with the speaker’s right to call plenary sessions to vote on budget bills and put forth motions to endorse the president’s appointment of key cabinet members. In casting himself as a leader who can also take hard-line approach, the 65-year-old politician, nicknamed “Mr. Smile,” vowed to speak his mind during his tenure. Chung is known as a skilled negotiator and for his gentleman-like attitude. “Although many fellow lawmakers see me as nonconfrontational, the 20th Assembly will demand more than a moderation. It will sometimes require vigor. Through smooth yet firm operation of the Assembly, I will be dedicated to breaking through the crisis of democracy and the economy,” Chung said.One of the imminent challenges Chung faces is the legislative confrontation over bills that failed to clear the previous Assembly and have been handed over to the new lawmakers. With no parties holding parliamentary majority, the lawmakers are expected to clash over government-led bills aimed to ease business regulation and grant the intelligence agency more authority to conduct counterterrorism efforts. They have been or are in the process of being resubmitted. The Minjoo Party, for its part, is pushing to revise a law aimed to offer compensation to the victims of the Sewol ferry sinking and toxic humidifier disinfectants. The Saenuri Party has rebuked the move as “politicization” of the incident. Chung beat former Seoul city mayor Oh Se-hoon in the latest general election. In 2010, he served as the leader of then-opposition Democratic Party, a forerunner to the Minjoo Party, and brought the party to a victory in the 2010 by-election. Chung ran for nomination in the 2012 presidential election, but was defeated by Moon Jae-in who became the party’s eventual presidential nominee. Since his term ends in 2018, Chung will not run in the 2017 presidential race.

We continue to pursue action with our regional and international partners, as well as international bodies,"" Ory Abramowicz, a State Department spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency.The spokesman, however, declined to comment on the report.""We refer you to the concerns Director of National Intelligence James Clapper expressed in February during Congressional testimony about North Korea's potential to reprocess plutonium,"" Abramowicz said. Clapper said at the time that the North had run the 5-megawatt reactor long enough to harvest plutonium ""within a matter of weeks to months."" ""We call on North Korea to refrain from actions and rhetoric that further raise tensions in the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments,"" Abramowicz said.Later in the day, State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner also expressed concern.""I don't want to get into too much detail because it veers very quickly into intelligence. But of course, speaking broadly about the issue, we're concerned that North Korea could have access to materials that would allow it to produce nuclear weapons, more nuclear weapons,"" he said at a regular press briefing.Earlier this week, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano said there are indications that the North could have started nuclear reprocessing. Private U.S. research institutes, citing commercial satellite imagery, have also reported signs of the North running or preparing to run the reprocessing plant, such as smoke from a coal-fired plant providing steam for reprocessing activity.The graphite-moderated reactor has been the source of weapons-grade plutonium for the communist nation. The small reactor is capable of producing spent fuel rods that, if reprocessed, could give the regime enough plutonium to make at least one bomb a year.The reactor has provided Pyongyang with weapons-grade plutonium that the regime used in its first three nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009 and 2013. The North conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6, claiming it successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.","begun reprocessing spent nuclear ,fuel to harvest plutonium ,nuclear fuel to harvest ,reprocessing spent nuclear fuel ,plutonium senior state department","['United States', ""North Korea 's"", 'the State Department', 'State Department', 'Reuters', 'Yongbyon']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39574909  0.12029726

He also studied in China at a research institute as a special representative for the Korean government earlier this year.Kim Jae-won, then ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker, talks to President Park Geun-hye, then candidate for the party’s presidential nominee, at a joint debate in Jeju in 2007. The Blue House’s personnel announcement came abruptly, just three days after the president’s return from her recent 12-day trip to three African states and France.Last month, following the resignation of presidential chief of staff Lee Byung-kee, Park named Lee Won-jong as the new chief of staff and former Saenuri lawmaker Rep. Kang Seog-hoon as senior secretary for economic affairs. Former economic chief An Chong-bum was relocated as senior secretary for policy coordination.The overall reshuffle is taken as the president’s gesture for reform in the wake of the ruling party’s defeat in the April 13 general election, as well as a move to tighten control during the remaining period of her term, which is to end in February 2018.But her choice of figures drew mixed reactions from the opposition camp. While the main opposition approved, runner-up minority parties blamed the president for favoring close aides and disregarding the public calls to eradicate factional divides.“We expect that  Kim will respect the legislature and communicate smoothly with the opposition,” said Lee Jae-kyung, spokesperson of The Minjoo Party of Korea.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chief of the People’s Party, expressed regrets over the president’s decision, claiming that it failed to reflect the public sentiment.“As a key pro-Park member, Kim may be fit to understand the president’s statecraft but is not likely to play a bridging role ,” Rep. Son Kum-ju, chief spokesperson of the party, also said.The more progressive Justice Party, too, argued that the point of the reshuffle was to “salvage” pro-Park members who dropped out of the party’s primary and thus failed to make it into the 20th National Assembly.Besides the disputed senior secretary for political affairs, Hyun Dai-won, professor of journalism at Sogang University and front-runner in virtual reality industry, was appointed as senior secretary for future strategy, while Kim Yong-seung, vice president of the Catholic University of Korea as senior secretary for educational and cultural affairs.The presidential office also appointed three new vice ministers.Kim Hyung-suk, presidential secretary for unification, was named vice minister of the Unification Ministry.Lee Joon-won, senior official in charge of food industry policy at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, was promoted to the ministry’s vice-ministerial post.As for the Environment Ministry, Lee Chung-seop, senior official in charge of environmental policy, was promoted to vice minister.By Bae Hyun-jung","president reshuffles key advisers ,reshuffles key advisers president ,new senior secretary for ,her key senior secretaries ,president reshuffles key","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Jae - won', 'Saenuri Party', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66685212  0.04181585

Named “Agenda 2050,” the panpartisan entity consists of 12 lawmakers including prominent centrists such as Rep. Kim Chong-in, the chairman of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, and Rep. Yoo Seong-min, an independent who had until earlier this year served as the ruling Saenuri Party’s floor leader.  The Minjoo Party of Korea’s chairman Rep. Kim Chong-in  greets former Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min at a meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. An hoon/ Korea Herald.Borrowing its name from the famous social reform plan led by the German government in 2003, the group would work on developing initiatives targeting overhauls in education, employment, welfare, taxation and administration. The group intends to work with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Other members include chief policymaker for the People’s Party, Rep. Kim Song-sik.“It is a panpartisan study group to discuss strategies for Korea’s future policies,” said Rep. Kim Se-yeon, a third-term Saenuri lawmaker who led efforts to form the group. “We have recruited people who can share our views regardless of their  political spectrum.”The third-term lawmaker said they would focus on developing welfare policy tailored to specific demographics, reinforcing the safety net for the unemployed and narrowing income gaps between the wealthy and the underprivileged, among other goals. The centrist lawmaker stressed there is “no political purpose” in forming the group.But speculation has grown nonetheless about the political implications of the move, mainly due to its high-profile list of members, many of whom have been thrust into the political limelight after clashing with President Park Geun-hye over difference in policies. For instance, Minjoo Party leader Kim had been one of the chief strategists for Park, who was then presidential candidate of the Saenuri Party. But the former economics professor quit his job in 2012 as Park refused to endorse his signature policy of “economic democratization.” He later joined the main opposition party in 2015.The same goes for former Saenuri floor leader Yoo. The fourth-term lawmaker began his political career by working as a chief of staff for then-lawmaker Park, but the relationship turned sour as the former economics professor openly denounced the president’s welfare policy and her dealings with the legislative body. Rep. Kim Se-yeon is also considered close to Yoo. He was one of few Saenuri members who suggested that Yoo should be able to return to the party. Yoo left the party before the April general election in protest of the party’s decision to drop his nomination. He then went on to win his seat as an independent. “We are going to hold an opening event and begin our job within this month,” said Kim. “In the meantime, we want to focus on coming up with specific policies and an agenda. We are not planning to add more members just to promote ourselves,” he said.  By Yeo Jun-suk","12 lawmakers including prominent ,reform agenda tuesday fueling ,next year presidential election ,election named agenda 2050 ,advance reform agenda tuesday","['Agenda 2050', 'Kim Chong - in']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05419324  0.29263201

Kim Moo-sung, the former chairman, stepped down shortly after the general elections.Saenuri not only lost the majority but secured just 122 seats in the National Assembly out of 300 up for grabs. Although it could emerge as the No. 1 player if it secures independent lawmakers, the election result reflected the public's discontent toward the ruling camp.Since the resignation of Kim Moo-sung, the party has been struggling with a power vacuum that reignited infighting between the non- and pro-President Park Geun-hye factions.The appointment was made after key senior members discussed ways to reorganize the party's overall structure to grant more power to a single leader last month. In the past, the party employed a collective leadership system that has been cited for fueling internal discord and bickering, which was one reason for the poor showing in the recent elections. As the ruling party held nine council leaders, such meetings regularly failed to produce significant results.Last month, the party attempted to kick off emergency planning and innovation committees headed by Rep. Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader, and Rep. Kim Yong-tae, respectively. The plan failed from backlash from the pro-Park faction within the party.","interim head thursday ,month after rep kim ,its interim head thursday ,interim head thursday as ,former chairman stepped down","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'the Government Public Ethics Committee', 'Kim Moo - sung']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36722615  0.31432259

Hong was a prominent prosecutor investigating major corruption cases that involved the country's former presidents. He stepped down from office in 2011 and worked as a lawyer.

Currently, the price of diesel is maintained at 85 percent that of gasoline, based on an energy policy set in 2005.But the price hike plan was immediately countered by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.The Finance Ministry cited the negative impacts of the tax hike on domestic industries, while the Land Ministry expressed concerns over the diesel-reliant public transportation industry.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party, too, stood against the diesel price hike plan.“Increasing the diesel price will only add burden on the people and may not be an effective counterplan to fine dust,” floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told reporters Wednesday.“On the contrary,  should consider lowering the price of gasoline.”Amid such ongoing conflicts, the related ministries held a closed-door meeting over the weekend under the supervision of the presidential office of government coordination, but once again failed to reach a consensus.Their common dilemma is that the president, who is currently on a 12-day overseas trip and will return Sunday, will be requesting an immediate solution blueprint.Cheong Wa Dae has so far refrained from elucidating its stance over the inter-ministry feuds, claiming that a comprehensive counterplan was still under discussion.The opposition circles pointed at the presidential office for triggering slipshod competition among the ministries for a solution to fine dust without a vision or responsibility for the consequences.“Government ministries are lost in confusion and without a control tower, while the president is absent on an overseas tour and the Prime Minister’s Office is failing to take charge,” said Kim Chong-in, interim chief of The Minjoo Party of Korea.By Bae Hyun-jung","fine dust measures president ,dust measures president park ,dust measures president ,measures president park geun ,president park geun hye",['Park Geun - hye ’s'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24242827  0.66540796

Third from left, former CEO of Oxy Korea Shin Hyun-woo The 68-year-old, who headed the company between 1991 and 2005, has been charged with homicide by negligence, according to prosecutors. Oxy started selling its products here in 2001.Two other former and current company officials, as well as the chief of another humidifier sterilizer maker, Cefu, identified only by his surname Oh were indicted at the same time. Prosecutors said they also summarily indicted Oxy Korea and Cefu to pay 150 million won  in fines each.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.South Korea confirmed 221 people as victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products. Out of 90 deaths, 70 are believed to have been caused by products made by Oxy.In early May, Oxy Korea CEO Ata Safdar made an official apology and vowed to fully cooperate with the Korean government in the ongoing investigation. Now the focus is on whether the company‘s British headquarters was aware of the health risks of its disinfectants.","sterilizer probe prosecutors indicted ,toxic sterilizer probe prosecutors ,korea indicted in toxic ,prosecutors indicted former chief ,probe prosecutors indicted former","['south korean', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'british', 'Shin Hyun - woo', 'Oxy K']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25359839  0.52260703

I am speechless.” Hong Man-pyo enters the building of the Seoul CEntral District Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul to be questioned on FridayLater in the day, the prosecutors indicted judge-turned-lawyer Choi You-jeong on charges of taking advantage of her status as a former judge to seek a favorable ruling for Jung.

Jung was indicted last October on charges of illegal gambling from 2012 to 2014 overseas including in Macau and the Philippines.

Last Thursday, the National Assembly had passed the bill that allows standing committees to call for public hearings to deliberate and investigate on any agendas considered important.Cheong Wa Dae has been openly disgruntled with the bill, claiming that it could be used a political tool that can paralyze the executive branch. Park, who is currently in Africa on a 12-day trip to Ethiopia Uganda, Kenya and France, exercised the veto power through the electronic approval system, Cheong Wa Dae said. This is the 66th veto power exercised by the president in Korean history and the second veto by the Park Geun-hye administration. “The bill is  introducing the legislative’s new control measure against the executive branch, which does not come in accord with the Constitution that ensures the division of powers, check and balance,” said Hwang.The veto, although widely anticipated, quickly doused prospects of a sound opening of the next Assembly on Monday, with the issue likely to overcloud pending discussion over how to form the new parliament. The parties had agreed to meet the deadline of electing the new speaker by June 7 and new chairpersons for standing committees by June 9.The opposition parties slammed Park’s veto, insisting that they would collectively push for the same bill in the 20th National Assembly slated to kick off Monday. “The three floor leaders of the opposition parties vowed to pass the bill in the next parliament.  is very shameful and immature. The public will criticize it, thinking that the government still has not come to itself, although the government was judged by the public in the April general election,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. After a presidential veto, the Assembly must revote on it and it requires at least two thirds of approval with over half of the lawmakers attending. The ruling party has been claiming that with the end of the current Assembly, a revote is not valid and that the bill is automatically terminated.The opposition, on the other hand, contends that the Constitution holds up the validity of a bill that has been endorsed before the end of the session regardless of a presidential veto. The Constitution Article 51 stipulates that bills submitted to the parliament shall not be abandoned on the grounds that they were not endorsed during the session in which they were introduced, except in a case in which the term of the lawmakers has expired. “It cannot be repealed automatically. According to the interpretation of law experts we discussed with, repassing the bill is possible in the next parliament,” said People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won. The parties also said that if the Assembly secretariat decides against the legitimacy of the revote, they would consider filing the case with the Constitutional Court for review, or resubmit the same bill for another round. The ruling Saenuri Party, however, defended Park’s move, claiming that the decision is the president’s own right. “The veto power is the president’s exclusive authority that should not be considered as a taboo. It is reasonable that the work of the 19th National Assembly is wrapped up in the 19th parliament. Resubmitting the bill in the 20th National Assembly that was submitted by the 19th parliament lawmakers is not legal,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.

Park is currently in Africa on a 12-day trip to Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and France.The bill, passed last week, has caused a rift between the opposition parties that favor the change and the government, which voiced concerns that hearings will be used as a political tool and paralyze the executive branch. The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae has also maintained the bill will heavily burden state affairs.The revision to the National Assembly Act was handed over to the government for final review and presidential endorsement.""The revision to the National Assembly Act may be unconstitutional,"" Hwang said. ""The opening of more hearings could be considered a move by lawmakers to dominate the administration.This does not match with the constitutional idea of separation and balance of power.""The premier added the excessive request for hearings made by the parliament may emerge as a burden for the people, adding it could also bring about privacy infringement issues.""The revision could virtually make all activities of the administration face hearings. It could burden state affairs, which would eventually inconvenience the people.""Cheong Wa Dae voiced its hope that the hearings bill would no longer cause any political dispute and that the incoming National Assembly would focus on revitalizing the economy and improving people's livelihoods rather than getting mired in partisan politics.Presidential spokesman Jeong Yeon-guk told reporters that Park would endorse the Cabinet's decision through an electronic approval system.Opposition parties immediately protested against the decision made by the Cabinet.Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, said he is certain that the public will be angered by the government's ""ambush"" of exercising a veto during Park's trip. The party whip said the opposition parties will bring back the bill in the new parliament that kicks off next week.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, said the bill should automatically be scrapped, adding that it should not be discussed at the 20th National Assembly. Ruling party lawmakers, in particular, argued that due to the extreme partisan nature of South Korean politics, the bill's passage will only result in endless wrangling.The move by the Cabinet was anticipated because on Tuesday, South Korea's Cabinet approved a package of new bills, including the country's first comprehensive anti-terrorism bill that the government stresses is critical for safeguarding the country from acts of violence spreading across the globe. The earlier meeting, however, did not touch on the contentious bill. According to South Korea's Constitution, a law handed to the government by the National Assembly must be declared by the president within 15 days. But if the president exercises a veto, the bill can be discussed again at the parliament. The veto, however, cannot outline how it should be revised.In regards to the future of the bill, the country's legislation ministry claims that the rejected bill cannot be discussed at the 20th National Assembly. This view is also shared by the National Assembly Secretariat that said a vetoed bill will be automatically scrapped unless it is handled within the 19th National Assembly that ends its four-year term Sunday.On the other hand, some legal experts said banning the 20th National Assembly from reconsidering the controversial bill would violate the nature of the veto system, which is aimed at creating a balance. It marked the 66th time for a South Korean president to exercise a veto since the establishment of the Constitution.","president park vetoes parliamentary ,korea cabinet on friday ,park vetoes parliamentary hearings ,president park vetoes ,rare veto by president","[""South Korea 's"", 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Ethiopia', 'Uganda', 'Kenya', 'France']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.40671971  0.45331854

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a native of the region, is emerging as a potential presidential contender, observers said Thursday.The relatively politically neutral region has traditionally been perched on the political periphery while the conservative southeastern Yeongnam region and progressive southwestern Honam region have held stronger sway over South Korean politics in the past.But Chungcheong has recently been moving toward the center of the political scene with some of its politicians garnering top posts in the government and political parties. They include presidential chief of staff Lee Won-jong, and Chung Jin-suk and Rep. Hong Moon-pyo -- the ruling Saenuri Party's floor leader and acting secretary-general, respectively.On the back of the momentum for the rising region, Ban is now being touted as a possible odds-on favorite who can win in next year's presidential vote.  The backing from some ruling party lawmakers loyal to Park Geun-hye -- whose support base is in the Yeongnam region -- could further brighten the prospects of Ban winning in the crucial election, political watchers said.""The reason why keen attention is being paid to Ban is there is no clear presidential hopeful in the ruling party,"" Rep. Kim Tae-heum of the Saenuri Party, a native of the Chungcheong region, said, indicating that the potential for the U.N. chief to clinch his party's ticket for the presidential vote is high.Saenuri Party lawmakers, closely affiliated with the president, have repeatedly floated the idea of Ban running in the presidential election. This has spawned speculation that Ban could gain considerable voter support from the Yeongnam region as well as the Chungcheong region.However, region-based politics could draw a backlash from voters, some observers said, noting that it is an anachronistic concept that has distorted Korean politics and undermined national unity.""There could be the possibility that some would take issue with the fact that a rare candidate from the Chungcheong region is sowing discord in politics,"" an official of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea said, declining to be identified.Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University, said that election campaigns based on ""regional sentiment"" are the main culprits that have caused Korean politics to ""retrogress.""Meanwhile, with Ban in the political limelight, his close confidants and associates drew renewed attention.Given his longtime career in diplomatic circles, the cadre of his aides largely includes former and current diplomats such as former Foreign Ministers Song Min-soon and Kim Sung-hwan, and South Korea's envoy to the U.N. Oh Joon.Members of the Chungcheong Forum, a group of prominent figures in politics, government, journalism, the judiciary and other fields, could also actively support Ban should he officially throw his hat in the ring.","presidential contender observers ,in politics emerges talk ,potential presidential contender observers ,presidential contender ,politics is surfacing","[""South Korea 's"", 'Chungcheong Province', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Yeongnam']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.85233772  0.21494311

Gay Korean couple Kim Jho Gwang-soo, 51, and his partner Kim Sung-hwan, 32, make remarks in a press conference held in Jongno-gu, central Seoul, to criticize a court’s refusal to recognize same-sex marriage. YonhapThe Seoul Western District Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition by the filmmaker couple seeking legal status for their same-sex marriage, saying that a separate legislative step is needed to recognize it as legitimate. According to the court, not recognizing same-sex marriage does not violate the principle of equality, as marriage should be seen as a union between a man and woman who can give birth and bring up children to sustain society under current law. The court decision came after local authorities denied their application to register for marriage, citing the absence of legal clauses. The couple filed a suit against the district office in May 2014. While homosexuality is not banned in South Korea, the nation does not recognize same-sex marriage. Legally married couples are entitled to various benefits including the right to share assets, medical insurance and pension, among others. “The South Korean court says we are not allowed to get married because we are both men. How long will it take for the government to recognize us as couple?” posed Kim at a press conference held in central Seoul.“I hope the court musters up its courage to put an end to the institution of marriage discriminating against same-sex couple.” Civil groups in support of sexual minorities also slammed the court for “shifting its responsibility” to the legislative body, pledging to fight for equal rights. “I, as a lesbian living with my same-sex partner for four years now, think that the court made a bad decision, giving up its role as a judicial branch,” said Lee Ho-rim of Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea. “It is the judicial branch’s responsibility to tackle violation of basic human rights on the ground of gender.”Their legal representatives said they would file a separate suit for two other gay and lesbian couples whose applications for marriage at the local authority were rejected. Sexual minorities still live largely on the fringes of Korean society, as the majority of Koreans remain intolerant of homosexuality, with the latest Gallup poll ranking Korea at 69th among 123 nations in terms of gay-friendliness in 2013. According to a 2014 survey by the National Human Rights Council of Korea of 518 sexual minorities, 44.4 percent said that they had suffered discrimination and bullying at least once at work.

""Though geographically far apart, Korea and Ethiopia became brothers by blood in the 1950s during the Korean War,"" she said.During the first major armed conflict of the Cold War, Ethiopia deployed to the Korean Peninsula more than 6,000 troops of its battalion, named ""Kagnew"" -- meaning establishing order from chaos. To honor those ""Kagnew heroes,"" Park plans to participate in the ceremony on Friday to commemorate the 65th anniversary of their participation in the war, she said.Beyond the expansion of economic cooperation, Park pledged to bolster South Korea's support in the areas of health care and nutrition through its ""Korea Aid"" project, share its know-how on socio-economic development with Ethiopia, and increase cultural and people-to-people exchanges.""I hope that through all such forms of cooperation, our two nations will further cherish and nurture our bonds of blood and friendship, and establish a mutually beneficial partnership in which we can learn and grow together,"" she said.South Korea is seeking to explore new business opportunities in the African continent, while Ethiopia hopes to gain development support from the Asia's fourth-largest economy.Ethiopia has been pushing for an ambitious 10-year growth plan, called ""Vision 2025.""

The interview had also been interrupted for about 30 minutes so the daughter, identified only by her surname Kim, could secure a cassette player so she could play with accompaniment. Prosecutors, however, said there is no regulation banning applicants from revealing their personal information, including members of their family, in the admission rules for disabled students. They also said applicants are not required to bring any musical devices for background music but are also not prevented from using them as well, so providing a person a cassette player cannot be seen as giving undue favor.","lawmaker prosecutors said monday ,reporter indicted over defaming ,indicted local journalist ,have indicted local journalist ,monday they have indicted","[""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", ""Sungshin Women 's University"", 'Na Kyung - won']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48649573  0.72543418

The outgoing Assembly held its last plenary session last week during which they shelved all the remaining bills of contention.“The government feels grave responsibility and the labor unions and the political parties should feel the same.”Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon Lee said he will arrange a meeting of the ruling Saenuri Party and the government to fast track the next steps as soon as the next Assembly formally opens on May 30.Youth unemployment has reached 1.21 million as of March this year, according to the ministry. The government has been pushing to introduce several measures including the wage peak system, which gradually decreases the salaries of employees past retirement age to make the employment market more flexible. The government and the ruling Saenuri Party have motioned five relevant revision bills -- the labor standards act, the industrial accident compensation insurance act, the employment insurance act, the dispatched work act and the short-term worker protection act.The bills have remained untouched as the tripartite committee of the government, the businesses and the labor union was suspended last year. The deal fell through when the union objected to the government’s unilateral release of draft administration guideline that they contended breached the due process of negotiation. The union and the opposition parties have also objected to most of the five bills that they contend are favorable towards the businesses and would increase contract-based workers with minimized protection. The tripartite committee meeting on labor reform has since been held without the attendance of the labor’s representative.","labor reform bills failed ,sunday he will push ,push to resubmit bills ,next national assembly opens ,labor minister pledges to","['Labor', 'Lee Ki - kweon', 'National Assembly', 'Lee', 'Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59233463  0.11021303

They suggest that new political entities are needed to overhaul factional strife and reform-minded moderates should rally behind the move.Fomenting such an atmosphere is the aggravating internal feud at the ruling Saenuri Party, which has failed to appoint an interim leadership amid heavy power struggle amongst factions defined by their perceived loyalty to President Park Geun-hye. Some party members predicted the party would eventually split across factional lines.Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk  sits next to The Minjoo Party of Korea’s interim chief Kim Chong-in and People’s Party‘s chairman Ahn Cheol-soo during a memorial service for former National Assembly Speaker Kim Jae-soon at the National Assembly on Saturday. Among the moderates aiming to seize the momentum is ex-opposition leader Sohn Hak-kyu. The former Gyeonggi governor, who had competed to run for the 2007 presidential election, announced Wednesday that he would build a “new system” in politics. “The people are asking us to bring a new system into politics,” said Sohn. His top aides noted that his reference to the “new system” indicates sweeping realignment that goes beyond onetime coalition among opposition parties designed to win an election.  The former political science professor, who has stayed out of politics since his decision to end his political career after his election defeat in 2014, is expected to announce his return to politics in July when his advisory groups mark their 10th anniversary, according to sources.Outgoing National Assembly speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa is another heavyweight joining the fray. The four-term lawmaker, who had been a Saenuri member until his speaker position, stepped into the political limelight when he challenged President Park and her faction over her vetoing a law passed by the lawmakers last June. Chung, whose term ends on May 30, said that he would launch “political association” this October that can attract reform-minded moderate politicians. Chung has not run for the 20th Assembly. He also said he was not sure whether to return to the Saenuri Party.“I heard many politicians are showing their interest in the new political association. We would later decide whether the organization should take the form of a political party,” Chung told the reporters after presiding over final plenary session Thursday. Whether the realignment would attract political momentum hinges on the outcome of the Saenuri Party’s national convention. The event is to elect the party leadership slated to take place between late July and early August. Some party members said that if the party fails to elect the leadership capable of the factional feud, the party would be divided between the faction close to the president and its dissenters. “A lot of changes would take place after the event,” said third-term lawmaker Rep. Chung Doo-won. One of the changes coming into play is U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Ban, who has been consistently mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, will visit South Korea this week with just some six months left before the end of his term at the U.N. Though the former South Korea foreign minister has not specified his plans after finishing his 10-year tenure, local media and political pundits have speculated that he could run in the 2017 presidential election as a candidate from the Saenuri Party.Other politicians from the opposition bloc showed mixed reaction to the rising calls for political realignment among the conservatives. The third-largest People’s Party welcomed the move, while main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea called it a political gimmick.  “If some Saenuri dissenters defect from their party, we are willing to accept those who can share our values,” said the People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. But he dismissed the possibility of forming a coalition with the Saenuri Party. The Minjoo Party’s leader Kim Chong-in and its floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho said that the debate over the political realignment was “too early” and will not serve the interests of the people.

The scene was symbolic of the political divide and social disputes that still remain in Korea over what is internationally recognized as a civilian revolt against the dictatorial military regime, 36 years after the bloody incident.Families of those who lost their lives in the May Uprising protest against Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs Park Sung-choon during the commemoration ceremony in Gwangju on Wednesday. In 1979, the abrupt assassination of iron-fisted leader Park Chung-hee -- incumbent President Park Geun-hye’s father -- left the nation in hopes of bringing democracy at last.Such hopes were quickly dashed in December, after Gen. Chun Doo-hwan took over the government through a military coup. The disgruntled public in Gwangju rose against the military regime at Chonnam National University on May 18, 1980, only to be mowed down by the military in the days to come. To this day, the number of civilian casualties remains uncertain, ranging from the stated 144 by the then-martial law command to the media estimates of over 1,000.The military regime’s attempt to frame the May 18 Democratic Uprising as a rebellion initiated by the North Korean troops and their sympathizers was all but debunked, with foreign journalists like the late Jurgen Hinzpeter reporting and civilian groups working to unearth facts related to the movement.In 2011, the 1980 Archives for the May 18th Democratic Uprising was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.But the “North Korean intervention” conspiracy lingers on in Korea via civic groups, the Internet and even mainstream media.In 2013, local cable broadcasters TV Chosun and Channel A drew fire for interviewing North Korean defectors and ultra-right panels who claimed the Gwangju Uprising was sparked by North Korean troops, without presenting actual evidence.The Korea Communications Standards Commission subsequently issued a warning and disciplinary actions against those involved, saying airing uncensored, baseless claims are a violation of the regulation.“A disciplinary action is inevitable as gross distortion of a historical fact that has been proven both legally and socially can infringe upon the assessment of the meaning behind the May 19 Uprising,” the commission said.Last month, columnist Jee Man-won was indicted on a charge of claiming that a citizen who participated in the May Uprising was a member of the North Korean special forces team.Those who believe North Korea interfered in the 1980 incident are in the minority. Last week’s survey by the May 18 Memorial Foundation on those 19 years of age and older showed that 9.6 percent of the respondents believed the uprising was related to Pyongyang.Experts say the root of the distortion comes from the claims of the Chun regime. Lee Yun-seop, the author of the book “1980 Korea,” quoted a May 1980 report by the South Korean Army that analyzed intel that North Korea was planning to invade the South around May 15-20, when the “disturbance” was at its peak. The report said there was very little possibility of an invasion, given that Pyongyang’s then-leader Kim Il-sung was visiting Yugoslavia at the time, and that there were no signs of imminent war.Ironically, Chun -- the man believed to be primarily responsible for the violent suppression of the protestors -- said in a recent interview he had received no reports of the North Korean troops invading Gwangju. During the interview, he also ducked responsibility for the Army’s shooting of protesters.Oh Seung-yong, a research professor at Chonnam National University’s May 18 Institute, recently released a paper pinpointing the military regime as the source of conspiracy theories relating to May 18.“The distortion theories currently being advocated by the conservatives are merely adding details to the claims made by the martial law command,” he said in the paper.Oh contended that it is the ultraconservatives that spread faulty rumors on the May 18 Uprising, saying it is because they feel threatened by the surge of liberals, many of whom find political roots in the democratization movements in the 1980s.Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces remain a very liberal region, with around 70-80 percent of citizens there voting for liberal candidates in each election.With the Gwangju Uprising becoming a symbol for the liberal faction, the event itself is often embroiled in ideological and political disputes.Singing of “March for Our Beloved” -- controversial for its lyrics written by a person suspected to be pro-North and later being used in a North Korean movie -- has been representative of the standoff.Up to 2008, all attendees of the May 18 ceremony were required to sing the song. But it became optional in 2009, the second year of the conservative President Lee Myung-bak administration.The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, in charge of the ceremony, said it was to avoid “division of public opinion” from having everyone sing the controversial song.By Yoon Min-sik","politicization taint gwangju uprising ,government officials looked uncomfortable ,distortion politicization taint gwangju ,taint gwangju uprising ,politicization taint gwangju","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hyun Ki - hwan', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11149257 -0.23468183

Nearly 10,000 pending bills are likely to be scrapped unless they manage to receive final parliamentary approval by May 29.At the heart of the clash is the series of economic bills to relax regulations on the service industry and the labor market. While the ruling Saenuri Party has been touting these bills as key tools to revitalize the economy, the opposition bloc has denounced them as widening the social and economic gaps.The Minjoo Party of Korea and the runner-up opposition People’s Party, for their part, have called for legislation to help toxic humidifier victims and to extract punitive damage compensations from the product manufacturing companies. The Saenuri Party has been reluctant to introduce the bill, though it did consent to a special parliamentary hearing on the issue.Last week’s meeting between Cheong Wa Dae and the parliamentary whips reconfirmed the gap in opinions of the parties. The attendants, despite their consensus on the need to boost government-legislature communication, failed to make a breakthrough on the contentious bills.“It was unfortunate that we haven’t seen any progress on sensitive bills,” said the Minjoo’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho after the meeting, highlighting that President Park Geun-hye dismissed the bill related to humidifier as “something that needs further parliamentary discussion.”Even the “undisputed bills” remain pending amid the slowed pace of the outgoing assembly. Rep. Kim Do-eup of the Saenuri Party on Thursday said that some 120 undisputed bills would clear the Assembly. Until now, only 37 bills have been tabled for the plenary session. What further impedes the passage of the bills is that the parliamentary committees have yet to schedule their meetings to deliberate on the bills. Last week, the committees dealing with Sewol and labor bills failed to make a breakthrough, after which they have not yet arranged another meeting.The legislative impasse appeared to be exacerbated by the changed political landscape following the latest general election on April 13.The opposition bloc, having earned a parliamentary majority, has been growing vocal over its key agendas.But the Saenuri Party, which has been demoted as the No. 2 party, has been relatively slack over pending bills, preoccupied by its persisting factional strife and leadership selection dispute.Yeo Jun-suk","their eleventh hour struggles ,session slated for thursday ,10 000 pending bills ,final plenary session slated ,contentious bills passed before",['National Assembly'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22745155  0.19045959

In March, the U.K. announced a plan to impose a new tax on sugary drinks. In 2014, Berkeley city council in California introduced a “soda tax,” becoming the first jurisdiction in the U.S. to pass penalty taxes on the sugar-sweetened beverages. South Korea has also joined the move to reduce sugar intake. In April, the government said that it aimed to cut down on the amount of sugar consumed by Koreans to 10 percent of their daily diet by 2020. It plans to require manufacturers to specify the level of sugar in their products. But it is only in recent times that sugar has become known as a harmful substance. When sugar was first discovered by the people of New Guinea in around B.C. 8,000, it was considered as a panacea for illness and the epitome of wealth. The 12th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas famously wrote “eating sugar is not breaking a religious fast because it was a medicine taken to aid digestion,” when confronted with the question of where consuming sugar should fall fasting rules. A renowned anthropologist Sidney Mintz said in his book “Swiftness and Power,” one of the most influential publications about food history, that sugar served at dinner was used as an indicator of the wealth of aristocrats in Europe. Sugar enjoys similar popularity in present-day South Korea. The Shinsegae Museum of Korean Commercial History shows that sugar was one of the most sought-after gifts during holidays, alongside flour, eggs and sesame oil. People often served sugar water to guests at home. “As recently as the 1960s, there were not enough dietary supplements to make you felt reinvigorated. People were drinking sugar water when they felt tired and sick. It is pretty much the same as getting a glucose injection,” said a public relation official from the Korea Sugar Association. The origin of sugar in Korea dates back to the 13th century. It first appeared in the literary work “Pahanjib,” authored by poet and politician Lee In-ro in 1260 during the Goryeo Dynasty. Historians said that sugar was introduced before then and came from China. Back then, it was a luxury product used by elites. It was only in the early 20th century that the public gained access to sugar. Sugary cookies and pies, imported from Japan, were introduced to the people. In 1922, the first sugar refinery was established in Pyongyang by a Japanese company. The Korean-owned sugar company was built in 1953 by Lee Byung-chul, founder of Samsung Group. CheilJedang, which has now become the biggest food company here, was capable of producing 25 tons of sugar per day by processing raw sugar, which was given to the war-torn country as foreign aid. The massive production eased the nation’s reliance on imported sugar. Back in 1953, Korea had imported all sugar from Japan and elsewhere. But the proportion of imported sugar dropped several years later and only 7 percent of sugar was imported in 1956.With more sugar being produced, its consumption soared too. According the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the amount of sugar consumed has increased almost 20 times over the past 60 years. In 1953, Koreans on average ate 984 grams of sugar a year, but the amount rose to 22 kilograms in 2012.

As for controversial agendas such as the toxic humidifier disinfectant investigation and the legislation of the Sewol special act, Park said that parties should reach a consensus among themselves. But they also agreed to establish a pan-partisan consultation committee on the humidifier disinfectant case if necessary. “The president and the floor leadership of the three parties agreed to hold a president-party leader meeting every quarter,” senior presidential secretary for public affairs Kim Sung-woo told reporters.“She also requested that the economic deputy prime minister and the party policy chiefs soon hold a meeting to inspect the nation’s economic situations.” President Park Geun-hye holds hands with the floor leaders and policy chiefs of the top three political parties prior to their meeting on Friday. YonhapThe consensus was reached during Park’s rare 82-minute meeting with the floor leaders and policy chief of the top three parties. The occasion was also her first official encounter with members of the incoming 20th National Assembly since the April 13 general election.Representing the ruling conservative Saenuri Party on this day was its floor leader Chung Jin-suk. From The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party, Reps. Woo Sang-ho and Park Jie-won were present. All three were respectively accompanied by their policy committee chiefs.It was due to the current vacancies of formal leadership in the Saenuri and Minjoo parties that the presidential office decided to first invite the floor leaders and policy committee chairmen. The two parties, currently steered by interim chiefs, are slated to elect new leadership in their upcoming national convention.“It was the People‘s Party’s Rep. Park Jie-won who suggested the regular meeting with the party chiefs, after all three parties confirm their new leadership,” said a senior Cheong Wa Dae official.“The president consented, adding that the frequency could be increased  if necessary.”Park has often faced criticism about lacking communication with the parliament. Since taking office in February 2013, she has so far held six meetings with party leaderships, only one of them including floor leaders.The meeting kicked off in an amicable mood, with the president greeting and shaking hands with each party official. She first shook hands with main opposition whip Rep. Woo, before reaching out to her home party whip Chung.But the opposition bloc, while acknowledging the positive outcome of the meeting, also pointed out its limits.“President Park has achieved meaningful results in her recent state visit to Iran but has shown little progress on  issues such as the revision of the Sewol act,” Woo said in a briefing to sum up the presidential meeting.Park urged that parties should first reach a consensus among themselves on whether to revise the controversial Sewol act or to set up a parliamentary task force on humidifier disinfectant case, according to Cheong Wa Dae.By Bae Hyun-jung","regularly meet party leaders ,meet party leaders president ,hye agreed on friday ,on friday to meet ,to regularly meet party","['Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.49678001  0.52898651

Choi is accused of taking a total of about 10 billion won  from two clients -- cosmetics firm Nature Republic CEO Jung Woon-ho and an investment firm owner surnamed Song. Jung was accused of gambling while Song was accused of fraud.Choi allegedly promised to help lessen their punishments by using her connections in legal circles as a former judge.Choi had reportedly asked a chief prosecutor to cut Jung’s penalty. In the appeals case, the prosecution had sought a 2 1/2-year jail term, which was four months shorter than what it had previously sought in the first trial.Her attempt to cut Jung’s sentencing, however, fell through and Choi reportedly returned 3 billion won. The case was brought to light after Jung and Choi had a spat over the failed attempt.For Song, who was facing investment fraud charges, Choi had also reportedly called her former colleagues. However, he was sentenced to a 13-year jail term last month. In another fraud case in which Song was involved last year, his penalty was lessened from a four-year prison term to a three-year jail term with five years of probation when Choi served as his attorney in the appeals case.

The main opposition Minjoo Party and the People's Party secured 123 and 38 seats, respectively.Seventeen other seats are held by other minor party members and independents.The change in the political landscape means that Park must work closely with parliament to pass a set of bills that she says are vital to reviving the sluggish economy.Chung Jin-suk, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, has said that Park and other participants can discuss ways to cooperate on state affairs, including people's livelihoods.A senior presidential official has said the agenda for the meeting could also include how to deal with security threats posed by North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs.The main opposition Minjoo Party said Thursday that it will raise such issues as toxic humidifier sterilizers, job creation and household debt at the meeting on Friday.Toxic humidifier sterilizers have become a high-profile issue in South Korea as prosecutors launched a probe into the products that have been blamed for numerous deaths and illnesses.Park Jie-won, floor leader of the splinter opposition People's Party, demanded on Thursday that Park punish the related officials and the government offer a public apology over the failure to properly regulate toxic chemicals used in productes to clean household humidifiers.A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than 100 people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used in products to clean household humidifiers made by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser.The president and lawmakers must also work together on growing household debt which hit a record 1,207.0 trillion won  as of the end of December, breaching the 1,200 trillion won mark for the first time in the country's history, the Bank of Korea said in February.","last month parliamentary elections ,three major political parties ,hye began talks friday ,political parties crucial meeting ,the new floor leaders","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55544204  0.67639089

A businessman surnamed Oh, who manufactured and sold another humidifier disinfectant brand carrying the toxic PHMG substance, was also included.The three Oxy officials face charges of causing death or harm to the users by skipping the toxicity test in 2000, and also for exaggerating and falsely promoting the product as being safe to children.Since Oxy’s Oxy Ssak Ssak was introduced to the market in 2001, a total of 4.53 million were sold until August 2011. While 221 individuals have been officially confirmed by the government to have suffered lung damages, 177 have allegedly used the Oxy product. Of the 90 confirmed deaths, 70 are those that reportedly used Oxy’s sterilizer. Meanwhile, family representatives of toxic humidifier disinfectant victims on Wednesday criticized Oxy Reckitt Benckiser for not apologizing, despite their visit to the U.K. headquarters. Families of the victims and activists returned to Seoul after a six-day visit to the U.K. that included a visit to the firm’s headquarters to ask it to take responsibility for the massive number of deaths and health damages. Kim Deok-jong, whose son is suspected to have died from the toxic humidifier disinfectant, talks to reporters during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. They said RB headquarters CEO Rakesh Kapoor only used words such as “profoundly regret” and “personally very sorry” in referring to the disinfectant tragedy. “Although the company’s press release said he had apologized to us, he did not use any expression of ‘apology’ to us nor did he have sincerity,” said Choi Ye-yong, the head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, during a press conference upon his arrival back to Korea. When asked to visit Seoul to sincerely apologize to the victims, the CEO did not give a response, added Choi. Families of the victims said they would continue the boycott movement until the company is expelled from the global market. “We have seen the same stance of Oxy for five years. There is no longer a reason to talk to the company anymore. The citizens-driven boycott movement is the only solution,” said 40-year-old Kim Deok-jong who lost his five-year-old son in 2009, allegedly from using the disinfectant. “ appreciate all the support from the public. Participating in the boycott is great support to us. Until the RB CEO kneels down in front of the victims and offers a sincere apology,  will continue and expand the boycott to the international market.” They will file a suit against the company to the U.K. prosecution after the local prosecutorial probe wraps up, they added. During the trip, they also visited Denmark to meet the former head of a Danish company which had provided the main ingredient of another local humidifier disinfectant Sefu that killed at least 14 Koreans. The company later shut down after the tragedy took place. The families of the victims obtained crucial information regarding the ingredient toxicity from the former head, they said. They submitted the data to the prosecution later in the day.The Danish prosecution also vowed to cooperate with the probe into Sefu manufacturers and distributors, they added. The families also requested the heads of the Korean political parties to meet with them to discuss enacting a special law for victims’ compensation, holding a parliamentary hearing and investigation, and setting up a special committee to introduce relevant regulations. Meanwhile, more retailers and consumers have been seen participating in the boycott. Following distributors like Lotte Mart that joined the move last week, online commerce services Tmon and Coupang, convenient store chains GS25, CU and 7-Eleven, and large department stores Shinsegye, Hyundai and AK Department Store have decided to participate in the boycott movement, according to civic consumers’ group Korea National Council of Consumer Organization. By Lee Hyun-jeong","prosecutors on wednesday sought ,arrest of four former ,officials prosecutors on wednesday ,prosecutors on wednesday ,the arrest of four",[],10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00946201 0.39302656 0.11028321],Lee Hyun-jeong,Social affairs,5,2016,"prosecutors on wednesday sought for ,killed at least 14 koreans ,the arrest of four former ,move last week online commerce ,arrest of four former","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Shin Hyun - woo', 'Oxy', 'Oxy ’s Oxy Ssak Ssak', 'Oxy', 'Oxy ’s', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'U.K.', 'Seoul', 'U.K.', 'Kim Deok - jong', 'Seoul', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'Choi Ye - yong', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'Kim Deok - jong', 'U.K.', 'Denmark', 'danish', 'Koreans', 'danish', 'Sefu', 'korean', 'Lotte Mart', 'Tmon', 'Coupang', 'CU', 'Shinsegye', 'Hyundai', 'AK Department Store', 'Korea National Council of Consumer Organization', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00946201 0.39302656 0.11028321]

Choi's family is estimated to have avoided some 1 billion won  in losses.Under the current law, executives, staff members and major shareholders of a company are deemed ""insiders"" who are banned from using undisclosed information. Violators could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years or a fine that amounts to three times the amount of gains or losses avoided.Currently, Choi is the chairwoman of Eusu Holdings Co. that separated from Hanjin Group in May last year.","prosecutors on wednesday raided ,chairwoman prosecutors on wednesday ,wednesday raided the home ,hanjin shipping chairwoman prosecutors ,shipping chairwoman prosecutors","['Choi Eun - yeong', 'Hanjin Shipping Co.', 'Seoul Southern District Prosecutor']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49134541  0.41424936

It is the same as what is stipulated in the current code of conduct for public officials. The proposed ordinances also set the ceiling for gifts to 50,000 won, and money for congratulations and condolences to 100,000 won.The civil rights panel also set the lecture fees for ministers at 400,000 won per hour. Journalists and private school faculty can receive up to 1 million won per hour. The proposals were made about 14 months after the controversial anti-corruption bill passed the National Assembly in March 2015.The bill was drawn up to tighten loopholes in existing anti-corruption rules under which public officials cannot be punished for accepting expensive gifts and services unless there is evidence of reciprocity.The Constitutional Court is reviewing the details of the law after the Korean Bar Association filed a petition arguing that it has elements that are not fair and even unconstitutional.The association said the law's inclusion of journalists among those subject to it can infringe on freedom of the press and people's rights for equality. Also, the law's articles requiring people to report their spouses' acceptance of a bribe or expensive gift to authorities or face criminal punishment go against principles of freedom of conscience and self-responsibility in the Constitution.The court is reviewing the law with the aim to deliver a ruling before it goes into effect in late September.","three years in prison ,controversial anti corruption bill ,faculty to maximum penalty ,corruption bill that won ,monday announced the enforcement",['Kim Young - ran'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16739015  0.17563924

According to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, investigators questioned the company’s vice president surnamed Park to look into whether there were dubious deals and illegal lobbying involving CEO Jung Woon-ho.Park, the company’s No. 2 man in charge of marketing, has led the company after Jung was put behind bars last October over his overseas gambling charges. He is reported to have helped Jung expand business over the past 10 years. Jung is suspected of hiring a judge-turned-lawyer surnamed Choi to peddle influence in the legal circles, seeking leniency in the ruling over his illegal gambling charges last year. Choi was allegedly promised 5 billion won  in attorney fees from Jung in exchange for bail from the appeals court. The entrepreneur was indicted last October on charges of illegal gambling from 2012 to 2014 in Southeast Asia, including Macau and the Philippines. The lower court handed down a one-year prison term, but the appeals court reduced it to eight months. Jung also allegedly hired several brokers to bribe public officials while expanding his business. Prosecutors suspect a broker, surnamed Han, of lobbying public officials and Lotte Group officials respectively to win military supply deals and to open Nature Republic stores at Lotte Duty Free, in return for 1 billion won from Jung. Prosecutors requested a warrant for Han. Jung hired another broker, surnamed Lee, accused of taking 900 million won from Jung to bribe public officials over a contract to open the brand’s stores at subway stations. Lee also allegedly had dinner with a judge hearing Jung’s case at the higher court, which prosecutors viewed as seeking a favorable ruling.In addition, there have been allegations that Jung lobbied police and prosecutors through brokers to cover up other criminal cases involving him. The summon follows Wednesday’s raid on the National Tax Service’s Seoul office, Seoul Bar Association and the Legal Ethics and Professional Conduct Council in connection with the lobbying scandal. The investigators collected tax data, internal reports, account books and contract information of the related lawyers.

""What pilots have to do is just to decide to go or not go, but are you saying that it is hard? Flying is done by autopilot, which is easier than driving a car,"" he said. ""Only in case of an emergency do we need pilots. You are exaggerating too much.""This was in response to an earlier online post by one of Korean Air's pilots who detailed grueling procedures that he has to go through before entering a cockpit.Korean Air and its pilots have been at odds for months since wage negotiations fell apart. The pilots have been on a ""work-to-rule"" struggle since a majority of their union members voted for a strike in February.They are demanding a 37 percent hike in wages, while the company proposed a 1.9 percent increase, which it said is on par with the wage growth rate for non-pilot workers.","allegedly ridiculing pilots daily ,sued for defaming pilots ,ridiculing pilots daily ,allegedly ridiculing pilots ,korean air chairman sued","['Korean Air Lines Co.', 'SNS', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Korean Air', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Cho', 'SNS']",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.19565985 0.34627256 0.310756  ],KH디지털1,Social affairs,5,2016,"comment allegedly ridiculing pilots daily ,allegedly ridiculing pilots daily ,allegedly ridiculing pilots daily work ,sns comment allegedly ridiculing pilots ,ridiculing pilots daily","['Korean Air Lines Co.', 'SNS', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Korean Air', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Cho', 'SNS', 'Cho', ""Korean Air 's"", 'Korean Air']",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.19565985 0.34627256 0.310756  ]

In the reports, he said the causal relation between the humidifier sterilizers and lung diseases is not clear. Prosecutors raided the veterinary professor's office and home and confiscated computer hard drives and records on lab experiments. Cho was arrested at the office.The office and home of a professor at Hoseo University in South Chungcheong Province were also raided following similar allegations raised.The British company asked the professors, acknowledged as authorities in toxicology in South Korea, for reports to rebut the announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August 2011 that the company's products caused lung injuries. The company paid the SNU and Hoseo University 250 million won  and 100 million won as research funds respectively and remitted additional money to the professors' personal accounts as consultancy fees, according to prosecutors. The British manufacturer is suspected of submitting reports that are favorable to it to the state prosecutors and the court. Prosecutors said they are investigating whether the professors controlled certain variables to induce results they wanted and whether they manipulated data on the reports. The prosecutors' move came a few days after Ata Safdar, CEO of Oxy Korea, apologized for selling the deadly sterilizers and proposed that other makers of similar products, namely discount chains Lotte Mart and Homeplus, work with the company on joint compensation.Oxy started selling its products in Korea in 2001, followed by local companies. It wasn't until 2011 that the products were taken off the shelves after mysterious deaths from lung complications were linked to the sterilizers. South Korean government confirmed 221 people as victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products. Out of 90 deaths, 70 are believed to have been from using Oxy products. Civic groups say the extent of the harm is much larger.Earlier on Wednesday, representatives of the victims left for Britain and Denmark to protest against companies that sold toxic humidifier disinfectants in South Korea.","prosecutors raided the office ,professor arrested over alleged ,oxy reports prosecutors raided ,arrested the scholar wednesday ,prosecutors over its toxic","['Seoul National University', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' office""]",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17110029  0.45211509

545,545,Oxy protest taken to U.K. headquarters,The Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office raided Wednesday offices of professors of Seoul National University and Hoseo University who had led the product toxicity test requested by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser. A SNU professor surnamed Cho was arrested without warrant.

A SNU professor surnamed Cho was arrested without warrant. The prosecution suspects that the professors allegedly received money from Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- in exchange for omitting some of the product’s toxicity test results. In April, the prosecutors traced 250 million won that was allegedly wired from RB Korea in 2011 to a personal bank account of the SNU professor surnamed Cho.A professor surnamed Yoon from Hoseo University also allegedly received 100 million won from RB Korea at a similar time, according to the prosecution. The Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office’s special probe team is widening the probe by adding five more prosecutors to cover the case from the original six. “Since the investigation process is speeding up with more manpower, we are going to divide the investigation into a two-track probe regarding related firms,” a prosecutor from special probe team was quoted as saying. The prosecution has accelerated its investigation into the sterilizer case that was first revealed in 2011 from the end of last year. The products are blamed for at least 143 deaths.Meanwhile, the father of a deceased victim of Oxy humidifier disinfectant headed for the U.K. on Wednesday to launch a weeklong protest at the company headquarters and other relevant organizations in Europe.Kim Deok-jong, whose 5-year-old son died in 2009 after battling a respiratory disease, will stage a protest at Cavendish Square in London on Thursday, organizers said.Kim Deok-jong  holds a press conference at Incheon International Airport on Wednesday before leaving for the U.K. to stage a protest at Reckitt Benckiser’s headquarters. The parent company Reckitt Benckiser Group is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting at No. 11 Cavendish Square on the day. He will be joined by Choi Ye-yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health.On Friday, they will move to the RB headquarters in Slough, Berkshire, to deliver their protest letter. “When we visited the RB headquarters last year, we were outraged at how they declined to take responsibility, by separating the Seoul office and the group,” said Kim at a press conference before boarding his flight at Incheon International Airport.“The prosecution said RB headquarters supervises the Korean affiliate, so we are going to demand their responsibility once again,” Kim added.The two protesters will also visit British retail giant Tesco, headquartered in Hertfordshire, to demand it takes responsibility for the toxic humidifier disinfectant sold at its Korean affiliate Homeplus which led to the loss of 13 lives. Their protest will continue in Denmark with visits to chemical manufacturer Ketox, Denmark’s Environment Ministry, Foreign Ministry and the prosecutor’s office. In 2001, a local household firm Oxy merged with RB and was renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014. The firm was criticized for changing its name on suspicion that it tried to escape due responsibility on the disputed humidifier disinfectants. But RB Korea’s representative director Ataur Rashid Safdar refuted the criticism during a press conference on Monday by saying that despite the name change, “RB Korea will not abandon legal liability of the company over any damage from its products.” The National Assembly’s Environment and Labor Committee said it will hold a meeting with Minister of Environment Yoon Seong-kyu next week to be briefed on the estimated damages from toxic humidifier disinfectants and the status of compensation and medical treatment for victims. Amid the widening prosecution probe into the firms behind toxic humidifier disinfectants, the main opposition Minjoo Party decided Wednesday to launch a special committee on the humidifier disinfectant tragedy and safety of local household goods.By Kim Da-sol","prosecutor office raided wednesday ,office raided wednesday offices ,district prosecutor office raided ,office raided wednesday ,raided wednesday offices","['the Seoul Central District Prosecutor ’s Office', 'Seoul National University', 'Hoseo University', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'SNU', 'Cho', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Reckitt Benckiser Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39780205  0.04953491

The police are trying to confirm the identity of the man who was photographed using the victim’s debit card at an ATM.  The Jeju Seogwipo police said they found a photo of a man withdrawing 2 million won  from an ATM with the victim’s debit card, around the end of last year when the victim went missing. The man in the photo wore a white cap with a dark jumper. His face was covered with a scarve. Given the low resolution of the picture, the police said it will take some time to identify the man.The photo was discovered in the collaborative search involving the victim’s financial records with a bank that has its headquarters in China. The 22-year-old victim had an account with that bank. She had worked illegally at a bar in Jejudo Island after overstaying her tourist visa. She disappeared in December without finishing her first month of work and was later discovered dead at a field near Seogwipo on April 13. She had multiple stab wounds that injured vital arteries in her neck and chest. The National Forensic Service determined there had been no sexual assault. The police had arrested a Korean man as a suspect in April but had later released him due to lack of motive and evidence. A total of 29 people who were close with the victim -- both Koreans and foreigners -- were banned from leaving the country during the investigation of the case. The victim’s family, who were contacted through the Chinese embassy, said that their daughter had left home as soon as she had reached legal age. According to her family, she had traveled to Jejudo Island in a bid to solve her financial difficulties. The family will arrive in Jejudo Island next week with financial aid from the Korean police.By Lim Jeong-yeo","murder case new suspect ,chinese bank on wednesday ,korean chinese murder case ,suspect for jeju murder ,jeju murder case new","['korean', 'chinese', 'ATM', 'Jeju Seogwipo', 'ATM']",10,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.06942026 0.22812009 0.1734345 ],임정요,Social affairs,5,2016,"victim chinese bank on wednesday ,jejudo korean chinese murder case ,bank on wednesday the police ,victim financial records with bank ,police had arrested korean man","['korean', 'chinese', 'ATM', 'ATM', 'China', 'Seogwipo', 'the National Forensic Service', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'chinese', 'Jejudo Island', 'korean', 'Lim Jeong - yeo']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.06942026 0.22812009 0.1734345 ]

Korea, with its world-top level of information technology, hopes to become a reliable partner for Iran in this field.”Cheong Wa Dae also emphasized that the summit has elicited a record-high economic outcome by bridging South Korean export companies and local Iranian buyers.“The one-on-one business consultation meeting resulted in the clinching of 31 purchasing deals, worth $537 million in total,” An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the individual business meetings on the previous day.During the state visit, Iran’s top leaders also called for denuclearization, once again denying alleged military ties with the communist regime and thus stepping closer to partnership with South Korea. They did not, however, directly mention North Korea and its nuclear armament.“It is our basic principle that dangerous nuclear weapons should vanish from the Korean Peninsula and from the Middle East,” said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Monday in a joint conference following a bilateral summit with his South Korean counterpart.His remark was relatively vague, compared to that of Park, who explicitly demanded for “Iran’s cooperation” in denuclearizing the North.“I have delivered our stance of zero-tolerance concerning North Korea’s nuclear armament, underlined the importance of implementing the related U.N. resolution, and requested for Iran’s cooperation in the given issue,” Park said in the conference.Rouhani’s comment, though falling short of pegging North Korea, took Iranian officials by surprise with its unprecedented determination, according to senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs.Iran, which was freed from international sanctions in January this year after clinching a compromising denuclearizing deal, has often been suspected of holding military ties with North Korea over missile and nuclear technology. The Iranian government has been denying the allegations.Meanwhile, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader and the top religious authority of the Muslim country, sought to draw the South Korean leader’s attention to the Middle East peace agenda.“Terrorism and regional insecurity will be even more difficult to eradicate in the future, unless we take a real and proper approach immediately,” he was quoted as saying during a meeting with the South Korean president.President Park Geun-hye talks with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on May 2. “It will be beneficial for the mutual relationship of both countries if Korea paid consideration on what is important for Iran.”Separate from the meeting with Park, the leader denounced potential U.S. leverage upon Iran-South Korean ties.“Contracts and agreements between the two sides should be concluded in a way that foreign harmful factors and sanctions would not leave negative impacts, because it is unacceptable that the Iran-South Korea relations should be affected by the U.S. and its ill-will,” Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the ayatollah as saying.Having assisted Ruhollah Khomeini during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and served two consecutive presidential terms in the 1980s, Khamenei is recognized as a hawkish, anti-American conservative, in contrast to the moderate reformist president.Despite the lack of mention of North Korea or nuclear weapons, the top religious chief’s unprecedented meeting with the South Korean president is expected to add pressure on the nuclear-driven, isolated North.By Bae Hyun-jungKorea Herald correspondent","freed iran president park ,tuesday praised the renewed ,hye on tuesday praised ,sanction freed iran president ,freed iran president","['TEHRAN', 'Iran', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.34790856  0.51733464

President Park Geun-hye, wearing a rousari, talks with Iranians donned in Korea’s traditional hanbok during a K-Culture exhibition at Tehran’s Milad Tower on May 2. During her summit with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and her following talks with Supreme Leader and religious cleric Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, she maintained a similar dress code, putting on a long pink-colored jacket with the rousari.The green, pink and white combination was designed to be a tribute to the green, red, and white-colored Iranian flag.“The president’s wearing of the rousari is an expression of respect for Iran’s traditional culture,” said presidential spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk.“It is the equivalent of foreigners taking off their shoes when stepping indoors in Korea.”While some denounced the headscarf as a symbol of discrimination against women in Muslim culture, Park’s gesture seemed to have a positive effect upon the leaders of the Middle East state.Prior to the summit on Monday morning, Iranian President Rouhani came out all the way to the vehicle to greet Park and escorted her in person to the reception hall.During the press conference following the summit, Park and Rouhani sat side by side at a table in a relatively informal composition.This was not the first time that the South Korean president wore a piece of traditional garment during a state visit. When visiting Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in March last year, Park wore a shaya, the local Arabian version of the headscarf. But her special dress code then was limited to the religious event only that time.President Park also said at the end of the press conference “dust va hamrahe khub,” meaning “friend and good companion” in the Persian language.It was amid this cordial mood that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei consented at the last minute to a face-to-face meeting with Park.The presidential office had been attempting to confirm a meeting with the religious chief, who not only holds leverage over the religious circles but also upon the country’s administration, legislature and judiciaries.Also, as the last schedule on her agenda, Park paid a visit to the Iran National Museum on Tuesday afternoon to appreciate the cultural heritage of the Persian empire.By Bae Hyun-jung Korea Herald correspondent","iran president park geun ,to iran president park ,visit to iran president ,required of muslim women ,iran president park","['tehran', 'Iran', 'Park Geun', 'muslim', 'islamic', 'South Korea']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.57698727  0.43280762

The ministry announced the results on Monday, but indicated they were able to only find mild cases that cannot be directly linked to any irregularities.The ministry said it found a total of 24 cases in which law school applicants revealed the occupations or social positions of their parents, to allegedly take advantage of it in the admission process. Such information in five cases allowed the admission officials to identify their influential parents or relatives, officials said. The ministry, however, stressed that clear causality between revealing the family background and the admission was not confirmed. The cancellation of the students’ admission is also impossible, citing that it is not appropriate to divert the accountability of schools’ mistakes to the students, it added. Lee Jin-seog, the director general of academic research affairs and financial aid at the Education Ministry, bows after announcing the results of its survey on law schools’ admission processes on Monday. The probe was launched after a lawmaker was accused of allegedly using his authority to have his son admitted to a law school late last year. The ministry probed some 6,000 cases of the past three years. It was the first-ever probe since the law school system was introduced in 2009. While Korean law schools have been welcomed as an alternative to widen opportunities to non-law major students and to raise diversity in the field, the admission system operated under schools’ discretion has sparked criticisms over their transparency. Disallowing applicants from revealing their family background has been considered one of the tools to prevent nepotism. The families of the applicants involved in the five cases were found to be high ranking officials of law firms, law-related organizations or high-ranking public servants. Regardless of the results, the ministry said it will start mandating that schools conduct blind admission processes. Only 18 out of 25 law schools across the country have voluntarily applied strict rules against revealing family background of the applicants.The Education Ministry also gave warnings to schools with lax admission rules.Criticism, however, persists over the ministry’s “superficial” monitoring and light punishment against law schools.While admission is mostly determined by bar scores, English test scores, personal essays and interviews, the schools are not obligated to disclose how much each criteria is weighed in the admission, allowing loopholes for schools to select student based on their preferences. The nationwide probe, itself, also sparked criticism that it has caught irregularities only based on whether the students revealed their family backgrounds in their essays, overlooking irregularities in other areas. The ministry, however, claimed that looking into the essays was the only objective way to probe the irregularities.

Conglomerate leaders have mostly enjoyed the privilege and the release has was often been justified as a step to jumpstart the economy. “Releasing them doesn’t help bring our economy back on track,” said Lee in elected in Seo-cho A district in Seoul. “If the business of a company falters just because a single man spends his time in prison, the company should be blamed for that,” she said. The third-term lawmaker tentatively named the legislation as “anti-wheelchair” bill, referring to common scenes of indicted chaebol owners appearing in a patient’s outfit in a wheelchair hoping for lesser punishment.From the main opposition camp, Rep. Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea has pledged to introduce a bill designed to abolish the regulation mandating mobile phone users pay a “basic” fee of 10,000 won  to the telecom carriers.“The measure is necessary to reduce the burden on people’s livelihood,” said the lawmaker who will be serving his third term. Woo has coauthored a similar bill during the 19th Assembly, but has failed to get them passed due to opposition from the government and the ruling Saenuri Party.  CJ Group chairman Lee Jae-hyun showed up at the Seoul High Court in a wheelchair last December. YonhapWith some Saenuri lawmakers-elect, such as Rep. Bae Duk-kwang, backing the move by pushing to halve the required payment, the businesses remained opposed to the move saying the payment is needed to finance their investment in telecom infrastructure.Each party is also outlining bills to represent their policy identities.The Saenuri Party has vowed to amend the law to support quantitative easing program, an initiative designed to aid corporate restructuring, by allowing the Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to policy lender Korea Development Bank. The Minjoo Party has pledged to pass a bill to widen job opportunities for young people under the age of 34. The bill calls for companies with at least 300 employees and government agencies to fill at least 3 percent of their new employees with those aged 34 and under. The People’s Party has announced that it would enact a law that restricts the revolving-door practice among former high-ranking government officials. The third biggest party has also pushed to amend the law aiming to boost venture business and regulate corporate monopolies. The new legislative business will start on May 31.

The 12 illegal entrants and the four South Koreans have been booked without physical detention.The unidentified broker had the businesspeople send false invitations to the 12 so that they could come to South Korea on a C-3 visa, which allows foreigners to enter the country for tourism, transit, visiting relatives or similar reasons and to stay here for up to three months.Around the time the C-3 visas expired, all 12 of them applied for refugee status to stay illegally. They took advantage of the law under which refugee status seekers are not forcibly deported for a period of three to five years, when their refugee applications are screened, police said. The Ghanian broker coaxed the four businesspeople including freight forwarders into issuing the false invitations in return for giving them deals to ship freight for the 12 people's family members in their home countries, they said. Police said they will investigate further into the case to see whether there are more people who came here illegally through the Ghanian's help as the four owned up to writing about 100 false invitations.","broker arrested on charges ,2013 helped the illegal ,korea illegally through loophole ,friday they have arrested ,helping africans illegal entry","['ghanaian', 'african', 'South Korea', 'ghanaian', 'Ghanaians', 'Nigerians', 'south korean', 'the International Crime Inv']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.09554268  0.30756843

Instead  was slam her fist on the table,” Park said. People’s Party’s new whip Rep. Park Jie-won  attends an event on Thursday. He was referring to recent news reports that detailed how Park expressed her frustration toward the legislation by knocking her fist on the table during a presidential meeting. Park has reiterated her distaste for the current Assembly during a meeting with chief news editors, saying that the people have voted to create a three-party system after being disappointed by current politics. During the Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Park repeated her calls for the Assembly’s cooperation in passing pending economic bills to save the sluggish economy.“If President Park honestly admits her maladministration, seeks for help, persuades the opposition leaders and asks for the People’s Party’s cooperation to have a ruling party member assume the speaker’s seat, we may consider  based on patriotism,” the veteran lawmaker said. Park, a former aide to late President Kim Dae-jung, has served three terms for the Jeolla Province constituency. Park was unanimously approved as the party’s new floor leader on Wednesday. This is Park’s third time serving as a political party’s whip. Park’s Saenuri and Minjoo counterparts are to be elected next month.Park left The Minjoo Party of Korea ahead of the April 13 general election in a nomination fallout. Park joining the People’s Party, along with a handful of other former Minjoo members, is considered to have contributed to the People’s Party’s overwhelming victory in the Gwangju and Jeolla regions. “Through the eight years of Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, the economy has come to its limit. It has reached a point where we will not survive unless restructuring takes place on all sectors, not just shipping and marine transport industries,” Park said.As for the question of the possibility of strategically aligning with the Saenuri Party, Park said it would be a matter of principle. “The identities of the Saenuri Party and us are completely different.  may be possible if they come to us with full acknowledgement of our identity.”The People’s Party, co-led by entrepreneur-turned-politician Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and former justice minister Chun Jung-bae, is widely perceived as a centrist party comprising of conservative and progressive members.As for the possibility of joining hands with the Minjoo Party for the sake of an administration change at next year’s presidential election, Park said, “A traditional opposition party must acquire the support of Honam . It cannot be achieved just with Honam  but also without Honam.”“This is not yet a time to talk about an alliance, but to be recognized that if the People’s Party becomes a ruling party, and if chairman Ahn Cheol-soo becomes president, this is the kind of administration that  will get.”","thursday called on president ,new third party whip ,jie won on thursday ,president changes and asks ,party rep park jie","['the People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - win', 'Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'the People ’s Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.53154111  0.70801616

Key presidential aides, led by Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination Hyun Jung-taik, attended the event.The occasion -- the first of its kind in three years -- was taken as the state leader’s move to promote communication with the public and to preemptively respond to the looming lame duck label.Much in contrast to her New Year’s address in January, which triggered criticism on her lack of communication skills, the president spent ample time listening to the media chiefs’ opinions and freely answered their questions.The meeting comes in the aftermath of the April 13 general election, in which the ruling conservative Saenuri Party failed to secure parliamentary majority and slipped to the No. 2 party.“We may consider a ruling-opposition-government consultative body so as to discuss and solve key issues,” Park said, stretching out a hand to The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party, which together hold a majority in the forthcoming legislature.But she also blamed the opposition parties for holding back a series of economic revitalization and labor reform bills, which the presidential office and the Saenuri saw as crucial remedies to the nation’s sluggish economy.“Even as president, there was little I could do,” Park said, referring to the outgoing 19th National Assembly which failed to reach a compromise on the pending bills, due to opposition backlash.“I believe that it was because of  that the people chose to replace the conventional two-party frame into a new tripartite one, hoping to boost cooperation and power balance.”She was referring to the runner-up opposition People’s Party which rose as a new parliamentary bargaining unit by sweeping 38 legislative seats, 23 of them won in the Minjoo’s longtime stronghold constituencies.As for ongoing speculations that Cheong Wa Dae may carry out a cabinet reshuffle as part of self-reform efforts, the president said that the option was currently not under consideration.Park also reiterated her strong-handed policy regarding the increasing military threats from North Korea.“Should North Korea implement a fifth nuclear test, we will introduce more powerful restrictive measures, in close partnership with the United States and China,” she said.“Despite doubts, China has been actively participating in the U.N. resolution .”By ignoring the repeated warnings of the international community and continuing its provocations, North Korea will be bringing destruction upon itself, she added.South Korea has recently upped its alert against a possible nuclear test by the communist neighbor, given its launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, as well as more provocative remarks from leader Kim Jong-un.To a question on the Dec. 28 deal with Japan to resolve the sex slavery issue, Park indicated that the opposition’s emphasis on Tokyo’s reported demand to have a comfort women statue removed from its location near the Japanese Embassy in Seoul was tainting the issue.“ was never even mentioned in the agreement. ... As we have reached an agreement after much difficulty ... we must enable the follow-up measures to take place as soon as possible,” she said.With regard to the controversial reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks, Park said that history education so far has been criticized for its biased nature and the current textbooks would eventually lead to South Korea being absorbed by the North.By Bae Hyun-jung","revitalization park also reiterated ,tuesday that she will ,meet with party leaders ,party leaders president park ,meetings regular gesturing toward","['Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5233838   0.51577032

Tokyo formally apologized for the crime, acknowledged responsibility and pledged to pay 1 billion yen in reparations. Despite the deal, that has been hailed by some as a historic breakthrough in bilateral relations, the South Korean government has been under fire from the former sex slaves and progressive activist groups, which claimed Tokyo did not offer a sincere apology for its past deeds.""The Cheong Wa Dae official should be punished for abusing his power, if he is found to have instructed a conservative civic group to carry out the rally,"" the civic groups said in a press release.The groups further argued that the prosecution should look into allegations that the Federation of the Korean Industries gave support to the conservative civic group.

The committee is currently comprises 31 members, including the chairperson.Next in line was the Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee with 37 wanting to join. Other popular committees were the Industry, Trade and Energy, National Policy, Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries and Strategy and Finance committees.

Suh Chung-won, who will be serving his eighth term, along with Rep. Lee Ju-young and Rep. Chung Woo-taik, respectively entering their fifth and fourth term, for instance, chose the Foreign Affairs Committee as their first choice.

A family member of a humidifier disinfectant victim stages a protest calling for the punishment of the involved companies in front of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul on April 19. “We have a long and established safety track record and have never before faced an issue like this. Nevertheless, we deeply acknowledge and recognize our social responsibility to respond on the HS matter and we have tried hard to engage with, and listen to, the needs of victims.”So far, the humidifier disinfectants have been blamed for claiming 228 lives in Korea for a harmful substance they contained that caused serious lung disease, with 70 percent of those having used the company’s products. The total number of injured victims reaches 1,528.The statement comes three days after local supermarkets Lotte Mart and Homeplus offered an apology for their involvement in distributing the harmful disinfectants here. It is Oxy’s first press statement on the issue released in the five years since the case was first brought to light.The Korean government confirmed in 2011 that it had found a significant association between the disease and the use of humidifier disinfectant. Earlier in the day, an official, who was in charge of customer service for the British firm, appeared at the prosecutors’ office for questioning. Prosecutors reportedly asked the official why some posts to the company’s website left by customers complaining about the products’ side effects were removed. The prosecutors and a team of 20 experts in medicine and pharmacy science have also reportedly confirmed the correlation, which they said will be presented as evidence in the upcoming trials. They are also studying whether the disinfectants could have caused damage to other organs aside from lungs.The prosecution suspects Reckitt Benckiser of bribing a professor at Hoseo University to fabricate research papers in favor of the company. The firm has cited the papers to claim that its products had not resulted in the deaths of pregnant women and infants. The prosecution expanded the probe into whether the British headquarters had approved the sales of the toxic products here. The British company has denied its involvement, saying it had been entirely the Korean subsidiary’s decision. While the firm has maintained that it had not been aware of its products’ toxicity, the company allegedly contacted a number of victims to offer compensation in return for them not filing a lawsuit as the investigation picked up pace.Prosecutors also said Thursday that during questioning last November they secured testimonies from company officials involved in research that they were aware of the harmfulness of the substance, but that they skipped safety tests. According to prosecutors, Reckitt Benckiser also allegedly deleted a number of materials and safety data sheets about PHMG, which is responsible for severe illnesses and deaths, from its computers.Prosecutors plan to summon researchers and executives at the company involved in manufacturing the products next week. Meanwhile, victims of toxic humidifier sterilizer plan to file a class action lawsuit against the products’ manufacturers and distributors to seek compensation, an environmental group said.The Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health said that it will hold a meeting with the victims and their families on Sunday to form a group of litigants and discuss their plans for the lawsuit. The victims are targeting Reckitt Benckiser and local distributors, including Lotte Mart and Home Plus, involved in manufacturing and selling the humidifier disinfectants in Korea. “We will discuss the amount of compensation we will seek and receive applications to form a group of litigants,” said Lim Heung-kyu, an official at the center. “Our primary purpose for the lawsuit is to make sure that those classified as having suffered less directly from the products also get due compensation.” The Environment Ministry decided to classify the victims into four groups in accordance with the level of correlation between their disease and the use of disinfectant. It is set to compensate 200 of the victims who fell into the first two groups highly affected by the products. The center will raise funds to help the victims and their families as a whole rather than compensating individuals, he said. It plans to build a private research center and file a compensation suit in a British Court against Reckitt Benckiser.By Ock Hyun-ju","firm apologized on thursday ,apologized on thursday ,won million in humanitarian ,on thursday to victims ,the prosecution widening probe","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'british']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11136555  0.33854628

It is up 32.4 percent from that of the previous general elections, which stood at 1,096.The minister said the methods of election violations have been clearly shifting from bribery to spreading lies.According to prosecutors' data, some 53.9 percent, or 56 elected politicians, have been caught for negative campaigning, followed by bribery with 22.1 percent. It said 6.7 percent were caught because they used unauthorized methods to sway votes.""Rumors target unspecified masses, possibly leading to a significant change in the voting results,"" Kim said, underlining the seriousness of the crime.    In the latest elections, the main opposition Minjoo Party and the People's Party won 123 and 38 seats, respectively.

The rest of the seats went to another minor opposition party, the Justice Party, and independents.Under South Korean law, a fine of more than 1 million won  handed down to lawmakers-elect results in the invalidation of their elections.

YonhapThe prosecution is set to summon product researchers from Oxy Reckitt Benckiser and ask why the data sheets were destroyed in bulk, under the possibility that the move was intended to hide the product’s toxicity level.Since 2011, SK Chemical has been responsible for the production and distribution of polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate, one of the chemicals contained in the humidifier disinfectant. PHMG is a chemical known to have powerful sterilizing power compared to other chemicals. It is restricted in proportion by the Environment Ministry.According to the materials safety data sheet that was created when SK Chemical exported PHMG to Australia in 2003, PHMG is “poisonous when inhaled in powder form at room temperature.” The report also warns that the chemical should not be consumed by a human.On Monday, Lotte Mart, one of the manufacturers of disputed humidifier disinfectant made an official apology, vowing to provide due compensation to the victims and their families.The announcement marks the first ever public action taken by a maker of the toxic disinfectants since the probe was launched in 2011.

Ahn Cheol-soo , lawmaker-elect and coleader of the minority opposition People‘s Party, pays respect Tuesday at Busan Jungang Park to those who died in the April 19 revolution.

YonhapBut the People’s Party, which sees itself as a centrist balancing weight between the two leading parties, remains reticent on a number of disputed issues, including the government-driven labor reform plans.The two opposition groups initially kicked off what seemed to be policy partnership by agreeing on extending the term of the special investigation committee of the Sewol ferry sinking and on abolishing state-issued history textbooks.“Considering that the salvage  is scheduled for July, it is illogical that the committee should expire in June,” said Joo Seung-yong, lawmaker-elect and floor leader of the People’s Party on Monday.He thereby expressed his party’s consent to the Minjoo-drafted revision bills on extending the active term of the special committee. Different bills propose to extend the term until six months after the sunken hull is salvaged or the end of June next year.Even without the bill, both opposition parties have argued that the committee should continue until early next year, as the 18-month active period should be counted from the budget allocation in August last year. Saenuri’s view was that the committee’s term should expire in June this year, on grounds that the related bill had been passed in January last year.The opposition cluster also reached unanimous agreement on discarding state-designated history textbooks.“We agree  100 percent,” said the Minjoo’s floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul, concerning the Sewol committee and history textbooks.The open-armed response of the main opposition party was described by several local media as “political wooing” toward the tie-breaking party.The clock is ticking for the Minjoo as the Saenuri Party is soon expected to resume its No. 1 position by embracing a number of defected members who won last week’s race as independent candidates.But the range of their mutual understanding has so far been limited to social sectors. When it comes to the contentious economic revitalization and labor reform bills, the pivotal People’s Party is still reserving its official stance, carefully weighing its pros and cons in the long-term.At the center of the inter-party dispute is the worker dispatching bill, which expands the range of short-term workers for those aged 55 or above and for specific manufacturing industries.The government and the ruling party advocate the bills as a way of creating more jobs for the elderly and easing employment rules for small and medium-sized companies. But the opposition parties, backed by labor unions, denounced it as a pretext to promote irregular employment.The People’s Party, on the other hand, has adopted a two-track stance. While siding with the ruling party on the other three bills -- employment insurance bill, industrial disaster bill, and labor standard bill -- the party demanded that the dispatching bill be taken back to square one, seemingly adding weight to the Minjoo’s opposition.The trilateral parliament, along with the more left-wing minor Justice Party, which has six seats, will be dealing with the economic and labor bills over the extraordinary session to be held from this week to mid-May, according to the National Assembly secretariat.By Bae Hyun-jung","tie breaking minority party ,biggest opposition people party ,people party for leverage ,news focus leading parties ,minority people party for","['National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27142292  0.09342252

Rhee was the first president of South Korea, which was founded in 1948 after its liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.Rhee later went into exile in Hawaii and died there in 1965.","democracy uprising president park ,paid her respects tuesday ,silence at national cemetery ,cemetery in northern seoul ,pro democracy uprising president","['Park Geun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Syngman Rhee', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.1826295   0.24662901

Ahn Cheol-soo, coleader of the minority opposition People’s Party, pays respects at the May 18 Memorial Cemetery on Sunday during a post-election visit to Gwangju. YonhapAhn’s comments came during a luncheon with the party’s local headquarters officials and the political department chiefs of local media. He had been asked about his blueprint on presidential candidacy.“Now is the time to show to the people how the People’s Party may take a leading role in creating a productive parliament,” he said, sidestepping the question.He also remained vague on whether or not he will seek for a consecutive term as party chief by participating in the party’s national convention slated for July.“Our goal is to create a party which may change existing politics, people’s lives and the current government,” he said.But by reiterating the party platform, he effectively displayed his implicit plan to refrain from party chairmanship and warm up for the presidential race.The former computer vaccine developer, who stepped into political circles as a potential candidate for the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election, rose to the national spotlight by running in the 2012 presidential race as an independent candidate. Following months of brawling over opposition unity, Ahn renounced his candidacy, giving way to main opposition candidate Moon Jae-in, who then lost to eventual president Park Geun-Hye. But this time, a merger or strategic alliance within the opposition camp is not much likely to happen, according to Ahn.“It would be inappropriate to speak of political realigning at this point in time,” he said, displaying his disapproval over a possible union with The Minjoo Party of Korea.“We do not see ourselves as a mere tie-breaking third party, but more as a new opinion leader in parliamentary affairs.”Ahn also refuted criticism that his party’s political leverage was limited to the Honam region.“Having some two months to prepare for the election, we did not have sufficient time to discover competent candidates, but things will be completely different from now on,” he said.“The people chose us to be the third-largest political party here, considering us a tool for government change and a valid solution to the existing political frame.”The party’s leadership, along with 13 lawmakers-elect of the Honam region, paid their respects at the May 18 Memorial Cemetery, which honors the victims of the 1980 democratization movement.By Bae Hyun-jung","challenge the presidential race ,presidential race should resign ,next year presidential election ,moving onto presidential race ,presidential race ahn cheol","['Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'National Assembly', 'Ahn']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2397771   0.25883847

One of the worst maritime disasters in Korean history divulged the connection of corruption between the government and civil sector. It also revealed grossly incompetent rescue operations, which failed to save hundreds of passengers -- most of whom were high school students -- as the 6,825-ton vessel tilted for hours before sinking.Those deemed primarily responsible for the disaster -- such as captain Lee Joon-seok and rescue operators from the now-defunct Korea Coast Guard -- have been prosecuted. But the committee has been seeking to also investigate officials of the then-ship‘s operator Cheonghaejin Marine Co., other high-ranking officials of the KCG, ship inspecting organization Korean Register of Shipping and other bodies and individuals possibly connected to Sewol for misdeeds that was connected to the incident.During the committee’s hearing held last month, testimonies indicated insufficient approval process for Sewol along with possibility that the communication records during the rescue operation had been manipulated.The committee consists of 17 members, five recommended by the ruling party, five by the opposition, two by the Supreme Court, two by the Korea Bar Association and three by the families of those who lost their lives in the accident. But the committee has hit a number of obstacles in less than a year of operation, most notably suspected sabotage by a ruling Saenuri Party-nominated member.In November 2015, a Maritime Ministry document on guidelines for the ruling party-nominated members was unearthed. It said that the members should consistently supervise the committee’s decision making process, and if necessary, offer to resign en mass.“Ruling party members should publicly request the minutes of the meeting, and should announce a statement denouncing an abnormal, biased operation of the committee if needed,” it said. The manual also specified that if the probe began to point to President Park Geun-hye, Saenuri-linked members should resign and hold a press conference. Around 10:30 a.m. on the day of the accident, Park had called the now defunct Korea Coast Guard and urged officials to make sure that not one person gets left behind. But the president’s vague whereabouts for the next seven hours have consistently aroused debate and controversy over where she was during the nation’s darkest hours.Opposition lawmakers grilled the Maritime Ministry on the document on Nov. 20 during a parliamentary budget committee, saying the guideline hampers an independent operation of the committee, as the ministry is one of main subjects of the committee’s inquiries for being in charge of overall safety on the sea. The ruling party responded by accusing the opposition of being politically motivated.The controversy over the committee has also spilled over to its operation last summer, upon news reports taking issue with the high salaries of the committee members and their budgetary usage. The committee members have denied the accusations saying the spending is in accordance with regulations.University students from around the nation gather in Seoul on Saturday, the second annual memorial day of the Sewol ferry sinking, to call for further investigation into the accident. YonhapMeanwhile, Park Ju-min, the legal representative for the bereaved families of Sewol victims, has been raising questions on whether the government actually had the will to unearth the truth behind the accident.“If the government indeed was willing  I think it would have been more active in allocating budget or manpower for the committee,” Park said in a radio interview with Traffic Broadcasting System. He contended that the government interpreted the Sewol special bill in a way that gave the committee the shortest time possible for investigation. The operation period for the committee had been a topic of controversy; the bill on conducting a special probe stipulates that the committee can be sustained for up to a year after its creation. It can also be extended for another six months if necessary.The bill was enacted in January 2015, the committee members were officially appointed in March and the budget was allocated in August of that year. While the special committee members have argued that it should remain intact at least until the end of 2016, the government-designated deadline is in June. Opposition and legal representatives of the victims’ families argue this might make it impossible for the committee to probe the Sewol itself, the salvage operation for which is scheduled for July. Salvaging the sunken ship has been deemed crucial by both the committee and the bereaved families for in-depth investigation of the vessel and hopes of recovering nine bodies of those who still remain missing. Park Ju-min, who is now a lawmaker-elect for The Minjoo Party of Korea, said that the salvage operation should be transparent in order to prevent further dispute and suspicions concerning the government’s resolve to find the truth about the Sewol tragedy. The authority of the special committee had also been disputed by the ruling and opposition parties. The bereaved families have called for the committee’s rights to conduct an independent investigation and indict suspects. These clauses have been dropped after opposition by the Saenuri Party. The Saenuri Party instead offered a special prosecution probe upon request of the committee. But the request for the special probe in February remains pending at the National Assembly with the Saenuri Party’s opposition.Despite the muddled past of the committee, the general election hints at changing tides with Saenuri losing majority and several candidates who have been favorable toward the committee being elected. Park Ju-min has vowed to push for a revision of the Sewol bill. He stressed that the bill should clarify the committee’s investigative rights -- such as probing the ship -- along with expanding the operational period and budget.In addition to Park, former crime psychologist Pyo Chang-won -- a consultant for the committee -- won a parliament seat for the main opposition Minjoo Party. Rep. You Sung-yop -- the leader of the Minjoo Party’s special committee on Sewol -- had also retained his seat.The bereaved families of the victims and survivors have filed civil lawsuits against the government and the ship operator for compensation as part of their move to seek for further investigation. The trials are ongoing.By Yoon Min-sik","cut funding after june ,ferry left 304 dead ,committee investigating the tragedy ,expected to cut funding ,passed since the sinking",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38053206 -0.00627632

But Wednesday’s election seemed to show that such decades-old tactics might no longer work for the established parties, with the electorate in liberal and conservative strongholds casting their ballots for candidates running across the regional divide.In the conservative strongholds of Busan, Ulsan and South Gyeongsang regions, opposition contenders won in 11 voting districts. Two opposition and independent candidates also secured wins in Daegu, the heart of President Park Geun-hye and the ruling camp’s support base.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s elected candidates in Busan constituencies thank voters after paying tribute to fallen heroes at a memorial tower on Thursday. YonhapOn the other side of the country in Gwangju and Jeolla, the traditional backer of liberal oppositions, two Saenuri Party candidates came out as victors. “The results could be a sign that regionalism is not as strong as it used to be,” said Lee Nae-young, professor of comparative politics at Korea University. “Particularly, young voters think more about the candidates than the parties when they cast their votes” said Lee. One of the most prominent victories came from Kim Boo-kyum, the first candidate from The Minjoo Party of Korea elected in Daegu in more than 30 years. The nation’s third biggest city is one of the strongest political bases for the conservative party and the place where President Park Geun-hye began her political career. “I think it will usher in a new era of South Korea’s politics,” said Kim, the third-term lawmaker who beat his Saenuri counterpart former Gyeonggi Province governor Kim Moon-soo by a margin of more than 20 percent. The lawmaker-elect was narrowly defeated in the 2012 general election and the race to choose the city’s mayor in 2014. The liberal strongholds also saw outsiders’ victories. South Jeolla Province elected two candidates from the Saenuri Party: Jung woon-chun and Rep. Lee Jung-hyn. Lee will be the first third-term conservative lawmaker elected in the southern region. These cracks were also shown in conservative political bases in Seoul and nearby metropolitan areas. Having elected conservative parties throughout the decades, the regions’ affluent neighborhood elected liberal candidates for the first time in nearly thirty years. Minjoo Party candidate Jeon Hyun-hee beat incumbent Saenuri counterpart Rep. Kim Jong-hoon in Gangnam-gu B constituency. The conservative parties have not lost to liberal ones since the 1988 election in the region.  But the experts noted that the results hardly show the regional divide will become a thing of the past in the upcoming elections anytime soon.“It is hard to say it is the decline of regionalism,” said Choi Young-jin, professor of Korean politics at Chung-Ang University. “Regionalism can take various forms. It is about being united under one party. It doesn’t matter who they side with,” said Choi, referring to the election victory by the People’s Party, which took all eight seats in liberal stronghold Gwangju city. Politics professor of Myongji University Shin Yul agreed, suggesting the latest outcome could also be driven by the new electoral maps.“The victory in Gangnam-gu had little to do with the demise of regionalism.

Kim Moo-sung. Saenuri Party supporters listen to a stump speech by party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung in support of candidate Kang Yo-shik in Seoul on Tuesday. “I hope that the 20th National Assembly will devote itself for the sake of the people,” Park said in a regular Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, reminding the nation of the parliamentary election the following day and urging the citizens to exercise their voting rights.In criticizing the current parliament, she referred to the economic revitalization bills that failed to pass the floor due to persisting opposition disapproval.“With the North Korean provocation lurking around, our nation could always face a second financial crisis, should the economy halt its progress,” Park said.By highlighting the economy and national security issues, the president effectively aroused the conservative voters’ sense of crisis, calling them to give momentum to the ruling party.The state leader’s unreserved political push immediately triggered backlash from the opposition as a “blatant intervention in election.”The presidential house and the ruling party, however, were less affected by opposition complaints than by their own internal feuds -- which have only been temporarily suspended for the sake of the election.At the peak of the factional infighting was Rep. Yoo Seong-min, third-termer in conservative stronghold and the president’s hometown Daegu, who exited the party after being excluded from candidate nomination.Backed by Kim’s last-minute support, the party failed to nominate an in-party rival to Daegu’s Dong-gu, enabling Yoo to anticipate an easy win in the conservative stronghold city.The wrap-up of Wednesday’s election is also expected to signal the launch of moves by various high-flying figures within the party, as they eye party candidacy for next year’s presidential election.They include Kim Moo-sung, former Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon and former Gyeonggi governor Kim Moon-soo.By Bae Hyun-jung","bigger brawl after election ,brawl after election ,brawl after election having ,faces bigger brawl after ,fourth year in office","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.53309125  0.16663852

According to the festival's articles of association, the executive director can appoint advisory committee members without any other procedures. There are no regulations on how many people can be appointed to the position.Still, the court said the articles should not be interpreted in a way that could fundamentally affect the composition of the organization.""The appointments could essentially change the constituency of the group and distort the decision-making procedure with the new members' voting rights,"" it said. BIFF's executive committee and Busan, which foots around half of the festival's annual budget, have been embroiled in a controversy since the government demanded the resignation of Lee, citing ""problems"" found in the city's recent audit of the festival organization.The move prompted protests from the local film industry, which said the city's demand came because the executive director refused to accept Mayor Suh Byung-soo's request to cancel the screening of a controversial film.The documentary ""The Truth Shall Not Sink with Sewol,"" also known as ""Diving Bell,"" criticized the central government's rescue efforts during the Sewol ferry disaster that claimed more than 300 lives in April 2014.The feud deepened recently as Busan filed a complaint with prosecutors against Lee and other committee officials for allegedly committing accounting fraud by submitting documentation for sponsorship procurement activities.South Korea's film industry has been warning that it could opt to boycott this year's festival if Busan keeps ""denying"" the festival's autonomy.","film festival to suspend ,festival to suspend appointments ,festival biff seeking suspension ,court suspends biff new ,suspends biff new advisory","['the Busan District Court', 'the Busan Metropolitan Government', 'the Busan International Film Festival', 'BIFF']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16142742  0.14566709

Moon Jae-in, the former leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. Moon showed up alongside Kim Hong-gul, the third son of late President Kim Dae-jung.“I will achieve a history of upholding the Gwangju spirit,” Moon wrote in the guestbook. He then paid his respects to the deceased democratic activists, making a deep, lasting bow at the memorial stone. Among the buried was Juergen Hinzpete, a German journalist who first reported the massacre to the world. The Minjoo Party of Korea's former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in , accompanied by the late President Kim Dae-jung's son Kim Hong-gul , visits the May 18 National Cemetery to honor the victims during the 1980‘s pro-democracy uprising in Gwangju. YonhapThe visit, which came just five days before the general election, was the ranking opposition figure’s final plea to the voters in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces. Once considered to be a political stronghold of the Minjoo Party, the region is now being contested by the emergence of the People’s Party led by high-profile Minjoo defectors elected there.Opinion polls showed the main opposition lagging behind the fledging party. The survey conducted by local pollster Media Research showed Tuesday that the People’s Party candidates held leads over Minjoo Party candidates in seven constituencies of eight. Among them, two were within the margin of error.The Minjoo Party leadership and some party candidates had expressed their objection to Moon’s visit. The party’s chairman Rep. Kim Chong-in said he was “pessimistic” about the former leader’s chances of swaying the electorate in his favor. “I don’t think his visit to Gwangju would be helpful to the Minjoo Party candidates running in Gwangju,” said Chung Joon-ho, a candidate for the Buk-gu-B constituency in the city. “Moon had failed to win the  election despite overwhelming support from the region. He should abandon his presidential bid,” he said.What lies beneath their argument was an apparent “anti-Moon sentiment” -- the notion that voters in Honam -- a reference to the city of Gwangju and the surronding Jeolla provinces -- have been put off by what they saw as the Moon faction’s disregard for the region.That sentiment, however, did not seem to resonate with the Gwangju voters following Moon’s two-day trip. From downtown Gwangju to traditional markets and local colleges, Moon was greeted by packs of supporters holding welcoming signs and flowers, eager to have the distressed opposition celebrity in town.“The anti-Moon sentiment was an illusion created by conservative media channels,” said 53-year-old Shin Young-eun, who was born and raised in Gwangju. “But I do think his visit is quite long overdue. Moon should have come earlier to show the people how much we support him.”Citing the number of Honam natives who held high-profile positions during the Roh Moo-hyun presidency, the late President’s former chief of staff devoted most of time and resources dispelling the negative sentiment.His effort reached its climax when Moon vowed to quit his presidential bid if the Honam voters “withdrew” their support for him. Some of his supporters gathered at Chungjang-ro, one of the most crowded neighborhoods, protested against his all-or-nothing announcement, insisting that he run for presidency. But the mood off Moon’s trail was not as enthusiastic. Some critics derided the former presidential candidate as a weak politician using empty rhetoric and lacking the anticonservative spirit. “I don’t understand what he was getting at,” said a 48-year-old who runs a shoe repair shop in the Buk-gu district. “If he came here to make an apology, he should spell it out, but he just defended his position with empty rhetoric, which to me didn’t sound sincere.” Some people questioned his credentials as the leader of the main opposition party.“He didn‘t have much to say when several conglomerate-run factories were removed out of Gwangju,” said 48-year-old Kim Jae-yul.“I don’t see him as the type of opposition leader who dares to take a bullet and speak out on key issues.”Political experts at local colleges generally agreed that Moon’s visit may have the intended pacifying effect, but only to a limited extent.“Had Moon come here much earlier, it would have brought more significant changes,” said Ji Byung-geun, professor of politics at Chosun University.“His visit at this point in time is not enough to turn the election game around, but it could at least prevent the local voters’ antipathy from growing further.”Chonnam National University politics professor Oh Seung-yong noted that his visit could help his enthusiastic supporters unite, while also carrying the risk of shunning those against Moon.

It said the information the two men accumulated was accessible by anyone online.Considering that most of the charges were only backed by testimony provided by the 59-year-old co-defendent, identified only by his surname Kim, the court concluded that he made false claims to entrap the 78-year-old, surnamed Lee, after they had troubles in their joint business.Lee was sentenced to life in prison on a separate espionage charge in 1972, though he was released on parole in 1990.Kim, an ethnic Korean holding New Zealand nationality, received a 10-month jail term, suspended for two years, for violating a string of laws related to the country's passport act.","businessmen of espionage charges ,north korea were indicted ,june 2012 on charges ,acquits businessmen of espionage ,the north korean spy","['north korean', 'North Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38013971  0.30434093

The two officials asked not to be identified, citing policy.There is an atmosphere in Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office, that Jin could face heavy punishment if any wrongdoing is unearthed by the probe.Under a recent mandatory report, Jin said he sold all his801,500 shares of Nexon listed on the Japanese stock market for about 12.6 billion won in 2015. That represented a 3.79 billion-won increase in his personal wealth from the previous year.All ranking government officials and lawmakers are required to disclose changes in their personal wealth annually.Jin has said he bought then-unlisted shares of Nexon in the early 2000s, saying that the investment opportunity had been initially offered to a friend of his, who then decided to share the information with many of his own friends, including Jin.The prosecutor stressed that there was no wrongdoing involved.Still, suspicions have arisen since Jin worked at the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea's financial regulator, suggesting that the opportunity to purchase such large quantities of unlisted shares was possible because the company gave Jin a favor.","prosecutor over stock purchase ,presidential office on thursday ,online game developer presidential ,game developer presidential official ,stock purchase the presidential","['Jin Kyung - joon', 'Nexon Corp.', 'Jin']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83386272  0.381744

Recent video footage captured the scene where U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon came to see the president before the conference’s plenary session kicked off last Friday. As the two shook hands and exchanged conversation, Choi Jong-moon, deputy minister for multilateral and global affairs at the Foreign Ministry, took a snapshot of Kim Kyou-hyun, senior secretary on foreign affairs and security at Cheong Wa Dae, and himself with the leaders in the background. While the diplomats seemingly had enough time to take the pictures, a diplomatic blunder took place afterwards, as Park missed an earlier-than-planned group photo session during which she was supposed to stand next to U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders in the front row, as the host of the summit’s 2012 edition in Seoul. She was believed to be in the restroom at the moment and had swiftly returned for another photo with Obama and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, officials said, but the diplomatic team took flak for failing to keep up with the constantly changing schedule during the multiparty summit.","blunder some senior diplomats ,president before the conference ,controversy after being spotted ,summit in washington last ,diplomats criticized for taking","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'the Nuclear Security Summit', 'Washington', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Frida']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64859635  0.4255712

Lee Yoon-sang, one of the three human rights ombudsmen and independent investigators hired by the city of Seoul, acknowledged the case as a violation to her rights, and said, “Multiple guidelines make it a principle for interviewers to refrain from asking questions that might lead to discriminations.” “Regardless of the evaluator’s intended objective, questions regarding an applicant’s marriage status may trigger other evaluators to make biased decisions against married women, as well as disconcert the applicant with matters unrelated to the job,” Lee said. Lee stressed the need for a more scrupulous mechanism to guarantee fair evaluation, and asked Seoul to implement an educational program for its human resources directors.By Lim Jeong-yeo","discriminatory in job interview ,unfit for job interviews ,human rights ombudsman tuesday ,ombudsman tuesday the report ,for job interviews questions",['Seoul City'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23068841 -0.02570325

But in this year’s parliamentary elections, a significant number of voters are appearing to be aloof toward their current representative, reflecting the growing public cynicism about party politics.

Among the 292 members of the 19th National Assembly, 190 have entered candidacy for the April 13 race, according to the National Election Commission data. Considering those who failed to make it past the party’s preliminary cutoff, the actual number of those who originally sought an additional term is much higher.







Saenuri Party‘s candidate for Yongsan Hwang Chun-ja is on her campaign trail in the distrit on Monday. 




Despite their struggle for continuity, however, several ranking candidates have found themselves cold-shouldered by their local voters, who seem to prefer new blood over familiar faces.

An example is former Welfare Minister Rep. Chin Young, who defected last month from the ruling conservative Saenuri Party to join The Minjoo Party of Korea, after failing to win candidacy in his home camp.

Chin was immediately named the main opposition party’s candidate for his current constituency of Yongsan-gu, brushing aside the Minjoo Party’s preliminary candidates.

The senior lawmaker, who had once been one of the closest aides to President Park Geun-hye, received a fervent welcome from party chief Kim Chong-in, but his approval ratings in polls have so far fallen below his new party’s expectations.

According to a survey conducted by Korea Research Center on 500 respondents last week, Chin was ranked second with 31.9 percent of support, lagging behind his Saenuri competitor and political newcomer Hwang Chun-ja. Other surveys by local media, too, showed the ruling-turned-opposition figure to be the runner-up in the regional race.

Observers have pointed out that despite his political career and advantage as a current representative, Chin’s personal reputation was outrun by the residents’ preference for the conservative party.

The central Seoul district, embracing the newly rising rich residential areas in Ichon-dong, has for the past 16 years been classified as a conservative stronghold.







Former Saenuri member running as The Minjoo Party contender for Yongsan Chin Young is on his campaign trail in the distrit on Monday. 




Another lawmaker facing a challenge is Rep. Chung Sye-kyun of the Minjoo Party, a fifth-termer and former party chief who is running for reelection in Jongno-gu, a core constituency in the nation’s capital.

Chung once again marked his position within the opposition camp by achieving a sweeping preliminary victory over a ranking pro-presidential aide. The match was initially considered highly rash, as he had given up an easy win in his longtime electorate in North Jeolla Province, accepting the leadership’s call.

For him, the big hurdle is neither the conflict with the party nor his lack of legislative performance -- but the appearance of former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon as his Saenuri rival.

A survey by Realmeter showed Sunday that Chung had 39.9 percent support, falling slightly behind rival Oh’s 41.5 percent.

This gap of 1.6 percentage points was down from a high of 17.3 percentage points in the third week of March. Nevertheless, Chung is proving stiff competition against the widely recognized former mayor, who is also considered a potential presidential candidate.

“True public opinion may be found in the streets, on the faces of the people,” said Chung, shrugging off the poll results.

“Opposition candidates have to fight not only against their rival candidates but also against public pollsters .”

Former Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan, on the other hand, is suffering the consequences of his disgraceful defection from the Minjoo Party.

After the leadership ruled him out of nomination, citing “political reasons,” Lee stormed out of the party and announced his solo candidacy in the administrative city of Sejong.

Having won the first legislative seat in the newborn city back in 2012, Lee displayed confidence in doing the same this year, without a partisan support.

But a recent survey by Research & Research showed the former prime minister to be losing to Saenuri rookie Park Jong-jun, with 30.6 percent versus 35.7 percent.

As for the People‘s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the close chase of Saenuri candidate Lee Jun-seok in Nowon-C constituency is a major threat in keeping his seat in the parliament and promoting the position of his fledgling party.

According to pollster Realmeter, Ahn’s stood at 42.8 percent support earlier this week, still outpacing Lee‘s 31.1 percent.

But observers pointed out that Ahn, as party chief, is allocating most of the campaigning period to supporting other candidates while Lee is focusing on the constituency.

But the CMC president Hiram Chodosh highlighted that “the balance” in the breakdown of its faculty, staff and students allows for a more effective liberal arts education for graduates in challenging various transformations witnessed in societies and sectors across the world.“When you look at the political demographic of students coming here, it is incredibly balanced for this generation of students. Because of that balance, CMC appears more conservative than many other liberal arts colleges,” Chodosh said in an interview with The Korea Herald.  “Some of our liberal students love the conservative faculty more because it is challenging, and  boring to learn from those who already think like you. That is a signature commitment to make sure that we are challenging our own learning environment with a diversity of ideas, values and ideologies,” he said. Before taking office in 2013 as the fifth president of the CMC, Chodosh had served in advisory positions at the World Bank Justice Reform Group and the International Monetary Fund Legal Department. The president was in Seoul on March 19 as part of a tour to discuss international programs with colleges in Asia. One of the projects is the CMC-Yonsei Summer Program, a six-week program in which tens of CMC students team up with Yonsei students in business schools to participate in a project-based internship while completing each other’s course credits. Chodosh highlighted that the program could provide a cross-cultural environment in which students can improve their learning capabilities and leadership skills to address complex problems, in the same way that prominent tech companies build ecosystems that they call “campuses” “If you go to any tech companies now, you see a campus. You see a campus for a reason because of social density and proximity of people in real time. It is a powerful learning environment that can’t be replicated just online,” he said. “Working in teams together is a very important idea. Any understanding across cultural and social borders is very much advanced when two sides of that border have a common purpose.” The education expert, who was named one of the 25 most influential legal educators by the National Jurist Magazine in 2012, described the education system in Korea as a “driving force” behind its economic and political success. But the president noted that the nation’s zeal for education now should be channeled into developing problem-solving sets of skills for the students and encouraging them to self-motivate by creating a “magical cycle” of learning through trials and errors. “It is hard to measure performances in test-oriented cultures, which are wonderful for motivating work and discipline but often not very good for generating originality and emotional well-being, creativity and innovation,” he said.“One of the solutions to that is giving students the opportunity to actually go out and try to do things. When they face reality and fail the test, they can go back into the field and do better the next time,” he said. The president noted that liberal arts schools, such as the CMC, can find roles in these efforts because they can empower students to navigate through technological transformations by providing interdisciplinary education programs designed to boost students’ motivation.One of those programs is the CMC’s “Athenaeum,” which is Greek for temple of wisdom, the event brings together the world’s renowned thinkers and doers to give lectures to the students and alumni each night of the week. The students are given priority during question and answer sessions. “There is a difference between knowing something and knowing why it is known. There is a difference between having a particular skill and knowing why this particular skills works in that context,” he said.With regard to the controversial on-campus protest against racism last year, the president noted that students should have the right to express themselves and that the college would seek to improve diversity in its academic programs.The college’s former dean Mary Spellman resigned last year after a controversial comment in an email sent to a Latina student sparked a protest over racial tensions. Chodosh noted that such moves by students should generate engagement and discussion rather than populist movement hijacked by “flamboyant slogan and media attention.”“Students should know that they have the right to protest and it is important for them to exercise their rights. But I want this protest to be informed, to be more accountable and to lead to more discussion and engagement,” he said.

Yoo Seong-min, whose sour relationship with President Park Geun-hye cost him his party membership but gained him wider support in the lead-up to next month’s general election. The party appears to remain in disarray, with the chairman refusing to nominate a different candidate for Yoo’s constituency in a show of protest to the pro-Park nomination committee.Rep. Yoo Seong-min leaves his office in Daegu on Thursday. While Yoo pondered a possible nonpartisan alliance with other defectors, party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung publicly censured the nomination committee on Thursday, further deepening the crack between those pro-Park and those not.“I have consistently spoken against  candidate selection that violates our party platform and regulations,” Kim said in an urgent press conference.“ I have decided not to give final approval on the party’s candidates for the remaining five constituencies.”Of these areas was Dong-gu-B in the southeastern city of Daegu, where the defected Rep. Yoo pledged to run as independent candidate. The nomination committee tapped pro-Park figure Lee Jae-man as party runner for the area, immediately after Yoo made official his defection late on Wednesday.Kim also pledged to hold off the Supreme Council meeting until the end of Friday, effectively freezing the party’s nomination process during the two-day candidate registration period. He then headed off to his constituency in Busan.“ is totally irresponsible,” said Supreme Council member Rep. Suh Chung-won, who is pro-Park, told reporters.Floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul, another pro-Park member of the group, summoned a council meeting despite the party chief’s absence, and denounced him by volunteering a press conference, calling his decision “dogmatic.”The move by party chief Kim, who speaks for the non-Park group, is considered to be an attempt to dodge the public’s resentment toward the nomination committee and its political move to drive out uncooperative members.At the center of the factional dispute lies the high-handed nomination chief Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, who has bluntly pushed ahead with a candidate plan that favors the pro-Park clique.“ has insulted our party, betrayed his colleagues and left in search of his own interests,” Lee said Thursday, shrugging off the defection.“The way that he clings to another parliamentary term or feigns himself as victim is the kind of old political practices that we should eradicate.”Yoo had announced at the eleventh hour on Wednesday that he will defect from the Saenuri Party and run as an independent candidate in the April 13 general election.“In reliance on the nation’s constitution, which states that all power originates from the people, I plan to leave my old home and run for the sake of justice,” he said.“The party’s nomination has been all about political retaliation of the pro-Park against the non-Park.”The disputed third-termer, once considered a close aide to President Park Geun-hye, has increasingly been under pressure to either drop out of the April race or to exit the party.Yoo resigned from his post as floor leader last July after the president publicly rebuked him for leading negotiations with the main opposition party on passing a parliamentary revision bill.He also hinted that he may form a nonpartisan alliance with other non-Park members who have defected. The exit of Yoo and additional nonmainstream members left the ruling party with 146 out of 292 parliamentary seats.“Given the consequences of the nomination feuds, the party is likely to lose its parliamentary majority,” said Rep.

The U.S. move also targets cyberattacks, human rights abuses and other illicit activities.Touching on politics, she voiced concerns about a set of bills stuck in limbo in parliament as the rival parties focus their attention only on how to win next month's parliamentary elections.""Fierce battles begin among parties to win the elections""instead of caring for people and the national economy, Park said.The rival parties have been mired in factional infighting, respectively mainly over who will win the nominations for the elections.

Chin Young in Yongsan-gu, central Seoul.The lawmaker defected from the Saenuri Party last Thursday, after the party’s nomination committee denied him qualification to rerun in his constituency -- where he has enjoyed a relatively steady approval rating for the past 12 years.The Minjoo’s nomination committee immediately named Chin as the sole candidate for his current constituency, a position which had been kept vacant. Rep. Chin Young  announces his entry into The Minjoo Party of Korea on Sunday, accepting party chief Kim Chong-in’s call. YonhapThe lawmaker reproached his former party for playing factional games, publicly excluding those who are at odds with President Park Geun-hye.“To me, politics should be about implementing pragmatic policies under a practicing leader, not about seeking factional interests under the pressure of a specific person,” Chin said, directly referring to the president.“Looking back, I realize that my original political intentions have been blurred by power battles and factional divisions.”His change of affiliation meant not just the probability of an extra parliamentary seat for the main opposition party in the nation’s capital, but also signaled cracks in the ruling party due to feuds.The Saenuri Party is currently under fire for its series of election candidate nominations, which many regarded as an outright plot to filter out those who are not mainstreamers.It also added weight to the Minjoo chief Kim Chong-in’s repeated condemnation of President Park’s failure of policies and lack of leadership.“I appreciate Rep. Chin’s decision to continue his quest for democracy despite the political injustice that he faced,” Kim said.“The ruling party’s recent trials make it hard to believe that it is functioning as a proper political party.”Kim, much like Chin, had formerly been a top economic advisor to the president before he was brought to the opposition leadership earlier this year.The reunion of the two former conservative figures, who are known to share their views on middle-of-the-road policies, raised expectations on the party’s expansion into the centrist swing voters’ group.The judge-turned-lawmaker Chin won his first parliamentary term in the core Seoul constituency back in 2004, despite the public backlash that the then-Grand National Party faced after impeaching the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.Ever since, he has served the president in close proximity, as vice chairman of Park’s presidential transition team after her election in 2012 and then as the new administration’s first health minister the following year.But the centrist-conservative politician was at odds with the president when the latter scaled back several of her popular welfare campaign pledges, citing an unexpected tax revenue drop. He resigned from his ministerial post in protest at the government’s revised plan to restrict the duration of basic pension subscription.In sharp contrast to him, Busan’s third-termer Rep. Cho Kyoung-tae had defected from the Minjoo earlier this year to join the Saenuri Party, claiming that his policy directions were more in line with the conservative camp.By Bae Hyun-jung","party amid nomination infighting ,april 13 general election ,backlash former top aide ,park aide joins opposition ,of korea on sunday","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Chin Young', 'Yongsa']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26563668  0.27336398

Ahn Cheol-soo over the option of aligning with the main opposition party.“I have argued that partisan alliance among the opposition is necessary in order for us to expand our seats in the metropolitan region and prevent the horrendous situation in which the ruling forces win a sweeping victory,” Kim said in a press statement. “I am taking responsibility for failing to have  realized.”Kim had resigned from his position as cochairman on Friday last week after Ahn turned down his suggestion to seek an alliance with The Minjoo Party of Korea.From left: People’s Party cochairmen Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, Rep. Chun Jung-bae and Rep. Kim Han-gil The four-term lawmaker has been seeing his chances of winning in his constituency of Gwangjin-gu in Seoul ebb away after unsuccessfully floating the idea of joining hands with the Minjoo Party. The talks of an alliance was first initiated by Minjoo Party chief Kim Chong-in on March 2. As internal talks at the People’s Party looked unpromising with Ahn’s vehement opposition, the Minjoo Party swiftly dropped under-the-table negotiations with Kim by naming its own candidate to run in Kim’s constituency on Monday.Kim’s fellow cochairman Chun Jung-bae had initially appeared to join his move in the face of declining public approval ratings against the party’s star member Ahn. Chun, however, changed his mind and called a truce with Ahn on Wednesday, leaving Kim on his own.Kim and Ahn had shared the leadership at the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the precursor to the Minjoo Party, in 2014. They had jointly resigned from the post after a by-election defeat in July the same year. Kim joined Ahn’s new party earlier this year after both of them defected from the Minjoo Party over deep-running factional rivalries.","chief drops election bid ,next month parliamentary race ,joint chief drops election ,drops election bid ,parliamentary race the decision","['Kim Han - gil', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3976275  -0.07369818

The school is suspected of embezzling 7.5 billion won  in school expenses through the establishment of a paper company. Earlier this month, another international school in Seoul was forced to close by authorities for illegally transferring management rights without the required permit. Its official closure is slated for June 30, considering the class schedule, the Education Ministry said. International schools in Korea refer to educational institutions established for children of foreigners and for Koreans who have lived overseas for a period of time. As of this year, a total of 46 such schools are operating in the country, mostly in the capital. In recent years, public criticism has been raised over the schools for being “elite institutions” for the rich, counter to the intended purpose of educating foreign residents. In the case of Dulwich, 25 percent of the total 650 students are Koreans. The tuition fee is said to be 30 million won  per year. Tuition fees for local public high schools are typically around 2 million won per year.  International schools have enjoyed eased regulations for nearly a decade.In 2008, the Lee Myung-bak government eased the school admission criteria from “Koreans who lived abroad for over five years” to “over three years.” It also allowed local nonprofit corporations and school corporations to establish schools. Only foreigners were entitled to open international schools in the past. Monitoring of school management, however, has remained a blind spot.Under relevant laws, international schools are classified as “miscellaneous schools” under the monitoring of municipal education offices. On the other hand, the regulations over school establishment and operation are separately set by the Education Ministry. In reality, these schools mostly run under their own rules, starting from curriculum design, as they are not funded by the government, officials said. “Since these schools are not within the boundaries of the local mandatory education system, they naturally get more discretion over the way they run the schools. Because their background and rules are all different from local schools, it’s realistically difficult to monitor them all,” an SMOE official told The Korea Herald. To enhance supervision, SMOE said it would draw comprehensive measures soon to expand its surveys of other international schools, following the audit of Dulwich.

Lee Hahn-koo, the ruling Saenuri Party's nomination committee chief, vows Monday to reinforce the candidate screening process for the April 13 general elections. Yonhap“I feel that our candidate nomination process has not been as reformative as it should have been,” Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, chief of the party’s nomination management committee, told reporters Monday.“Those who have won themselves multiple terms in relatively unchallenging regions should face detailed investigations .”The pro-Park lawmaker thus hinted at sweeping off some of the incumbent lawmakers in the party’s stronghold constituencies in Daegu, South Gyeongsang Province and key metropolitan areas.The president’s recent trip to her home city of Daegu -- which some opposition charged was overt meddling by the head of state in the elections -- added to speculations that the pro-Park clique is attempting to pitch their favored candidates against current lawmakers.Party chief and fifth-termer Kim, however, shrugged at the nomination committee’s ambitious calls for reshuffling.“I regret that our party, preoccupied with the candidate nomination issue, has neglected the people’s livelihoods,” Kim said at the Supreme Council meeting.This was the first time in weeks that he made an official remark at the council, as well as the first one since he was ordered to face a local primary in his Busan constituency.In contrast with the ruling party, which is seeking to step up its nomination clear out, The Minjoo Party of Korea has been making drastic renewal-driven decisions to wipe out traces of the former leadership.The party’s nomination management committee announced Monday that it would make strategic nominations in the administrative city of Sejong.This effectively denies party candidacy for incumbent sixth-termer Rep. Lee Hae-chan, who was a former prime minister and close aide to the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun. Kim Chong-in, interim leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea. YonhapIt was also taken as a symbolic move by interim party chief Kim Chong-in, to once and for all strike out those affiliated to the former leadership, even at the price of losing a stronghold constituency.Kim was brought to the party leadership earlier this year to replace Rep. Moon Jae-in, amid escalating criticism that the former Roh clique was monopolizing power.“It is up to the leadership to make political judgment on whether or not to nominate Lee ,” the party’s nomination chief Hong Chang-sun has said repeatedly, evading direct responsibility for excluding the influential senior lawmaker.Lee immediately vowed to fight against the party’s decision and to continue his election campaign as planned.By Bae Hyun-jung","mudslinging turf war parties ,to thoroughly reshuffle candidates ,into mudslinging turf war ,mudslinging turf war ,turned into factional battle",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79641181  0.15448722

Prosecutors said they confiscated the 1.3 kilograms of meth at the site.""Recently, the place of purchase has been diversified from China and the Philippines to Cambodia and Thailand,"" said an official, underlining the importance of joint investigations among the countries.","alleged methamphetamine smuggling prosecutors ,indicted two south koreans ,smuggling prosecutors said monday ,methamphetamine smuggling prosecutors said ,methamphetamine smuggling prosecutors","['South Koreans', 'Cambodia', ""the Daejeon District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'southeast asian', ""South Korea 's""]",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.37530202  0.74999553

He applied for naturalization the same year, but the ministry turned it down citing the “misconduct.”“The traffic accident was a mistake, with the counterpart also partly responsible … The Justice Ministry’s decision abuses and deviates from the scope of its power,” the Seoul Administrative Court ruled.The Nepalese had no criminal record or tax delinquency during the nine years here. He also passed all the necessary written tests and interview. The number of naturalized Koreans has reached 29,506 between 2013 and July 2015, according to the Justice Ministry.From March this year, a foreign national seeking naturalization as a South Korean must have assets of at least 60 million won or regular income that surpasses the per capita gross national income. Last year’s per capita GNI was 29.7 million won.

This is part of the full weight of responsibility that a state leader is bound to bear.His or her speeches, as well as the manner in which they are stated, are not just personal opinions or plain descriptions of facts. They are messages to the political audience, policy guidelines of the nation, or even previews of future government actions.But such pressure may have slipped the mind of President Park Geun-hye, who has recently flip-flopped her tone on the nation’s economy from gravely concerned to encouragingly hopeful.“Our recent economic situation has shown several positive aspects, including a slowdown in export decline, as well as a steady growth in consumption and employment,” Park said this Monday during her meeting with top aides.Considering the lasting challenges posed from the weak global economy, these accomplishments are not as bad as they are made out to be, she also said.The improved economic indicators which she quoted were indeed true. But it was the president’s sudden upturn of attitude that caught many off guard.These were Park’s words during the same kind of meeting held on Feb. 22, just two weeks before her show of optimism: “We started off this year in a solemn heart but the external economic situation turned out to be much more challenging than expected.”In a New Year’s address in mid-January, Park even used the term “national emergency” to underline the economic difficulties, reminding the nation of the mass layoffs and financial losses of the 1997-1998 financial crisis.One may find the president’s tone graph capricious but in fact, there is one key principle that lies beneath her wording.When pushing ahead with the passage of pending economic and labor reform bills, Park cites the grim parts of the economic reality -- prolonged slow growth, low employment rate, and widening social polarization.When it comes to the opposition’s rebuke upon current economic situations, however, the president chooses to put on a cheerful front. Over the past weeks, during which Park has revised her views on the nation’s economic prospects, The Minjoo Party of Korea’s interim chief and celebrated economist Kim Chong-in has increasingly been snapping at what he sees as Park’s economic policy failure.Such reproach from a former aide of hers certainly seems to have delivered a blow to the president, especially with about a month left till the April 13 parliamentary elections.But despite all the odds and political stakes, Park, being the state leader that she is, should remember to look at the big picture.For every inconsistent word, when spoken by the president, may lead to more than is intended.By Bae Hyun-jung","president connotes more than ,political audience policy guidelines ,president park should weigh ,weigh her words every ,the president connotes",[],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57589906  0.54067469

In a taped telephone conversation leaked to local media on Tuesday, Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the Saenuri Party, who had served as a presidential adviser on political affairs in 2015, said that he would “eliminate” his party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung to block his attempt to sway the nomination process in his favor.“I am going to kill Kim Moo-sung,” said the second-term lawmaker during a conversation with an individual he refused to identify. “I am going to single out  and block him from being nominated as a candidate for the elections,” Yoon said. Admitting to making the comments, Yoon noted that he was drunk at that time and attempted to apologize to Kim. Kim refused to accept the apology by avoiding Yoon when he came to visit at his office.The Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. YonhapThe comments by a long-time loyalist to President Park Geun-hye added fuel to the factional feud, which has been escalating since Rep. Chung Doo-un alleged on Sunday that the pro-Park faction is plotting to dominate the conservative party’s nomination process. Chung claimed that chairman Kim allegedly nudged him about the existence of a secret list of party members branded as “unqualified” candidates to be nominated. It was reported that the list mostly included members from the non-Park faction. Kim has downplayed Chung’s claim but the incident exemplified the long-standing clash between the non-Park faction led by the chairman and the pro-Park faction over the rule on determining candidates for the elections. The Saenuri leadership agrees that Yoon’s remarks crossed the line and they are discussing how much “punishment” will be sufficient, including a nomination ban.“I think Yoon should leave politics,” said Rep. Hong Moon-jong, the third-term lawmaker who is classified as those against the pro-Park faction. “Keeping Yoon as a party member would be harmful to the party particularly when we head into the elections,” Hong said. Rep. Lee Jae-oh asserted that the party should find out whether loyalists to President Park have actually been mobilized to influence the nomination process, urging Yoon to identify the person that he had talked with. “It must be someone who holds sway over the nomination process,” Lee said. Yoon and his ally in the pro-Park faction contended that the scandal was “politically motivated,” saying that someone aiming to undermine his faction illegally wiretapped the telephone conversation and leaked it to the press.“I wasn’t attempting to intervene in the nomination process,” said Yoon. “I know I have made a terrible mistake, but the allegation is absurd. Additionally, listening in on someone’s private conversation and leaking it to the public is the last thing we should do,” said Yoon. Rep. Suh Chung-won, a leader of the pro-Park faction, supported Yoon, comparing the scandal to a smear campaign against his faction. “I don’t know whom I can trust in a world where people try to record private conversations and leak it to the media,” Suh said.

The Korean authorities had requested the extradition of Yoo, who has been living in Paris, as part of the probe into suspected links between the embezzlement and safety defects leading to the sinking of Sewol ferry on April 16, 2014. An overloaded ferry and the government’s botched rescue efforts have been blamed for the nation’s worst maritime disaster.  Yoo had refused the call and went on the run, but French police arrested Yoo at her luxurious apartment in Paris in May 2014. She had filed a suit with a French court to fight the extradition bid. Yoo had denied the charges and maintained that she was not related to the Sewol ferry disaster. She had denounced the extradition attempt as politically motivated. She had also claimed that she would suffer from forcible labor in jail and that the trials held in Korea would lean against her.An appeals court had ordered the French authorities to extradite Yoo to Korea in December 2015, saying that Yoo is entitled to her rights for defense and fair trial in Korea. The highest court had dismissed Yoo’s claim about possible human rights violation in prison. Even if the extradition takes effect with the French Prime Minister signing off on the plan, the process will likely take long as Yoo has vowed to lodge an appeal with France’s highest administrative court and then the European Court of Human Rights. “We plan to do our best to rapidly extradite Yoo in close cooperation with the French government,” an official from the Justice Ministry said. Yoo’s brother Yoo Dae-Kyun was found guilty of money laundering and jailed for two years in May 2015. Lee Jun-seok, the captain of the Sewol ferry, was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of gross negligence and dereliction of duty in November 2015.By Ock Hyun-ju","late south korean tycoon ,deadly 2014 sewol ferry ,tuesday the extradition ,embezzling about 49 billion ,korean authorities on suspicion","['french', 'south korean', 'Yoo Sum - na', 'Cheoghaejin Marine', 'korean', 'korean']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28892788  0.41489154

China has voiced vehement opposition to such a deployment.The resolution also calls for ""the expansion of information and intelligence sharing"" between the three countries and underscores the importance of the trilateral relationship in tracking North Korea human rights violations and holding it accountable for its abuses.In December 2014, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan signed a memorandum of understanding that calls for voluntary sharing of military secrets on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs between the three countries. The deal paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to share such intelligence via the U.S. after the two countries failed to strike a bilateral intelligence sharing deal in 2012 due in part to negative public sentiment in South Korea about signing such a pact with the former colonial ruler.The agreement has since been put into action, but officials have suggested that there has been not enough information sharing taking place among the three countries.","bipartisan resolution last week ,korea japan house lawmaker ,salmon introduced the bipartisan ,rep matt salmon introduced ,house lawmaker has introduced","['U.S. House', 'U.S.', 'asian', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'north korean', 'Matt Salmon', 'Ed Royce', 'the House Foreign Affairs Committee']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.08557788  0.20975742

Cheong Wa Dae“Our economy has made improvements in several key sectors recently, including a slowdown in the export decline, a steady growth in consumption and general employment,” Park said in a meeting with top aides at Cheong Wa Dae.“Considering the lasting challenges , such accomplishments are not as bad as they are made out to be.”She also urged people not to be intimidated, claiming that an excessive level of anxiety and the consequent shrinking consumer confidence may deal an actual blow to the real economy.“Once the government’s ongoing financial policies such as prolonging the individual vehicle excise tax take effect, the economy will be back on track,” she said.The president’s explanatory comments seemingly responded to Kim Chong-in, her former economic advisor and current interim leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea.“Unless  makes a fundamental turn in its economic policies, it will face failure, just as the Japanese economy did years ago,” Kim said at a party meeting on Monday.The ruling-turned-opposition politician has repeatedly stressed that the largest blunder of the Park government is its economic maladministration, adding weight to the opposition’s push for change of power in the upcoming April parliamentary elections.By Bae Hyun-jung","optimistic on economy president ,park optimistic on economy ,on economy president park ,economy president park geun ,economy president park","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Jong - in', 'Park Geun - hye']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2578249   0.53564483

Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party -- have distinctly different election strategies.Kim, a 75-year-old veteran politician who was scouted as relief pitcher for the feud-ridden party, has made it clear that he is ready to accept anything if only to achieve a significant number of parliamentary seats in the imminent April general elections.Ahn, on the other hand, has quite a few balls to juggle. Besides struggling to draw a line with the mainstream opposition camp and demonstrating his newborn party’s independent foothold ahead of April, he also has to map his way to the 2017 presidential race.It is for such reasons that Ahn sternly turned down the idea of opposition unity, even at the risk of losing against the ruling conservative Saenuri Party.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People's Party. Yonhap“Though the People’s Party is wandering in the wilderness, surrounded by enemies, there will be no turning back,” Ahn said Sunday in a press conference.“We realize that this could mean death for all, but so be it.”He thereby reiterated his flat refusal to Kim’s recent suggestion to “form an opposition unity for the sake of election victory,” despite the party’s plummeting ratings. Surveys have indicated that the new party’s approval ratings, which had once neared the 20 percent mark, fell to the 5-6 percent range in late February to early March.Ahn is well aware that returning back to the mainstream opposition group would amount to giving up on his presidential roadmap. Kim Chong-in, interim chief of The Minjoo Party of Korea. Yonhap“A party is bound to split apart when there are more than two within the party aspiring for presidency,” Kim said Saturday during a talk concert at Chonbuk University, referring to Ahn who may later compete with The Minjoo’s presidential runner Moon Jae-in.In defense of his uncompromising rejection to unity, Ahn underlined that he had made three landmark concessions for the opposition over the past years, but these had been in vain.The former information technology guru attracted the public’s attention when he renounced his potential candidacy back in the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election, giving way to then-civic activist Park Won-soon.He also united camps with opposition candidate Moon in the 2012 presidential race and later joined the then-Democratic Party in 2013, accepting the party’s repeated call for opposition unity.“Mayor Park has made my concession worthwhile by winning the election as well as the people’s trust, but  has fallen short of every promise that it has made,” Ahn said.The Minjoo chief, who is largely aloof about his own political career development, has decided to pay undivided attention to the April race.“I have no ambitions for a parliamentary seat or any other position,” Kim said.“There are wild speculations on my political plots, but I am a 75-year-old man who was called back into the political circles.” Kim, who formerly served as chief economic strategist for President Park, joined the opposition camp earlier this year as election strategy chief, allowing chairman Moon to step down from party affairs.Once in power, he pushed ahead with a series of drastic plans to ready the party for the parliamentary elections. This included eyebrow-raising moves such as demanding for the termination of the high-profile filibuster and suggesting an opposition unity with party defectors.Under all circumstances, the top priority task for the opposition is to judge the maladministration of the Park Geun-hye government by achieving victory on April 13, according to Kim.Despite his apparent indifference to power, observers continue to speculate that the interim leader may further consolidate his power and possibly challenge the party’s proportional representative seat.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition chiefs at odds ,year old veteran politician ,two opposition party leaders ,odds over election blueprints ,pitcher for the feud","['Kim Chong - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ahn Cheol', 'the People ’s Party', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36214846  0.35634238

The agency is expected to invest some 42 billion won into the project.Prosecutors suspect that some parts and equipment do not meet mission requirements, and that the evaluation and verification process to designate the contractor has not been carried out in a thorough manner.In a separate case, prosecutors have sought a formal detention warrant from a local court against a retired colonel, identified only by his surname Kim. He is suspected of forging documents and siphoning off munitions.A series of shady deals has come to light over the last year since a special investigation team -- comprised of government, military and prosecution officials -- cracked down on corruption in the defense industry.To continue its monitoring of unlawful activities that has been undertaken by the special team, the government opened a new department under the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office last month to cover corruption in the defense industry.","prosecutors investigate alleged corruption ,arms dealing prosecutors launched ,in arms dealing prosecutors ,prosecutors launched an investigation ,investigation into south korea","[""South Korea 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", ""Defense Acquisition Program Administration 's""]",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35428807  0.36871186

The Saenuri Party accused the opposition of derailing the passage of business legislation that did not make it to the last plenary session. The fate of the bills, such as those on relaxing regulations in the service industry and overhauling the labor market, look dim as the 19th Assembly will spend its final days boosting the incumbents’ re-election bid instead of arranging more plenary sessions. The current session ends on March 10. The Minjoo Party, discouraged by the Wednesday passage of the antiterrorism bill but boosted by the consolidated support from the filibuster, vowed to turn up its election campaign mode.“Now is time to translate the filibuster energy into an opposition alliance,” said Minjoo Party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul. The last filibusterer described the marathon speech as an opportunity to “unite against the Park Geun-hye administration.” Throughout the 192-hour speeches, some lawmakers from the minor Justice Party and the Peoples’ Party joined the marathon speech led by the main opposition, criticizing the government-backed counter-terrorism bill.  The floor leader’s remark came a day after the party’s interim leader Kim Jong-in suggested that the opposition parties should merge into a single party ahead of the general election to prevent the Saenuri Party from seizing majority in the Assembly. Leadership from the People`s Party: Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, Rep. Chun Jung-bae and Rep. Kim Han-gil. YonhapThe interim leader’s proposal roiled the opposition bloc, particularly the People’s Party which has been struggling to boost its stagnant popularity despite its pledge to create a new political force. Opinion polls suggest that the newly-built party’s supporting rate is far below that of the two mainstream parties.On Thursday, Kim slammed People’s Party founder Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, who shunned his coalition idea a day ago. The 75-year-old politician charged that the former presidential candidate opposed the offer because he is “still obsessed with the idea of him becoming the next president.”   Ahn again on Thursday derided Kim’s remark as a “cowardly political gimmick” to deflect the voters’ attention from the legislative impasse and sabotage his party before the elections. But other key members argued that Ahn should give more thought to the offer.  “We need to have a serious discussion ,” said the People’s Party co-chairman Rep. Chun Jung-bae. Rep. Park Jie-won, a liberal bigwig who joined the party on Wednesday, went further to embrace the offer by saying that “the opposition needs to build a coalition.” The Saenuri Party, for its part, derided the coalition move as a political stunt repeated among liberal parties. It instead rushed to devise its own strategy for the election. The conservative party has publicly announced that it will win more than 180 seats. Some key members of the leadership, most of those within the faction close to President Park, urged its leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung to allow the party to “strategically” nominate what it considers to be a proven candidate for the elections. “Under any circumstances, we need to build our own principle and power to compete with other parties. For that to happen, we have to fill the party’s candidate list with those who are deemed competitive by voters’ standard,” said Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the Saenuri Party.

Security Council resolution slapping tough sanctions on North Korea for its recent provocations, Seoul's Foreign Ministry said Thursday.During their talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken also agreed to further raise pressure on the North to denuclearize through stringent bilateral sanctions and international cooperation.""Minister Yun and Deputy Secretary Blinken shared the understanding that the adoption of the resolution carrying the strongest and effective sanctions is a representative case of the close cooperation between South Korea and the U.S.,"" the ministry said in a press release.Yun and Blinken were in Geneva to attend a set of international conferences on arms control and human rights.Their talks came after the UNSC adopted Resolution 2270 to punish the North for its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and its long-range missile launch on Feb. 7, and to curb its weapons programs through a fresh package of stringent sanctions.The new measures require mandatory inspection of all cargo going into and out of the North, while banning its exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a key source of hard currency that accounts for nearly half of the country's aggregate exports to China.The two officials also noted that the ""serious"" human rights abuses in the North could pose a threat to peace and security of the international community by increasing the risks of instability in the isolated state. To help address the issue, they agreed to seek to bring more international attention to the human rights of North Korean laborers overseas.North Korea watchers believe more than 50,000 North Koreans are working under very poor conditions overseas, mostly in Russia and China. The communist regime is thought to extort most of their earnings, which are estimated at around $200 million per year.Pointing to the possibility of additional North Korean provocations, Yun and Blinken agreed to maintain a firm joint defense. Separately, Yun held talks with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the Foreign Ministry said. They shared the need to implement a set of recommendations that the U.N.Commission of Inquiry has made to enhance the North's woeful human rights situation.In early 2014, the COI released its investigation report on the North's human rights conditions. The report found evidence of torture, executions, arbitrary incarceration, deliberate starvation and other appalling practices that the COI said amounted to ""crimes against humanity.""","on wednesday foreign minister ,its recent provocations seoul ,thursday during their talks ,wednesday foreign minister yun ,wednesday foreign minister","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.N.

He has worked as a coach and manager of the national water polo team on multiple occasions since 2004.        About a week ago a warrant was issued to detain another board member of the national swimming organization over alleged bribery.A number of officials from the organization are also under investigation over corruption charges. Last month, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced that it would stop providing subsidies to the national swimming body due to corruption scandals.    The culture ministry said the federation is suspected of forging documents and siphoning off training expenses meant to go to athletes.","embezzlement prosecutors said wednesday ,latest crackdown on corruption ,national swimming body arrested ,arrested over alleged embezzlement ,swimming federation on charges","[""South Korea 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'the Korea Swimming Federation']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.17770208  0.38119972

Filibusterers, many of them within the hawkish wing of The Minjoo Party of Korea, urged the party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul to rethink his decision to halt the marathon speech against counterterrorism bills they believe have gained popularity among liberal voters and moderates. “Though we started the filibuster, it is not up to us ,” Rep. Eun soo-mi said on her Twitter account. The first-term lawmaker had set the record for the longest-ever address in the National Assembly before fellow member Rep. Jung Chung-rae broke it. Rep. Kim Kwang-jin, who was the first debater for the filibuster that began on Feb. 23, also asked, “What are we supposed to tell the people now, after spending 150 hours describing how the bill poses problems?”The opposition’s dilemma over the filibuster was expected. While it consolidated its supporters and received praise for offering an encouraging alternative from confrontational policies, it also failed to dramatically spike support ratings, especially with pressure building to pass urgent bills such as for the new electoral map.The Minjoo Party of Korea floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul  cheers independent Rep. Jeon Jeong-hee after she completes her filibuster speech at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Late Monday night, the party’s interim leader Kim Jong-in reportedly tried to persuade Lee Jong-kul for hours that the suspension of the filibuster is the way to go to prevent it from backfiring into an ideological fight, inviting blame for causing further election delays. Lee was the first to propose and push the filibuster as a way to block the majority ruling party from endorsing the controversial bills designed to give stronger surveillance power to the National Intelligence Service and fortify preventive measures against terrorist attacks.Lee consequently planned a press conference at 9 a.m. on Tuesday to declare the end of the filibuster, though it was delayed at the last minute.The party planned a general assembly later in the evening to further discuss their options.“We delayed the  in order to hear from the members who oppose the decision ... the decision to suspend it will not be overturned,” said chief deputy floor leader Rep. Lee Choon-suak.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, welcomed the decision, perceived as a triumph for the party in the drawn-out tug-of-war over the controversial counterterrorism bills.“While it is extremely regretful when we think about the hours wasted at the National Assembly through the filibuster, it is a relief that the Minjoo Party came to such decision,” said Saenuri’s chief spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul reiterated that no changes will be made to the counterterrorism bills that the opposition claims will seriously damage civil rights.“After the opposition’s filibuster is suspended, we will be voting on the antiterrorism bills tomorrow. ... There will be no further revision to the bills as we have reflected the demands from them over the past three months.” By Yeo Jun-suk","marathon speech against counterterrorism ,halt the marathon speech ,breaking filibuster tuesday sparked ,the marathon speech against ,legislative deadlock filibusterers many","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Lee Jong - kul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10907425  0.17168972

The technical implications are significant and you understand the political implications better than I do,"" Hecker said. Hecker's trip marked the first time that the North had publicly acknowledged the existence of the program and a facility for it, even though the communist nation had long been suspected of seeking a uranium-based nuclear weapons program. The North has since bolstered its nuclear capabilities and conducted its fourth nuclear test last month, claiming that it successfully conducted its first hydrogen bomb test. Some experts have warned that the communist nation's nuclear arsenal could expand to as many as 100 bombs by 2020.","nuclear scientist uranium enrichment ,very disturbing former secretary ,newly released clinton emails ,american nuclear scientist uranium ,secretary of state hillary","['U.S.', 'State', 'Hillary Clinton', 'North Korea', 'american', 'Clinton', 'Clinton', 'Stanford']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50468278  0.53159672

The unlimited speech relay serves as a rare opportunity to make their case before the national audience, particularly for political rookies and those excluded from their parties’ nomination list for the April general elections. Among them was Rep. Kim Hyun of The Minjoo Party of Korea, a first-term proportional representative who has recently been screened out of the party’s nomination.“We have to take out the toxic clause from the antiterrorism bill that may enable the National Intelligence Service to abuse its power,” said Kim, referring to the allegation that the nation’s top intelligence agency had deliberately interfered with the 2012 presidential election. Photos of opposition lawmakers staging filibuster at the National Assembly. YonhapThe Minjoo Party rebuked the bill as a measure that would curtail civil liberty by expanding the spy agency’s surveillance authority, but the government and the ruling Saenuri Party countered that the bill is crucial to national security and that it included sufficient provisions to prevent such power abuse.Kim’s remark followed Rep. Seo Gi-ho, another first-termer of the progressive minority Justice Party. After his five-hour speech, the former judge announced that he would give up candidacy in the upcoming elections.Rep. Shin Kyoung-min, another Minjoo first-termer and former news anchor, made headlines by pointing out that the ruling Saenuri Party, despite its grudges against the ongoing filibuster, had endorsed the system in the first place back in 2012.The Minjoo Party’s third-term lawmaker Rep. Kang Gi-jung, who is expected to be excluded from the party’s nomination for the parliamentary race, was noticed for his emotional outburst during his four-hour speech late Thursday. “Had I been given an opportunity to discuss freely at the National Assembly, I would not have gone down in history as a violent lawmaker,” said Kang, referring to his past record of using violence against a fellow lawmaker amid attempts to deter the ruling party’s enforcement of a bill passage.Meanwhile, the partisan confrontation over the much-disputed bill showed no signs of abating, both inside and outside parliament. While the opposition bloc set up a placard to support the filibuster at the entrance to the Assembly hall, the Saenuri members held their own signs to protest against it.Civic groups, too, held their ideological battle outside the legislature building. The People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, the nation’s leading progressive civic group, has been conducting a campaign since Tuesday to allow citizens to speak out against the bill.Next to what the left-leaning group calls an “online filibuster,” a conservative group staged its counter protest against the filibuster, urging lawmakers to pass the antiterrorism bill that they claim is crucial to national security.

Security Council is pushing for mandatory cargo inspections, comprehensive arms embargo and a limited ban on mineral exports in the latest bout of measures designed to tighten its sanctions on North Korea over its latest nuclear and missile tests. Following nearly two months of grueling negotiations between Washington and Beijing, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power presented a draft resolution on Thursday in New York. After circulating it to all 15 member states, the council is expected to adopt the resolution over the weekend. “It is a major upgrade and there will be -- provided it goes forward -- pressure on more points, tougher, more comprehensive, more sectors. It’s breaking new ground in a whole host of ways,” Power said ahead of circulating the text at a closed-door meeting. The document carries “the strongest set of sanctions imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades,” she told reporters afterward. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power Seoul, which has joined hands with Washington to call for a “terminating” resolution, also lauded it as “unprecedentedly strong and effective,” expressing hopes for a swift passage.Under the proposal, all U.N. member states would be required to carry out inspections on all shipment passing through their waters to or from North Korea to see if any illicit items are loaded. This marks an upgrade compared with the past when they were obliged to do so only if they had related grounds. Likewise, it would forbid all flights suspected of carrying prohibited items. Also for the first time, it calls for an embargo on the exports of coal, iron, gold, titanium, rare earth minerals and other minerals except for “livelihood purposes,” in another move to squeeze funding sources for the communist state’s nuclear and missile program. The existing small and light arms trade ban would be tightened to cover all weapons, while a new one could be enforced to bar the transfer of any items that may directly help improve the North Korean armed forces’ operational capabilities. On finance, the document would require -- an advancement from “encourage” -- countries to freeze the assets of any North Korean state or ruling Workers’ Party organs involved in banned activities. North Korean banks would be blocked from opening branches abroad and hosting the offices and subsidiaries of other member states’ financial institutions. It also seeks to expand the council’s blacklist by adding 12 entities and 17 individuals including the National Aerospace Development Agency that was in charge of the Feb. 7 long-range rocket firing. An annex to the resolution newly lists 31 ships to be boycotted, all owned by the North’s Ocean Maritime Management Company Ltd. Other suggestions include a sanction on all supplies of jet and rocket fuel and a mandate to oust North Korean diplomats engaged in unlawful activities. “The resolution would send the international community’s united, stern message that it will not accept North Korea’s nuclear, missile and other weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation,” a senior official at South Korea’s Foreign Ministry told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “Once passed, it would hinder the North’s further acquisition of funds, weapons advancement technologies and know-how, thus complicating its nuclear development. “And it’s important that it does not target the North Korean people ... but one of the world’s most oppressive regimes alone.” The Unification Ministry took notice in particular of the mineral trade ban, noting that exports of resources make up more than 40 percent of the North’s total trade volume. “If passed, it would pose a substantial hurdle for its foreign currency income,” ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said at a news briefing on Friday, adding that the government will explore further individual measures as a follow-up action. The draft’s unusual unveiling came one day after U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said they have agreed “on the importance of a strong and united international response to North Korea’s provocations,” according to a statement from the National Security Council. Though Beijing remains Pyongyang’s top diplomatic and economic sponsor, the Kim Jong-un regime’s unabated, flagrant defiance of resolutions -- and its own carrots and sticks -- had apparently placed China in a thorny position in which endorsing tougher penalty was inevitable. “We are opposed to any nuclear testing and the launch testing of ballistic missile technology and we hope this resolution will help to prevent further occurrences of this nature,” Chinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi said after the UNSC session. The White House, for its part, praised Beijing’s cooperation, saying the draft is the proceeds of “extensive” conversations between the sides. “I do think that it is indicative of how productive diplomacy can be. It’s not easy, but it certainly is an indication that the United States and China, when our interests are aligned, can cooperate quite effectively to advance the interests of citizens in both our countries,” spokesman Josh Earnest said during a daily briefing on Thursday.

Meanwhile, the 24-year-old Vietnamese man is accused of forcing his way through the gate of an unmanned automatic immigration checkpoint at Incheon airport on Jan. 29, prosecutors said.The two cases have prompted public concern over security breaches at the country's main gateway, prompting a state audit agency to hold a massive inspection.""An investigation shows that the two cases occurred accidentally and were not a premeditated illegal entry,"" said an Incheon prosecutor, requesting customary anonymity.The prosecution office said it also indicted a 47-year-old Chinese and a 32-year-old Vietnamese on charges of helping the couple and the man, respectively.The Chinese suspect allegedly helped the couple find a house to hide in and a new cellphone, prosecutors said. Following the two high-profile cases, President Park Geun-hye instructed Cabinet officials to strengthen security at the airport.Soon, the country's airport authority set up a team meant to prevent illegal entry by foreigners.","indicted thursday on charges ,foreigners were indicted thursday ,airport last month prosecutors ,three foreigners were indicted ,month prosecutors said thursday","['South Korea', ""the Incheon District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'chinese', 'vietnamese', 'chinese']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29538873  0.77515602

Seocho Police Station asked the prosecutors to indict the 53-year-old novelist for violating the Information Communications Network Act.The move came after the priest, surnamed Kim, from a cathedral in Masan, filed a complaint against Gong, who posted a comment on Facebook in July last year accusing him of using donations for personal gains. According to Gong’s allegations, the priest gathered donations to build shelters around high-voltage transmission lines in Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province, but did not deliver the money to relevant organizations.The priest filed a complaint against Gong, saying that the novelist libeled him with false accusations.   Gong Ji-young Gong has denied the charges, claiming she raised the suspicions based on facts. Police decided to refer her to prosecutors after they found that the collected money had been handed over to groups related to the high-voltage tower and the disabled. Residents in Miryang and the state-run Korea Electronic Power Corporation have clashed over the government’s plan to set up high-voltage transmission lines in the area, leaving two to commit suicide in protest and nearly a hundred injured in the process.Locals have opposed the project, citing health and environmental issues. They have denied compensation from the state and called for alternative measures, such as laying an underground power line or relocating towers to detour away from residential areas. KEPCO officials have denied the suggestions, citing high costs and feasibility. The 53-year-old author is known for her active participation in social issues and for openly discussing themes including dictatorship, feminism and the labor movement in her novels. Since her literary debut “The Arrival of Dawn” in 1988, Gong has written many popular works, including “The Crucible” and “Our Happy Time,” both of which were made into films. By Ock Hyun-ju","embezzling donations seocho police ,old novelist for violating ,the prosecutors to indict ,best selling novelist gong ,priest by falsely accusing","['Gong Ji', 'the Information Communications Network Act', 'Kim', 'Masan', 'Gong']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22468324  0.22127238

The Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office said it confiscated computer hard drives and documents from Volkswagen Korea’s headquarters in Gangnam-gu, southern Seoul, as well as from the houses of high-ranking company officials in charge of product certification.Investigators procured data related to gas emissions and business records, along with emails exchanged with the company’s headquarters in Germany.Investigators from Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office move boxes of confiscated records at the local office of Volkswagen Korea in Seoul on Friday.  YonhapThe move came after VW Korea failed to satisfy the government requirements for its recall plan. The Environment Ministry last month filed a criminal lawsuit against the company after deciding that its plan to recall some 125,000 of its vehicles was missing crucial elements, including cause of defects and a plan to improve them.Korean law stipulates that those who do not comply with the government’s recall orders can face up to five years in jail or a fine of up to 30 million won . The ministry had filed a lawsuit against VW Korea’s managing director Johannes Thammer and Terence Bryce Johnson, head of overseas sales at Audi of VW Group. The company has been accused of violating the Clean Air Conservation Act, which can lead to imprisonment of up to seven years or up to 100 million won in fines.Last year, the ministry found in its emission tests that some of the VW models sold in Korea had used “defeat-device” software to bypass the pollution tests. It ordered the company to recall the rigged vehicles in November.The Fair Trade Commission in January launched an examination of the company’s televised and print media advertisements to determine whether it misled the customers with false advertising by exaggerating capacities of its diesel engine vehicles. VW Korea reportedly complied with Friday’s raid, and said that the company’s position to “actively cooperate with the investigation” remains unchanged.By Yoon Min-sik","volkswagen office raided ,prosecutors on friday raided ,volkswagen office over allegations ,volkswagen office raided in ,office raided in emissions","['Volkswagen', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutor ’s Office', 'Volkswagen Korea ’s', 'Gangnam - gu', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37471548  0.24278334

638,638,[NEWS ANALYSIS] Park’s sudden shift on N.K. raises doubts,"Concerns and skepticism persist over Seoul’s policy direction and future cross-border relations since President Park Geun-hye broke a taboo by warning of “regime collapse” in North Korea.During her parliamentary address Tuesday, Park in effect demanded North Korean leader Kim Jong-un make a choice: Abandon nuclear weapons or face the demise of the communist system.

The recent pullout from the Gaeseong industrial park is only the “beginning” of “strong and effective” steps for a change to be taken by Seoul and the international community, she said. President Park Geun-hye speaks during the National Security Council’s emergency meeting held upon North Korea’s long-range rocket launch on Feb. 7. The speech heralded a sweeping shift from her much-trumpeted trustpolitik vision that had been marked by a blend of solid deterrence and dialogue since her inauguration three years ago. Having singled out “pressure” as the centerpiece of this year’s North Korea policy, Seoul is now expected to further toughen its line, with the door for talks likely to stay shut. But the abrupt turnaround sparked criticism that without a well-thought-out strategy and detailed action plans, as well as close cooperation with key regional partners, it may backfire on Seoul and raise the chances of another major provocation, including limited attacks on South Korea. “Pressure is mostly intended to make Kim realize that his parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development is not working, and bring him back to the negotiating table. But if the dialogue part is missing, it will be very hard to convince the international community,” a diplomatic source said, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. While Pyongyang deserves punishment for the latest nuclear and missile tests, such a hard-line approach would firm up the backing by Russia and China of the Kim regime, said said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. Thus it could further complicate the already drawn-out sanctions discussions at the U.N. Security Council given that possible major turmoil within its destitute neighbor and a consequent refugee exodus appear to remain the top source of anxiety especially for Beijing. Another source of concern is what the Unification Ministry called an “inevitable” severance of humanitarian assistance in addition to private-level exchanges. This represented a major reversal in the administration’s long-held principles toward humanitarian aid, as well as Park’s own vow during the speech “never to face away” from the dire livelihoods of the rank-and-file North Koreans. “The president appears to have decided that she will break its nuclear ambitions and make a regime change happen through omnidirectional pressure on the North, but whether it will prove effective is a different matter,” Koh said. “Given the deepening mutual mistrust, it would be extremely difficult to redefine inter-Korean ties throughout her remaining presidency, and a local provocation and armed clash cannot be ruled out, unless the sides manage to hold meaningful talks such as for a China-mediated exchange of a nuclear moratorium and a peace treaty, which is no less easy.” The U.S., another core stakeholder, is also showing few signs of forsaking its “strategic patience” policy, which has been dubbed a failure by many experts around Washington and Seoul, especially after Pyongyang’s Jan. 6 atomic blast and Feb. 7 long-range rocket test. Though the State Department on Wednesday expressed the U.S.’ support for Park’s “principled and firm approach,” spokesman Mark Toner said strategic patience is a “really big-picture foreign policy concept” and “valid approach in some cases.” “I think there’s also a realization given the past actions, and these are being pursued not only bilaterally or unilaterally, rather, but also within the Security Council, of the need for additional actions on North Korea,” he said at a news briefing. In his own parliamentary address Thursday, Ahn Cheol-soo, cohead of the minor opposition People’s Party, lashed out at the burst of the “regime collapse” discourse among not just the president and ruling party but also some from the opposition. “This does not help to tackle our security worries or bring peace and stability to the peninsula, or even a unification,” Ahn said. “The people know that a sudden change and unification could be a disaster, not a bonanza. What we need is a practical approach instead of an ideological one,” he added, referring to Park’s 2014 drive portraying unification as a “bonanza” for all Koreans. Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, who formerly was an economic adviser to Park, has also said in a media interview that the president’s argument that South Korean cash given to the Gaeseong industrial park has been used to fund the North’s nuclear and missile programs was “incomprehensible.” He called for the administration to provide evidence and reasonable logic behind its decision to shutter the project. By Shin Hyon-hee","collapse in north korea ,her parliamentary address tuesday ,choice abandon nuclear weapons ,abandon nuclear weapons ,korea during her parliamentary","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'abandon', 'Gaeseong']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.26865622 -0.06032223

Last year, the state-run Korea Sports Promotion Foundation was probed for allegedly misappropriating funds, leading to indictments of a number of heads of sports-related companies.Sources said the investigation will expand to the overall sports industry.

Security Council resolutions banning such tests.The resolution says Congress condemns the latest rocket launch and its restart of a plutonium reactor.

The president devoted most of her 30-minute speech to making the case that South Korea must be united against North Korea’s increased security threat following its nuclear test and rocket launch, which Seoul and its allies view as a disguised test for ballistic missile. By the end of her remarks, Park shifted gears and made a passionate plea to lawmakers that they should swiftly pass contentious pending bills designed to relax business regulations in the service industry and overhaul the labor market. “This is the people’s tears, their cries for us to come together as one to overcome the crisis facing our nation,” said Park, citing the business-led petition campaign to pressure the Assembly to enact the bills. The most frequent words to appear during her address were “North Korea” and “we ” She used these words 54 and 50 times respectively. She also mentioned the possibility of North Korea’s demise for the first time. On the other hand, she barely used words or phrases with pacifist connotations. For instance, she used the word “engagement” only once and “dialogue” was not used at all. Park’s speech incurred mixed responses from both sides of the aisle. While the ruling Saenuri Party’s lawmakers welcomed her with a standing ovation and gave loud applause to her remarks. Opposition liberal parties, The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party, were reluctant to exhibit supportive gestures.   Ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers huddle to greet President Park Geun-hye at the National Assembly on Tuesday. The divided atmosphere was vivid when Park lashed out at the previous liberal administrations’ efforts to engage with the communist regime via economic cooperation.  The late Kim-Dae Jung and Roh-Moo-hyun administrations had provided the North with food and financial aid to boost inter-Korea relations. Some opposition lawmakers looked at their smartphones or even let out sighs, when Park said, “We should not succumb to the North’s pressure and end up providing loads of money to it.” Those from the Saenuri Party, on the other hand, applauded.“I think it was a great speech,” the Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung said after the event. “What the president said today was basically what we had wanted to talk about. She has done a great job of delivering the message to the people in a compelling manner,” said Kim. The Minjoo Party, however, described the speech as a “disappointment.” The main opposition party’s spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-soo said in a statement that the president failed to spell out the reasons why she decided to shut down the cross-border industrial complex. Kim went on to argue that the failure to specify the reasons is tantamount to tacit acknowledgement that her administration had violated the United Nation’s resolution, which bans its members from helping fund the North’s nuclear and missile programs. Since South Korea decided to suspend operations at Gaesong Compex, whose earnings the government said had been funneled into the widely-condemned weapon program, lawmakers urged the government to clarify the link and that not doing so would constitute violation of the UN resolution.   Some experts said the speech could have been designed better to convince people that they should endorse her hardline initiative towards the North and constant efforts to enact economy bills.  “Park should have focused solely on the national security issue,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University, referring to how one-fifth of her speech was devoted to swift passage of pending bills. “I think we are in a national crisis. Park, as a leader, should have reassured the people and laid out a solution to tackle the crisis. She could have made her message succinct and brief, so that people would rally behind her efforts to overcome the crisis,” he said.  Yoon Sung-yi, politics professor of Kyung Hee University agreed. “Considering the speech at the Assembly is conducted in a limited time frame, it is unlikely for her to make her case and communicate with the people. She should have set up a press briefing to tell the people why she made such decisions,” Yoon said. By Yeo Jun-suk","her 30 minute speech ,opposition lawmakers the president ,mixed reactions president park ,the conservative leader relentless ,lawmakers the president devoted","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'the National Assembly', 'South Korea', 'North Korea ’s']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.19131954  0.68965924

The Korea HeraldThis is the first time that the president has volunteered a speech at the legislative body, except for regular administrative policy speeches regarding budget and overall administration.Since North Korea launched a long-range rocket on Feb. 7, Park has mostly refrained from speaking directly on the issue except for her immediate reaction following the test.“The United Nations Security Council should promptly come up with powerful disciplinary actions,” the president said at the National Security Council meeting on the day of the provocation.With Park’s support, the administration moved fast to respond to the North.The Defense Ministry immediately started discussions on deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system in South Korea, after months of avoiding the issue as its introduction is strongly opposed by China and Russia.Later last week, the Unification Ministry shut down the inter-Korean industrial park in Gaesong.While the government’s stern measures were welcomed by the U.S. and Korean hard-liners, Park’s lack of sufficient explanation has not been received kindly by the public, observers said.“President Park has no consideration for international politics,” said former Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyun.“Diplomacy and international politics should not be approached in black-and-white logic.”Cheong Wa Dae, however, is set to use the outside risk as an opportunity to make a breakthrough.“The president will underline the importance of the parliament’s legislative function, especially in times of trouble, and urge for the swift passage of the terrorism prevention bill, North Korean human rights bill and the labor reform bills,” Kim said.By Bae Hyun-jung","tuesday calling for unity ,korean strife following military ,key bills president park ,assembly on tuesday calling ,strife president park geun","['Park Geun', 'the National Assembly', 'inter - korean', 'Park', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.02902891  0.50877357

It goes to the North Korean government instead,"" Hong said.""Any foreign currency earned in North Korea is transferred to the Workers' Party, where the money is used to develop nuclear weapons or missiles, or to purchase luxury goods.""Last week, South Korea shut down the industrial park in response to the North's recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch. Opened in 2004, the complex had long been a big cash cow for North Korea.North Korea, in turn, expelled all South Korean nationals on Thursday from the complex and froze factory assets by South Korean firms, further driving the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation to the brink.Earlier Sunday, the ministry released a statement with much the same details, saying it has received reports from ""multiple channels"" claiming the majority of the workers' wages had been funneled into the North's ruling party.When asked if South Korea should have shut down the complex earlier, Hong responded by saying the positive impact of running the factory park outweighed the risk of financing the North's weapons programs until now.""The international community recognized the significance of operating the Gaeseong Industrial Park,"" Hong said. ""So we continued to keep the place in operation despite multiple nuclear tests. We decided to shut it down this time because North Korea was only going to intensify its weapons development, and we needed to make a decisive move to alleviate our people's security concerns.""Hong said the decision to close down the factory zone was solely South Korea's, adding, ""China and other neighbors showed some interest in the matter, but we reached the decision on our own.""The minister added he hasn't identified any problems in the area since the South Korean workers were pulled.A total of 124 South Korean firms were operating factories at the complex, employing more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods such as clothes and utensils.The complex opened in 2004 as a result of the first inter-Korean summit in 2000. It had been a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea benefited from cheap but skilled North Korean labor.","wages to develop weapons ,korea has used wages ,workers party to bankroll ,television appearance unification minister ,korean affairs said sunday","[""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Unification', 'Hong Yong - pyo', ""Workers ' Party""]",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50409865  0.71597356

Shin Yee-jin, the party's spokeswoman said. She pointed out that unless stringent measures are taken at this juncture, there is no way to get the North to turn its tide.The decision to close Gaeseong, which has been churning out goods since late 2004, directly impacts 124 South Korean companies that have manufacturing operations in the North Korean town just north of the inter-Korean demarcation line. It also cuts off the last remaining economic link between the two countries, although Seoul said the move is needed to stop the flow of cash that can be used to bolster up the Kim Jong-un regime and allow it to build up its nuclear and long-range missile arsenal.The belligerent regime fired off a multi-stage missile, which could have the capability to target parts of the United States, on Sunday, only a month after it detonated its fourth nuclear device on Jan. 6. Both actions are seen as a slap in the face of past warnings issued against North Korea by countries around the world.The spokesperson said that the National Assembly should have one voice when it comes to national security, but the opposition only seems to be interested in criticizing the government.She then said that the opposition actions are fueling worries among the general public.""If the opposition is trying to use the Gaeseong closure to win support ahead of the April election, it can only be seen as these parties have seriously deficient views when it comes to national security,"" the lawmaker said.The opposition parties, on the other hand, blasted the Gaeseong closure as counterproductive and harmful to long-term cross-border relations.In particular, they attacked remarks made by Seoul's unification minister, who argued that the complex conflicted with United Nations Resolution 2094 banning the flow of funds to the North that can be used to make missile and nuclear weapons.Rep. Kim Sung-soo spokesman for the Minjoo Party said the unification ministry's comments are a serious matter and shows that the government admitted to breaking the resolution.""Unless this matter is explained properly, it may be hard for people to believe that funds that went to Gaeseong were misused to make the North's nuclear weapons,"" he said.Others like Chang Jin-young, the spokesman for the minor People's Party said that of the US$100 million in funds sent to the North through Gaeseong, about 70 percent is used to pay for wages, with only 30 percent going to the state.""The funds at the government's disposal is enough and I don't think even President Park Geun-hye really thinks the money was used to make missiles and nuclear weapons,"" the official claimed.He then said the government's decision, while it can lead to120 billion won  in lost revenue for the North Korean regime, can lead to 2 trillion won in damages for South Korea and hurt local small and medium-sized enterprises and their employees.""By taking such drastic actions, President Park is inflicting serious damages not only onto North Korea, but local firms and workers,"" Chang claimed.","the upcoming general elections ,locked horns on saturday ,political parties lock horns ,saturday over the government ,upcoming general elections","['North Korea', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69250178  0.29989341

645,645,Several U.S. states seek to block 2nd trimester abortion method,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Abortion opponents in Mississippi, West Virginia and several other states are filing bills to ban an abortion procedure commonly used in the second trimester that opponents describe as dismembering a fetus.Courts have already blocked similar laws that Kansas and Oklahoma enacted in 2015.The New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion providers in legal fights, says ...","JACKSON, Miss.  -- Abortion opponents in Mississippi, West Virginia and several other states are filing bills to ban an abortion procedure commonly used in the second trimester that opponents describe as dismembering a fetus.Courts have already blocked similar laws that Kansas and Oklahoma enacted in 2015.The New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion providers in legal fights, says banning the dilation and evacuation method of abortion -- commonly called ""D&E;"" -- is unconstitutional because it interferes with private medical decisions.""Laws like these are an attack on women's health, personal autonomy, and the doctor-patient relationship, and they have the potential to force physicians to subject women seeking safe and legal abortion services in the second trimester to additional invasive and unnecessary procedures,"" Kelly Baden, the center's director of state advocacy, said in a letter this week to West Virginia lawmakers.Baden said dilation and evacuation is the safest method for the second trimester and is used for about 95 percent of all second-trimester abortions in the U.S.The Mississippi bill uses language provided by the Washington-based National Right to Life Committee. It would prohibit any abortion that would involve extracting a live fetus in pieces from the uterus using instruments like clamps and forceps, calling that procedure a ""dismemberment abortion.""Mary Balch, director of state legislation for the anti-abortion group, said the proposals would not ban all dilation and evacuation abortions. The law would still allow abortions in which the fetus is dead before it is extracted, which she said do not pose any greater health risk to the woman.The Center for Reproductive Rights says it is not always medically necessary to induce fetal death before starting an abortion, and it's never required before 18 weeks, when most women would be seeking abortions. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is no evidence that inducing fetal death makes second-trimester abortions safer. If proposals such as those in Mississippi become law, the Center said a woman seeking a D&E; abortion would have to have an injection to the fetus to stop its development before the procedure.Republican Rep. Sam Mims, chairman of the Mississippi House Public Health Committee, is sponsoring the proposal to ban a procedure he calls ""very graphic.""""I believe that life begins at conception. To me, this is a baby,"" Mims said.Similar bills are also being filed in Idaho, Missouri, Minnesota and Nebraska, Balch said. Others are expected in Kentucky, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and South Carolina, said Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Rights.Mississippi has enacted several abortion restrictions in recent years, including banning abortions after 20 weeks' gestation last year. The U.S. Supreme Court later this year will consider the constitutionality of a 2011 Mississippi law that requires physicians at the state's only abortion clinic to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital. The physicians have been unable to obtain them, but the law has been blocked by federal courts.Diane Derzis is the owner of the lone Mississippi abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, which does abortions up to 15 weeks' gestation. She said the state is inviting another expensive lawsuit by trying to ban a commonly used abortion method.""This is just another way of attacking abortion,"" Derzis said. ""An entire, intact fetus is not the result of any abortion, so it affects all abortions.""In West Virginia, Republican Sen. Ryan Ferns is chairman of the Health and Human Resources Committee that is scheduled to consider an amended version of the proposed ban on Thursday. The changed bill will say that second-trimester dilation and evacuation procedures are illegal unless the physician first ``creates demise or death'' of the fetus. It doesn't apply to emergency procedures.Ferns said there are a variety of ways a physician can accomplish that, including breaking the amniotic sack.""We're not preventing a second-trimester abortion,"" Ferns said. ""We just don't want an unborn child to have to go through the gruesome procedure of being ripped apart limb by limb while they're still alive.""There would be no criminal or civil penalties, but a physician could be called before the board of medicine for a license review.West Virginia Delegate Stephen Skinner, a Democrat, opposes the bill.""Banning a method of a medical procedure is not something the Legislature should get involved in,"" Skinner said. ""We need to let doctors decide what's best for their patient in consultation with the patient and her family. The Legislature getting into the practice of medicine is a dangerous thing.""","abortion opponents in mississippi ,block 2nd trimester abortion ,to ban an abortion ,miss ap abortion opponents ,2nd trimester abortion method","['JACKSON', 'Miss.', 'AP', 'Mississippi', 'West Virginia', 'Kansas', 'Oklahoma', 'New York', 'Center for Reproductive Rights']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37706381 -0.23382376

646,646,Court orders ex-dictator’s son to pay fines on behalf of his father," A Seoul court ruled that the son of the former dictator Chun Doo-hwan should pay the fines unpaid by his father to the government through his company assets, legal sources said Wednesday. It marks the first victory for the government in a lawsuit against the 85-year-old ex-president since the prosecution launched a special investigation team in 2013 to collect the unpaid fines.  Chun Doo-hwan (Yonhap)The Seoul Cen...","A Seoul court ruled that the son of the former dictator Chun Doo-hwan should pay the fines unpaid by his father to the government through his company assets, legal sources said Wednesday. It marks the first victory for the government in a lawsuit against the 85-year-old ex-president since the prosecution launched a special investigation team in 2013 to collect the unpaid fines.  Chun Doo-hwan The Seoul Central District Court ordered the publishing company Sigongsa, founded in 1989 and run by Chun’s eldest son Jae-kook, to pay 5.7 billion won  for the six-year period on behalf of his father.Jae-kook owns slightly more than 50 percent of shares in the publishing company that posted revenue of 1.9 billion won in 2014. According to the verdict, the company will have to pay 700 million to 1.5 billion won every year from 2016 to 2021 to the state. If the money is not paid in time, the amount is set to increase by 5 to 15 percent. The ruling came after prosecutors lodged a suit against Jae-kook to directly collect 6.3 billion won from the sale of the Sigongsa-owned building. The property was auctioned off for an estimated 11.6 billion won.Chun, who rose to power in a military coup in 1979, was convicted for taking bribes from Korean companies and for his role in the 1980 Gwangju uprising. His crackdown in the southwestern city left about 200 pro-democracy protestors dead.In 1997, Chun was ordered to return to the state some 220 billion won he had accumulated through kickbacks while in office from 1980 to 1988. He took the bribes in return for giving favors to companies. He refused to pay the penalties at first, claiming that he was broke, despite news reports of his family leading a life of luxury here and in the U.S.. Chun and his family eventually promised to voluntarily pay the money by September 2013 in the face of public criticism.As Chun’s statute of limitation was set to expire in October 2013, the National Assembly passed a bill to extend it to 2020. The bill allowed authorities collect the fine from Chun’s family members if the asset was proven to have originated from his illegally earned funds. The prosecution has searched Chun and his family’s residences and seized artwork, real estate and valuables since it opened the investigation in 2013. As of 2014, Chun and his family have paid only 51.4 percent of the fines, or 113 billion won. Last November, the U.S. government also returned more than $1.1 million to South Korea that it had forfeited from Chun and his family in the country. The U.S. froze the money from the sale of their residence in California and investment bonds. The prosecution filed another suit against Jae-gook’s firm Libro last year, to collect an estimated 2.5 billion won. Several items of real estate were put up for auction and the proceeds will be transferred to the state.

It will also be offering the service in more foreign languages.The Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission said it has started operating the online petition e-People service via Korean.net as well as its own website .The e-People site’s original Korean name was “Sinmungo” , which comes from a system during Joseon Dynasty in which a person that had complaints could inform authorities by striking a drum. The homepage of “e-People,” online petition service operated by the Anti-corruption and Civil Rights CommissionSimilar to this ancient practice, the service allows Koreans -- both here and abroad -- along with foreigners living in Korea to file petitions, report corruption as well as discuss and propose policies. Overseas Koreans are allowed to visit Korean.net -- operated by the Overseas Koreans Foundation -- and file petitions either in Korean or English. ACRC officials said that they had decided to start a petition service on the website because it is frequently accessed by Koreans living outside the country. The ACRC said it will gradually expand the services to provide them in 13 languages, just like the official e-People homepage. Translation for petitions submitted via e-People and the ACRC’s responses are carried out by commission under the OKF and done by a designated private firm. The ACRC funds this process.E-People currently offers services in Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Mongolian, Indonesian, Thai, Uzbek, Bengali, Cambodian and Sri Lanka’s official language, Sinhalese. The ACRC started to allow foreign-language submissions of petitions in 2008, as part of its project to support and protect Koreans living outside the country. “Petitions submitted via both websites will be dealt with in an identical process, which means we can expect that  will help address complaints of overseas Koreans,” said an ACRC official. Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief Sung Young-hoon Another part of the commission’s plan is to expand the foreign language services for the e-People website itself. Officials said that it plans to launch petition services in Russian and Burmese -- the official language of Myanmar -- on July 1. The launch will coincide with the three-month promotion period of the services from July to September, during which introductory leaflets will be distributed to 218 government organizations including foreign embassies in Korea and multicultural family support centers. The leaflet will contain information on how to file petitions in foreign languages. “We decided to focus our promotion in the autumn period, because that is generally when various events for foreigners and multicultural families are held here,” explained Kim Yeong-hee, an official in the e-People team of the ACRC.The ACRC has obtained a domestic patent for its “Global e-Petition System,” which receives petitions in different languages, processes them and notifies the petitioner of the results in his or her own language. Last year, 1,370 petitions were filed via e-People. Most of them were about overdue wages, unlawful layoffs and visa-related issues. Petitions from foreigners who work in the education sector also made up a considerable proportion, officials said.By Yoon Min-sik","expanding its online petition ,acrc expands online petition ,expands online petition service ,is expanding its online ,expands online petition","['South Korea ’s', 'Koreans', 'Civil Rights Commission', 'Korean.net']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1900164  -0.09916885

She did not specify which constituency she would be running in.“Some people laugh at the fact that an erotic actress should challenge politics, but I consider  a sign of interest in political issues,” she said in a radio interview.She has also frequently been noticed for her forthright comments on her private life. In 2009, Kim claimed that marijuana should be classified as a special medicinal herb and legalized for clinical uses.Another surprise candidate is 25-year-old Cho Eun-bi, who so far is the youngest preliminary candidate for the ruling Saenuri Party in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.“I cautiously yet ambitiously announce my bid in the race to realize a new world, as the party name 'Saenuri' stands for,” the aspiring politician said last week.""It is my dream to prove that any young person with a political vision may bring real changes to the world.”Cho had worked on the campaign of then-candidate Park Geun-hye during the 18th presidential election in 2012 and is currently serving as vice chairperson in the party’s future generation committee.Cho also attracted the public's attention with her selfies and revealing photographs going viral on the Internet.Meanwhile, former Saenuri lawmaker Kang Yong-seok had recently announced his bid as a Saenuri Party candidate in Seoul’s Yongsan district but was rejected by the party leadership. Kang Yong-seok “A person who aroused social criticism is not fit to resume party membership,” the party’s vice floor leader Rep. Cho Won-jin told reporters on Monday.Kang was expelled from the party in 2010 after making sexual remarks about female news announcers. His infamy went to extremes last year when he was involved in an alleged extramarital relationship with a famous blogger.Less controversial aspirants include a 51-year-old shoeshine man and former boxer named Park Il-deung, who is preparing to run in the April race in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. Park, whose name means “top” of ""first class"" in Korean, had entered for candidacy in the parliamentary elections in 2012 and the local elections in 2010 and 2014.“If I am elected, I will make a tour around my constituency and shine people’s shoes while listening to their petitions,” he said.Physically challenged candidates, such as infantile paralysis patient Kang Byeong-ryeong and visually impaired Lee Kyung-hye, are also aspiring for the Saenuri Party’s proportional representative positions.By Bae Hyun-jung tellme@heraldcorp.com)","fatigue over such political ,run in april elections ,feuds while still failing ,the public fatigue over ,reflecting the public fatigue",['National Assembly'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58722925  0.01601373

Kim Moo-sung once again talked his way into trouble last week, with his latest comment that South Korea’s low fertility should be tackled by bringing in more Chinese immigrants of Korean descent.It was not the first time an off-the-cuff remark by Kim to put him at the center of political controversy, as he faces the daunting task of overcoming an escalating factional standoff over the party’s nomination rules for the April elections.“Korea, which has an ethnic Korean  China, needs to accept their massive immigration. This is the best solution to reduce the chances of culture shock ,” said Kim, during a party meeting to discuss measures to fight the low fertility rate.His comment drew an intense backlash from the general public and opposition lawmakers. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s female lawmakers said in a statement Sunday that the remark was a “national disgrace” and derogatory toward women and ethnic minorities. They derided the remark as an ill-considered plan that treats ethnic minoritiy women as responsible for giving birth to Koreans, while failing to address the fundamental cause of the problem of young couple’s reluctance to have children. Kim Moo-sung Last year, Kim drew public outcry for comparing a visiting African student’s skin color to that of coal briquettes. Kim said that the comment was not intended to hurt the student's feelings. More recently, Kim has been caught up in a political firestorm over his comment about the party’s power structure. He noted that the party’s important decisions -- such as how to nominate candidates for the elections and whether to endorse a contentious bill -- have been made by “the one with power.” “In previous years, the party members changed their positions toward the Assembly law after the ‘powerful one’ made the decision. That is why I am pushing for a bottom-up nomination process to prevent th e lawmakers ,” said Kim on Tuesday. Though he did not specify who “the one with power” was, his dissenters suspected that it was a tacit reference to President Park Geun-hye.His remark immediately followed strong criticism mostly from those loyal to President Park, such as Rep. Suh Chung-won, who had competed against Kim for the party’s leadership in 2014. "" I think Kim himself is the one with power and there are many people close to Kim who get their way in the party’s affairs,” Suh said. Despite his repeated verbal blunders, Kim has remained strong in the public polls. Realmeter's Jan. 25 polls showed placed Kim as the second favorite presidential hopeful at 18.1 percent, following the Minjoo Party's former chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in at 20.8 percent. “Kim often speaks in a nonchalant manner and it is Kim’s political style. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. The ‘powerful one’ remark seems to be calculated one and the comment about the immigration policy looks as if off-the-cuff,” said Youn Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy.“Since the political landscape is strongly divided across the party lines, most Korean politicians’ controversial remarks  have little impact among their staunch supporters. In that regard, Kim’ approval rating is not his own, but that of the Saenuri Party,” he said.

Lee Jong-kul, in a meeting with his Saenuri counterpart Won Yoo-chul, demanded that the ruling party consent to a series of unsettled bills, such as the revision bill on the minimum wage and the carbon industry support bill. He also demanded that the election law revision bill to redraw the nation’s constituency map be put to a floor vote, along with other bills.“We have decided to wrap up the electoral map issue and process the pending bills in a rational order, even at the risk of delaying the general meeting,” Lee said.The Saenuri floor leader refused the proposal but added that the Saenuri Party would accept the minimum wage bill and the carbon industry bill, if the Minjoo Party accepts the deadlocked North Korean human rights bill.“Both parties clearly agreed to vote on the corporate revitalization bill and the North Korean human rights bill and then move on to a leadership meeting to discuss the electoral map,” Won told reporters.“But for some reason,  is violating our earlier agreement.” The ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers sit in the general meeting room on Friday, waiting for opposition parties to show up. The parliamentary session fell through, amid partisan feuds over the passage of the revised electoral map. YonhapThe two parties were poised to attend the parliamentary general meeting at 2 p.m. to vote on the corporate revitalization bill to offer restructuring support to insolvent companies. They had also attempted to do the same for the human rights bill but failed to reach an agreement on a controversial clause which defines the purpose of the bill.Amid the bipartisan conflict, independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and his forthcoming People’s Party condemned both main parties, accusing them of playing power games and neglecting the people’s needs. But the centrist party also urged that parties pass the human rights bill, adding weight to the ruling camp’s stance.Signs of feuds showed up earlier in the afternoon when Reps. Kim Jung-hoon and Rhee Mok-hee, the policy committee chiefs of the Saenuri and Minjoo Party respectively, failed to reach a last-minute consensus on the North Korean human rights bill.It was the main opposition Minjoo camp’s demand to amend the second clause of the bill to place more focus on improving inter-Korean relations. The ruling conservative Saenuri camp, however, claimed that the bill should concentrate on human rights promotion and that peace clauses should be included in the inter-Korean exchange and cooperation law.“This clause is indeed the core of the North Korean human rights bill as it shows the underlying legislative view,” Rhee said, after the meeting turned sour.The corresponding bill, motioned by a Saenuri lawmaker in 2012, calls for efforts to raise the international society’s awareness of human rights abuses in the communist state and to ensure that humanitarian aid is not diverted to other uses. It is also considered a diplomatic tool to exert pressure on the North Korean regime not to misuse outside aid to support its military.While the ruling party pushed ahead with it, the opposition party has resisted, claiming that it may provoke the communist neighbor.By Bae Hyun-jung","parliament tensions peak over ,bills peaked on friday ,peak over contentious bills ,over contentious bills the ,over contentious bills","['Saenuri Party', 'north korean', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43623987 -0.08373605

A total of 19 lawmakers, including Kwon, from the Saenuri Party filed a petition with the Constitutional Court in January 2015, arguing that the clause goes against the Constitution and simple majority rule.""The Constitution stipulates the National Assembly can exercise its legislative power with a majority vote,"" said Sohn Kyo-myeong, a lawyer representing the lawmakers.The lawmakers further argued that contentious bills, including a set of economic bills meant to revitalize the economy, have failed to pass through the parliament and that the percentage of bill passage was lowered due to the clause.Only 5,566 out of 17,309 bills tabled at the parliament, or 32.2 percent, have been passed, compared to 44.8 percent in the 18th and 50.28 percent in the 17th, according to data released by the National Assembly earlier.Rival parties have asked the court to deliver the ruling before the current parliament wraps up in May.Separately, National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa tabled the revision to an act that would gradually ease the requirements for so-called ""fast-track legislation.""Chung presented the bipartisan revision plan with the signature of 15 lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties to the National Assembly.Under the revision, a speaker can introduce a bill for voting when a simple majority of lawmakers makes the demand.Chung said the current clause has paralyzed the parliament by preventing lawmakers from passing a set of important bills. ""I believe that  would begin discussing the revision out of respect, since it would be submitted by a parliamentary speaker by himself,"" Chung told reporters earlier in the day.Chung further expressed hope that the revision would end months of parliamentary deadlock.","ruling lawmakers argue parliamentary ,lawmakers argued the unconstitutionality ,lawmakers argue parliamentary ,percent of sitting lawmakers ,ruling lawmakers argue","['the Constitutional Court', 'the National Assembly Act']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4298251   0.21580759

She also promised to give 3.2 million won, or 20 percent of her monthly pay, to the fund each month.Park's donation has sparked a series of contributions.Park said the pubic donation was made possible in a short period of time as people share the view that young people should not waste their time due to a lack of opportunity.""The government will make efforts to ensure that new jobs can continue to be created,"" Park said in a meeting with about 100 young job seekers in central Seoul.She also met with a dozen young people who got jobs through the Youth Hope Foundation, a public foundation funded by public donations to help young people find jobs.The unemployment rate for those aged 15-29 reached a record 9.2 percent in 2015, up from 9 percent tallied a year earlier and the highest level since 1999, according to government data.","107 million in donations ,million in donations park ,won us 107 million ,130 bln won president ,130 billion won us","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'the "" Youth Hope Fund', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.26671064  0.24966908

In the past, elections have marred by corruption.The comments came two weeks after the government announced a set of anti-corruption measures to preemptively root out corruption.South Korea has been hit by a series of corruption scandals, including those in the state arms procurement agency, in recent years.Last year, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo quit his job over allegations that he received 30 million won  from a businessman when he was running for a parliamentary seat in 2013.South Korea climbed three notches in international corruption awareness to 43 out of 175 countries in 2014, according to a global anti-corruption watchdog.The Berlin-based Transparency International said that South Korea scored 55 out of 100 in its 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, with high scores meaning low corruption.Park also instructed officials to root out domestic violence and crimes against vulnerable people, citing a series of child abuse incidents.Earlier this month, police arrested a couple over the death of their seven-year-old son in 2012. The father, 34, is accused of cutting the body into parts and wrapping them in plastic bags before putting them in a refrigerator in his home.","tuesday renewed the government ,root out corruption president ,hye on tuesday renewed ,corruption ahead of parliamentary ,an annual policy report","['Park Geun - hye', 'the Justice Ministry', 'South Koreans']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20215641  0.39590767

Park may either join Chun’s new party once it is established or choose to establish his own party and then work on an inter-party integration, according to the official.Chun on Saturday held a close-door meeting with Park in Gwangju to confirm their much-anticipated solidarity.Chung, who had left town after losing in the by-election last April, also consented to the need of reuniting the voters’ divided support in Gwangju and Jeolla Provinces. He is largely speculated to announce, or at least allude to, his political comeback at a lecture he is to give on Monday at a women’s employment center in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province.The imminent solidarity of these former and incumbent Jeolla-based lawmakers will act as a variable to the two parties ― the Minjoo Party and People’s Party ― as both are struggling to pull up their faltering approval ratings in the strategically important Southwest.According to a national survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea from Tuesday to Thursday last week, the Minjoo Party received 32 percent support in the area, while the People’s Party stood at 26 percent.Although the Minjoo camp has slightly recovered since its party split, it still finds itself at the risk of losing its grip on a long-time favorable constituency cluster.The People’s Party, which has recently come under fire for recruitment failures, could use the support of Chun’s solidarity to win back its earlier initiative in the southwestern Jeolla provinces.

In an emergency meeting held late on Saturday, the senior members of the ruling Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party of Korea agreed to put the two bills to a vote in the parliamentary plenary session on Friday. The meeting was attended by the floor leader, vice floor leader and policy committee chief of both parties.“The plenary session will be held at 2 p.m. on Jan. 29 to vote on the corporate revitalization bill and the North Korean human rights bill,” Reps. Kim Yong-nam and Lee Un-ju, respectively floor spokesperson of the ruling and the main opposition party, said jointly.The revitalization bill, dubbed the “one-shot bill,” involves offering restructuring support to insolvent companies, allowing them an easier business reshuffling process.The opposition camp had been demanding that conglomerates be excluded from this benefit, citing possible abuse, but recently yielded on the claim in a compromising gesture.The North Korean human rights bill calls for efforts to raise the international society’s awareness on the abusive human rights situation in the communist state and to ensure that humanitarian aid is not diverted to other uses.It reflects the concerns that the North Korean regime has been misusing outside relief supplies for the sake of its military.The bill has been pending at the National Assembly since June 2012, with the ruling party advocating its necessity and the opposition party claiming that it may provoke North Korea.In exchange for the compromise that the opposition made on the one-shot bill, the ruling party agreed to include an inter-Korean peace promotion clause, as suggested by Minjoo Party.Whether or not the parties will pass these two bills is yet uncertain but the consensus to put them to a full vote was at least taken as a positive sign in the long-stalled partisan relationship.But aside from this partial achievement, parties still face hurdles when it comes to the rest of the pending bills.Representatives of the leading parties once again met on Sunday afternoon to seek for solutions on the terrorism prevention bill, labor reform bills and the election law revision bill to redraw the nation’s electoral map.The most controversial issue was the four labor-related bills, over which the government and labor circles conflicted further.While President Park Geun-hye advocated a national petition campaign to urge for the passage of the disputed bills, an umbrella labor union walked out of the trilateral talks with the government and management.Conflicts worsened as the Labor Ministry on Friday announced a set of administrative guidelines that allow companies to lay off underperforming employees and to change employment regulations without the employees’ consent.As for the constituency restructuring, parties had earlier agreed on a plan to allocate 253 seats to regional representatives and 47 to proportional ones, but are still at odds on whether or not to put the bill into the same basket as the economic and labor bills.By Bae Hyun-jung","rival parties agreed saturday ,ending months long dispute ,floor vote this week ,vote this week ending ,had crippled the legislative",['north korean'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5075556   0.22503334

But as the situation continues where the meeting itself cannot take place or, even if it does, it would not contribute to the denuclearization of North Korea, there will inevitably be a debate about its effectiveness.” President Park Geun-hye talks during a policy briefing at Cheong Wa Dae on Friday. The six-way gathering has been dormant since late 2008, as Seoul and Washington urge Pyongyang’s sincerity and gestures to ensure progress on its disarmament as precursory steps, whereas Beijing and Russia called for a swift, unconditional restart of dialogue. The North, for its part, has been demanding acknowledgement as a nuclear weapons state and arms reduction talks, which have been flatly dismissed by the U.S. South Korea has since late 2014 pushed for what it calls the “Korean formula” to restart denuclearization dialogue with the North or among the other five parties. The content and method of the “Korean formula” has remained largely undisclosed, and it has so far failed to bring about any multiparty meeting. The U.S. has deemed the proposal as unfeasible, dismissing it at an early phase, according to Seoul diplomats with the close knowledge of the process. During the meeting, Park also stressed the significance of China’s role in altering Pyongyang’s course, given Beijing’s veto power in the U.N. Security Council, chairmanship of the six-party forum and formidable clout over its intractable neighbor.“What’s crucial after all is to create the situation under which North Korea has no option but to change itself, in which China’s cooperation is vital,” she said.“China has so far displayed many times its strong resolve to never accept the existence of nuclear weapons on the peninsula. Now I hope it will take effective steps so that North Korea will realize its nuclear program will be of no use and come out to the international community alongside Iran.”By Shin Hyon-hee","talks to disarm president ,new year policy briefing ,negotiations during an annual ,president park geun hye ,geun hye on friday","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'Seoul']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01786648  0.58232343

The ministry cited a violation of a labor law clause that bans dismissed education workers from joining trade unions.According to the Education Ministry, this is to ensure that teachers remain politically neutral.Citing the labor law clause, the appellate court said that the ministry’s move against the KTU was a lawful administrative procedure. “Prior to the ministry’s notification, the KTU had decided to reject the government’s request for it to not accept dismissed workers via a member vote, which clearly shows that the KTU is not recognized as a trade union by the labor law,” the court said in its ruling, upholding a decision by the lower court on June 2014. “On the plaintiff’s appeal that the labor law clause is unconstitutional, the Constitutional Court has already ruled that it does not infringe upon the basic rights. ... Therefore, the court declines the plaintiff’s claim,” The lower court said that given the characteristics of education workers, the legislators are entitled to enforce stricter rules on them. KTU leader Byeon Seong-ho denounced the ruling and said that it showed that Korean Democracy had “taken a step back,” adding that the decision “falls short of international standards.” He said that the KTU will appeal the case to the Supreme Court. Song Jae-hyuk, the group’s spokesman, said as the court had already imposed fines for accepting dismissed teachers as members, Thursday’s decision was “redundant and excessive.” The Supreme Court last Thursday levied a fine of 1 million won fine  on both the KTU and Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the Justice Party -- the former leader of the group.“International standards and common sense both say that the KTU should be granted legal status,” said Song. International Trade Union Confederation and Education International had requested a permanent injunction against the Labor Ministry’s decision to delist the KTU. Without its legal status, the KTU lacks the right to have full-time workers, collect membership fees, receive government support and negotiate on behalf of its members with other parties.  The office of Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union in Seoul. YonhapThe Education Ministry said that it would immediately conduct follow-up measures, including withdrawal of all its benefits.Song said the group will contemplate future plans based on the government’s reaction to Thursday’s ruling, but said a legal challenge would no longer be its main method of operation. “After consulting with legal representatives at the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, we have found that we can still negotiate on behalf of our members. It just lacks legal binding power. But several education offices have said that they will accept the KTU as partners,” he said.

Cho Kyoung-tae, a third-term lawmaker representing Saha-gu in Busan, was once portrayed as a pioneer in condemning localism in politics, as he survived three consecutive elections in the traditionally conservative constituency.But after 12 years as an opposition representative, Cho decided to defect to the ruling party ahead of the upcoming general election, arousing derision and accusations that he had betrayed his political beliefs for the sake of reelection.“I hope that my fresh start acts as a positive stimulant to both ruling and opposition parties,” he told reporters Thursday, after submitting his application to join the Saenuri Party.Kim Moo-sung, Saenuri’s party chief and a fifth-termer in Busan, welcomed Cho’s arrival with open arms.Rep. Cho Kyoung-tae is greeted by Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung at the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. Yonhap“Rep. Cho’s thoughts have always been largely in tune with that of our party,” Kim said, introducing the former opposition member to the party’s supreme council meeting.The lawmaker defected from The Minjoo Party of Korea on Tuesday, claiming that the opposition camp was trapped in a hegemonic frame, refusing to communicate with others.The Minjoo Party took his departure with composure, as the lawmaker had long been at odds with party chief Moon Jae-in and had recently been displaying friendly gestures toward the ruling party and the Park Geun-hye administration.“We are not at all affected  as he made no contribution whatever as a party member,” said the Minjoo Party’s Busan office through a statement.The party headquarters also remained unfazed by Cho’s change of affiliation and focused more on welcoming influential new figures such as Dumun Political Strategy Institute director Lee Cheol-hee.Despite the apparent indifference, however, the opposition party is facing the risk of losing Busan altogether to the ruling camp in the upcoming parliamentary elections.With Cho off the list, the only remaining Minjoo lawmaker in Busan is party chief Moon, who had earlier pledged not to run.The southeastern city, in addition to being the nation’s second-largest, is an area over which the opposition party has been striving to loosen the conservative party’s grip.It also happens to be the hometown of all three of the top potential presidential candidates -- Saenuri chief Kim, Minjoo Party chief Moon, and head of the forthcoming People’s Party Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo.The presence of opposition member Cho in this conservative-dominated city had not only acted as a Maginot Line against the ruling party’s expanding clout, but also symbolized the opposition party’s challenge against incumbent powers.Rep. Cho, on the other hand, is likely to have his political integrity called into question after changing sides.“I entered politics to fulfill the late President Roh Moo-hyun’s dream to eradicate localism,” Cho had said back in 2012, at the party’s primary race for presidential candidacy.The former policy adviser to the late president had also repeatedly criticized President Park Geun-hye for a lack of communication, at least before his recent change of heart.“What good will it be for the party to bring somebody, lawmaker or not, who will not even be missed by his own former party,” said Seok Dong-hyun, Saenuri‘s preliminary candidate in Busan’s Saha-B constituency, which Cho currently represents.By Bae Hyun-jung","tae third term lawmaker ,lawmaker under fire over ,survived three consecutive elections ,third term lawmaker representing ,three consecutive elections","['Cho Kyoung - tae', 'Busan', 'Cho']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12179048  0.24262305

Samsung Group became the first private business to join the campaign, with other big conglomerates, such as Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Group, reportedly mulling whether to follow suit, industry sources said Wednesday. A booth was opened at Samsung’s Seocho office for executives to sign. Samsung Electronics‘ network business president Kim Young-ky  and Samsung’s visual display division head Kim Hyun-seok sign a petition calling for prompt legislation of economic bills at the company building in Seocho, southern Seoul, Wednesday. YonhapPark on Monday signed the petition initiated by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry to urge the lawmakers to pass contentious labor bills on Monday. Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday said it was Park’s decision to join the movement. According to the KCCI, some 40,000 citizens had signed on as of Tuesday.Park’s signing effectively raised public awareness as well as criticism from opposition camps, which have claimed the president  abused her power in favor of the interests of businesses, while shunning the use of presidential authority to reach a consensus with a legislative body. The government had been at loggerheads with the labor unions and the opposition over its economic measures including labor reform plans. The government contends the easing of labor regulations would boost the sluggish economy and add jobs for young workers. But the labor unions and opposition parties view them as expanding temporary jobs and making it easier for employers to dismiss workers.“I can’t help but think of state-led demonstrations during the Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee administrations,” said main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, referring to their mobilization of their supporters to promote their policies and suppress opposition movement. An opposition lawmaker accused the president of violating the democratic rule of separation of powers by infringing upon the legislative body’s authority. Rep. Han Jeoung-ae of the Minjoo Party called her move “extremely worrisome” on such concerns.Some experts noted that Park’s decision to join the petition may not be ideal, but could have been one of few options she saw open to her.“It is fair to say the National Assembly is not doing its job. But it does not look good for the president to take to the street, either. Instead of directly appealing to the people, she should have communicated first with lawmakers,” said Choi Jin, chairman of the Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Though it is hard to say that she violated the rule of separation of powers, she should have done better. She should have approached the lawmakers and persuaded them first before going down the street and appealing to the people,” said politics professor Yoon Sung-yi of Kyung Hee University.Other pundits cited the petition case as an example that can question Park’s leadership. Yoon Pyeong-joong, political philosophy professor of Hanshin University, noted that the president does not appear to fulfill her obligation as a leader who should communicate with opposing groups. “Admittedly, it is a minor incident. But I think it reflects that the president’s unwillingness to perform her duty. Given the fact that she had never held a one-on-one session with an opposition leader, the petition could serve as yet another example that she does not take her job seriously,” Yoon said.By Yeo Jun-suk","economic bills korean conglomerates ,nationwide business movement samsung ,debate roiling over president ,business movement samsung group ,business movement samsung","['Park Geun', 'korean', 'Samsung Group', 'Hyundai Motor Co.', 'LG Group']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.45662215 -0.01901019

Park Yu-ha, a professor at Sejong University, was brought to the court after prosecutors indicted her in November on charges of defaming former “comfort women” -- the euphemistic term for Korean women coerced into sex slavery for the Japanese military during World War II -- with her book “Comfort Women of the Empire.” An estimated crowd of 70 including two former comfort women, their advocacy group the House of Sharing, and a few Japanese attended the first hearing held at the Seoul Dongbu District Court.  Park Yu-ha “The accused included false information in her book, describing the victims as prostitutes who voluntarily went to Japan, had ‘comrade-like’ relations with the Japanese military and were patriotic to Japan as a member of the Japanese Empire,” the prosecutors said. “These severely defamed the victims.” In her book published in 2013, Park argued that the victims volunteered to serve as prostitutes for the Japanese military out of patriotism and some had romantic relationships with Japanese soldiers. She also noted that Korean collaborators, as well as private Japanese recruiters, were mainly responsible for luring Korean women into the military brothels in Japan. She added that there is no evidence of the Japanese government’s involvement in recruiting the sex slaves and running the brothels.In response to the prosecution’s accusations, Park’s lawyer said that she had no intention to defame the victims through the book and the work was only to promote the public good based on truth. “The book used the term ‘the comfort women of the empire’ to describe a group of comfort women as a whole, not to specify individuals,” the lawyer said. “So it is not defamation against individuals.”Park asked the court to proceed the trial under a jury system, saying she could no longer trust the nation’s judiciary. Last week, the civil court ordered her to pay 10 million won to each of nine women, who had filed a suit against Park in 2014, in financial compensation for defamation. Under the jury system, residents aged 20 or older living in the jurisdiction are randomly chosen to serve as jury. But their verdict is not legally binding and can be overruled by judges. The court is set to decide whether to refer the case to the jury system after reviewing their evidence. “I am not sure whether the court had serious interest, sense of justice and duty. I cannot accept the previous verdicts ,” Park told a slew of reporters at the scene as she left the courtroom. “I wrote the book to contribute to clarifying the  issue that has remained unsolved for the past 60 years.”She said various voices on the issue have been dismissed, as advocacy groups for the comfort women have dominated the agenda and imposed what she called a one-sided theory. She cited her interviews with some surviving victims who she claimed agreed to the content in her book. “The women are now being held hostage by interest groups,” Park said, targeting the victims’ rights groups that have refused Japan’s apology and humanitarian aid. She plans to disseminate the content of her book free of charge online to open a public debate on the comfort women issue. The victims, however, lashed out at Park’s claims, accusing her of colluding with Japan to “distort” history.“The woman said she could receive 2 billion won from high-ranking Japanese officials if we did not file a complaint,” Yoo Hee-nam, a former comfort woman, told the reporters. “Her books should be removed and she should apologize. She has no right to live on Korean soil.”Another victim Lee Ok-seon said, “Why do you think we came to the court today in this cold when we cannot even walk properly? ... We should win against Japan and restore our honor.”The next hearing is scheduled for Jan. 29.By Ock Hyun-ju","after prosecutors indicted her ,court after prosecutors indicted ,wednesday to face criminal ,after prosecutors indicted ,week after seoul court","['Seoul', 'Park Yu - ha', 'Sejong University', 'korean']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21916632  0.28855884

Five education chiefs are at loggerheads with the Education Ministry over the funding of the Nuri program, which subsidizes child care costs for children aged 3-5.Gyeonggi Province, Gangwon Province, North Jeolla Province, Seoul and Gwangju have refused to allocate a budget for the day care centers, saying that the law states they are only mandated to fund “educational institutes.” Children attend a kindergarten in Seoul City. YonhapThe standoff has resulted in some local governments, including Seoul and Gyeonggi, cutting the entire Nuri program from their budgets. While the payday for kindergarten teachers is customarily around the 20th of each month, neither side has succumbed. The fight between the central and provincial governments has even led to a blame game among municipalities.Lee Jae-jung, the education superintendent of Gyeonggi Province, held a press conference to denounce Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil’s announcement that the provisional government will fund a few months’ costs of operating the day care centers under the program.“ measure will only complicate the matter, and aggravate the crisis of regional education finances,” Lee said. He added that the irresponsibility of President Park Geun-hye -- who vowed to expand the Nuri program from 5-year-olds to ages 3-5 -- is causing trouble for the education sector as a whole.The National Assembly was also embroiled in the dispute, with the ruling Saenuri Party blaming the education superintendents and The Minjoo Party of Korea holding the administration responsible. Education Minister Lee Joon-sik is scheduled to meet the education chiefs on Thursday, seeking a breakthrough. Their earlier meeting Monday had fallen through. The chances of a grand compromise remains bleak as the ministry also remains unchanged from its initial position.“I don’t think there will be a huge change in our stance. It  is not something that the ministry has to make a deal with the education offices for. We’ve already checked their budgets and concluded they have sufficient funding,” a ministry official said. But education offices countered by saying that 17 offices across the country hold accumulated debt of 7.89 trillion won , which is more than one-third of their total budget. With both sides blaming each other, the Korea Kindergarten Association sent a notice to parents saying they would start charging for operating fees. Members of an association of child care centers in Incheon City carry baby dolls as part of a demonstration to call for prompt execution of the Nuri budget by Incheon City and Incheon Metropolitan City Office of Education at Incheon City Hall on Wednesday. Yonhap“We are waiting to see how the situation turns out for now, but we have no choice but to place the burden on the teachers if nothing happens,” said Lee Myung-hee, the head of KKA’s Seoul division, adding that the kindergartens have postponed the pay date to Jan. 31.She accused the politicians of worsening the situation, for which children and their parents are paying the price.By Yoon Min-sik","payday for kindergarten teachers ,authorities play chicken over ,chicken over child care ,education authorities over financing ,down five education chiefs","['Nuri', 'the Education Ministry', 'Nuri']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15877903  0.19862422

More controversial issues, such as extending the employment period of temporary workers or expanding dispatched labor, were held off for further discussion.Based on the deal, which was the first of its kind in 17 years, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party motioned five relevant revision bills -- the labor standards act, the industrial accident compensation insurance act, the employment insurance act, the dispatched work act and the short-term worker protection act. Personnel Management Minister Lee Geun-myeon  and Vice Labor Minister Koh Young-sun converse while attending a briefing session at Cheong Wa Dae on Wednesday. YonhapThe presidential office withheld the most highly disputed short-term employment bill upon vehement opposition. But even the remaining four bills showed little promise of passing parliament due to the main opposition party’s persistent objection.The union’s backlash was mostly against the government’s draft administrative guidelines to allow companies to discharge underperforming employees and modify its employment regulations without the workers’ consent.Union officials had claimed that it was against good faith and violation of the trilateral deal for the government to force ahead with regulations, especially as the related laws have not yet been legislated. The government, on the other hand, blamed the union for repeatedly refusing open discussions and claimed that the leadership was held down by hard-liners.Park, while not directly referring to the FKTU’s boycott, said the government would nevertheless push ahead with its labor reform plans.As part of such efforts, Park on Monday participated in a petition campaign to collect 10 million signatures from people to demand the National Assembly to pass the pending labor and economy-related bills.Reforming the labor market is part of Park’s “top four reforms” plan, which involves reforming the labor, education, public and financial sectors.By Bae Hyun-jung","labor reforms president park ,geun hye on wednesday ,park vows to push ,reforms president park geun ,with labor reforms president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24224554  0.26135606

However, the bills have not yet been put to a full floor vote due to strong dissent from the opposition party on concerns about giving more authority to the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's top spy agency.""There have been needless battles at the National Assembly for the past 15 years,"" said Kim Soo-min, a senior NIS official who participated in the government-ruling party meeting. ""The anti-terrorism bills are designed to protect the lives of the people and should not be the subject of a bargaining tool."" The NIS told lawmakers that seven foreign nationals who previously worked in South Korea have since joined the Islamic State, according to Rep.

Chun Jung-bae and Park Joo-sun, who also left the party last year to create their own political group.However, there still remains an obstacle to possible reconciliation between the Minjoo Party and Ahn's new party slated to be launched in March.Last week, Moon named Kim Chong-in, an architect behind President Park Geun-hye's ""economic democracy"" pledge, to head the party's election campaign committee.Moon said that the committee will be given full authority to nominate candidates and that he will give up his entire right during the nomination process.Last week, Han Sanng-jin, a co-chairman of a preparatory committee for Ahn's new party, publicly denounced Kim for being an active member of a committee under then Lt. Gen. Chun Doo-hwan in 1980.Han's remarks were made as a criticism that Kim is a conservative figure who worked for Chun, who seized power in a military coup in 1979.On Monday, Ahn also denounced Moon's decision to recruit Kim, saying that he is ""trying to win the election without principles.""","looming power struggle ,two dozen lawmakers moon ,amid an internal feud ,he will resign ,news focus power struggle","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'moon']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53572148  0.40557134

Presiding over a Cabinet meeting, she instructed her top foreign and security policy aides to make utmost efforts to convince the U.N. Security Council to draw powerful sanctions.“If strong and substantive steps are not taken again this time, the international community would send the wrong signal to North Korea that should it carry out a fifth or sixth nuclear test,  can’t do anything about it,” Park said. “We should make diplomatic efforts, closely cooperating with the U.S. and other partners primarily, so that the U.N. Security Council will come up with strong and comprehensive sanctions.” Her reiteration of stricter penalties against Pyongyang, following her New Year’s news conference last week, came as the UNSC is working on a draft resolution in response to the communist state’s fourth underground explosion on Jan. 6. South Korea, the U.S. and Japan have agreed to push for a strong and comprehensive response to North Korea‘s nuclear test, though it remains unclear whether China will join in tightening the screw on North Korea.The roles of Beijing and Russia are crucial in particular, given their veto power at the council and decades-old diplomatic and economic patronage of Pyongyang that has long been deemed crucial for the Kim dynasty’s survival. “We must make sure North Korea clearly recognizes what consequences its wrong behavior will bring,” Park said.As part of the allies’ efforts to spur the diplomacy, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken arrived here earlier in the day to coordinate a stance with Seoul before traveling to Beijing later in the week. Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea’s special representative for Korean Peninsula affairs at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry and chief nuclear negotiator, also held talks with his Russian counterpart in Moscow. While displaying concerns about Pyongyang’s nuclear program, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged “restraint” and dialogue during his phone conversation with his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se last week, and Russian Ambassador to the U.N.

The suit was filed against Johannes Thammer, managing director of Audi Volkswagen Korea, after the world’s largest automaker failed to satisfy the nation's legal requirements in its recall plan, the ministry said. Thammer was accused of violating the Clean Air Conservation Act, which can carry a prison term of up to five years and a penalty of up to 30 million won .Volkswagen Korea CEO Johannes Thammer attends a parliamentary audit at the National Assembly in October 2015. YonhapThe decision came after the ministry determined that the recall plan submitted by VW Korea was missing such key elements as the cause of defects and the plan to improve them as required by law. The company was ordered to submit a detailed recall plan including how to improve emissions results and maintain fuel efficiency after removing the emissions-cheating software by Jan. 6. After conducting its own emissions tests for two months, the ministry found that VW models had used “defeat-device” software to bypass emissions tests. It ordered the carmaker to recall about 125,000 vehicles and fined it 14.1 billion won  in November. A spokesperson from the company did not offer its official stance on the suit, saying that it had only learned about the ministry’s plan to file a complaint through local media in the morning. It is the first time for the government to file a suit against the German company, though a local civic group sued Thammer and Thomas Kuehl, the VW Korea chief, on the same charges last November. Earlier in the day, six key Volkswagen company officials including Thammer and Friedrich Eichler, VW’s powertrain development chief, visited the ministry to offer an explanation about the technical solutions to the defects.""Audi Volkswagen Korea is putting utmost efforts to resolve the emissions issue,"" the company said in a statement. ""The executives from the German headquarters visited the Environment Ministry to implement the recall plan rapidly and systematically in the Korean market.” Regarding the visit, the ministry said it was irrelevant with the criminal suit and that it was to exchange opinions on how to carry out the recall plan. The ministry is considering filing an additional complaint against the company on charges of discharging excessive level of hazardous gases into the air and using unauthorized car parts after consulting legal experts here.The Transportation Ministry, meanwhile, said it plans to launch fuel efficiency tests on VW vehicles involved in the emissions-cheating scandal next week.Last week, the California Air Resources Board also disapproved VW’s recall plan for the U.S. market, citing insufficient information on fuel efficiency, emissions and safety.

Rhee Mok-hee.“We hope that such a bewildering situation will not happen again during Park’s remaining two years in office.”The ruling Saenuri Party reiterated the president’s comments.“The petition would never have been necessary, had the National Assembly performed its role in the first place,” floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul told reporters Tuesday.“Our party, too, is to be held responsible just as much as the opposition party.”The presidential office shrugged off the opposition camp’s blame.“Signing the petition was a gesture of participating in the people’s initiative, not an act of disregard towards the legislature,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk told reporters.Meanwhile, the government, the presidential house and the ruling party agreed Tuesday to go to all efforts to pass the pending labor bills through parliament within January.“The opposition camp is deterring key economic bills and labor reform by adding unessential requests,” said Saenuri floor leader Won at the policy adjustment meeting held at the prime minister’s office.By Bae Hyun-jung","labor reform bills president ,reform bills president park ,on tuesday to participate ,reform bills president ,pending labor reform bills","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.06892471  0.3054862

The law that was announced on Dec. 1 will go into effect on June 2, with the latest details related to fines being part of the larger package to deal with emissions violations.South Korea has taken flak for not having proper rules in place to deal with emissions cheating, like the United States.       Local authorities, meanwhile, have said they are looking at ways forwarded by Volkswagen to correct cheating software, although the process may take time.Similar measures suggested by the German carmaker in the United States have been rejected, that is expected to put pressure on local regulators to carefully check the solutions being offered and to make certain they can comply with air protection standards.","cars will be fined ,volkswagen cheating scandal ,cars for emissions violations ,volkswagen cheating scandal the ,by volkswagen cheating scandal","['South Korea', 'Volkswagen']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.37007937  0.28078297

Ahn Cheol-soo’s People’s Party, said the nation should highlight the positive aspects of its first president, who ruled from 1948-1960, and recognize Rhee as a historic figure who founded the country and eventually led it to democracy. “Most countries give the title of founding father to the one who built the nation. We should try to give a positive assessment to him and use it as an opportunity to unite the people going forward,” Han told reporters on Thursday during his visit to the April 19 National Cemetery. Han Sang-jin, cochair of the People’s Party’s preparatory committee, delivers a statement on his controversial remarks regarding former President Syngman Rhee during a party meeting in Seoul on Sunday. YonhapThough Han noted the late president had “his own limits,” referring to the March 15 rigged election during his presidency and the crackdown on the April 19 uprising, the professor-turned-politician asserted that Rhee had laid the groundwork for South Korea’s democracy. Han’s remark came as his party has made outreach efforts to right-wing voters. While liberals have focused on Rhee’s limits to highlight his dictatorship, the conservatives have dismissed it as an ideological bias overshadowing Rhee’s achievements to Korea’s liberation from the 1910-1945 colonial rule of Japan. Kim Jong-in, senior member of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, dismissed Rhee as an “unfortunate” president who had lost his chance at becoming the founding father by pushing through the rigged March 15 election and being forced to step down after the April 19 uprising. “In order for us to recognize Rhee as a founding father, he should have ended his term a better way,” said Kim. “If Rhee hadn’t changed the Constitution to extend his tenure, then he definitely would have become our founding father. But instead, he violated democratic values.” he said.Rep. Jung Cheong-rae of the Minjoo Party blasted Han for sympathizing with the right wing’s history revisionist rhetoric, comparing his remark to President Park Geun-hye’s attempt to ""revise"" South Korea’s contemporary history by adopting state-authored history textbooks. The progressives have been accusing the ruling camp for attempting to “rewrite” history by removing much of Korea’s independence movement and hence the history of pro-Japanese forces. The conservative administration, in turn, has said the portion of contemporary history will be downsized overall.Former President Syngman RheeChung also claimed that Han’s argument would help the revisionist idea that South Korea was established in 1948 when Rhee took power, not in 1919 when its provisional government was formed. Liberals have criticized it as a ploy to cover up the conservative’s pro-Japanese record. Observers noted that the debate over the late president stems from the new opposition party’s need to set themselves apart from the Minjoo Party. The People Party’s founder Ahn had derided the Minjoo Party as “anachronistic progressives,” who have lost touch with reform-minded voters. “Since it was the politicians, not historians, who started off the debate over Rhee, the debate inevitably takes on political overtones. It is the People’s Party’s attempt to demonstrate its political identity to the voters before the April general elections,” said Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“The People’s Party wants to embrace both liberals and conservatives. They want to stay away from the ideology coming from the old-school student movement. The remark should be understood in that respect,” said Lee.  By Yeo Jun-suk","debate over first president ,rekindled decades old debate ,the late president syngman ,president rhee reignites senior ,late president syngman rhee","['Syngman Rhee', 'Han Sang - jin', 'Ahn Cheol', 'People ’s Party']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28553972  0.39952865

At that time, Park vowed to become a president for small and medium enterprises and to shift the economy from one that relies heavily on the exports of large conglomerates to one in which both big and small firms coexist.For decades, South Korea's exports have been led by conglomerates, though smaller companies account for 99 percent of all enterprises and 88 percent of all employees in the country.","collecting campaign over bills ,over bills delay president ,campaign over bills delay ,bills delay president park ,campaign calling for parliamentary","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10939935 -0.244123

Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Tuesday announced the launch of a state-led anticorruption drive, pledging to preemptively cut out factors that may lead to corruption in government-funded projects and organizations.The four segments of the plan to root out corruption are: real-time monitoring of massively large-scale projects such as defense acquisition programs; risk-management of large government funds; active information sharing related to the projects; and enhancing internal audits of related organizations.  “Anticorruption measures of the past were based mostly on clamping down and punishment of crimes, which makes it impossible to prevent the damage occurring from such acts. ... By taking appropriate measures beforehand, we will be able to prevent the waste of state budgets,” said Hwang during a briefing at the Seoul Government Complex.Government programs in 16 sectors worth a total of 240 trillion won  will be subject to the Prime Minister’s Office-led anticorruption drive.Projects that will be monitored in real time include: 5.3 trillion won in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics; 5.9 trillion won in the creation of a science business belt in Daejeon; and a social overhead capital project worth about 12.7 trillion won. Social overhead capital refers to basic public services such as transportation and electricity that allow for the functioning of productive activities. Despite Hwang touting the plan as a drive to root out corruption, its effectiveness remains to be seen as the monitoring process will mostly be conducted by government officials instead of outsiders.According to the PMO, the Office for Government Policy Coordination‘s state-project management team will oversee the monitoring, while separate teams will be launched to supervise massively large-scale projects such as the PyeongChang Winter Games preparation. But such teams will be comprised of government officials from related ministries.Whether insiders will be able to objectively monitor wrongdoings remains to be seen, as the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission of Korea’s annual integrity scale on government bodies in December divulged a mismatch between the corruption level evaluated by insiders and those outside the organizations.The Office for Government Policy Coordination for example, received an integrity score of 8.26 by its officials, but garnered 7.73 from outsiders.The monitoring system will also be applied to defense acquisition programs “to prevent budget leaks and increase military capacity,” officials said. The government is currently mulling whether to appoint a senior prosecutor as a defense project supervisor -- a director-level post under the Defense Acquisition Program Administration chief -- to rein in corruption.Last year, prosecutors indicted 63 former and incumbent military personnel in its probe into arms deals, including former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Choi Yoon-hee, former Navy chief Chung Ok-geun and former Patriots and Veterans Affairs Minister Kim Yang.Hwang added that the government will enhance the risk management team’s capacity. The team will be headed by a director-level official, and will expand participation of outside experts. Boosting asset management capability is mainly aimed at aiding the country’s postal service, which manages some 105 trillion won. It handles the second most state funds after the National Pension Service, which manages over 400 trillion won. The PMO added that sharing information related to government subsidies will prevent people from unlawfully receiving state benefits, such as unemployment compensation. Officials said that successful implementation of the project is expected to save about 5 trillion won in government budgets. By Yoon Min-sik","government complex on tuesday ,tuesday yonhap prime minister ,tuesday announced the launch ,complex on tuesday yonhap ,speaks during press conference","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29346377  0.42551106

The one-story 11,075-square-meter building with four basement floors will consist of a public underground parking lot, an exhibition hall and a park on the ground floor. The new plan aims at expanding parking spaces while providing green spaces for the community residents, it added.   An image of the envisioned park commemorating former President Park Chung-hee The park scheme, initially pushed by the district three years ago, was accused of being an attempt by Jung-gu Mayor Choi Chang-sik to show his “loyalty” to the president.  The district had also sought to share the financial burden of about 30 billion won  with the central government and the city government. The project was suspended as the Seoul Metropolitan Government refused to shoulder the financial burden, citing that the district did not negotiate the project in advance. Cheong Wa Dae had then also stated that it was not desirable to build a park with taxpayers’ money amid the sluggish economy. This time, Jung-gu Office said it would fully shoulder the construction expenses, with 10 billion won already allocated to the project for this year. The park will open in 2018, it added.District councilors of the main opposition expressed objection to the project, claiming that the park plan is a budget waste. “Although  agree with expanding parking spaces in the district, tearing down old buildings and establishing a park with tens of billions of won without any financial support from the central and city government is a waste of the budget,” said city councilor Byun Chang-yoon of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. The district may also face hurdles from business owners over the compensation issue. The office said negotiations with business owners are underway.

Moon Jeong-lim, another spokesperson, criticized the opposition party for playing partisan games and neglecting its lawmaking duties.As a revision bill of the advancement act also requires three-fifths parliamentary consent for passage, the ruling party expects parliamentary speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa to exercise his authority and introduce the bill at a general meeting floor.“ asserted in the past that the advancement bill needs some revision,” said party leader Kim Moo-sung, pushing the speaker to make a legislative exception for this case.Rep. Chung, known for his legislative principles and political impartiality, agreed that the current process needs to be relaxed to a certain extent, but still refused to push ahead with the change on his own accord.“ is something that the current National Assembly should achieve within its term,” he said.“But I believe that the use of the speaker’s power should be kept to the minimum at all times.”The much disputed parliamentary act was introduced back in 2012 as an effort to eradicate violent protests by lawmakers at the National Assembly and to reinforce the legislative process.The law stated that a three-fifths quorum is necessary to pass a bill and also limited the parliamentary speaker’s rights to lay a bill on his or her own authority.As a result, even the ruling party has been unable to push ahead with a bill unless it secured a sweeping majority of 180 seats or more in the 300-seat Assembly.But a major challenge for the ruling bloc is that this parliamentary procedural act, which it is striving to relax by any means, is considered a major legislative legacy of President Park Geun-hye.The Grand National Party, the former body of the Saenuri Party, found itself in a fix in 2011-2012 after years of forcing the passage of bills and violence in the house. By spearheading the parliamentary advancement act, then-emergency council chief Park won herself extra credits as a potential state leader.It is also for this reason that the opposition camp is hammering the ruling party for being self-contradictory.“It was the ruling party that motioned the  bill in the first place,” said Rep. Park Soo-hyun, floor spokesperson of the Minjoo Party.By Bae Hyun-jung","deadlocked bills kindle disputes ,key disputed bills triggered ,disputed bills triggered new ,kindle disputes on parliamentary ,of key disputed bills",['Saenuri Party'],10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52602327 -0.15179223

Park Ki-choon, formerly of the Minjoo Party of Korea, for receiving some 270 million won  from the head of a distribution agency, only known by his surname Kim, in return for business favors. The court also ordered Park to forfeit 278 million won. Prosecutors alleged that Park's key roles during the 18th and the current 19th National Assembly on the parliamentary Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs Committee, where legislation on the construction industry is dealt with, put him in a favorable position to help Kim.The court also convicted Park of making one of his aides hide a massage chair he received, and delivered a six-month jail term but suspended it for two years. The 60-year-old lawmaker was indicted in August 2015 on charges of receiving more than 350 million won and valuables such as luxury watches from Kim. Still, the court said the chair and watches, some of which cost more than 30 million won, cannot be seen as illegal political funds.Park claimed that part of the money, the chair and the watches were given based on a personal relationship and were not political funds.Park was detained after a district court issued an arrest warrant with the consent of the National Assembly in August 2015.His arrest was subject to parliamentary consent as lawmakers in South Korea are immune from detention while the National Assembly is in session.Park left the main opposition party in August 2015, noting that he does not want to place any burden on it.Park will lose his legislative seat if the sentence is upheld by the Supreme Court.","friday for taking bribes ,illegal political sitting lawmaker ,received jail sentence friday ,taking bribes from businessman ,jail sentence friday for","['the Seoul Central District Court', 'Park Ki - choon', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08296543  0.16189022

Seoul and Washington have so far focused on applying sanctions against Pyongyang’s development of nuclear arms and missiles, and persistently called for “sincerity” in its denuclearization commitments.But such a hard-line stance has thus far failed to lure Pyongyang into meaningful talks to at least freeze the regime’s nuclear activities, allowing it to continue upgrading its nuclear technology, critics pointed out.“So far, Seoul and Washington have focused on applying sanctions and putting pressure on the North, believing that it is unlikely to abandon its nuclear program,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University.“They have also persistently demanded that the North should take presteps for the reopening of the denuclearization talks, although Pyongyang has itself suggested talks and made some fence-mending gestures.” The U.S. has so far maintained a policy of what analysts called “strategic patience,” which some have derided as “strategic ignorance” or even a “strategic coma.” Washington has been increasingly reluctant to engage with the North amid the deterioration of bilateral ties.After the breakup of the 2012 “Leap Day Deal” between Washington and Pyongyang, the bilateral relationship was caught in a downward spiral. The deal, under which Pyongyang agreed to put a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests in return for 240,000 tons of “nutritional assistance,” was breached after the North fired a long-range rocket less than two months later -- an incident that deepened mutual distrust. Bilateral friction further increased in late 2014 when the U.S. blamed the North for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, and imposed additional sanctions against it in retaliation for the alleged hacking.U.S. President Barack Obama’s abrupt allusion to the collapse of the North Korean regime early in January 2015 also fueled bilateral animosities, which analysts said encouraged Pyongyang to accelerate efforts to secure what it calls self-deterrence measures.Amid the deterioration of ties, Pyongyang was seen moving to restore its ties with the U.S. through a set of proposals. Last year, Pyongyang called on Washington to stop its military exercises with Seoul in return for a moratorium on its nuclear tests. But the proposal was spurned by the allies.Pyongyang has also called for talks over a peace treaty with the U.S. to replace the current Armistice Agreement. But Washington has dismissed the notion as insincere, apparently viewing the proposal with suspicion that the North would take advantage of it to expel U.S. forces from the South.With the U.S. presidential election slated for November, U.S. policymakers are unlikely to pay more attention to the North Korean issue, analysts said, highlighting the need for Seoul to make more efforts to engage with the North and prevent it from further developing its nuclear program.In line with the U.S.’ policy stance, Seoul has also maintained a tough stance over the North, calling for more sincerity from Pyongyang instead of its verbosity about improving bilateral ties. It has continued to maintain economic sanctions against the North and ratcheted up pressure on the North to give up its nuclear ambitions in cooperation with the U.S., China and other major powers.Seoul has so far focused its efforts on unification policy, but critics argue the policy has given an impression that the South seeks to forcibly absorb the North into its democratic system, rather than seeking coexistence with the North. Pyongyang has called the policy “ill-intended.”Experts say that Seoul should be more active in contriving more creative ways to bring the North to the table for dialogue and to resume the denuclearization process.“Seoul has not been active enough to tackle the nuclear issue so far. The centerpiece of the North Korean problem is the nuclear issue, but it has not been effectively addressing the issue,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“Seoul has long called for Pyongyang’s sincerity. But the North cannot be a country from which we can anticipate sincerity. It has, rather, to be managed or taken care of. Seoul should exert more efforts to persuade China and the U.S. to work out a coordinated resolution to the North Korean conundrum.” Over the past year, Seoul has called for unconditional “exploratory dialogue” with Pyongyang, as the latter has rejected the offer for official multilateral denuclearization talks -- as Seoul and Washington have demanded that Pyongyang first take sincere denuclearization steps.But the efforts have also failed due in large part to bilateral distrust.By Song Sang-ho","hydrogen bomb test president ,critics slam bungled korea ,heavy criticism wednesday after ,bomb test president park ,bomb test president","['Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Park Geun', 'National Security Council', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang']",10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55446786  0.8168574

Moon Jae-in leave the National Assembly after a press conference on Tuesday. YonhapThe party chief’s mention of the disputed deal led to speculations that Lee will be a challenger against the lineup of foreign affairs experts by the rival Saenuri Party, which is seeking to recruit U.N. Secretary-General and former Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon as a presidential candidate.“The sex slavery was a highly intricate diplomatic issue that involves history, politics and human rights,” Lee said upon announcing his party entry.“The foreign ministers of the two countries made a hasty deal, without even reflecting the stance of the victims. Their agreement was purely political and thus lacks legal binding force.”His censure was in contrast to Ban’s favorable comment on the deal referring to President Park Geun-hye’s decision as “courageous.”Lee had served as assistant deputy foreign minister from 2003-2005 under the late President Roh Moo-hyun, and later as South Korean ambassador to Germany and deputy department head at the National Intelligence Service.Being from Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province, Lee is likely to run for the party in the forthcoming parliamentary election in the region against Rep. You Sung-yop, who recently left the party amid partisan feuding. Independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo volunteers as a street cleaner at Yeongdeungpo in western Seoul on Tuesday.

Ahn Cheol-soo and the consequent departure of some senior party members.Pyo, who is known for his righteous image, immediately caught the attention of the young and progressive groups through a series of hard-hitting comments on key issues, including the sex slavery deal.Kim, with his successful experience in the information technology business, is seen as a counterpart to Ahn, who rose from a computer virus vaccine developer to political rookie in the 2012 presidential election season.While the opposition camp continued to expand its human resources pool, the ruling party remained deadlocked with internal feuds over selecting candidates.“The Saenuri Party is preoccupied with the nomination rules, while it should strive to recruit new talents,” said the party’s chief publicist Cho Dong-won.For months, the party has been caught in partisan strife between the pro-President Park clique and the non-Park group steered by party leader Kim Moo-sung. The former pushed to recommend former government officials as strategic candidates in the general elections, but the latter called for a nomination based on an in-party primary election.By Bae Hyun-jung","joined the party tuesday ,party recruits high profile ,party tuesday following suit ,new figures in housecleaning ,boldly recruit new figures","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Soo - hyuck', 'North Korea', 'Pyo Chang - won', 'Webzen']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53089297  0.39991546

Presiding over the first Cabinet meeting of the year, she also pledged to make constant efforts to put cross-border relations back on track, in an upbeat response to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s New Year address in which he said Pyongyang would strive to improve the ties and continue dialogue. “This year we are at a very critical turning point in terms of diplomacy and security and must therefore stay vigilant at all times,” Park said at Cheong Wa Dae, citing the possibility of an unanticipated provocation and perennial threats from across the border. “As a solid and reliable national defense is the paramount foundation, I hope we will step up efforts to reinforce our defense capabilities, stamp out weapons procurement-related irregularities and establish sound military disciplines.”  President Park Geun-hye speaks during a cabinet meeting at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. With unification preparation being one of the top priorities for her statecraft, the president stressed the need to follow through on last year’s inter-Korean agreement and lay the groundwork for a peaceful reintegration.Top officials from both sides agreed Aug. 25 to hold formal, high-level talks and arrange reunions of separated families -- which took place in December and October, respectively. But no follow-up gestures have been made from either side since the dialogue collapsed due to irreconcilable differences in their demands. “Given North Korea’s recent display of its resolve to implement the deal, I want you to strive to normalize the relationship such as by expanding civilian channels for a recovery of the national homogeneity and tackling the issue of separated families,” she added. In the Friday speech, Kim for his part urged Seoul to cherish the spirit behind the breakthrough and warned against any “retrograde” steps or behavior that may dent the mood for dialogue. “We will actively make efforts for North-South talks and the advancement of relations, and sit face-to-face with anyone who sincerely hopes for the people’s reconciliation, unity, peace and unification,” the young ruler said. On the economic front, Park instructed the Cabinet to take measures to sustain the economic recovery and boost domestic spending within the first quarter, while continuing regulatory and anticorruption reform to induce private investment and generate more jobs. To that end, the Defense Ministry unveiled plans to frontload nearly 5.9 trillion won  of its 38.8 trillion won annual budget.It has already allotted more than 195 billion won last year from this year’s budget for facility, clothing and other expenses to help reinvigorate the economy. “The measures are aimed at increasing the effectiveness of government spending and contributing to economic revival,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a regular news briefing.

Presiding over the first Cabinet meeting of the year, she also pledged to make constant efforts to put cross-border relations back on track, in an upbeat response to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s New Year address in which he said Pyongyang would strive to improve the ties and continue dialogue. President Park Geun-hye presides over the Cabinet meeting at the Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. “This year we are at a very critical turning point in terms of diplomacy and security and must therefore stay vigilant at all times,” Park said at Cheong Wa Dae, citing the possibility of an unanticipated provocation and perennial threats from across the border. “As a solid and reliable national defense is the paramount foundation, I hope we will step up efforts to reinforce our defense capabilities, stamp out weapons procurement-related irregularities and establish sound military disciplines.” With unification preparation being one of the top priorities for her statecraft, the president stressed the need to follow through on last year’s inter-Korean agreement and lay the groundwork for a peaceful reintegration.Top officials from both sides agreed Aug. 25 to hold formal, high-level talks and arrange reunions of separated families -- which took place in December and October, repectively. But no follow-up gestures were made from either side since the dialogue collapsed due to irreconcilable differences in their demands.  “Given North Korea’s recent display of its resolve to implement the deal, I want you to strive to normalize the relationship such as by expanding civilian channels for a recovery of the national homogeneity and tackling the issue of separated families,” she added.  In the Friday speech, Kim for his part urged Seoul to cherish the spirit behind the breakthrough and warned against any “retrograde” steps or behavior that may dent the mood for dialogue. “We will actively make efforts for North-South talks and the advancement of relations, and sit face-to-face with anyone who sincerely hopes for the people’s reconciliation, unity, peace and unification,” the young ruler said. On the economic front, Park instructed the Cabinet to take measures to sustain the economic recovery and boost domestic spending within the first quarter, while continuing regulatory and anticorruption reform to induce private investment and generate more jobs. To that end, the Defense Ministry unveiled plans to frontload nearly 5.9 trillion won  of its 38.8 trillion won annual budget.It has already allotted more than 195 billion won last year from this year’s budget for facility, clothing and other expenses to help reinvigorate the economy. “The measures are aimed at increasing the effectiveness of government spending and contributing to economic revival,” ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said at a regular news briefing.

The leadership of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea did not attend citing the ongoing parliamentary strife over key bills and the controversy over the government’s Dec. 28 agreement with Japan on sex slavery.“Unless we achieve change and reform, we will inevitably return to the past and face national difficulties.”South Korea made remarkable progress in reforming the public sector last year by revising the civil servants’ pension system and also in the financial and education sectors, she said.The bilateral free trade agreement with China has helped expand the nation’s economic territory. The diplomatic relations with North Korea and Japan, too, have made progresses, she said.Despite such feats, however, there remain difficulties such as the economic slowdown of China and other emerging economies.The president cited youth unemployment, weakening of corporate competitiveness and declining population as internal challenges and the Korean Peninsula’s diplomatic situation as an external risk.“When I think of our future 10 years from now, I feel obliged to achieve the three-year economic development plan and the key reform plans.”It is also crucial that the political circles should take the lead in the nation’s reform blueprint and give their efforts to improve people’s lives, she added.The remarks were made as the National Assembly struggles to pass a set of bills, which Park claimed could help reform the labor market and revitalize the economy.Parties are currently making last-minute negotiations on the bills so as to make meet the Jan. 8 deadline ― last day of the provisional parliamentary session.The presidential office and the ruling party, having failed to reach an agreement with the opposition bloc, had pushed the parliamentary Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa to put the bills to vote on his own authority.“Our society is riddled with division and conflicts,” said Chung in his valedictory speech to the president.“The only thing we can do to solve this is to harmonize and unite with one another, the ruling with the opposition parties, labor with management, and the North  with the South.”By Bae Hyun-jung","park pushes parties for ,for reform president park ,pushes parties for reform ,parties for reform president ,the ongoing economic reform",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.11223859  0.39084178

With the National Assembly’s extra session expected to end Friday, Lee Ki-kwon, the minister of employment and labor, underscored the need for bills to revamp the nation’s labor market to create jobs for the young and reduce job uncertainties. Members of the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions announce this year’s plan to fight the government’s push for labor market reforms near the statue of Jeon Tae-il, a deceased labor activist, along the Cheonggyecheon Stream in central Seoul, Monday. “Last year, we established a foundation for labor market reforms. This year, we need to bear the fruits,” Lee said, referring to the “grand compromise” made last September among management, labor and government representatives. “Some labor unions are only focusing on improving their labor conditions, ignoring the spirit of trilateral compromise to create a fairer labor market structure,” he said, calling the passage of market reform bills a “safeguard” for the workers on the edge of society. After months of debate over the labor market revamp, a tripartite committee of labor, business and government agreed on a series of reform measures, including clarifying employment guidelines and adopting the peak wage system on the condition of “sufficient” consultation before pushing for such policies. While the government pushes ahead with the easing of labor regulations to boost the sluggish economy and add jobs for the young, the nation’s labor unions have fiercely opposed the plan, viewing them as expanding temporary jobs and making it easier for employers to dismiss workers. Enraged by the government’s announcement of a draft of guidelines on employment guidelines on Dec. 30, the Federation of Korea Trade Unions, one of the negotiators of the trilateral agreement, hinted at a plan to withdraw from the trilateral deal.“Excluding the labor bloc, the government unilaterally revealed a draft of guidelines on easier dismissals and change of company rules,” Kim Dong-man, head of the nation’s largest umbrella union, said in a statement. The draft includes the government’s administrative guidelines to ease restrictions for employers to fire underperforming workers and change company rules without unions’ approval. The prospects for the passage of the key reform bills also remain bleak, as the rival parties have continued to lock horns over the embattled reform plan. As part of the Park Geun-hye administration’s drive for labor market reform, the ruling Saenuri Party presented five bills related to labor conditions in September following the three-way agreement. The bills stipulate a reduction in working hours, improvements in benefits for the unemployed, extension of hiring contract workers, expansion of sectors that can employ temporary workers and adoption of the peak wage system.But the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea has refused to pass the bills through the National Assembly, mindful of the votes of the 1.4 million workers comprising the two largest umbrella labor unions. National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa expressed his hope to pass the embattled bills before the extraordinary session expires Friday. He remains reluctant to exercise his authority to put the bills to a vote without the rival parties’ consent, citing the rule of law.Earlier in the day, the KCTU announced this year’s plan to resist the government’s push for labor market reforms in central Seoul, vowing to stage a strike Friday after the extra parliamentary session ends. The FKTU will decide on Friday in an executive meeting whether to join the militant union group Korea Confederation of Trade Unions’ fight against the government. By Ock Hyun-ju","market reform bills monday ,korea labor minister renewed ,his new year speech ,reform bills monday in ,reform bills monday","['South Korea ’s', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Lee Ki - kwon']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24788924  0.29001844

704,704,Child care crisis looms as funding standoff persists,"The Education Ministry stepped up its offensive against local education superintendents this week, with the government and regional offices locking horns over who is responsible for funding the “Nuri” child care and education subsidy program.“Some education offices’ refusal to allocate a budget for the Nuri program infringes on children’s right to be educated.

Superintendents should immediately take measures to stop the ‘child care’ crisis, and be mindful that they are responsible for the situation that ensues upon their failure to do so,” the ministry said Sunday.Nuri, one of President Park Geun-hye’s key election pledges during her 2012 campaign, provides financial coverage for kindergarten and day care tuition fees for all children aged 3-5.But the multi-trillion won project had sparked complaints from local education chiefs that the government has unfairly placed a financial burden on them. Children have lunch Monday at a kindergarten in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. As of Monday, six education offices ― Seoul, Gwangju, North Jeolla Province, South Jeolla Province, Gangwon, Sejong and Gyeonggi Province ― have yet to pledge full financial coverage of the subsidy program. Gyeonggi’s provincial assembly failed to reach an agreement on the Nuri program and commenced the fiscal year on a provisional budget, after a violent physical altercation erupted on Dec. 31 over its removal of Nuri from the 2016 budget.The ruling Saenuri Party accused on Monday the education offices, Gyeonggi council and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea of conducting a political scheme. “If  allow the child care crisis become a reality, they are legally responsible for violating the law,” said Rep. Kim Jung-hoon, head of the Saenuri Party policy committee. The education chiefs’ association of Korea had already requested an audience with the president, vowing to take all measures to see that the government accepts their demands to fully fund the Nuri program for this year, which they expect would cost about 4 trillion won .“A face-to-face talk with the president is our last resort. If she refuses, there is nothing more we can do,” said Jang Huy-gook, superintendent of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education who doubles as the head of the association. “If the government pursues legal actions against us , then we would take legal measures as well,” he said, referring to last month’s announcement by the Policy Coordinating Minister Choo Kyung-ho that the government would take “every possible disciplinary measure” to ensure that the local education offices pick up the check for Nuri. The government said the money for the Nuri program should come from the 41.2 trillion won budget already allocated for the country’s 17 city and provincial education offices in 2016, marking a 1.8 trillion won increase from the year before. Choo also stressed that a plan to inject an additional 300 billion won was passed by the National Assembly.But Jang claimed the 1.8 trillion won budget increase is “not even enough to cover the increase in payroll” of education workers. “We  already promised to pay for kindergarten, but at least cover the costs for the child care centers,” he said, in a press conference jointly attended by superintendents of six offices that have allocated zero or partial budgets for the Nuri program.Meanwhile, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education is locked in a standstill of its own with its city council, which has refused to even shoulder the kindergarten budgets. The SMOE is planning to request for a reconsideration of the council’s decision within this week. Among the thorny issues surrounding the Nuri program is the ambiguous law on the regional education budget, which funds the 17 education offices. The government and education offices are split on what qualifies as an “education facility,” which the cited clause does not specify. Korean law stipulates that the budget covers partial or entire expenses for all educational facilities installed or operated by a regional government.The government categorizes kindergartens as education facilities that are under the guidance of the Education Ministry, but child care facilities, such as day care centers, are under supervision of the Welfare Ministry. The Education Ministry claimed that as many of the functions and target age group of kindergartens ― generally for children aged 3-5 ― and child care centers ― for ages 0-5 ― overlap, the education offices should cover costs for both. The education superintendents have rejected the notion.Facing controversy, the government even passed an ordinance for the education budget law last year that mandated the respective education offices to pay for the entire Nuri program.In spite of the law revision, education offices pointed out that the cited clause ― which supersedes the ordinance ― clearly states that they are only required to cover costs for the educational facilities. The costs for child care centers alone is expected to reach 2.1 trillion won, according to the estimates by the education chiefs’ association.“What the Education Ministry is asking of us is illegal, because  is the responsibility the Welfare Ministry and not ours,” said Gangwon Education Superintendent Min Byung-hee, adding that his office’s financial problems makes it impossible to shoulder the costs of Nuri.A similar standoff last year over the Nuri program was stitched up with a makeshift solution of a 506 billion won emergency subsidy by the government and education offices issuing bonds. But the education superintendents said a resounding no to repeating the procedure, claiming that they are already swimming in debt.According to data provided by Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo of the minor opposition Justice Party, the collective debt of the education offices in 2015 was 10.8 trillion won, skyrocketing from 2.1 trillion won in 2011. Jang Man-chae, the education chief for South Jeolla Province, said the money for the Nuri program would eventually have to come from the budget originally intended for student welfare and maintenance of school facilities.Seoul Education Chief Cho Hi-yeon called for a “grand compromise” by both ruling and opposition parties to find a solution on the Nuri issue. “Strictly speaking, Seoul alone could cover about two to three months of the Nuri program. But in case of places like Gyeonggi Province, even the ministry admits that they are short on funds. I hope we can find a middle ground on the issue,” he told reporters.By Yoon Min-sik","offensive against local education ,education superintendents this week ,against local education superintendents ,some education offices refusal ,funding standoff","['the Education Ministry', 'Nuri']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39319986  0.01912232

Though the Assembly’s speaker granted the lawmakers a seven-day extension before he exercises his authority to push through the election bill on Jan. 8, the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea have yet to resolve their differences over the rezoning scheme. “The National Assembly is to blame for this unprecedented situation. Many political aspirants and preliminary candidates are treated unfairly because they do not know where they should run for the elections. It is a violation of the people’s right to vote and happiness,” the candidates said in a statement.  Preliminary candiates hold press conference after filing a lawusit againt the National Assembly over its failure to meet legal deadline for determining new constituencies. YonhapOn the same day, another prospective candidate Kwak Gye-taek filed an injunction request in Busan District Court, urging the court to prohibit the incumbent Saenuri lawmaker Rep. Yoo Ki-joon from rolling out pamphlets detailing his job performance at the Assembly.Kwak asserted that distribution of such documents prior to a legal campaign period could constitute a violation of the Elections Law, because the incumbent lawmakers have the ability to make and distribute papers on their projects related to their constituencies, while the newcomers do not. By law, preliminary candidates can engage in an initial level of campaigning, such as opening an office, hanging placards and hiring three or fewer campaigners.Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, meanwhile, repeated his commitment to use his power to call for a vote on the election bill and continued to bridge the gap between the rival parties amid the electoral committee’s stalled efforts to review the speakers’ meditation. “We have reached a pretty critical situation. I will be considering due measures,” he told reporters. Hours later, Chung arranged a luncheon with the leaders of the major parties and urged them to reach a consensus to avert further electoral crisis.The constituency law became invalid as of Jan. 1, and Chung proposed to pass a bill that includes a similar electoral map to the existing one -- 246 seats for local constituencies and 54 for proportional representatives.Despite its commitment to issue a specific guideline by Jan. 5, the electoral committee under the National Election Commission has failed to draw a compromise version. The committee must finalize the version and submit it for review in order for the Assembly speaker to put it to a plenary vote. As the electoral deadlock continued, the Assembly secretariat and even some lawmakers voiced their frustration over the impasse. Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party compared the situation to a “comedy show,” as candidates are forced to kick off their election campaign without knowing where to run. “The Assembly is the place where the lawmakers enact the law and comply with it. Given this, we have little excuse to the people for creating such a lawless situation. Some say it is the epitome of irresponsible politics. We deserve the blame,” said Park Heong-joon, secretary general of the National Assembly.

The deal would allow companies to dismiss workers who are either negligent or underperforming.No follow-up parliamentary measures have been taken.South Korea ""cannot get out of difficult times if we fail to make changes and reform,"" Park said in a new year meeting with officials, noting the country's future is at stake.Still, National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa renewed his opposition to invoking his authority to take a set of economic bills to the floor and put them to a vote.Under the National Assembly Act, a National Assembly speaker can table a bill to a plenary session for a vote in the event of a natural disaster, state emergency or under an agreement between rival parties.Chung said he told Park's chief of staff Lee Byung-kee at the meeting that economic bills and the issue of redrawing the electoral constituency map are two separate issues.Chung said he would table the issue of redrawing the electoral constituency map to the floor for a vote, without giving a specific time frame.The current electoral map became invalid by the end of last year.The rival parties are required to redraw electoral districts as the Constitutional Court ruled in October 2014 that the electoral map was unconstitutional, citing unequal representation.No opposition lawmakers attended the meeting at the presidential office.","pressed political parties monday ,embrace reform president park ,monday to embrace reform ,to embrace reform president ,reform president park geun",['Park Geun'],10,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27246153  0.68216377

708,708,Major shift in N.K. policy on Seoul could point to other causes of top official's death: U.S. expert,"A major shift in North Korea's policy toward South Korea could suggest that Pyongyang's top negotiator with Seoul, Kim Yang-gon, could have died by causes other than a car crash, a U.S. expert said Thursday.   The North announced Wednesday that the 73-year-old Kim died in a traffic accident, a cause that immediately raised doubts as some other top officials have died similar deaths in a nation known for scant traff...","A major shift in North Korea's policy toward South Korea could suggest that Pyongyang's top negotiator with Seoul, Kim Yang-gon, could have died by causes other than a car crash, a U.S. expert said Thursday.   The North announced Wednesday that the 73-year-old Kim died in a traffic accident, a cause that immediately raised doubts as some other top officials have died similar deaths in a nation known for scant traffic, including the 2003 death of Kim Yong-sun, who was also in charge of inter-Korean relations.   ""This is the big question right now facing Pyongyang watchers,"" Ken Gause, a senior North Korea analyst at CNA Corp., said. ""Was this an accident or is this a cover up for a purge? Sometimes when leaders are purged, the car accident is used as a way of getting rid of them without branding them a criminal or a traitor.""   Kim was given a state funeral, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who has become notorious for purging top aides, including the brutal execution of his uncle Jang Song-thaek, has offered ""profound"" condolences over Kim's death, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency.   Kim visited Kim's mortuary Wednesday and could hardly ""repress his bitter grief"" for long, KCNA said. The leader was also quoted as calling the late aide ""the closest comrade-in-arms"" and his death a ""great loss"" to the country.   ""The early indications are that this was an accident,"" Gause said. ""If, however, we begin to see a major shift away from inter-Korean dialogue toward a more aggressive, brinksmanship or isolationist policy, then we may have to take another look at this 'accident.'""   Kim was one of the two ranking North Korean officials who attended the rare inter-Korean high-level talks in August following heightened tensions sparked by a land mine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.   The two Koreas reached a rare deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tensions and make efforts to promote inter-Korean civilian exchanges. The two sides held follow-up high-level talks earlier this month to talk about the reconciliation project, but the negotiations broke off without any agreement.   ""Kim Yang-gon's death in a car accident might be interpreted as paying the ultimate price for the collapse of the inter-Korean mini-detente following the August agreement,"" Bruce Klingner, a senior Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation, said.   But Klinger also pointed out that prior to his death, there were no indications Kim was distrusted or in danger of being purged. The frequency of Kim accompanying the leader had also increased under Kim Jong-un's reign as compared with the era of late leader Kim Jong-il, he said.   The expert also noted leader Kim's expression of sorrow about the loss of Kim.   ""The North Korean leader attended the funeral, expressing 'bitter grief' and bemoaning the loss of 'his faithful helper whom nobody can replace,' suggesting an accidental rather than planned death,"" Klingner said. ""That said, other North Korean elites may now be more wary of getting into their cars.""","died in traffic accident ,top official death expert ,top officials have died ,crash expert said thursday ,kim died in traffic","[""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yang - gon', 'U.S.', 'Kim']",10,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.46835959  0.24554738
