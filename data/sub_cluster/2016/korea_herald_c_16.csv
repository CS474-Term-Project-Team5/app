The police said they will interrogate him to find out the exact motive.In October, JTBC initially reported Park leaked presidential speeches and other documents to her long-time friend Choi Soon-sil, based on what was assumed to be Choi's tablet PC.Park was impeached on Dec. 9 after the prosecution said she collided with Choi and other presidential officials to force conglomerates to donate a huge amount of funds.","crashed his ton truck ,park impeachment truck driven ,kim crashed his ton ,of park impeachment truck ,park impeachment truck","['south korean', ""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Kim', 'Mapo', 'Seoul']",16,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.56391543  0.16529751

Without anyone to share her feelings, she often cried to sleep. She has searched online for ways to kill herself and people to attempt suicide with, and even left a suicide note. “I was not close to my mother. I suffered from sociophobia and depression since I was in the middle school. I felt like there was no one who sympathized with me or understood me. I felt like I was completely alone,” said the student from Ulsan. “I felt I would not suffer if I just died.” Stock imageWhat helped her through the difficult times was a counselling service she received from the Youth Counselling and Welfare Centers as a part of the Gender Ministry’s community youth safety-net program. After being categorized as a student who needs special attention through a test, she was initially reluctant to see counsellors. “I had no trust in such counselling services and I hated to open myself up to others.”But now she considers herself “lucky.”“Through counselling, I gained confidence. I learned that it was okay to make mistakes. I learned that I was precious the way I was,” said Kim, who received the counselling service from May to September this year. Kim is one of the 172,900 teenagers who has been covered by the ministry’s community safety-net program this year. Some 34,775 were offered counselling under the program. The Gender Ministry aims to provide a social safety net for juveniles in crises such as runaways, dropouts and those exposed to various hardships from sexual violence, domestic violence and bullying at schools. Some 1,079 juveniles from multicultural backgrounds and from North Korea also received support through the program on 15,606 occasions.In partnership with municipalities, police stations, education offices and health clinics in the local community, the Gender Ministry discovers vulnerable youth and helps them to return to their homes, schools and society in accordance with Juvenile Welfare Support Act. It has 222 counselling facilities across the nation with 1,066 counsellors with an expertise in social welfare and youth to provide the teenagers at risk with one-on-one or group counselling, short-term and long-term protection, legal advice, medical services and financial support. Starting in 2017, the ministry plans to expand the youth support program by increasing the number of youth counsellors from the current 1,066 to 1,146, with the budget to rise by 9.4 percent to 8.1 billion won. “The ministry will increase the number of counsellors and harness their skills so that youngsters in crisis can receive customized services,” said Yang Cheol-soo, who is in charge of the ministry’s division for self-reliance on youth.

In 2015, it rose to 5 wild pigs, the highest level since 2001.  By province, South Korea's southwestern province of North Jeolla topped the list of wild boars' habitat density with 8.7, trailed by the southeastern province of South Gyeongsang with 6.6 and the northeast province of Gangwon with 5.4. The institute defines 3 to 5 per square kilometers as a safe population density. The increased habitat density stokes fears that people could be at risk of running into the feral animals more often. On Sunday, a 58-year-old medicinal herb collector died from excessive bleeding after a wild boar bit his thigh on a mountain in the city of Samcheok on the country's east coast. The incident followed a December 2015 incident in which one of the two people were mauled to death by a wild boar while picking medicinal plants on a mountain in the same city.Efforts to catch more wild boars than ever does not appear to help decrease the number of wild boars due to the prolific animal's propagative nature. In Gangwon, the estimated number of wild animals captured increased to 21,700 in 2015 from 10,700 in 2013 and 8,700 in 2011. As of September this year, it is estimated at 22,000, 5 percent of which is wild boars.An official at the institute said, ""A wild boar gives birth to three to 10 piglets. It is not so easy to adjust the number of the animals by capturing or hunting done on a local basis.""""A rise in the habitat density means that the possibility of people encountering wild boars could increase, too,"" the official said, asking people to take preventive measures to avoid such sudden encounters. ""On a mountain trail, which is also a passage of wild animals, you have to show indications of people approaching them as a way to keep them from appearing all of sudden,"" the official added.","73 000 wild boars ,18 000 wild boars ,000 wild boars were ,000 wild boars ,wild boars were captured",['the National Institute of Biological Resources'],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62972116  0.36661461

The announcement was made at around 12:52 p.m., hours after some 800 police officials raided the hospital, where the joint task force on elucidating Baek’s death has been staging a protest since last month.The surprise visit was met with fierce resistance from the bereaved family members and their supporters, who cried out that the enforcement of the autopsy was an attempt to steal the body and thus conceal the truth about Baek’s death.Protesters set up tents and barricades around the hospital’s funeral hall, some dozens of them forming a “human barricade” by binding themselves one to another with a chain.Rep. Pyo Chang-won of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, who is also a forensic expert and former professor at Korea National Police University, hurried to the scene to join the rally.But the police chief alluded that the enforcement plan has not yet been totally scrapped.“This is what we have decided for today. As for tomorrow and the day after, further discussions will be needed.”Also, the police held ground on not revealing the full text of the disputed warrant, claiming that the bereaved family members should first meet with police officials and agree to the execution in order to gain access to the court-issued document.Amid the disputes following Baek’s death, which took place after 317 days of unconsciousness, the Seoul Central District Court on Sept. 28 issued the autopsy warrant, on condition that the police and bereaved family agree on the location, observers and procedure.But the family members reiterated its former stance that autopsy was unnecessary for a death which was obviously caused by police aggression.By Bae Hyun-jung","autopsy on deceased farmer ,police water cannon last ,knocked unconscious by police ,deceased farmer the police ,farmer who died last",['Baek Nam - gi'],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5014028  -0.02543494

According to local police, the accident occurred at 7:18 a.m. at Gimpo International Airport Subway Station on subway line No. 5, when the victim, a 36-year-old Korean Air employee, was trying to get off the train. A subway train is seen at Gimpo International Airport Subway Station in Seoul, with platform screen doors open. He became trapped in the narrow space between the subway carriage and the platform safety door, but the train’s conductor, apparently unaware of this, signaled for the train to depart, leading to his death. “We’re looking into the exact cause of the accident,” police said. Seoul Metropolitan Mass Transit Corp., which operates subway lines No. 5-8, expressed condolences over the commuter’s death, adding it is looking into the case to identify what could be done to prevent similar incidents. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who visited the accident scene in the morning, vowed that the city will come up with thorough measures. This is the third fatality this year caused by subway screen doors and the sixth overall. Three of the victims were passengers, while the other three were repair staff on duty. Safety screens on subway platforms were first introduced in Korea in 2004 to prevent accidental falls off the platform onto the track area, suicide attempts and homicides by pushing.Now, nearly all Seoul stations have them. Provincial governments are required to install platform screen doors in their subway and train stations by 2017.","train commuter died wednesday ,commuter died wednesday morning ,train commuter died ,and train commuter died ,killed trapped between subway",['Korean Air'],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27347949  0.16118503

The hospital, CHA Bundang Medical Center in Seongnam, wasn’t aware of the irregularity until a former staff member blew the whistle last month. It said it has fired the three employees involved in the illegal transfer of blood samples.“We will also improve the current medical waste disposal system in order to strengthen the management of patients’ medical test samples and records,” an official of CHA Bundang Medical Center said Wednesday.   Bundang CHA Hospital buildingYet, public concerns have surfaced over how medical waste is handled and disposed of at hospitals. As well as ethical concerns, the waste also poses safety risks, as it can carry infectious diseases.The Bundang-based hospital is a highly rated medical center that receives at least 1,000 patients daily for blood tests. It belongs to the CHA Group, one of the most successful brands in the country’s medical services scene. “I have frequently visited large-scale or renowned hospitals with images of respectability and trustworthiness, so I’m very disappointed at those hospitals,” said a 30-something man surnamed Hong, who recently visited the CHA Medical Center in Gangnam.“No one can guarantee whether my personal medical records or genetic information are completely disposed after medical tests, since there is no method for patients to ask about the disposal” Son Young-mi, another patient, told the Korea Herald.According to the hospital, three employees secretly sent some 4,000 units of 10-milliliter blood samples to a biomedical company in Suwon instead of disposing of them after the tests. Employees sent 200 blood samples at a time each month to aid the firm in its research and experiments. They claim to have received no kickbacks in return and to have provided nothing else other than the blood. The personal information that was taped on the blood sample containers was removed before the transfer, they said. The current Medical Service Act states that blood or urine samples are considered medical waste once the examination is done and should be disposed of within two to three days. They must be handled with strict adherence to related guidelines, it stipulates.  The hospital said that it was difficult to detect the breach of rules because one of the employees involved in the case was a head manager in charge of medical waste disposal. That person is said to have been close to one of the employees of the biomedical company.  Health authorities said that it had requested a police investigation on the case to find out whether any medical data was leaked or monetary rewards were offered for handing over the blood samples.

The court found the middle-aged couple who killed the girl while abusing her as punishment were “highly likely to run away.” It approved the warrant requested by district prosecutors a day earlier for the couple, who face charges of child abuse resulting in death and the mutilation and abandonment of a body. The death of the girl, who the 47-year-old man and his 30-year-old wife adopted two years ago, occurred on Sept. 28, at their apartment around 11 p.m. in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province.The victim was wrapped in duct tape and left alone for 17 straight hours without being fed, Incheon Namdong Police found. She died the next day. The exact cause of death is still being investigated. On Sept. 30, the couple moved the body to a nearby mountain by car and reportedly set fire to the remains before burying them to hide the evidence. They then drove to a fish market festival in Sorae-pogu, Incheon, falsely telling the birth mother and police that they had lost their daughter while at the festival.But when examining CCTV footage, police found that the couple did not accompany the child to the festival. The couple later confessed during the investigation that they had killed the child, and had routinely abused her before the incident occurred.The couple denies that the killing was intentional, saying that the wife performed CPR before the victim died. A 19-year-old female who police said was a daughter of the father’s close friend and living with the couple was also investigated and apprehended on the same charges.

The ill-fated attempt to teach a lesson came after the teacher at an elementary school in Goyang-si, northern Seoul, whose identification has not been revealed, asked one of the sixth grade students in the classroom to make a presentation during Korean class last month, according to the local police and Gyeonggi Goyang Office of Education on Monday. Frustrated by the student’s barely audible voice, the teacher told the student several times to speak up, police found. The sixth grader was later allegedly forced to stand until the late afternoon by the instructor. The teacher reportedly told him “you are not going to sit again until you figure out how to speak up,” as he kept asking for permission to sit down. The discipline continued as the students changed classrooms later that morning. During the lunch hour, the boy had to reportedly finish his meal quickly in order to resume his punishment. It was not until the beginning of the sixth class in the late afternoon that the student was permitted to take a seat. Shortly after the student’s parents heard about the incident, harsh protests followed. “It is obviously beyond any disciplinary method,” his parents insisted. “The teacher didn’t even allow him to go to the bathroom and humiliated him in front of other classmates.” The parents also filed a complaint with the police against the school and the provincial office of education after the school failed to take sufficient action, arguing “the school is simply covering up the incident without acknowledging the magnitude of the case.”The homeroom teacher, who has been transferred to another class, said “it was just part of discipline.” Meanwhile, the police told reporters that it is “carrying out an investigation with a child protection institution and will bring him in for further inquiries.” Gyeonggi Goyang Office of Education will decide on the level of disciplinary action against the teacher based on the investigation result, its officials said.

The Seoul Central District Court found the professor at Seoul National University, identified only by his surname Cho, guilty of writing a report between 2011 and 2012 that said there was no clear causal relation between the substances in Oxy's products and lung damage.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.The company asked the professor for the report in August 2011 to rebut the announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in return for money. ""The suspect violated research ethics for money, when he holds social and moral responsibility as the country's highest authority in the field of toxicology,"" the court said. It ordered the professor to pay a fine of 25 million won  and forfeit another 12 million won. The court's decision came a week after Rakesh Kapoor, the head of the Britain-based Reckitt Benckiser, apologized for the pain and deaths of the South Korean consumers.

The high court decision confirmed the previous rulings of the lower courts in 2015 that a women who chocked her ex-husband to death after he threatened her with a knife earlier that night, was not self-defense, sentencing her to two years in prison.  The 44-year-old woman, known only by her surname Cho, was accused of strangling her ex-husband to death with a tie in June 2015, after he allegedly threatened to kill her with a kitchen knife after he came home late, intoxicated. Then-58-year-old ex-husband, Moon, reportedly brandished the knife aiming it at Cho’s throat, while Cho knocked it away with a wooden pestle. He then tripped over a bottle of liquor on the floor and fell and Cho started beating him in the head with the pestle. After two hours, she reportedly got a tie and chocked him to death with it, saying to her children “we will get revenge once he wakes up.”Although the Supreme Court admitted that the defendant had been experiencing domestic violence, it ruled that the killing is not self-defense since the deadly incident happened two hours after Moon brandished the knife. Moon, after he fell to the floor, offered little or no resistance to the defendant, the court said. In order to prove self-defense, there must be serious bodily harm which could have only been prevented by the use of force, the court explained.

The victim was stopping by her house for a change of clothes before afternoon classes when she was threatened with a weapon to her back. She was taken on a bus headed to Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. The bus ran for about an hour before stopping at a station in Hwado-eup at around 4 p.m., where Choi tried to alight with the victim. As they were leaving the bus, the victim screamed for help, reportedly collapsing near the driver’s seat. Choi hurriedly left the bus.The police used CCTV footage to chase Choi, who was seen fleeing from his house using his father’s car in the direction of Sokcho, Gangwon Province. The Gangwon Provincial Police were requested to cooperate in the chase, which ended Saturday at around 5:40 p.m., as Choi crashed into another car. He attempted to steal a car on the spot and continue fleeing, but failed and was caught after running some 100 meters on foot. At the Uijeongbu District Court on Monday, Choi said that he was sorry and that he will repent for the rest of his life.

An animal rights activist group reported the incident to the police, calling for strong punishment and tougher animal protection laws, police said. According to Sunchang Police on Sunday, a 50-year-old male driver was accused of driving downtown of Sunchang, North Jeolla Province, with his pet attached to the back of his sedan by a leash. It was killed by being dragged to death along the road Saturday, police confirmed. Animal rights group CARE made the police report with footage of the incident, asserting that there is plausible cause to believe the driver had intentionally let his dog be dragged by his vehicle.  A man shown on video dragging his pet dog to death will be taken in for investigation. The driver, whose identity has not yet been revealed, insisted it was an “accident,” police said. The driver said after visiting a grave of a family member -- as is custom in line with the upcoming Chuseok, or Korean thanksgiving -- he had put two Jindo puppies inside his car’s trunk with their leashes hooked inside it. He said he had not thought that the dogs could fall out of the car even though he had been aware that the trunk was partly open due to bulky equipment he had used to trim the grass on the tomb. As the vehicle sped up, one of the puppies had jumped out of the trunk and was then dragged to death along the road for about 4 kilometers at the speed of 80 kilometers per hour, the police explained. The police said they will take the driver in for further investigation.

And just around the corner are all-night eateries, serving up gamjatang , kongnamulguk  and other dishes believed to having sobering powers. Koreans commonly seek such foods as the means to rebound from the dreaded hangover, a practice Koreans call “haejang.”It is no secret that Koreans love to drink. The term “Let’s have a drink” is used essentially as an invitation to socialize among adults. Whether it be among friends, business partners or even among subordinates and their bosses in companies, a shot of soju mixed into a glass of beer is considered a recipe for breaking the ice or releasing the pressure of hectic life.Confucian-based Korean culture is built on the idea of hierarchical respect, making frank conversation among work-related people difficult. As such, sharing one’s true feelings while drinking, or binge-drinking, has become a sort of norm in the business world.According to a Finance Ministry data revealed in June, the government collected 3.23 trillion won  in alcohol-related taxes. It marked the first time in history alcohol taxes topped the 3 trillion-won mark, indicating that drinking culture is strong even, or especially, amid the economic slump.Koreans consume about 12.3 liters of alcohol per capita, which is the highest among all Asian countries according to the World Health Organization’s global status report on alcohol and health 2014.Fittingly, this gave birth to the custom of routinized, diversified and surprisingly commercialized custom of “haejang,” “chasing away” the hangovers the next morning. Derived from the word “haejeong,” which literally means to relieve hangover, haejang most commonly refers to eating dishes that will supposedly help you avoid the killer headaches and nausea. While the dishes may vary, the most popular are types of soups collectively called “haejangguk.” Many of them are hot, spicy and salty, with vegetables and meat in a hearty beef broth.Among the most popular are gamjatang, seonjiguk  and less-spicy kongnamulguk and hwangtaeguk .Over time, the term haejang has come to encompass various methods aside from eating particular dishes. One of the simpler ways is to drink a mixture of honey and water, which some binge-drinkers would have during the process of all-night drinking. Others believe that sweating helps avoid a painful hangover, opting for saunas or hot baths after drinking.Effects of haejang have yet to be scientifically proven or even recommended, but seemingly the majority of the heavy drinkers in Korea embrace the practice, believing it will help them recover from indulging in nectar of Dionysus.It is unclear when the haejang culture was conceived. Some trace it back to the ancient Goryeo kingdom . In “Nolgeoldae,” a Chinese language textbook from the times, seongjutang is referred to as what makes you sober. Others find roots in hyojonggaeng -- made with cabbage, bean sprouts, beef and seafood -- popularized during the late Joseon era .But as “tang” is referred to both as medicine and soup, some say the seongjutang in question is medicine, not the forerunner of today’s haejangguk.Food reviewer Hwang Gwang-hae raised such issue, and wrote in his column that haejangguk’s history actually originates from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonization of Korea. The term clearly makes an appearance in news articles written in the early 20th century.By Yoon Min-sik","night partying sprawled unconscious ,young clubbers in south ,women staggering from weight ,partying sprawled unconscious ,all night partying sprawled",['South Korea'],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.98482078  0.38219237

It was drastically downsized in March, when authorities razed its large southern sector of more than 1,000 shelters and shops, displacing at least 1,000 migrants. This summer, they began closing dozens of camp shops and restaurants, the only available amenities. Despite that, the camp's population has soared to its highest-ever level since taking root on the edge of Calais in April 2015. The prefecture, or state authority for the region, said after a one-day count this month that it found 6,901 people living in the camp. Aid group Auberge des Migrants reached its own figure after four days of recent counting: 9,106 people, compared to 7,000 in early July.British Home Secretary Amber Rudd was meeting Tuesday with her French counterpart and they were expected to discuss French-British cooperation in Calais. The squalid camp built within the sand dunes of northern France draws migrants from Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea, Syria and elsewhere, chased from home by danger or destitution, most driven by dreams of life in Britain, where some have family or friends. After often harrowing treks via Libya to Italy or overland through eastern Europe, paying smugglers along the way, most reach a dead end in Calais, unable to find a way across the English Channel. More than 300 have accepted money for a voluntary departure since the start of the year, the prefecture says, but most remain stuck in limbo. Many don't consider applying for asylum an option because they don't want to stay in France. Numbers indicating how many have been deported were not immediately available. ""They are broken inside because they were here with lots of hopes ... and in the jungle they're not seeing their bright future here,'' said Tariq Shinnari, a 26-year-old former civil servant from Afghanistan here since March. He has given up his dream of going to Britain and is applying for asylum in France. With that new goal, and his work as a volunteer for the British aid organization Care4Calais, he avoids the desperation of other migrants in the camp, though the situation is not lost on him.""They are saying we don't have war here, but we are like in a kind of prison.""Riot police line the highways leading to the ferry port or Eurotunnel trains crossing the English Channel, aiming to deter migrants who might try to sneak across. Some have resorted to increasingly dangerous tactics to jump onto trucks, throwing branches and other objects onto the roadway to stop traffic. Of the 11 migrants who have died in Calais this year, seven were hit by a car or truck, according to the prefecture. In the camp, supplies are growing scarce, according to two aid organizations, and migrants say they can spend up to three hours in line to get a shower of six minutes. They spend hours more in lines for food.The Kitchen in Calais, one of several volunteer dispensaries, served 800 dinners a day in April and is now dishing up 1,500 meals. It is seeking permission to expand to serve 2,000 meals daily, said Jamal Ismail, a Briton who runs it.The rising number of needy reflects the durability of the global migrant crisis, as the flow into Europe continues despite efforts to contain it. In the camp, a sense of despair lingers in the dusty alleys. Now authorities are trying to demolish the 72 restaurants and shops that migrants say make it livable, with places to socialize, charge cell phones and, in some cases, sleep. ""Nobody is functioning at full blast,'' said Maya Konforti of the Auberge des Migrants.Police guarding the camp refuse to allow building materials inside, so instead of plywood shelters, tents are going up in every available space. Up to 2,500 people now live in tents, according to Konforti, some of them in summer tents ""not at all appropriate for winter.'' With resources lacking, mounting tensions have created new dangers. On Aug. 23, a Sudanese man in his 30s was killed in a fight with Afghans. The next night, scores of migrants were seen at an intersection of two camp walkways and several Afghans armed themselves with long wooden sticks. New arrival Marhawi Tesfay, a 17-year-old Eritrean, said he was afraid.""I think there's not safety 100 percent,'' he said. Tesfay is among a record number of children alone in the camp. Aid organization France Terre d'Asile said Tuesday the number of children under 18 on their own there has reached a record of 861 -- well more than twice the 343 counted in May. The youngest is 10-year-old Afghan.Calais became a magnet for migrants in the late 1990s, when refugees from the war in Kosovo flocked to northern France. Afghans fleeing war followed. Migrant numbers spiked when a Red Cross shelter in nearby Sangatte took in 68,000 refugees over three years. The Sangatte center was closed in 2002, and France and Britain drew up an accord that puts British police, customs agents, sniffer dogs and high fences in Calais.After it became a flashpoint in Europe's migrant crisis last year, authorities made new efforts to deter or resettle migrants.In January, the French installed containers in the camp to house 1,500 people, and provided 400 places for women and children. They set up a bus service to take migrants to 148 welcome centers around France, to reconsider their futures. The buses are increasingly filling up -- despite warnings from some migrants that the trip is a trap with expectations they apply for asylum, and risk expulsion if rejected.The message is clear.

Daejeon Dunsan Police on Thursday said the driver, 63, passed away after sudden heart failure while driving at around 8:40 a.m. on Thursday in Seo-gu, Daejeon. Whether he passed away while still behind the steering wheel or after, due to lack of prompt emergency measures, has yet to be discerned. The late man, unconscious after the incident, reportedly lost control of the taxi with his foot pressed down on the accelerator. The car only came to a halt after ramming into another vehicle. According to witnesses who called for emergency service for the taxi driver, the passengers who had been present at the moment of the accident gathered their luggage and simply changed taxis without offering any help to the unconscious man.The police presume they left thinking others would report the accident for them, with the morning traffic fairly dense with commuters. The passengers only called to report the accident to police two hours after the incident, explaining they had to leave the scene in a hurry to catch an airport bus that was due to depart in 10 minutes. They told police they would cooperate with the investigation when they return from overseas. An autopsy has been requested by the National Forensic Service to determine the exact cause of the driver’s death.

A 33-year-old man, identified by his surname Lee, stabbed the two senior janitresses at around 8 a.m.Both women were taken to the hospital, however, only one regained consciousness. Police used a taser gun to bring Lee under control. He then claimed to have taken cyanide poison, however, a medical check proved this statement to be false and found that he had been drinking heavily. Lee reportedly told the police in ramblings that he “stabbed  because they had bullied  since childhood.” However, no evidence so far suggests that Lee knew the victims.The police said they have found people who drank with Lee the night before and that they are looking into clues that would link Lee with the victims.According to police investigation, Lee drank with his acquaintances late into the night at a nearby bar. In the morning at around 7:40 a.m., Lee went in to a restaurant on the ground floor of the building saying he came looking for his friends. The restaurant owner threw Lee out, who then broke into another restaurant, stole a kitchen knife, and went into the second floor of the previous building where he attacked the women cleaning the bar. The victims, both 75, had worked for the bar for a number of years. It has not been confirmed yet whether Lee has a psychological condition. The police plan to interrogate Lee and bring him in to detention.By Lim Jeong-yeo","injured after man stabbed ,stabbed the two senior ,police used taser gun ,after man stabbed ,stabbed them with knife","['Anyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee', 'Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52030766  0.28145412

The dominant presumption at the moment is homicide and suicide by the husband, but the possibility of murder by another person has not been ruled out, according to the police.  An investigation from the National Forensic Service found that the Algerian wife, 32, had been strangled to death. Based on this, Gangwon Yeongwol Police said that it was “highly likely” that the husband, 48, killed the wife and hanged himself. The couple’s bodies were discovered on Monday by a passersby who noticed a rotting smell coming from their house. The passerby peeked through the front gate and saw the body of a dead woman in the back seat of a car parked on the front lawn. The police who attended the scene found a man hanging from a tree at the back of the house.Based on the degree of decomposition of both bodies, the police estimate they had been dead for at least a week. No suicide notes were found. The police had initially thought that the woman was pregnant, but the forensic investigation showed that she was not. The dead couple reportedly began renting the house three years ago. They had intermittently occupied the house until recently, when they left the house unattended for a prolonged time. With their contract nearing expiry, the husband had verbally expressed intentions to renew the lease, but he had not made the payment yet. It appeared the couple had refurbished the floor of the house and had the wallpapers redone. The police said it seemed like the couple had planned to fix up the house to move in again but that after a long period of neglect the place was a long way from being fitfor habitation.

According to Yesan Police Station in South Chungcheong Province, the 51-year-old female teacher, whose identity has not been released, was booked without detention for habitually abusing children in a kindergarten attached to an elementary school in Yesan. It was reported by the police that the teacher had been poking a needle into students’ shoulders, arms and the backs of their hands while telling them “it will make you become good kids.”Some of the children at the kindergarten are also believed to have been tied up with duct tape on their arms and mouths because they were pinching each other. The number of mistreated children is estimated to be at least nine among 18 students under the class teacher, the police confirmed, and it will further investigate the rest of the class to see if there are any other offenses possibly committed by the teacher. The indicted teacher has denied allegation of pricking her students with needles, though she admitted that she bound them with tape for disciplinary purposes.But police say there is physical evidence to support the investigation. “We have obtained photos of the kindergarten’s children with needle-stick injuries,” a police source confirmed. “We also have the needles that are believed to be used on the children, and will send the evidence to the National Forensic Service for an expert opinion.” By Bak Se-hwan","punish kids kindergarten teacher ,to punish kids kindergarten ,kindergarten teacher accused ,punish kids kindergarten ,syringe to punish kids","['Yesan Police Station', 'South Chungcheong Province']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25570613  0.10076841

Similarly, another 27-month-old toddler, surnamed Kim, lost all his hair on his body after taking medicine from the same clinic. Kim‘s grandmother said in an interview with local media outlets, “We were told that the medicine should help mitigate the baby’s fever.”Kim initially lost a portion of his hair within a fortnight of taking the medicine, which led to a bald spot the size of a coin on the top of his head. He lost all hair on his body within three months. A five-year-old girl, surnamed Park, also lost all her hair after taking medicine from the same clinic three years ago, local news reports said. Her hair has still not grown back. Park‘s mother’s story was the same as the parents of Kim: “I was told that the medicine should help reduce my child‘s fever,” she said. The clinic continues to deny any accountability, asserting that the cause for the loss of hair can be due to the dysfunction of the children’s immune system and not the herbal medicine.

The mother, 54, and brother, 26, allegedly murdered the 25-year-old victim on Aug. 19, at their residence in Siheung, Gyeonggi Province. According to the police findings, the three family members had been fasting together for five days since Aug. 15 for a so-far unexplained reason.The accused told the police that on the night the daughter died, the three of them had been talking when their poodle starting barking violently which led them to believe that the animal was possessed with a diabolical spirit. The mother and the son reportedly killed the dog first and attacked the victim thinking that the demon had shifted to her.Immediately after committing the alleged crime, the brother called the father and told him what happened. The father, who was away, asked a friend to check on his family who found the decapitated victim and reported it to the police. As the given testimonies are difficult to accept commonsensically, the Gyeonggi Siheung Police are incorporating profilers to map out the psyche and the possible motives of the accused. The investigation so far has revealed that the accused mother had suffered a “spiritual illness” of hearing and seeing things, which is considered among some older generation Koreans as signs of a shamanic calling.According to the superstition, the illness comes from the attempted occupation of the body by a powerful spirit.The ill must accept the god and become a shaman or face horrible consequences for refusing the supernatural, some believers say.

He has a license to use a hunting rifle and keeps one at a police station in the city.A hunting rifle license allows its owner to possess up to 200 bullets, but those are required to be kept with the gun in police custody. Police are investigating into how he got away with possessing bullets and why he took his own life.Accidents or crimes involving guns are extremely rare in South Korea, as guns, including pistols and hunting rifles, are strictly controlled.Only licensed hunters are allowed to own hunting rifles, and still must not keep them at their own homes but at police stations.","gun shop man killed ,killed himself with hunting ,shop man killed himself ,shop man killed ,kills himself with hunting","['south korean', 'Daejeon']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48353913 -0.10831226

The accused, 25, was detained immediately for interrogation. She had reportedly been looking after the child since June after her sister, the mother of the child, found work at a factory away from their home in Naju.The suspect in a death of a 3-year-old boy is being taken in for questioning by police on Thursday. She cited her anger management disorder and mental disability as having triggered what she insists was “spur-of-the-moment” violence. The accused told police she became “angry” with the 3-year-old after he soiled his bedsheets. When she took the victim for a bath, he reportedly vomited. She then forced the toddler’s head underwater. The woman said she attempted CPR on the child, but to no avail, and called emergency medical services for help. While police have asked the National Forensic Service to perform an autopsy on the victim to determine the exact cause of his death, police believe the child drowned. The woman admitted to having also beaten and choked the child prior to his death.Upon discovery, the child had a cast on his arm, which was reportedly broken in July when the woman stomped on it while “enraged for no apparent reason.”Police said the NFS autopsy will provide an idea of how long the abuse had gone on. Depending on whether or not the accused had deliberate intentions to kill the child, she could face a punishment of a minimum five years in jail, a life sentence or death.Police also confirmed with medical authorities that the woman had bipolar disorder and was taking pills to control her mood.  Police said the accused had a medical history of anger control disorder. In July 2013, she was determined to have third-class mental retardation, which applies to people with an IQ between 70 and 75. People with third-class mental disabilities are able to lead a mostly normal lifestyle, albeit with handicaps in learning that may keep them from working. An IQ between 90 and 110 is average.The accused was unemployed and living at a house under her father’s name. She received monthly governmental aid of 510,000 won . By Lim Jeong-yeo","aunt abuses kills year ,kills year old police ,aunt abuses kills ,june after her sister ,abused her year old","['Naju', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Naju']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.91885048 -0.14283367

Such announcement came after its earlier decision to charge both sides with assault caused controversy online.Based on the CCTV footage in which the woman appeared to push the man after she was hit, police officers at the site previously decided they assaulted each other. The police’s decision went viral, even before the woman put up a post online arguing that it was unfair. Her action was widely viewed as self-defense, and online commenters questioned the police decision. “I had to point out somehow that there was an error in the police judgment,” said the woman during an interview with CBS radio news on condition of anonymity. “I did what I had to do and I don’t regret it.” During the Interview, she recounted the confrontation between herself and the man who assaulted her. “He chain-smoked near the entrance to the subway station,” she said. The regulation states that smoking within 10 meters of all subway exits in Seoul is forbidden and punishable by a fine of 100,000 won . “The sign was clearly written on the bottom that it’s a no smoking area. You can’t miss it.” She explained that “I told him that he couldn’t smoke unless he went somewhere else, and he started with all that swearing and seized me by the arm and slapped me right in the face.” She added that “for adults, you can just hold your nose.

The health care worker, who is currently being treated in isolation, had been working at Korea University Ansan Hospital’s intensive care unit for newborns.Following her diagnosis, a total of 51 babies and 57 health care workers are being tested for TB, the KCDC said. An official enters Samsung Medical Center, where a nurse was diagnosed with TB last month. YonhapSince last month, two other nurses in Seoul -- one at Ewha Womans University Medical Center and the other at Samsung Medical Center -- were diagnosed with TB also through regular health check-ups provided by their employers. Notably, both of the health care workers also worked at pediatric units at the medical institutions, one at the intensive care unit for infants and the other unit for children patients with blood cancers.At Ewha, 166 babies and 60 health care workers were tested following the nurse’s diagnosis last month. Among them, two infants and five health care workers were diagnosed with latent TB -- a condition in which the TB bacteria is in the body but inactive and causing no symptoms. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB at some point in their lives.According to the World Health Organization, over 95 percent of TB cases and deaths worldwide are in developing countries. South Korea currently has the highest incidence rate of TB among nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, partly due to the lack of epidemiological research of the disease since the 1950-53 Korean War. It is known that roughly one third of the entire Korean population currently has latent TB. “When we introduced our national health insurance system in 1989, many state-run health centers were replaced by private clinics that focused on treatments rather than epidemiological research on infectious diseases, including TB,” Health Minister Chung Chin-youb said earlier this year.As of 2014, Korea’s TB incidence rate marked 86 per 100,000 persons, about 28 times higher than one in the U.S. -- where the incidence rate of the disease is the lowest among the OECD -- which is 3.1 per 100,000 persons. Last year alone, 32,181 Koreans were newly diagnosed with the disease, while 2,305 died of the disease in 2014.“Many latent TB patients aren’t aware of the disease because they are asymptomatic,” said a doctor at a general hospital who wanted to remain anonymous. “Some TB and latent TB patients find out about their disease while applying for a visa in a foreign country, as many countries require foreign visitors to submit their TB test results along with their visa application.”South Korea has recently seen a number of TB cases at facilities with a large number of people, such as schools and postpartum centers. Last year, TB cases were reported in 974 schools, 332 military bases and 91 day care centers and postpartum care facilities -- where many newborns are placed in a same room together. To tackle the issue, the Health Ministry announced in March that all Koreans would be required to be tested for latent TB at least twice in their lifetime, at age 15 and 40, starting next year. TB treatments became free for all patients in Korea last month. Earlier this month, the ministry also said employees who work at facilities with a large number of people, such as health care workers and school teachers, are going to be required to be tested for TB regularly. Yet it’s the workers’ employers, not the government, that are responsible for financing the cost of the tests, which costs about 50,000 won  per person. The Health Ministry did not allocate any budget for the specific project. Rep. Kim Seung-hee of the ruling Saenuri Party told Health Minister Chung last week that the ministry should finance the cost of the TB test for health care professionals, day care workers and school teachers. Minister Chung said the government will try to allocate a budget for the tests next year.It was during former President Lee Myung-bak‘s administration  that South Korea increased its budget for TB prevention dramatically, from 14.9 billion won in 2010 to 44.5 billion won in 2011. The former president in fact suffered from TB back in 1965, when he was a university student, and was treated for a severe lung condition in 2009, according to his autobiography. This year’s budget for TB prevention is 3.92 billion won.By Claire Lee","been diagnosed with tuberculosis ,diagnosed with tuberculosis just ,tuberculosis just days after ,diagnosed with tuberculosis ,with tuberculosis just days",['the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79947329  0.24820644

The victim’s family said the boy left for the study center that day in his usual bright mood. They say they never pressured him academically. Police said the victim moved schools in March. He reportedly had difficulties making friends in the previous school, but adapted relatively well in the new one. Several schoolmates came to the victim’s funeral to pay tribute and shed tears. Police plan to run an autopsy at the earliest on Friday to determine the exact cause of the boy’s death. The boy’s friends and teacher will be asked to give statements.

The Seoul Seongdong Police said the 28-year-old, surnamed Jeon, had searched for the victim’s private number, bombarded her with over 500 text messages in a week and stalked her in her residential neighborhood and at her workplace.   According to the police, Jeon started expressing his one-sided affection for the 27-year-old victim since January, claiming he was smitten with her photos. The victim ran a Facebook page under her real name to promote the products from the company where she worked. She occasionally posted photos of herself on the page, which was how Jeon found her.The victim said she responded politely to Jeon in the beginning lest she harm the company’s hospitable image. However, when she did not reciprocate Jeon’s wishes to meet in person, Jeon began to send her threatening messages about unsolicited visits. The victim reported Jeon to the police towards the end of June by which time he became very intimidating. Jeon demanded to see the victim at her workplace on June 24 but was deterred by the police who came to the scene.Four days later on June 28, he visited the victim’s residential area and left a message that he came looking for her.Jeon was brought into police custody after publicly saying he would “terrorize the victim.” He reportedly told the police that he had thought the victim was interested in him, too.

She hid the cash in a nondescript paper box only to absentmindedly throw it out along with the trash on Sunday. After belatedly realizing what she had done, the woman ran back to the garbage dump, but waste collectors had already cleaned the area. Six police officers from Goheung County were dispatched to aid the woman in the quest to find her money. The troop tracked down the waste collection truck and found the box containing fat wads of 50,000-won bills in a paper recycling plant. The police attributed the collective efforts of the recycling plant workers and local neighbors to leading to the money’s discovery between stacks of paper waste at the plant.

The victim had children but her ties with them had grown weak since her husband passed away. In January 2014, Seo borrowed 100 million won  from the victim for the first time. He consistently paid her back a monthly interest of 3 percent of the money he borrowed, which helped boost trust in the eye of the victim. He additionally asked for money ten times, giving varying reasons such as for his business and for an emergency. The sum he borrowed added up to 630 million won by September 2015. The victim reported Seo to the police only after he suddenly became unreachable.When police arrested Seo, he had used up all money on an overseas golf trip and the repayment of personal debts.

His wife Park was taken to the hospital but did not survive. It is presumed that Park, 30, had her firstborn daughter on her lap in the passenger seat while the youngest son sat in the back in a child car seat. The toddlers suffered brain hemorrhage and arm and leg fractures. They are currently being hospitalized in Wonju-si. The older child remembers the accident, and is having difficulties sleeping due to the aftereffects of the accident, according to a family member of the deceased couple.The two-year-old continues to cry for her parents, saying “There was a bam, bam.”The younger child, barely a year old, is yet to learn how to speak but senses something terrible has happened, said the family member. Nams’ car insurance company, unidentified, initially refused to give subsidy for the children to be placed under hospice care, citing contract terms.It belatedly extended help after the case gained attention on social media. The company reportedly refuses to provide hospital aftercare fee, claiming they would require a medical statement on the children’s suffering disability from the accident. The Gangwon Jeongseon Police, who is investigating the case, has taken blood samples of the unconscious driver of the heavy truck and requested examination at the National Forensic Service. The police presume the driver had not been dozing, based on blackbox recordings. As the man remains unconscious in a hospital bed, the investigation is currently on a standstill.By Lim Jeong-yeo","car crash kills parents ,their third wedding anniversary ,kills parents two toddlers ,crash kills parents two ,car accident on july","['Nam', 'Park', 'korean', 'Gangneung', 'July11']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8123402   0.33393151

Then she spends about 30 minutes talking ...","For Kim Eun-jin, a 36-year-old working mother in South Korea, being at work is her “break.” She gets up at 4:30 a.m. every morning, leaves for work and returns home at about 8:30 p.m. What awaits after her long commute -- she lives in Incheon and works in Seoul -- are dirty dishes and unfolded laundry. She makes dinner, does the dishes, mops the floor and folds the laundry. Then she spends about 30 minutes talking to her kids -- one 8, the other 12 -- who are looked after by Kim’s mother-in-law during the day. There is no time for rest. She usually goes to bed after midnight. “If I get to live another life, I’d like to live as a single woman,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “I don’t necessarily regret getting married. But I don’t necessarily want to go through it again, either. I’ll admit -- being married and a working mother can be really hard at times. ”Kim is one of 44 percent of South Korea’s married women who think marriage is not necessary for everyone. According to a recent study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, which surveyed 11,009 married women nationwide, 44 percent of the participants said marriage was only optional and not mandatory. Of the total, 6 percent said it is in fact better for women to stay single. Last week, a separate study by the same think tank revealed that 50 percent of Korea’s single women thought marriage is an option rather than a necessity. “I wouldn’t ‘encourage’ young single women to stay single,” Kim said. “But I would tell them to think thoroughly before making their decision. Marriage can throw surprises. And not all of them are good ones.”Researchers said poor work-life balance and lack of financial independence may be the biggest reason why married women feel skeptical about marriage. They pointed out that married women in their 30s and 40s, as well as those with low education levels were more likely to have a negative view of married life. “Compared to women in their 20s or 50s, women in their 30s and 40s are often faced with a situation where they have to juggle child care, careers, and domestic chores all at once,” researchers wrote in the report. “This indicates that those who are the busiest are the unhappiest in their marriage.”Kim said her work continues even on weekends, as she has to cook for her mother-in-law -- who lives with her family and wants her breakfast at 6 a.m. -- while doing other domestic chores. Her husband has longer hours at work and gets home very late. She said she has tried to quit her job once -- despite its potential impact on their household finance -- partly because one of the family members wanted her to stay home and be a full-time mother.  “I often envy my single friends who have a lot of spare time. Going on trips alone or enjoying hobbies are almost unthinkable in my schedule right now,” she said.  Meanwhile, the report showed that highly educated women felt happier in marriage than those with lower education levels. While only 2 percent of married women who have postgraduate degrees said it is better for women to stay single, almost 15 percent of those who never attended high school said the same. According to data from the Korea Women’s Development Institute, the employment rate is higher for married women with high school diplomas than those with undergraduate or postgraduate degrees as of last year. “Our data show that many highly educated women stay as housewives either voluntarily or involuntarily after getting married,” said KWDI researcher Kim Young-ran. “Data also show that highly educated women are more likely to marry high-earning men. The work-life balance may be better for the financially stable, highly educated married women who don’t have to have full-time jobs than those who have both professional and domestic obligations with limited financial stability.”Kim pointed out that Korea’s male-dominated corporate culture does not allow male employees to fully participate in child care and family life. “It’s still unthinkable for male workers to get a few days off at work to look after their sick kids,” she said. “If the work culture does not change, family life won’t change, either. And more women would avoid being married, as marriage in general gives them more work at home and this becomes a disadvantage in their careers. The fact that even married women -- who have the experience of marriage -- don’t exactly recommend getting married, reflects how prevalent sexism is at both home and work in Korea.”Choe In-seong, a 30-year-old who has been married for 1 1/2 years, said that in spite of the hardships, marriage and being a mother have made her a better person. Starting a family with her husband has given her a sense of security, emotional stability and even a peace of mind, she said.“I know it sounds really weird. My life with a baby is actually pretty chaotic. But in a paradoxical sense, this chaotic life gives me a sense of peace -- because almost every problem that I had  doesn’t matter to me anymore,” she said. “What’s important to me now is watching my daughter grow every day, because she literally does something new every day. I’m physically exhausted, but nothing else has been more fulfilling in my life.”But even for Choe, having a child was only possible because she had a job that guaranteed a maternity leave and her return to work, she said. As of 2014, the latest figures by Statistics Korea showed that 22 percent of married women quit their jobs because of child care related reasons, including employers that fire female workers who become pregnant.   “I think if my employer did not guarantee workers’ return after maternity leaves, I may not have chosen to have a baby at all,” she said. ”It’s not just about money. It’s more about my  identity which I have earned through years of efforts. I wouldn’t have wanted to give that up for a child. And I think no working woman should.” By Claire Lee Kim Eun-jin is not her real name.

South Jeolla Province’s Gwangyang police said it booked a total of 11 people on charges of arranging prostitution. Among the booked 11, four were arrested, six were transferred to the prosecutors without detention and one who ran away was put on a wanted list. According to the police, the men and women, some of them married couples, are accused of recruiting six runaway girls aged between 15 and 17 in January and February 2015, and carting the victims around in a vehicle for prostitution.  The main culprit of the gang, whose identity was withheld by the police, raped each new recruit upon their arrival. His wife prepared the victims with make-up and taught them how to receive clients. The gang provided accommodation for the victims at a studio apartment in Gwangyang-si and Suncheon-si and taught them to use mobile dating app to secure men who were willing to pay for sex. Police said the gang lured the victims into prostitution themselves or gave a reward of 1 million won  to those who introduced runaway teenagers to them. The victims were coerced to have sex up to five times a day and were paid between 100,000 won to 150,000 won for each count of prostitution. All the money they made was extorted.The perpetrating adults threatened the victims they would “follow and catch them no matter what” if the victims ran away, and that if the victims alerted the authorities they would also be punished by the law under the anti-prostitution act. The police discovered the gang in a windfall while searching for the whereabouts of a teenager who had run away from home due to sexual abuse by her birth father.

77,77,10-year-old in coma due to oxygen gear glitch,"A 10-year-old girl fell in to a coma due to a glitch in medical support gear while being transported via helicopter, according to a story shared on a community bulletin in North Jeolla Province, July 12.Written by the parent of the girl, the story claimed that the fire department‘s helicopter used to take the girl to a bigger hospital lacked an oxygen supply, which gravely exacerbated her medical condition.  (Yonha...","A 10-year-old girl fell in to a coma due to a glitch in medical support gear while being transported via helicopter, according to a story shared on a community bulletin in North Jeolla Province, July 12.Written by the parent of the girl, the story claimed that the fire department‘s helicopter used to take the girl to a bigger hospital lacked an oxygen supply, which gravely exacerbated her medical condition.  The patient was to change from a hospital in South Jeolla Province to a bigger hospital in Seoul on July 7 when the incident occurred. On the day, the patient waited for the helicopter on the hospital rooftop on a wheeled bed connected to an oxygen tank. The helicopter arrived 10 to 15 minutes late during which time the tank ran out of oxygen. The medical staff connected the patient to a manual oxygen pump and moved her inside the helicopter, however, the vehicle’s oxygen tank was empty.There was a further delay of 10 minutes, with the patient short of breath, before the medics called off the trip and moved the patient back inside the emergency room. According to the parent, the girl had been able to make eye contact and hold simple conversations prior to the botched trip, however, after she ran out of oxygen supply on the rooftop, she lost consciousness and fell into a coma. She was moved to Seoul the next day via road ambulance. The girl’s parent called for justice for her daughter. “How can a helicopter designed to carry patients with serious illnesses lack oxygen in its tank?” The fire department that had dispatched the helicopter claimed there had been six hours’ worth of oxygen in the tank, however, a glitch in a hose may have caused a leak. The helicopter in question had been in service for 7 years and 8 months. It had gone under maintenance on March 16 to exchange decrepit parts. After the maintenance the helicopter was dispatched eight times of which three times it had used the oxygen supply kit. The Central Fire Department is running a self-inspection to discern the cause of the glitch and to follow up with preventive measures for the future.The 10-year-old girl arrived at a local medical center on July 2 after she suffered an abrupt seizure.Her condition deteriorated, upon which she was moved to an intensive care unit in South Jeolla Province up to the day she was to board the helicopter to move to a hospital in Seoul. The doctor who diagnosed the girl in South Jeolla Province said that she had a serious case of pulmonary edema which made her breathing uneasy. She also needed appendix surgery.

She told the police that she had visited the school nurse to ask for details regarding the difference between her daughter’s health examination results from the school and from the hospital, but the school nurse had “responded with a curt attitude,” which led to a fight between the women.

On Monday, SNU’s minority human rights committee and victims’ task force put up a poster accusing eight students of exchanging borderline “rapist” talks about women between February to August in 2015. The poster by the student committee called for the accused to give a written apology with their full names and to undergo human rights and gender equality education. The men allegedly sexually objectified women by passing remarks such as ""Do her with a bag over the head, because she still has nice body” and “I got offered to tutor a lolinee . It would have been better if she were a high school student.” When talking about their schoolmates the men allegedly made comments such as “She really needs to be tied up and beaten” and “politely request her to show her panties.”They were aware of the offensive nature of their language, as some of their conversation had included cautioning each other to keep their words secret. However, during a drinking session last year, one of them had revealed the content of their conversation to a female student who had been one of the subjects of their talk.  The victim had saved a copy of the chat thread, which she recently released following the revelation of a similar incident at another tertiary education institute.The SNU administration said the case is currently under investigation and that the students in question will be punished accordingly based on the results. The victims’ task force said that division among the genders is not their aim, but rather healthier sexual awareness among men and women.A similar accusation surfaced not long ago at another top tertiary education institute, Korea University, causing shock among the public at such behavior. Whether making public the content of private chats is an act that should also be punished is an issue that has not been discussed much, amid ongoing public debate about such incidents.

The toddler was taken to the hospital but did not survive.  According to the Korea Consumer Agency, Koreans should be mindful of the potential fatal accidents that can take place with the cords of window blinds. In June, the agency and the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards published preventive guidelines to warn the parents of toddlers about the perils of seemingly innocuous window blinds.The consumer agency’s inspection of 20 popular window blinds sold online showed that only one brand had attached the required safety descriptive label. Nine products had completely omitted the label, while 10 failed to mark the date of production and other details required to ensure user safety.The agency cited the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s report that in the U.S., out of 285 accidents between 1996 and 2012, 184 children under 8 years old died from suffocation by window blinds’ cords,In Canada, from 1986 till recently, 69 accidents occurred, of which 40 resulted in death. In France, between 2004 and 2014, four accidents occurred, including a 3-year-old’s death. In Japan, between 2011 and 2015, nine accidents occurred and three children died, with two of them 2-year-olds. In Korea, a 7-year-old boy died in 2015 after getting wound up in the cords. Four cases of accidents involving hazardous blinds cords were reported to KCA between 2013 and 2015.KCA and KATS advised households with toddlers to use blinds products without cords, or to tie up the cords at least 160 centimeters above the ground, out of the reach of children.There is also a need for greater attention to be paid to children’s welfare outside of homes. In early July, two children aged 6 and 7 suffered first degree burns on their hands after playing with soil from flowerbeds that were contaminated with chemical detergent waste.

Another police officer was dismissed for paying for sex, according to Seoul Geumcheon Police, Wednesday. Prostitution is illegal in Korea. Members of the group of retired and incumbent police officers offered public apology, Wednesday. Gwangju Bukbu Police said the officer who was on a probationary period is being accused of raping a middle school student in mid-May after acquainting the student through a smartphone dating application. The victim immediately filed a report with the police, prompting an investigation. As soon as the case was forwarded to prosecutors, the Bukbu Police sacked the accused officer on the grounds that he tainted the honor of public officials.  Members of the group of retired and incumbent police officers offered public apology, Wednesday. Seoul Geumcheon Police said a 37-year-old officer surnamed Kim paid to have sex with a woman he met via a mobile dating application in April. The police found Kim’s mobile number in an arrested prostitute’s phone and called for an investigation. Kim disappeared without appearing for police interrogation, only to turn up a month later on May 18 to admit his wrongdoings. He said he had run away for fear of punishment.Prosecutors decided to suspend the indictment on Kim, taking into account that he has no previous record of malpractice, however, the police decided to fire Kim for setting an unsavory example in his position as a watchdog for prostitution.

In the announcement Tuesday, Cheongju District Prosecutors’ Office said the 4-year-old victim died at the abusive hands of her birth mother, and was buried in a deserted area of a mountain in Jincheon County, North Chungcheong Province, by the stepfather on Christmas day of 2011. The mother, surnamed Han, had killed the victim by forcing her head underwater in the bathtub after she failed to control her bladder. The couple hid their crime with a chain of lies, telling others that the child was away at her grandparents, or that they sent her to an orphanage because of financial problems. Their lies were uncovered in March, when the victim’s school contacted the police about her three-year absence. Han killed herself immediately after the police investigation was launched. In her suicide note, she admitted her guilt and directed all blame toward herself.The stepfather, surnamed Ahn, aside from aiding in the desertion of the victim’s body, is also accused of psychologically and physically abusing Han and the child when they were alive. The CDPO claims Ahn hit his wife and stepdaughter on a habitual basis.In the final trial for the case, Ahn’s lawyer pleaded for mercy, saying he had repented for his crime, and had done his best to maintain peace within the family when the child was alive. Ahn said he “had wanted to report the accidental death of the child straight after the murder, but chose not to as Han was 9 months pregnant at the time.”Public ruling on Ahn’s case will take place on July 19.By Lim Jeong-yeo","stepdaughter killing prosecutors ,in stepdaughter killing prosecutors ,stepdaughter killing prosecutors have ,his dead stepdaughter ,year old victim died","['Cheongju District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Jincheon County', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Han']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.01079774  0.5282985

The GMOE said the middle school teacher, 37, punished the student for applying tinted lip balm and was accused of violence by the pupil’s father.Applying make-up is actively discouraged for teenagers within the Korean academic curriculum while direct corporal punishment was banned from Korean schools by the government in March 2011. This is a stock image and not the image of the lip balm used by the student in this article. Some form of indirect corporal punishments -- having students bunny-hop or stand at the back of the class with raised arms -- still remain commonly condoned.While each side’s testimony differ on the degree of corporal punishment involved, it is clear that a physical punishment did take place, according to the GMOE. The case will be passed to the relevant action committee to penalize the teacher.In previous court rulings, some of the punishments that were regarded against the law included: “emotional punishment by the teacher stemming from the students disobeying instructions,” “emotional punishment by the teacher who claims to have felt humiliated by the student’s puerile actions,” “kicking with the heel of the shoes, or other such demeaning punishments,” “hitting an 11-year-old with a wooden stick 50 centimeters in length and 3 centimeters in diameter,” “hitting the student’s head with a stick” and “leaving irrevocable aftereffects on the student by hitting the shoulders, arms and head with a mop” and more.

Park has been mired in a scandal as four different women, all working at local bars, lodged complaints against him in June, claiming they were raped by him. One of the cases dates back to 2014, while the latest allegedly occurred in early June.The woman who filed the first complaint on June 10 has dropped the case, but Park made a counterclaim, saying she falsely accused him of sexual assault. Monday's complaint was charged against the second woman who filed charges.Park's agency has been asserting his innocence, staking his career and reputation on the line. The 30-year-old was summoned by the police in southern Seoul over the weekend to be questioned on the allegations.

Gangwon Province Chuncheon Police said she is accused of conniving in the cohabiting man’s abuse against her son.  Jeong The 23-year-old mother surnamed Noh came to live with the 33-year-old surnamed Jeong on May 17, after meeting him over a chatting application. While Noh worked at night, Jeong stayed at home and looked after the child. He was taking time off odd jobs he worked since suffering an injury. On Friday night, Jeong came home drunk and found the toddler had soiled the floor. Jeong cleaned up after the baby, but when the toddler did not stop crying, he threw him twice against a wall and wardrobe, the impact of which killed the 3-year-old. In the investigation that ensued, police found traces of bruises on the dead toddler’s face separate from those that resulted in his death. Jeong confessed he had hit the baby several times for not being potty-trained. Noh, despite being aware of the abuse, took no actions against Jeong to protect her son. She belatedly learned of her son’s death, a day after he died, only when Jeong relayed to her what had happened. Police plan to apply a charge of violation of children’s welfare law on both Jeong and Noh and refer the case to prosecutors, at the earliest on Thursday.

According to the Seoul Dobong Police, the men are accused of attacking two middle school students in September 2011, when they were high school students. The accused reportedly discovered the underage victims drinking alcohol and threatened to report them to school authorities.According to police, a few days after the encounter, a group of 10 suspects summoned the victims at night to a wooded hill where they coerced the victims into drinking.When one of the victims lost consciousness, four suspects allegedly raped her. A similar attack involving forced drinking took place a few days later, police said, this time with a group of 22 suspects, 6 of whom are accused of committing rape. The other 12 either conspired in the wrongdoing or attempted rape but failed when the victims resisted. The victims reportedly suffered post traumatic stress and depression, and had difficulties sustaining regular lives. One of them halted her studies and went into hiding. The suspects on the other hand were found to have gone on to college or held jobs, leading otherwise average lives up until their arrest. The police said they discovered and tracked down the crime while investigating a separate case in which three of the suspects were involved. Of the 22 suspects, four were arrested for rape while six were booked without detention for conspiring in the violence. Twelve other suspects who are accused of rape are currently serving compulsory military duty, and will be referred to military judicial institutes once the police investigation is complete.

During an investigation into the captain, whose name was withheld, the 48-year-old man confessed that he had bought them shortly before the boat left the port of Donggang in China's Liaoning Province around 5 p.m. on June 9, they said.The captain, who purchased the drug and the inhaler from an acquaintance for 240 yuan and 20 yuan respectively, is suspected of inhaling the stimulant three times when the boat sailed near the Northern Limit Line, the inter-Korean de facto western maritime border, this month.He has also administered the drug about 10 times in China since last year, they said. ""I used the drug in secret at the pilothouse to beat fatigue,"" he was quoted as saying. He tested positive in a urine test for the drug.The Coast Guard plans to book the Chinese man without physical detention on charges of suspected violation of the illegal fishing control law concerning Korea's exclusive economic zone. In addition, it will book him on suspicion of violating the drug control law.The Chinese fishing boat carrying five crew members traveled in waters southeast of Socheong Island south of the NLL around 6:33 p.m. on Thursday before being captured by the South Korean Coast Guard. Illegal fishing by Chinese fishermen is a troublesome issue in the country as it has severely damaged the livelihood of Korean fishermen operating in the Yellow Sea.Chinese fishing boats often cross into Korean waters in the Yellow Sea during peak crab season in search of bigger hauls, regularly leading to crackdowns by the Korean Coast Guard.","illegal fishing drug use ,illegal fishing drug ,alleged illegal fishing drug ,fishing boat was arrested ,captain of chinese fishing","['chinese', 'inter - korean', 'the Korean Coast Guard', 'Socheong Island', 'Incheon', 'Seoul']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.48956466 -0.35008225

The courtroom temporarily set up on the second floor of the Sorokdo National Hospital in Goheung County, South Jeolla Province, was packed with some 90 patients, their families and spectators mostly in their 70s and 80s. Witnesses, judges and members of the media look at facilities during an appeal hearing at Sorokdo National Hospital in Goheung County on Monday. A 74-year-old plaintiff, surnamed Jeon, testified that medical staff at the state-run hospital forced her to undergo an abortion in 1965. “I got pregnant at the age of 23 while secretly dating my husband at the hospital. When hospital staff found out that I was pregnant, I was stripped off of my clothes and had no choice but to remove the child so as not to be kicked out of the facility and to marry my husband,” said Jeon, who was sent to the leper island at 17. “I was given no medication or treatment after I received the operation without anesthesia. I lost so much blood.” Sorokdo Island became a destination for Hansen disease patients in 1916 under the Japanese colonial rule. The patients were segregated and forced to undergo abortions and sterilization until the 1990s, based on the belief that the disease could be passed on to the children. But the disease is only mildly contagious and is curable.In 1935, sterilization and abortion operations became a precondition by law for marriage and cohabitation between male and female leprosy patients. Nam Jae-kwon, a 74-year-old ex-leper and resident of the Sorokdo Island, had to see his wife receive abortion at a different hospital in Jeonju only for them to be able to get married.“Did we have a choice? No. I was not able to marry my wife until I showed medical staff proof that she had the surgery,” Nam, who was taken to the island at the age of 13, told The Korea Herald in front of the hospital. “It is not a matter of money. We want the government to admit its wrongdoing and restore our honor.” The hearing comes a year after the lower court ordered the government to pay between 30 million to 40 million won in compensation to the leprosy patients who alleged the state-led abuses on the island and at other medical facilities.  It marks the first time for judges to visit what has become known as “a leper colony” since Hansen disease’s patients first filed a compensation suit against the government in 2011. Now, a total of 539 victims are involved in five suits pending at the court. “The nation violated individuals’ privacy, rights to pursue happiness, start families and protect their bodies,” the court said in the ruling, acknowledging the state’s responsibility for forced abortions and sterilizations. But the government appealed the decision, saying that it did not force the patients to undergo such operations. Kim In-kwon, a director of Yeosu Aeyang Hospital, who looked after Hansen’s patients for 30 years, took the stand as a witness to back the government’s claim. “I have never heard or seen any abuses on leprosy patients while working at the Aeyang Hospital since 1962,” said Kim. “Frankly, there was not the manpower, legal grounds or budget to allow the patients to give birth to babies. We only conducted the sterilization surgeries on those who agreed to them.”“The lives of the leprosy patients would have been more difficult if they had refused the surgery and lived outside the hospital. I only did what I thought was right for the patients,” he said. “It is not right to judge what was done by modern-day standards.” Park Jong-myeong, who represents the government at the court, maintained that the surgeries were not forcibly performed. “The accused  are in fact those who have looked after the leprosy patients for their whole lives,” he said. “The sterilization and abortions were encouraged as part of the nationwide drive for birth control.”Later in the day, judges examined the facilities where leprosy patients were detained. Dead bodies were dissected and abortions and sterilizations were conducted. Lee Nam-cheol, a Hansen disease’s patient, guided the judges, lawyers and reporters around key spots on the island for about an hour to help them better understand the Hansen disease patients’ suffering. “It is a little bit scary. ... We don’t come here often because you know ... it brings back the painful memories,” Lee said, shivering in the drizzling rain. Now, leprosy patients are granted 150,000 won every month in living and medical expenses regardless of their income in accordance with a revised act to support leprosy sufferers. Park Young-rib, a chief lawyer representing leprosy patients, called on the government to admit to its illegal acts of forcible abortion and sterilization to heal the wounds of the patients. “Through this suit, we would like to sound an alarm to society to prevent a recurrence of the government’s illegal acts.” By Ock Hyun-ju","hansen patients testify at ,139 leprosy patients judges ,monday to hear case ,scene hansen patients testify ,hansen patients testify","['GOHEUNG', 'South Jeolla Province', 'south korean', 'the Seoul High Court']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36093387  0.33508813

Five men from the infamous website had wrongly identified a different teacher from the same school as the victim, and circulated her photo as acquired from the school’s website. The teacher has since resigned from the school, citing severe psychological distress from the false identification. Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said the five were charged for defamation based on the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection. The agency’s cybersecurity team plans to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the case. In early June, a female teacher dispatched to Shinan County, South Jeolla Province, was raped by three local men, two of whom were parents of the students at her school. The suspects were caught and DNA evidence pointing toward their guilt was collected. The three men were forwarded to the Mokpo branch of the Gwangju District Prosecutor’s Office.

The Busan District Court found two online community leaders, respectively surnamed Lee and Song, guilty of falsely advertising cosmetic surgery clinics by pretending to have received procedures there, bagging a total of 600 million won  in return.The court said that many patients who contemplate cosmetic surgery make their decisions through online tips, and that the accused had spread distorted information that damaged the fairness of medical services. Lee and Song were given 10 months and six months in prison, respectively, with two years of probation. Six cosmetic surgeons who paid for the false promotion were each fined between 3 million won and 5 million won for violations of medical law. Their licenses remain unaffected, and a month’s suspension of clinical operations can also be paid off, allowing the surgeons to see patients freely upon settling the fines. To this lenient punishments, the public is voicing concerns and calls for transparency in media reports to reveal the names of the clinics.

According to the footage, the suspects visited the residence several times by car and exchanged phone calls.The suspects denied the charges. Two of the suspects’ DNA matched the evidence collected from the victim’s body.The case has prompted the government to lay out measures such as the installation of CCTVs and reinforcement of security forces in rural areas.

103,103,[FEATURE] Elderly victims overlooked in disinfectant tragedy,"It took Ryu Jae-wook several years to bring himself to apply to the government for a health probe over the death of his father who had regularly used a toxic humidifier disinfectant.

Although the government accepted such applications from product users over four separate occasions since 2011, with the latest one currently underway, Ryu deliberately ignored such information, telling himself that his father died of old age not from using the disinfectant. His father passed away in June 2006, and he had shown symptoms of pneumonia since 2003. He was exposed to Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s product Oxy Ssak Ssak from 2001, which was most used by victims recognized by the government.“I was the one who poured the toxic chemical into the humidifier in my father’s room every day. I didn’t want to admit that I killed my father. I kept telling myself that he didn’t die because of the disinfectant,” Ryu told The Korea Herald. Families of the toxic humidifier disinfectant victims look at LED candles in an event held to remember the 266 dead victims at Seoul City Hall on Sunday. YonhapEvery winter, Ryu had put more than the recommended amount of the chemical into his father’s humidifier, believing that the cleaner the humidifier, the better it would be. Even when his father was hospitalized for pneumonia, the son never forgot to put Oxy Ssak Ssak into the humidifier next to his bed. For years, he had kept the nagging secret that he believed was the cause of his father’s death, even from his sisters. However, the 53-year-old teacher at a private education institute, finally decided to come forward to apply for the fourth round of the health probe after witnessing Oxy’s apology. “Seeing the head of Oxy superficially apologizing right before the prosecutorial probe, I thought that it was not right. I decided to check whether my dad died of old age or not,” he added.“I confessed to my sisters that I had used the disinfectant for our father. They didn’t know anything about the disinfectant use. After telling the truth, I felt much more at ease.” He also joined the class-action lawsuit against the disinfectant manufacturers and the government, along with other victims and their families. “There must have been many elderly disinfectant users who didn’t realize its impact on their health and just died,” Ryu added. While infants and their mothers are known to have been the most vulnerable victims to the toxic humidifier disinfectants, the health damages suffered by elderly victims is relatively overlooked, with many having died. Since 2011 when the toxic impact of the disinfectant was first revealed, a total of 530 users, including 146 who have died, applied for the first two rounds of the public health probe that checks the causality between health damages and disinfectant use. According to the Environment Ministry, 221 of them were classified in the top two categories which officially recognize the disinfectants’ impact on lung health, with only three elderly aged 60 or above included. Most of them were infants or women. The government is conducting the third-round probe on 752 additional users while receiving the fourth round of health probe requests from other potential victims. A total of 1,057 users have applied, as of Wednesday. The number of elderly among them has not been disclosed.Only recognizing the health damages of three senior patients does not mean that the elderly were not affected by the toxic chemicals, experts said.The immune system of the elderly is much weaker than adults in general, which suggests that they are as vulnerable to chemicals as infants, according to Leem Jong-han, an occupation and environment medicine professor from Inha University.“Considering that the disinfectants were used in many sanatoriums, a large number of the elderly could have been exposed. Yet, in many cases, the sanatorium patients would have just suffered from their underlying diseases and passed away, without realizing the disinfectant’s impact,” added Leem, who also heads the Korean Society of Toxicology. “The damage scale of the elderly may be much larger than infants. It’s just that many cases are not revealed or detected.”  Since 2004 when the humidifier disinfectant was first developed by a local company, about 600,000 products were sold every year for seven years until they were withdrawn from the market in 2011. Considering that the number of disinfectant users is estimated to be around 9 million, the potential victims could reach up to 2.7 million, said civic group Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health. As of Wednesday, 2,339 users have reported their health symptoms to the civic group, with 464 dead. This includes the number reported to the government. Seoul Asan Medical Center’s survey also showed that, 31.3 percent of the entire Korean population could have been exposed to the disinfectant chemicals.  “As the disinfectant tragedy tends to focus on infants or females, the concern for elderly victims is relatively lower. Although they are physically vulnerable to toxic chemicals as much as infants or pregnant women, there is prevalent social prejudice that the elderly group is not as important as others as they are considered to have lived enough. That’s why many elderly victims are not reported,” said Choi Ye-yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health.Yoo Yeong-seok, 71, is one of the disinfectant users who participated in the first round of the health probe. Having used Oxy’s product from 2004 to 2009, he started to have difficulties breathing and doing vigorous activities starting a year later. Despite these sudden symptoms, he was classified into category 4, the group that is considered to have suffered little health impact, due to the strict classification criteria. What stresses him out the most, apart from his current health, is the sense of guilt that he feels about his 97-year-old mother who passed away in 2010. “I used to place a humidifier in her room and put the disinfectant into it every day. She soon started to complain about itchy skin. Thinking that it was caused by dry skin, I moved the humidifier right next to her head, and injected more disinfectant,” he said. While others speculated that she died of old age, the son stressed that the disinfectant was the culprit, citing the longevity of his family members. “Although she was in her 90s, she was so healthy that she enjoyed hiking. There was no reason for her to suddenly suffer a lung problem.” He has not filed his mother’s case to the government, citing issues with preparing the documents.  “I’m a son who killed his mother. How could this happen? I still pray every night that she forgives me,” Yoo said. Experts highlight that more attention should be paid to grown-up children who have lost their parents due to disinfectant use, as many of them tend to keep their sorrow to themselves and live with the guilt. “Aside from financial support or compensation, various measures are necessary to console and support them so that they can at least have mental and psychological compensation. Many are likely to feel reluctant to express their emotions, thinking that the deaths were their fault,” said psychologist Kwak Keum-joo from Seoul National University.

He found nothing in her pockets. In his initial testimony to the police, Kim had said that he “intended to kill the first person he met in the mountain,” raising suspicions of yet another misogynistic unprovoked murder amid a spate of similar crimes recently.

The soldier, only identified by the initial “S,” was given an 18-month prison sentence with three years of probation by Suwon District Court for sexually assaulting a female restaurant owner who had been asleep at her empty shop in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province.  The court said the sergeant broke in to the restaurant on Oct. 17, 2015 at around 5 a.m., where in a small side room he found the sleeping woman. The sergeant took down his pants, sat the woman on his lap and attempted to kiss her. The court said the woman, 41, was traumatized. However, she was ultimately able to reach a settlement with her assailant. Taking into consideration his previously clean record, the court ordered him probation. Korean law recognizes those who were given probation in a criminal case as targets to be deported.

The 45-year-old police officer surnamed Park was traveling with his wife to Cebu, Philippines, when he was stopped at Gimhae Airport security check as ammunition was found in his wife’s bag.  The rusted bullet was for a 38-caliber revolver. It had no serial number. The police determined Park had no intention of carrying out a terror attack and allowed his family to leave for Philippines, forewarning an investigation once he returns from the trip. The promised investigation took place on Wednesday as soon as the couple returned.The police suspect the ammunition may belong to Park. However, Park said he believed his wife found the bullet in the small hill behind the apartment the couple lived in 10 years ago. She had kept the single bullet in the drawer of her vanity table. Park guessed the bullet must have accidentally fallen into his wife’s purse as she was packing for the overseas trip. One of the policemen involved in the investigation said, “Although Park’s report is unconvincing there is no way to prove it otherwise” because the bullet was missing its serial number.  Following Park’s testimony, only his wife will be booked under the charge of illegal possession of ammunition. According to Korean law, possession of live ammunition is punishable even if the act was by negligence. The police station where Park is stationed is running a regulatory check on him on the side.

According to the Incheon Bucheon district court on May 19, the woman told her lawyer that “she had repeatedly had unwanted sexual relations with her older sister’s husband,” stressing the damage of the crimes she suffered was graver than prosecutors let on.  The accused rapist is 25 years the victim’s senior.Prosecutors had only acknowledged three cases of sexual violence against her as rape -- twice at the assailant’s country house in Wando, South Jeolla Province, when the victim visited in August 2008, and once in Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, in 2013 at a new apartment where the victim later joined her sister’s family in cohabitation.Prosecutors suspected the older sister knew of the sexually coercive nature of the two’s relationship, but lacked a normal level of intelligence or integrity to intercept and protect her younger sibling. The older sister also had two children with the accused.  The prosecution found both sisters to be intellectually disadvantaged and lacking in self-protective mechanisms.Starting from 2013, the victim had given birth to three children to her assailant. The prosecution, however, only acknowledged the sexual violence that led to the first child’s conception. This was partly due to the victim’s inability to clearly recall the times she had been raped. In the most recent meeting with her lawyer, the victim spoke with more clarity, saying she had regularly been coerced into unwanted sex with the accused, and that the brother-in-law had used force to overpower her.The accused admitted to raping the younger sister in court, although he did not specify the number of occurrences.

The owner of the blue vehicle parked in the residential area of Gonghang-dong, Seoul, near Gimpo International Airport, was in for a surprise when police discovered a dead woman’s body splayed across the backseat of his car.  He reportedly did not know the deceased 56-year-old surnamed Lee, and said his car had been parked in the same spot for over a week. A black box recording retrieved from another car that had passed by the parked vehicle at 3:45 p.m. on the day the body was discovered showed no noticeable movement inside the car. Five hours after the footage was recorded, the car was surrounded with police tape and marked as a crime scene.Police have so far found no evidence pointing to a homicide.

The police said that while the suspects continued their silence at an on-site inspection on Sunday, making it difficult to gain more insights into the case, they were talkative with other inmates that shared their cell. At mealtimes, the 43-year-old brother had reportedly responded animatedly to the food he was served.  “There were times I was hungry but had nothing to eat so much so that I put seaweed slices in water to let them bloat before I ate them,” said the man, according to the police. “If I had eaten as well as I do here now, I would never have suffered from tinnitus.” The suspect also let slip to the police that he had once attempted to take his own life by swallowing a few hundred medicine pills. However, the man became angry when the police probed further. The case will be passed on to the prosecution, along with the acquired evidence and test results, around Tuesday. The brother tried to show his face to the media. Although no substantial progress was made during Sunday’s on-site inspection, the police did find the victim’s bank account balance book and house deed documents hidden beneath a sofa.The siblings, who were present during the police’s discovery, had grown visibly angry although they did not explain why they were upset. The police later found out the suspects spoke to their cell inmates, accusing the authorities of attempting to steal their money. Several people close to the victim have testified that the siblings had tried to extort money from their father. The police are suspecting money as the key murder motive.According to article 1004, clause 1 of Korean civil law, those who murder or intend to murder someone related to inheritance are deprived of their right to it.

It showed a middle-aged driver forcing two Chinese women to get off his cab for refusing to pay extra fare. “I know you, every time. Every month we’re here, you say no ,” shouts one of the women, to which the driver responds “I’ll hit you, you disrespectful .” He was seen shouting profanities several times, particularly at the woman who recorded the incident and his car registration plate with her phone.A 31-year-old man surnamed Ma, who identified himself as the husband of one of the women, said his wife has had similar experiences over 10 times. According to him, the incident took place at Dongdaemun shopping district at around 4:30 a.m.“It is common for Chinese people to be rejected  at nighttime. ... My wife even paid 30,000 won  for a 4,000 won fare,” he said. He said his wife – a 30-year-old woman surnamed Wang -- was even threatened to be hit by one of the drivers.“Generally the drivers, who have a fixed fare among them, give a card that says they will charge extra at nighttime. Foreigners give up complaining and just pay the fare,” Ma said.Hailing a cab late at night is often a daunting task, with many drivers cherry-picking passengers to maximize profits. Around the busy districts of Dongdaemun, Gangnam and Itaewon, taxis asking potential passengers where their destination is and driving away without another word is a common sight.According to the Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission, 47.9 percent of such cases occur between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., while 99 percent of cases take place in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport last year introduced a “three-strike rule” for drivers caught refusing rides, stripping third-time offenders of their taxi permit.Those who have been refused rides can call Dasan Call Center at 120 to report the incident. The reports can be made in Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Mongolian. By Yoon Min-sik","cursing at chinese women ,korean taxi driver refusing ,video cab driver caught ,taxi driver refusing chinese ,video cursing at chinese","['korean', 'chinese', 'chinese']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52057147  0.00252613

The two are exercising their right to remain silent. During a police interrogation on Tuesday at Gwangju Bukbu police station, they refused to wear masks in front of the press claiming they had nothing to hide as they are innocent. The police were forced to cover their faces for them. In Korea, disclosure of a suspect’s identity is only allowed if the crime is of a violent nature, such as murder or rape, with ample evidence pointing to the suspect’s guilt and provided the suspect is of legal age.A police officer who wished to remain unnamed said that the victim’s body had been mutilated beyond recognition and that prior to their arrest, the police had naturally assumed the suspects to have had a spiteful relationship with the victim. According to police reports, the siblings had planned to run away after committing the crime. Two days prior to the murder, they had asked their landlord to return the deposit on their home and reserved a date with a moving company.Both were unmarried and had moved out from the victim’s house roughly seven years ago, in 2009 after their mother passed away due to a traffic accident. On Sunday, the day of the crime, they had arrived at their father’s house and waited for him to return from a female friend’s house. It was not revealed whether they had scheduled to meet him for Parents’ Day. Surveillance camera records showed the victim arriving at his apartment at around 8 a.m.An hour later, the siblings were recorded leaving the apartment in different clothes. The police said the body had been found inside the house, at the bottom of a giant rubber basket with layers of blankets placed on top to mask the smell. So far, the police investigation has revealed that the sister had reported abuse by her father in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, she had on two occasions succeeded to acquire injunctions to keep him away. She has a record of working as a missionary at a church, however, she had not been active there lately. Her brother had studied for a government position for a long period, according to those who knew him. The victim’s female friend had testified that the deceased had stayed at her place for refuge after having been allegedly threatened by his son to hand over his house deed.By Lim Jeong-yeo","siblings murder father on ,siblings murder father ,police interrogation on tuesday ,murder father on parents ,siblings murder",['Korea'],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30036023  0.2125258

Jo, 30, appeared for his arrest warrant hearing without a mask covering his face. His name and other details were revealed after the warrant was issued. Jo's Facebook account is now deactivated. The police said the degree of brutality of the crime and the provided evidence that pointed to Jo’s guilt gave them grounds to respond to the public’s rights to know.His personal life leading up to the alleged crime has since been dug up and has gone viral online.The police’s decision rekindled debate over revealing the identities of suspects before they are tried, with some pointing to the authorities’ lack of consistency in their decisions.The special law on punishing violent crimes was revised in 2009 to allow disclosure of a suspect’s identity in cases that involve violent crimes, such as murder and rape, with ample evidence backing suspicions and provided the suspect is not underage. The grotesque murder of a 40-year-old man surnamed Choi had come to light after a tourist at Daebudo Island found a gunny sack in a trench containing the severed lower-half of the man’s body on May 1. An intensive police investigation involving more than 900 policemen as well as a couple of drones and boats ensued, leading to the discovery of the upper half of the body at the island’s northernmost wharf on May 3. A surveillance camera had recorded footage of Jo by himself at the wharf unloading an object believed to be the body from a rented vehicle and deserting it. Police detained him on May 5. In the police interrogation, Jo reportedly testified to having shared housing with the victim at Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, to save on costs. The two had gotten acquainted at an inn where Jo had been manning a counter. Jo initially testified that he had only accidentally committed the crime in March after Choi repeatedly belittled him for being younger and ordered him to clean their flat. However, further questioning led him to confess that he had premeditated the crime after Choi verbally abused him by insulting his parents. The police are looking into whether there could have been other motives or accomplices, as the violence Jo inflicted on Choi is uncommon for a first-time offender. In the latest confession, Jo said he had used a hammer he had prepared in advance to assault the sleeping Choi. The police said that Jo then kept Choi’s body in the flat’s bathroom for over 10 days during which time he carefully dismembered it into two halves for separate disposals. Choi’s body was found with collapsed facial bones and rib cage, with multiple stab wounds on his chest, arm and buttock. Jo had not fled from the flat afterwards, claiming he had been unaware that he was wanted as he only watched movie channels on TV and not the news. The police said it was unusual for a person who is as active as Jo on social media to not keep tabs on the developments of a crime he was involved in. They will continue to investigate for missing details.Those acquainted with Jo said in news reports that he had no outstanding conflicts in his social life. He had graduated from a high school in Uijeongbu and matriculated to a university in Seoul. He had reportedly run a pet cafe in his Uijeongbu neighborhood, but business went sour after his then-girlfriend allegedly ran away with vital assets. Jo’s Facebook account showed he had been worrying about his future career even after he had committed the murder.The police’s decisions on revealing the identities of suspects have often swung back and forth.In a previous case, a couple who was sentenced to prison terms in April for abusing their 7-year-old son to death and deserting his body had their identities protected, except for their last names, ages and the general area of their residence, despite the angered public’s demands to know their personal details. Those in favor of revealing suspects’ identities cite the need to send a message against violent crimes and the right for the public to know. Those against it point to the principle of innocent until proven guilty.By Lim Jeong-yeo","police on saturday arrested ,daebudo murder suspect full ,on saturday arrested jo ,murder suspect full identity ,saturday arrested jo","['Jo Sung - ho', 'Daebudo Island', 'Gyeonggi province ’s', 'Ansan', 'Jo', 'Jo']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74572939 -0.04317676

According to the police, the victim was yet to be reported missing, which led the police to assume he had no family or had separated.The National Forensic Service determined the victim’s primary cause of death to be the blows he received to his head. His facial bones were broken as well as his rib cage. The victim had marks of five to six gashes on his head and arm, and a stab wound as deep as 5 to 6 centimeters on his right buttock.Based on the marks of multiple assault, the police presumed the perpetrator to be an acquaintance who held resentment against the victim.The investigation will continue around the victim’s circle of acquaintances from work and his residence.

Although he had been reported for suspicious acts on multiple occasions in the past, he was only arrested after being caught in the act while filming through the gap between the floor and the toilet partition in February.  This is a stock image. The victim, 25, said she spotted the camera lens pointing up at her from the ground and let out a scream which her boyfriend heard from outside the bathroom and witnessed the man in subway uniform running out.The couple protested at the station office, but the man claimed he had only entered the women’s bathroom to fill in the toilet supplies. He had removed the sim card from his cell phone, making it impossible to check the photo album. Surveillance cameras revealed no concrete evidence of his crime. The case investigation was expedited however, when the enraged couple reported the case to the police, who discovered the man had been accused of similar crimes many times in the past. An emergency arrest of the man revealed more than 60 incriminating videos on his mobile phone. It was later revealed that the man had an ex-girlfriend who left him upon finding out his crimes and he underwent behavior corrective education programs. He continued to breach the law however, leading to his arrest on Monday.

Berkenkotter also said the victim, Michelle Wilkins, as well as her family and the community needed Dynel Lane, 36, to express remorse. Lane murmured a ""no"" when the judge asked if she wanted to speak. Lane also did not speak in her defense during her trial, which ended in February when jurors found her guilty of attempting to kill Wilkins after luring her victim to her home with an ad for maternity clothes.Jurors had heard that Lane went to elaborate lengths to feign her own pregnancy before attacking Wilkins. They did not hear that in 2002, Lane's 19-month-old son drowned in what investigators ruled was an accident. Relatives who spoke on Lane's behalf before the sentencing Friday said her remorse over losing her son may have led her to take an action they could not understand or explain.Lane's attorneys did not dispute that she attacked Wilkins, but they argued there was no evidence it was a calculated murder attempt. They urged jurors to convict Lane of the lesser charge of attempted manslaughter.Berkenkotter sentenced Lane to 48 years for attempted murder and 32 years for unlawful termination of a pregnancy. The remainder of her sentence was for assault charges in the attack. She was given credit for the more than a year she has served since her arrest.Kathryn Herold, the public defender representing Lane, told the judge Friday she would appeal and that Lane had the right not to speak. Berkenkotter acknowledged that was Lane's constitutional right. But the judge said that in weighing her sentence she had to take into account that ""people are hungry to hear from you, Miss Lane. Hungry, desperate to hear you express genuine remorse from the bottom of your heart.""Prosecutors said they were unable to charge Lane with murdering Wilkins' unborn girl because a coroner found no evidence the fetus lived outside the womb. That led Colorado Republicans to introduce legislation that would have allowed a murder charge. Democrats rejected the measure, the third time such a proposal failed in Colorado. Over the objection of abortion-rights supporters, 38 states have made a fetus' killing a homicide.Wilkins focused on her unborn daughter Friday. She placed a large photograph of her dead baby, who appeared to be sleeping, on an easel next to the witness stand, then asked Berkenkotter to impose the harshest possible sentence.Wilkins said after the sentencing that she saw the hearing as a day in court for her daughter, who she named Aurora.""Judge Berkenkotter was clearly listening to everything that we were saying,'' Wilkins told reporters, adding she felt justice had been served.In court, Wilkins had directed her words to Lane, who sat straight and showed no emotion as her victim spoke. Lane cried later in the hearing when a letter from one of her two daughters expressing love was read. Lane's mother apologized in court to Wilkins and her family, as did her father in a letter his wife read.Lane had posted online photos of herself with a distended belly and sent the man she said was the father of her child ultrasound images downloaded from the Internet. David Ridley, who lived with Lane and her two daughters, testified at trial that Lane claimed for more than a year that she was expecting a boy, whom they planned to name James. Friends even threw a baby shower.Ridley had grown suspicious by the time Lane lured Wilkins to her Longmont home. Wilkins testified they chatted for about an hour before Lane hit, pushed and tried to choke her, then used two kitchen knives to cut the baby from her womb.When Ridley came home early from work that day to meet Lane for a doctor's appointment, he said he found the fetus in a bathtub and drove the child and Lane to a hospital, where she begged staff to save her baby.Lane said nothing to Ridley about Wilkins, who was unconscious at her home. Wilkins regained consciousness and called police.","friday sentenced colorado woman ,100 years in prison ,colorado woman gets 100 ,sentenced colorado woman who ,sentenced colorado woman","['BOULDER', 'Colo.', 'AP', 'Colorado', 'Maria Berkenkotter']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7934683   0.38565513

She wants to be a painter, teacher, owner of a big supermarket, florist, designer, scientist, and more.Every day, she wakes up and goes to school by 8 a.m. When school finishes at around 2 p.m., she briefly plays with her friends in the playground until she goes to her private lessons for piano, computer classes and English.“When the lessons are over at around 4 p.m. I am free. I invite friends to my parents’ stationery shop and play. I really like spending time with my friends,” Lee told The Korea Herald in a cheerful, high-pitched tone. As Children’s Day -- May 5 -- is just around the corner, Lee cannot wait to go on a picnic with her friends and open a gift from her parents. “I would love to receive a doll from my parents, but I don’t know what they will get me,” she said. “I want to own a big supermarket, then I can have anything I want!” Statistics suggest that kids in Korea today enjoy a higher quality of life than in any other generation, but they are the least happy among children in the developed world due largely to academic stress and fierce competition at schools. Lee said she also started to feel pressured about studying and taking after-school classes. “When I have fun with my friends, sometimes I don’t want to study or go to after-school classes.”According to 2015 data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, child poverty in Korea has decreased since 2007, with only 7.7 percent of children aged 18 or lower living in households with a disposable income of less than half the Korean median income. In terms of children’s health, the rates of infant mortality and low birth weight are below the OECD average. Korean children’s academic achievement is notable, with students aged 15 to 19 ranking second in the OECD in reading and first in problem-solving using computers. But Korean children’s happiness and satisfaction with their lives were among the bottom, scoring 90.4 compared to the OECD average of 100 according to Pang Chong-hwan Foundation last year. The survey was conducted on 7,536 students aged 19 and younger. The highest score was 119.4 by Spain. Among primary school kids, 14.3 percent felt suicidal, followed by middle school students at 19.5 percent and high school students at 24 percent. A 25-year-old primary school teacher, who wanted to be identified only by her surname Jang, said that children are very “busy” these days, enjoying less time to play and explore. “Their life is different from mine as a child. They are very sensitive about exams and they are used to competing against each other,” said Jang, who has taught sixth-graders for three years. “With parents overly passionate about their children’s education, most of the kids take extra private lessons, mostly to improve math and English … and at least two or three cram schools until the night.”“On Children’s Day, many of my kids said they would go to private institutes for extra study.”According to Statistics Korea, 68.8 percent of the children took private education in 2015, spending 5.7 hours on average per week. Just over 17 percent said that their free time did not last an hour. A lack of balance between work and life for Korean parents is also blamed for more children going to cram schools -- an option for parents to keep them safe and less lonely. Korean parents work for an average of 2,124 hours per year, the second highest among the OECD countries. The latest data by the OECD shows that Korean children spent only 48 minutes daily with their parents last year. A growing use of smart devices has also changed the children’s lives, especially in how they form relationships and learn social skills, Jang pointed out. “As many kids go to after-school classes until late at night, social media such as KakaoTalk or Skype has become a key tool for them to interact with each other,” she said. “Communication, getting to know each other and bullying all take place online.” “I hope that my students grow up as warm-hearted people who are willing to help each other rather than compete against one another.” Calls are also rising for society to better protect the rights of children, particularly in the time of increasing child abuse cases.According to the Health Ministry, the amount of child abuses including negligence has steadily increased from 10,943 in 2012 and 13,076 in 2013 to 17,991 in 2014.“Parents and children seem to talk less these days in nuclear families. They interact less with each other face-to-face due to wide use of smartphones,” said Lee Bae-young, a professor at Sungsan Hyo University. “The lack of interaction leads to mental health problems such as depression, but they don’t know where to seek help.” Yet, as South Korean women have 1.24 children in their lifetime, less than any other OECD member countries, many loving parents tend to spend more money than ever on their children. The trend created a new term “gold kids” referring to only child being brought up like royalty in their families. Businesses are busy rolling out products and services for children including furniture and cars with more safety measures, luxurious toys and fashion items and IT devices which can locate their kids. In 2015, the country saw a 12 percent increase in spending from a year earlier, but spending on children’s products soared by 81.3 percent.By Ock Hyun-ju","child attending primary school ,supermarket florist designer scientist ,every day she wakes ,the playground until she ,big supermarket florist designer","['Lee Seo - hyun', 'Namyangju', 'Gyeonggi Province']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59016669  0.5861209

Her business requires her to work during weekends and even on national holidays. Her husband goes to work at a manufacturing firm six days a week.After Kang heads to work at 8 a.m., her son Dong-woo is taken care of by a nanny she hired three years ago.For Kang, this year’s Children’s Day will not be so different from any other day. She asked the nanny to come in despite it being an official holiday, as she found it difficult to take the day off.“Taking a day off to spend time with their kids is someone else’s story, perhaps it’s for those who work for big conglomerates. Doing so is difficult for workers at midsized companies or small business owners,” Kang said.There are currently 5.2 million working parents in Seoul alone, and many struggle to find a balance between work and family.National holidays are worse for such parents who are desperate to find reliable people to take care of their kids as child care centers remain closed.“It is not just about the physical challenge, but also emotional ones, as I constantly question myself whether all this is worth it. I constantly feel tremendous guilt for spending so much time on my career while basically leaving my children in the hands of others,” said Lee Jin-hee, 39, who is a manager at a firm in Seoul. “I charge through day by day assuring myself that one day my children will grow to respect what I have achieved not just as their mother but also as a person.”South Korea’s long working hours have been one of the key factors that hinder constructive work-family balance and consequently the low birthrate. Korea had the second-highest average number of working hours at an average of 2,124 hours among the 34 member states of the OECD.A report released by Seoul Foundation of Women and Family earlier this year showed that married couples’ struggle for compatibility between work and family can be attributed to several social factors.The report stated that purchasing a home, securing a career, saving up for the future and surviving culture still biased against working mothers all contribute to their struggle to spend time with children.A mother of a 2-year-old girl who is currently on her year-long maternity leave said she was already afraid to go back to work in June.“I thought the one-year maternity leave would be long enough for me and my daughter. I will now have to face the reality that I will have to spend more time at work than with my daughter for our family’s future,” she said, adding that she is thinking of hiring a full-time nanny who can eat and sleep with her daughter.The government has been implementing various measures to help working parents, in line with its fight against the low birthrate. They include child care subsidies for families with multiple children, prioritized enrollments of toddlers and children of working parents at child care centers and incentives for companies that provide flexible paid child care leave.The government’s emphasis on encouraging more fathers to engage in child care has also been paying off, albeit slowly, with the number of fathers taking paternity leave rising. The Ministry of Employment and Labor said that 1,381 men took child care leave between January and March this year, up 57.3 percent from the same period last year.Many working parents, however, still saw a lot of room for improvement.“I try to contribute as much as I can to find more time to take care of my daughter, but I have to admit, I depend on my wife to be the prime caretaker while I try to achieve my end of the bargain to become more successful,” said Yoon Jin-seo, the father of an 18-month-old girl working in architecture.According to the Statistics Korea’s data in 2015, 9 in 10 married women living in Seoul said that they were mainly responsible for the housework. Korean fathers recorded 45 minutes of daily chores at home, the shortest among OECD countries as of 2015.“Working parents in Korea are exposed to long working hours. Although both mother and father are exhausted after work, mostly it is the mothers that are stressed out from having to take care of their children,” said Hong Seung-ah from the Korean Women’s Development Institute.“Equal gender roles must be first established in order to find work and family compatibility at home, since there is no longer a big gap between men and women’s role in society here.”By Kim Da-sol","working parents struggle to ,nanny she hired three ,wedding shop in gangnam ,working parents struggle ,national holidays her husband","['Kang Ji - hye', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'Children ’s Day']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.861871    0.04999998

Her daughter only wanted to spend time outdoors -- all day, every day. She’d sit on her stroller and cry nonstop until Lee would take her outside, even if it was two o’clock in the morning.“So I’d take her on a stroller walk at 2 a.m., and just walk around the neighborhood until she fell asleep,” said Lee, a former teacher who now raises two children. “And I’d very carefully take her back to her bed, trying my best not to wake her again.”For about six months that year, Lee almost literally lived with her daughter outdoors. She fed her in the playground. When there was nothing else to do after many stroller walks, they watched children going in and out of school together. “And then the monsoon season came,” she said. “It was only after she was soaked in rain a number of times -- which she did not enjoy -- she slowly started losing interest in being outside all the time.”Mothers take a government-run class on parenting in Gwanak-gu, Seoul. Lee is one of some 20 mothers who are taking classes on child care provided by the Gender Ministry in Gwanak-gu, Seoul. The former elementary school teacher has been taking such classes for several years, since her first daughter was born.“I read a lot of books on parenting before my first child was born,” she said. “But when you actually have your baby, you face countless unexpected situations that none of the books you read can help. I would have never guessed that my daughter would not want to stay inside when she turned 18-months-old. Many times you need hands-on help and advice from real people.”Education for parentsWhile Lee has benefited immensely from the classes, it is only this year that the South Korean government started actively encouraging new parents to attend educational programs on child care. The decision has been partly in response to the increasing number of reported child abuse cases in the country, with 80 percent of the abusers being the children’s parents.Statistics say Korean children are unhappy about spending a significant amount of time alone after school. Korea scores low among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of children’s happiness and life satisfaction. A survey released by the Gender Ministry revealed that more than 35 percent of elementary school children spend time alone after school, while 63.7 percent of them live with a single parent who has no caretaker to look after them when they are alone at home.Mothers take a government-run class on parenting in Gwanak-gu, Seoul. Among the 10,027 young Korean child abuse victims reported in 2013, 14.6 percent of them were infants aged 0-3. The report by the Health Ministry said that being exposed to abuse during the first four years of one’s life can be particularly dangerous, and it can severely damage a child’s social development and leave life-long psychological scars.Abusive or neglectful behavior toward infants include limited physical contact with the child -- such as no kisses or hugs or other signs of affection -- and failing to bathe or feed the baby regularly.“I think education is needed, because a lot of the times parents may be unaware that they are actually abusing their children. You may think you are disciplining them or even helping them,” said Lee Young-min, an expert in child development who teaches at government-run child care classes.“That is why you need education. Being well-aware of your own personality as well as your child’s temperament can help you prepare better for unexpected situations, and prevent you from unreasonably blaming your own child for something they should not be blamed for.”For example, Lee explained in her class that most toddlers to act very stubborn at 18 months, as it is when they begin to realize they are an individual, not just an extension of their parents. It is also at 18 months that toddlers start recognizing themselves in the mirror.“But when the parents do not have this information, they may think their child is just being unbearably difficult. And this can really negatively affect their relationship with the child,” she said.Stress factorKim Soo-jeong, a 42-year-old mother of two, recalled a moment when she couldn’t control her stress and screamed at her first child. It was just about 15 days after her second child was born.“My mother was helping me with postpartum recovery as well as in taking care of the newborn and my first daughter, who was three at the time,” she said. “But my mother became ill after the first 10 days, and I was left to take care of both kids all by myself while I hadn’t fully recovered from the delivery.”It happened when her 3-year-old kept littering toys all over the floor, over and over again. “And she would keep tearing off a poster from the wall, after I put it back up numerous times,” she said. “That’s when I lost it and yelled at her: ‘Didn’t I just tell you to stop?’”Lee Young-min said it is important for parents to actively seek help when in need and rest as much as they can whenever they have time. Managing one’s own stress is crucial for parents when dealing with young children, she added.Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who have marriage stress or struggle financially are more likely to abuse or neglect their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University. Along with stress, the social isolation of a parent from having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization.Lee said one of the important aspects of being a parent is to learn about his or her own personality as well as their weaknesses. For example, if one is an emotionally sensitive person, they should be aware that they are more vulnerable to stress than others, and remind themselves that this can negatively affect their children.Without this process, many parents may end up being angry at their children for “just being children.”“Some kids are just really physically active, while some parents prefer to stay home and read,” Lee said.“If this is the case, you have to acknowledge that the difference between you and your child may cause conflict. If you don’t know this, you just end up yelling at the child for making you exhausted all the time. But when you think about it, there is nothing wrong with children being active. They are just being kids. Know your own personality and preferences, and carefully study how they are different from the ones of your child. Knowing this can reduce your chance of neglecting your child’s needs.”Compatibility issuesExperts say it’s a myth that all parents -- especially the mothers -- “naturally” love their children unconditionally. Lee said personality differences can be stressful not just between married couples, but for parents and their children as well.For example, when a parent is spontaneous and enjoys improvising while the child does not enjoy unexpected or new situations, it can be stressful for both, Lee said. “In this case, the parent can be seen as inattentive to the child,” she said.“It can be very stressful for the child because he wants things to be ready and planned in advance. The child may feel anxious that the mother may forget to help. Such children also don’t really enjoy going to new places. They actually have a lot of fun when they visit their favorite place they’ve been a number of times. But for a spontaneous parent, it may feel like the child is just too picky or not adventurous enough.”Lee said it’s always the best to accommodate children’s preferences according to their personality, instead of forcing them to do something they are not interested in. “Say a child is an introvert and enjoys solo sports,” she said.“Then you should let him swim, instead of making him take basketball lessons because you want him to be more extrovert and be a team player. There is nothing wrong with being an introvert, as there is nothing wrong with being an extrovert. What’ s important is that the children feel like they are accepted and loved the way they are.For example, when an active child is discouraged from doing activities and is asked to behave differently, he or she may grow up into an individual who is unfocused and easily distracted. But when children’s active qualities are appreciated and accepted, they are more likely to end up becoming considerate and highly social and engaged persons, she said.Motherhood and careersKim Soo-jeong said after taking parenting classes, she lets her daughter litter toys around the house as much as she wants.“I realized that she just likes them all littered on the floor. That’s how she likes it for some reason,” Kim said. “In the past, she’d cry when I organize them for her, asking me to put them back to where they were. So now I just let her be and have fun, but make sure she cleans the room in the end. I came up with this idea of ‘cleaning game,’ so she doesn’t think of it as an ordeal.”Lee Ji-seon plans to go back to work in 2018. In total, she would have taken 6 years of break from her career. She said she doesn’t regret taking a long break and doesn’t feel insecure about being a teacher again. “I don’t think of it as a disadvantage,” she said. “May be it’s because I’m a school teacher. But regardless of your job, I think there is invaluable lessons one can learn from being a mother. It expands your life into something bigger, something more meaningful. I think being a mother will only make me a better teacher.”South Korea is notorious for its long work hours, which often separate parents -- especially the fathers -- from their children. Lee said her husband quit his job back in 2014 to be a full-time parent, along with Lee. They are currently relying on their savings accumulated for 10 years before having the first child.“I think the best gift parents can give children is their time,” Lee said. “We have no regrets.”Yet not many Korean parents have the option of taking parental leave or quitting their jobs indefinitely to commit to child care. From 2010 to 2014, the number of double-income households increased from 27.9 percent to 31.2 percent.“I think what Korean parents need the most is flexibility to spend time with their children,” she said. “Allowing us more time is the best way for the government to help us with child care.”By Claire Lee","her daughter turned 18 ,unexpected situation her daughter ,daughter turned 18 months ,her daughter only wanted ,learning when her daughter","['Lee Ji - seon', 'Lee', 'Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60844171 -0.15645941

The body of the dead woman, 22, was discovered by a man gathering bracken near a barley field in the city of Seogwipo on South Korea's largest island of Jeju on April 13. It was partially covered by grass and soil, and badly decomposed.The woman, who entered South Korea as a tourist on Oct. 7, 2015, and overstayed the visa-free period to work, left the same fingerprint as the one collected on her immigration records.The police combed the area near the barley field on April 13-14 for any possible belongings but found nothing. A ray of hope was given the next day, when a coroner extracted the fingerprint, which was left intact about four months after her death, in an autopsy. It prompted police to scurry to the immigration office to do a cross-comparison of her fingerprint with those of foreigners who arrived on the island.On Friday night, the police successfully determined her identity with the help of the immigration office and found out she is a Han Chinese from the southern part of the country.Earlier this week, the police arrested a South Korean male suspect in connection with the murder but released him because of a lack of evidence.The suspect was a regular customer at a bar where she was working before she went missing around the end of last year.The Chinese woman was confirmed to have arrived on the South Korean island in October last year by taking advantage of the country's visa-free entry for Chinese tourists that allows foreign tourists aboard cruise ships to enter South Korea and stay here for 30 days without a visa.She is believed to have been dead for less than four months, because the owner of the barley field did not see the body when he planted barley seeds in December and January.","slain chinese woman police ,chinese woman found dead ,of slain chinese woman ,woman found dead ,slain chinese woman","['chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'the Seogwipo Police Station']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72767514  0.02268323

The young migrant worker used to work for the African Art Museum in Pocheon, which later made headlines for their appalling working conditions for African workers in 2014. Her employer neither took her to a hospital nor paid for her medical expenses when she cried for help. Foreign workers attend a rally calling for protection of their rights in 2014. “I took a bus to a hospital and paid for all the expenses. I told my boss that I had to get surgery. But my director forced me to dance although I was injured, threatening to send me back home,” Maria told The Korea Herald. “I knew that I could not carry on dancing and I might lose my legs. So I just escaped.”Four years on, she still suffers from the injury, as she could not receive an operation in time. Last year, she belatedly came to find out that she could claim recompense from the government for her work-related accident. “I submitted all the medical records, but I could not receive compensation. It was already too late,” she said, saying she had no access to know about the insurance scheme.Like Maria, migrant workers in South Korea are exposed to a higher risk of work-related injuries because most of them came under the Employment Permit System and are employed in so-called “3-D” jobs -- dirty, difficult and dangerous -- left vacant by local Koreans.As per the latest available statistics, among the nearly million foreign nationals employed in South Korea, 18,034 foreign workers sustained work-related injuries over the 2012-14 period. Among them, 270 workers lost their lives. In 2014 alone, 6,044 foreign workers were injured at work and 85 died. More than half of those injured were Chinese of Korean descent, followed by other Chinese, Vietnamese, Uzbeks and Sri Lankans. Most of them were injured being stuck between machines or from falling. Nearly 60 percent of the industrial accidents took place in the manufacturing industry, followed by 22.3 percent in the construction sector. Just over 87 percent of work accidents took place at small and medium-sized enterprises with less than 50 staff members. “I believe that the rapid influx of foreign workers here and poor working conditions without safety measures at workplaces are reasons behind the rising incidence of industrial accidents,” said Chun Sang-heon, deputy director of the public relations team at the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency. The agency is in charge of promoting safety at workplaces and carrying out on-site inspections. It has also been working to better protect the rights of foreign workers. “Also, cultural and language difference could be factors,“ Chun added.Under the Labor Standards Act and the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act, the Labor Ministry offers compensation to Koreans as well as foreign workers when they suffer work-related injuries. They can apply for it without their employers’ consent. But foreign workers find it difficult to receive compensation due to language barriers, low awareness of the scheme and irresponsible employers who try to cover up the accidents, local activists pointed out. “Migrant workers are not aware that it is their right to file for compensation when they sustain injuries at work,” said Shekh al-Mamun, deputy head of the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union. “Even if they know about the scheme, most of them think the process is complicated and that they need to hire brokers or labor attorneys to apply for it.” The Bangladeshi official at Korea’s first migrant workers’ labor union also noted that unregistered foreign workers illegally staying in the country are even more vulnerable to work-related injuries. “Unregistered migrant workers fear possible deportation. So they tend to stay quiet,” he said. “Also, many unregistered workers are hurt or die during the regular crackdowns by immigration officers. But the state does not recognize such injuries as occupational.”Korean employers are reluctant to report the foreign workers’ occupational injuries to the authorities due to possible disadvantages they may face, a counselor at migrant workers’ support center said. “Employers instead force their workers to sign waivers and give them some money for medical expenses,” said An Soo-un, a counselor at Gimhae Support Center for Foreign Workers. Under the law, employers should pay more into the state-run employment insurance scheme in accordance with the number of industrial accidents. If they are marked as having a high incidence of occupational accidents, they are more likely to be disadvantaged in winning bids for public projects and hiring foreign workers. “The foreign workers are more exposed to the risk of occupational accidents as they are mostly hired in small factories without enough safety measures,” he said. “When accidents occur, they have trouble in explaining the occupational nature of their injuries in Korean.”Go Ji-woon, a human rights lawyer, noted that hospitals should also be more cooperative in helping foreign workers to apply for compensation. “Without employer approval, hospitals tend to refrain from performing medical procedures or providing medical reports needed to apply for compensation,” said Go, who helped seven migrant workers receive compensation for work-related injuries. “For unregistered migrant workers, some employers seem to feel no obligation to help them get compensation or medical treatment,” she said. “They just threaten migrant workers that they will report their illegal stay to the authorities.” MTU official Mamun pointed out that the difficulties in claiming compensation for foreign workers shed light on the need for stepped-up efforts to prevent industrial accidents in the first place. “Foreign workers receive three-day training before they start their jobs, but this should be made longer and  practical,” Mamun said. “It would be helpful if government agencies can do more to go around factories and show videos to teach workers how to prevent industrial accidents.” The KOSHA said it plans to continue reinforcing their support for migrant workers and their rights.The agency has been offering training about preventing occupational accidents at work to both employers and foreign workers upon request at factories and migrants support centers.“We lowered the number of industrial accidents from 2.66 per 100 workers in 1987 to 0.5 in 2015 for Korean workers,” Chun said. “In the fast-changing labor environment, KOSHA will work harder to improve safety conditions at work for migrant workers.” By Ock Hyun-ju","accidents plague foreign workers ,25 year old dancer ,leg injuries after falling ,work accidents plague ,work accidents plague foreign","['Maria', 'West Africa', 'the African Art Museum', 'Pocheon', 'african']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66066366  0.03525985

There they illegally consumed alcohol and took turns in violating the intoxicated girl. When the girl did not return home that night, her father reported her missing. The police found her the next morning at the goshiwon with three boys and used condoms. The boy who had invited the girl confessed to the group’s wrongdoings.

The killer, surnamed Kim, had wandered around a college campus and the adjacent Eodeungsan Mountain with a knife, before coming across a trekker and brutally murdering him at around 5 p.m. on Monday.The victim was a 63-year-old man surnamed Lee who had been resting on a rock with his mobile phone. Kim attempted to forcefully take the phone from Lee, and when Lee fell over, stabbed him nine times in his neck, chest, back and thigh.  Kim revisited the crime scene on Tuesday. When revisiting the crime scene with the police on Tuesday, Kim had claimed that the victim had tried to alert the police with his phone to have the man locked up in jail or a psychiatric ward. Kim asserted that the victim’s resistance had been “dangerous” and that he had bit the man’s hands to save himself. After committing the murder, Kim tried to check the call log on Lee’s phone, but as he did not know the security code he tried keying in random numbers. When the phone suddenly connected to a police emergency hotline, he stomped on the phone, breaking it to pieces.On his way down the mountain, Kim ran into more trekkers, whom he also threatened with a knife. “I couldn’t trust anybody. They all looked like they wanted to kill me,” Kim said. Kim has been taking pills for a disorder for thirty years but had stopped taking the medication since January, around the same time when he quit his job related to electric utilities.Two days before committing the crime, Kim had visited a psychology clinic with his family. When he was recommended to be hospitalized, Kim had run away from home. He took a 20-centimeter knife from a greenhouse near the mountain and wandered into a nearby university where he found a military uniform and changed into it. The next morning he went to the mountain with the knife hidden in his sleeve, and encountered Lee. The police arrested Kim within thirty minutes of his crime, after pursuing him over a 1-kilometer distance in the mountain.By Lim Jeong-yeo","man who murdered trekker ,old man who murdered ,trekker and brutally murdering ,on tuesday the killer ,brutally murdering him at","['Kim', 'Lee']",16,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.27196267  0.30325869

The Seogwipo police found the body Wednesday following a report from a man who found the decayed body. Although the decay prevented the police from determining the exact time of her death, they presumed she died no more than four months ago based on the testimony of a nearby farmer who had planted barley between December and January without noticing the corpse.The woman had been stabbed with a sharp object six times on her chest and neck. Preliminary autopsy revealed her neck wound as the direct cause of death.The police said they dispatched 80 policemen to search a radius of 5 kilometer for lost belongings without any success.The search, however, revealed that there were no special signs of struggle, leading the police to think that the victim had been murdered elsewhere and moved to the field. Seogwipo police said they made an urgent request to the National Forensic Service for a DNA test to discern whether the victim had been sexually assaulted, which could help track down the perpetrator.The police are currently analyzing the surveillance camera records while also inquiring for eyewitnesses. The woman was found near a barley field in Andyeok-myeon, Seogwipo.

But she is having difficulty breathing, as the broken rib has sparked an infection in her lung, government officials said.Her transfer to Seoul was scheduled after a team of doctors from the hospital visited her early this month for her diagnosis and judged it would be no problem to move her to South Korea.When Ha is moved to Seoul, she will be accompanied by a four-member medical team from the South Korean medical institution as well as her daughter and granddaughter.Gender Equality and Family Minister Kang Eun-hee said in a statement, ""We'll ensure she will get enough treatment to make a fast recovery.""Ha is the only former sex slave in China who keeps her South Korean nationality, they said. Two other victims of Japan's wartime sex slavery in China are Korean-Chinese.At the age of 17, she was forced to serve as a sex slave in Wuhan for Japanese troops during World War II. Even after Japan's defeat in the war, she did not return to her home country, according to her family. She lived in South Korea for a few years after recovering her South Korean citizenship in 1999, but returned to China because she had no living relatives in her home country.Historians estimate the historical number of sex slaves at about 200,000, with less than 45 South Korean victims alive today.","injured korean ex sex ,korean former sex slave ,pelvis last month after ,korean ex sex slave ,and broke her rib","['South Korea', 'south korean', 'China', 'Ha Sang - sook', 'Wuhan', 'China', 'Hubei Province', 'the Ministry of Gende']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1405188  -0.14816828

They had been living on government subsidies at the time.Following the husband’s orders, the wife had taken a man she met in Dongdaemun to a motel room in July 2015. When the heavily intoxicated man fell asleep straight away, she stole his money and cell phone. She took photos of her private parts and sent obscene messages to her husband’s friend, later claiming them as evidence of her being raped. However, the police investigated and had the woman prosecuted in December 2015 for false accusation, robbery and manipulation of evidence. She pleaded guilty and claimed she had acted under her husband’s directions. She was sentenced in February to one year in prison.The husband, who has been on the run, was indicted on Thursday. A person from the Prosecutor’s Office who claimed knowledge of the case said that nothing regarding the wife’s verdict will change, but if the couple had been simultaneously prosecuted, the husband could have been given probation.By Lim Jeong-yeo","wife as prostitute man ,out wife as prostitute ,allegedly sells out wife ,25 year old wife ,man to extort money",['Seoul'],16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.86492157 -0.14634724

According to the study released on Wednesday by a child rearing policy research center, a survey of 478 mothers and fathers with disabled children showed that 32 percent of them felt that there was a lack of specialized educational centers.Among the respondents, 21 percent wanted more financial support from the government, 19 percent wanted medical treatment support and 7 percent wanted visiting nurse services. The report gathered that an average of 6 million won  was spent annually to care for a disabled child, of which more than half went to medical treatments.Government subsidy per child came up to 2.6 million  won on average, 44 percent of the total fee.  The center’s report also underscored a correlation between the parents’ income levels and their desire to educate their disabled children. Households with monthly income of less than 2.6 million won  had a 24.4 percent rate of request for expansion of educational centers, while those with more than 4.7 million won  of monthly income had a 43 percent request rate. From these educational institutions, 46 percent of parents wanted their children to develop social adaptability, 27 percent wanted language development, 11 percent wanted acquirement of basic daily habits, and 7 percent wanted cognitive development. The report said the parents took an average of 14.5 months to have their children officially diagnosed after initial signs of abnormal behaviors.Out of the surveyed parents, 39 percent said they had trouble accepting their children’s disability while 32 percent said they struggled to find relevant information and required services.

She testified to the police that she had “exploded at seeing the boy growing up to resemble his father, the brother-in-law that ruined everything.”  The woman has been under police investigation for killing her nephew, now allegedly her son, on March 15. When the boy returned home from nursery school and refused to listen to her order to take out his lunchbox from his bag, she kicked the three-year-old five times in his stomach, resulting in his death. The Gimpo Police said they have requested for an arrest warrant for the 51-year-old brother-in-law who is presumed to be the dead boy’s father.While the suspect denies the sexual abuse, rumors of his wrongdoings were widespread in the neighborhood, according to the police.By Lim Jeong-yeo","woman who killed nephew ,raped by her brother ,raped by her older ,killing her three year ,her older sister husband",[],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82071948 -0.21197844

I was going to give the new baby the same name,” said the 38-year-old father surnamed Shin. The 38-year-old Shin wanted vasectomy reversal after his abused son's death. According to the Prosecutor’s Office, Shin called a urology clinic on Feb. 3 to book a surgery, while the body of his dead 7-year-old son Won-young still lay neglected in the veranda of the house. The couple later removed and buried the body in the mountains.This fresh piece of information evoked public disbelief and disgust.“The only person Won-young could rely on for protection against his stepmother’s abuse was the father, but Shin sought for vasectomy reversal as soon as Won-young died,” said enraged Seo Hye-jeong, the vice representative of Council for Families of Child Abuse Victims. Shin had stood by when his 38-year-old wife by second marriage surnamed Kim locked up his son in an uninsulated bathroom during winter. Kim starved the boy, beat him, and occasionally showered him with ice-cold water and chlorine bleach. Shin Won-young was 7-years-old at the time of his death. When Shin would use the toilet, Won-young faced the wall without saying anything. For three months the boy hung on to his life. Shin testified that the dying boy moaned for “mother” minutes before he drew his last breath. Although Shin saw that his son was in a critical state, he closed the door on the boy.Kim and Shin were indicted on Monday for first-degree murder, unlawful disposal of human body, violation of Child Welfare Law and Punishment for Special Cases of Child Abuse, by the Pyeongtaek Branch of Suwon District Prosecutors’ Office.By Lim Jeong-yeo","wife had booked vasectomy ,rebirth of murdered son ,booked vasectomy reversal surgery ,father of abuse victim ,murdered son the father","['Shin', 'Shin']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78248912  0.31038398

I was in the 1st squad, but a couple of squad leaders in the 2nd squad raped every single one of the low-ranking female soldiers,” Lee testified. Others attending the event also testified to the appalling state of women‘s rights in the North. Especially due to the dire economic situation, more and more North Korea women are slipping through the Chinese border for work, with also more being caught and facing severe consequences. Once captured in the North, the women are sent to prison camps, where sexual assault and rape are believed to be widespread. And for those who return pregnant, forced abortions have become state policy.“The Chinese consider them to be illegal immigrants and repatriate them to North Korea where they are imprisoned for having crossed the border without the permission of the authorities,” David Hawk, author of “The Hidden Gulag”  told the United Press International in 2015. “That‘s a nonpolitical offense that’s being criminalized. Thousands of women are in penitentiaries for crossing into China,” Hawk said.One defector, Kim Eun-mi, who worked as a railway attendant, said in the conference, “women crew members often fell victim to sexual assault and rape, which was common in trains carrying soldiers, especially in the evening when lights were turned off.” Kim also mentioned that she worked under a squalid condition where female crew had to “reuse sanitary pads that were already solidified .” Choi Su-hyang, a former nurse in the North Korean Army, left the country for the South in 2014. She pointed out that 30 to 40 percent of the North‘s military personnel are women, who are often raped and assaulted by superior officers. Adding to the sexual assault, she added, most military soldiers, both males and females, suffer from malnutrition, and are at high risk of contracting diseases like hepatitis and tuberculosis. The women’s human rights group on that day lashed out at the North Korean regime, saying the abnormal state should stop infringing on women’s rights.By Bak Se-hwan","rape abuse female soldiers ,abuse female soldiers in ,abuse female soldiers ,soldiers exposed to rape ,rape abuse female","['North Korea', 'north korean', 'New Korea Women ’s Union', 'Lee So - yeon', 'Seoul', 'International Women ’s Day']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41042912  0.04581887

Arthur John Patterson, 37, denied his involvement in what is known as the “Itaewon murder case,” saying that he was only a witness of an “unexpected” murder. His lawyer accused Edward Lee, 37, of killing Cho, citing the blood stains on his shirts.  Arthur John Patterson’s attorney Oh Byung-joo heads to court to attend the appeal in Seoul on Tuesday. “I was young and stupid. My first reaction was to get out of the place. I was scared and I was not thinking,” he said, when asked why he ran away and attempted to get rid of the knife without reporting it to the police after the murder. “I should have gone to the authorities, but he was my friend. It was not my idea to destroy the evidence.” A lower court sentenced Patterson to 20 years in jail -- the maximum term for suspects aged 18 or younger at the time of murder -- in January for stabbing Cho to death in April 1997 at a Burger King outlet in Itaewon, an area of Seoul commonly frequented by expats. The court found Lee guilty of inciting Patterson to kill the victim. It recognized Lee as an accomplice, but did not convict him according to Korea’s double jeopardy rule. The rule bars an accused from standing trial over the same charge for a second time, even if new evidence comes to light. In 1998, Prosecutors indicted only Lee, who was then 17 years old, for murdering Cho. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was later cleared of the charge for lack of evidence. Patterson, who was also 17 years old, was handed down an 18-month jail term on charges of eliminating evidence and possessing a dangerous weapon. He was freed after serving a year in jail in an annual amnesty. As prosecutors failed to renew his travel ban, he returned to the U.S. in 1999.In the hearing, Patterson, who appeared in a sky-blue prisoner uniform at the Seoul High court, actively defended himself, saying that the trial has been “unfair” for him. “My concern is a fair trial for me. If I cannot reach anybody and ask what happened 20 years later. It is not fair. It is not right,” Patterson said in front of some 60 spectators including the victim Cho’s mother and Lee’s father. “Why is it that my side is not allowed to summon  Park Jae-oh but prosecutors can bring in anyone they want?The remarks came after the judge dismissed Patterson’s request to call in Park Jae-oh, a former prosecutor who investigated the murder case in 1997, as a new witness. “The prosecutor did not witness or experience the crime, but only investigated it. It is not appropriate to ask him about his judgements and personal opinions,” the judge Yoon Joon said. “He will not help find the truth. Please respect the court’s decision.”But the court accepted Patterson’s call to bring in his former friends and ex-girlfriend from the United States as witnesses in the upcoming hearings. The victim, Patterson and Lee were the only three people who were at the crime scene. But neither Patterson nor Lee were found guilty of the murder at the time, leaving the case unresolved for almost two decades.The prosecution opened a fresh investigation into the murder in 2009, charging Patterson as the prime suspect of the murder. The U.S. citizen was arrested in Los Angeles in 2011 and was extradited to Korea last September.

Concerned for the safety of her current boyfriend, who was inside the apartment, the door to which was now ajar, the woman alerted the police. More than 40 police officers, including a special response unit, attended the scene. The two men had fought physically in the apartment, during which a glass bowl was shattered and blood was spilt. The soured former-lover threatened to hurt the woman’s new boyfriend and take his own life. During the standoff, the man demanded cigarettes and asked the crowd to stay quiet.

According to the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office, a medical checkup has suggested that the 28-year-old man is not mentally ill. The checkup was done as prosecutors had faced difficulties in investigating the murder case due to his unusual behavior in a prison cell. The man is seen inside a prison cell at a police station in this file photo. The man killed a 38-year-old man in the bathroom of an Internet cafe in Gwangju on March 9. Police found the victim with his mouth jammed with a spoon and chopstick. He died of heavy bleeding and a fracture to his neck. The Kenyan man then robbed a 22-year-old male customer, stealing his winter jacket and phone. The African admitted to the crime, but has remained silent as to the motive. The police sent the case to prosecutors on March 14. While in police custody, the man reportedly showed violent behavior, such as screaming, damaging goods in the prison cell and smashing glass windows at the police station. Police said he also took off all his clothes and danced. He once asked for a Bible, prayed then shouted “Satan,” according to police.Frightened by his eccentric behavior, a Kenyan diplomat, who visited the police station to check on him, refused to interview the man.The suspect arrived in Korea on a three-month visa to participate in an international work camp hosted by UNESCO last July. Before his visa expired in August, he applied for refugee status and has been working for a parcel delivery company in Gwangju. A day before he committed the crime, he allegedly asked for help at a local police station, saying he wants to return home. However, due to his status as an asylum seeker, the authorities could not deport him.","murder found sane kenyan ,who murdered korean employee ,chopstick murder found sane ,man in chopstick murder ,seeker who murdered korean","['kenyan', 'korean']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41010532  0.37434965

The Korean seaweed soup is traditionally served on birthdays and to women who have just given birth. The Vietnamese-born worker married her Korean husband in 1998, after spending four years as a factory worker. “I couldn’t bear the smell of the soup, especially just a few hours after delivery,” Do said in an interview with The Korea Herald. After spending more than 20 years in South Korea, Do has now become used to the soup and speaks Korean fluently. She even secured a job at a government-affiliated agency here. Yet, one of the few things she regrets is not teaching her children her mother tongue, Vietnamese, when they were young. Foreign-born migrant wives Do Thanh Quy  and Kim Soo-yeon , who work as phone counsellors at the state-run Danuri Helpline, a hotline for marriage immigrants and victims of violence, pose for a photo in their office in Seoul. Claire Lee/ The Korea Herald“My in-laws were against it, as they thought learning Vietnamese first would make it difficult for the kids to learn Korean properly,” she said. “I was also scared that they may not fit in at school if I speak Vietnamese to them at home. Now I know that I was totally wrong. Vietnamese, if they had a chance to master it properly, would’ve been one of the biggest assets of my children.”Her personal experience is part of the reason why Do applied to work at the state-run Danuri Helpline -- a hotline for female marriage immigrants in the country -- back in 2006. The 44-year-old is currently one of 85 phone counsellors for the hotline, which offers services in 13 languages including Vietnamese, Chinese, and Tagalog. Most of the counselors at the agency are foreign-born migrant wives. They take calls from women from their countries of origin. For Do, the job enables her to tell other women not to repeat her mistakes. Most of the hotline callers, some 38.5 percent of them, are wives from Vietnam. “I always tell women from Vietnam that they should start talking to their babies in Vietnamese when they are in the womb,” she said. “I always tell them their chance to communicate with their children in their mother tongue is something they should never give up.”Her colleague, Kim Soo-yeon, moved to Korea in 2004 upon marrying her Korean husband. Born to ethnic Koreans in China, she spoke Korean fluently on top of Chinese before arriving in the country. However, getting used to Korean food was just as hard for Kim as it was for Do. “Food was actually one of the biggest causes of conflicts between my husband and me in our earlier years , so I know how hard it can be for women who have just arrived here,” Kim said, adding she still dislikes bulgogi, one of Korea’s signature dishes. “I still struggle with cooking , but my husband only wants our kids to eat Korean food. So imagine what it would be like for women from Mongolia, most of whom have never eaten seafood before moving here.”Although South Korea officially implemented bilingual policies for children of multicultural families in 2011, both Kim and Do said many migrant women still face forced assimilation by their in-laws and their Korean spouses. And this affects their children, too, they added. “Many women constantly hear the phrase, ‘when in Rome, do as the Romans do’ from their Korean husbands,” said Lee. According to Kim, many ethnic Korean women from China are forced by their Korean spouses to get rid of their Chinese accent when speaking Korean. They are even asked to pretend that they were born and raised here. “A lot of these husbands feel ashamed that they couldn’t manage to marry South Korean women,” Kim said. “As ethnic Korean women from China speak Korean fluently, and look ‘local,’ they think it’s possible to make them look like South Koreans as long as they get rid of their accent.”Working at the Danuri Helpline means getting all kinds of calls, including Korean husbands requesting for simple translations: “Could you please tell my wife that we are going to a hospital at 9 a.m.?” There was once even an urgent call from an obstetrician in a delivery room: “Can you please tell my patient to push when we count to three?” Foreign-born migrant Do Thanh Quy, who works as a phone counsellor at the state-run Danuri Helpline, takes a call in her office in Seoul. Danuri Helpline.Kim and Do also get many calls from Korean husbands who often complain about their marriages. Do said a large number of such husbands complained that their Vietnamese-born wives were trying to wire too much of their salaries to their parents back home. “I think it is one of the biggest misunderstandings Korean husbands have of Vietnamese women,” she said. “First, they need to understand that in Vietnam, daughters are just as obligated to support their parents as sons. We consider it our basic duty. And often, what women want is not the money, but words of understanding.”Kim, on the other hand, often hears many husbands saying, “Are all women from China this stubborn?”“In China, most of the mothers work. Full-time housewives are very rare,” Lee said. “There, women are used to expressing their opinion. And that trait is somehow interpreted as being ‘stubborn’ by Korean husbands here.”Both Kim and Do said South Korean families are much more patriarchal than in their home countries. Do remembers being shocked when she had just arrived in the country and learned how Korean housewives spend their time at home. “The women are so devoted. They would clean the house, shop for groceries, and make dinner before their husbands get home,” she said. “I was shocked at how Korean husbands wouldn’t participate in domestic affairs after work, and yet they were somehow getting such superb treatment from their wives.”Kim and Do said that more Korean relatives of migrant families should be educated on the unique challenges immigrants face, especially on food, language and even clothing. Do said she once mistakenly wore a piece of lingerie in public thinking it was a dress. “You would be surprised at how many international couples fight about the clothes the women wear,” the women said. “Some women from warm countries get scolded by their in-laws and husbands for wearing too many layers in the winter months. Some women get scolded for choosing colors that are favored by people in her home countries.”When asked to give advice to women in China who are thinking of moving to Korea, Kim said it’s important to gather as much information as possible first before making a decision. “Please don’t decide to move here after watching Korean dramas,” she said. “Don’t assume your problems at home will disappear once you move to another country.”Migrant women who need help can call the Danuri Hotline anytime at 1577-1366. The hotline is available round-the-clock, 365 days a year. South Korean and Foreign-born counselors offer services in 13 different languages: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Russian, Thai, Mongolian, Lao, Uzbek, Nepali, Khmer and English.  By Claire Lee","worker married her korean ,married her korean husband ,the korean seaweed soup ,her korean husband ,her first child 17","['Thanh Quy', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Vietnamese', 'korean']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58092129  0.4126828

But concerns are growing over the efficacy of the measures, with activists taking issue with shortage of financial, human resources in the field and authorities’ lack of will to implement the policies. Police on Monday launched a probe into suspected child abuse cases by reviewing the cases of 809 infants aged from 4 to 6 years old who have no record of receiving medical checkups or vaccination at hospitals.Upon the review, police officers specializing in child abuse and government officers from community centers will visit the homes of children suspected of suffering from abuse for on-site inspections.The Education Ministry also announced it would make it possible for school principals to look into children’s personal information, such as home addresses and their contact points, through a local community center’s computer network. The ministry had rolled out a manual last month that mandated schools report to police whenever a student is absent for more than three days straight or does not enroll in school in time. It considers expanding the manual to include preschoolers. The Welfare Ministry vowed to closely monitor parents who do not apply for day care subsidies from the government. It mapped out a plan to build a local network with community centers, municipal organizations and schools to watch out for children who might be subject to child abuse. The stepmother  of deceased 7-year-old Shin Won-young and father are taken for an on-site survey Monday to a location in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the body of the boy was found Saturday. The measures came in light of a series of gruesome abuse cases and deaths of children at the hands of their parents this year, the latest being Shin Won-young. Shin, who had allegedly been locked up and beaten for three months by his stepmother before his death in February could have been saved if there were comprehensive and legal systems to act on the suspected abuse, observers have noted.“When one of our counsellors learned about Shin’s case, there were no legal grounds to force entry into his home to separate the boy from his parents,” a counsellor from the National Child Protection Agency told The Korea Herald. A staff at the local child protection agency detected physical abuse on the boy’s body and reported the case in 2013. But the agency had to close the case in 2015 as Shin’s parents refused questioning, citing that it was a “family matter.”At the time, the special act for children was not in place. The act, which took effect in September 2014, grants greater authority to child welfare activists to inspect suspected cases without parents’ consent. Police are required to accompany counsellors for on-site inspections. But even with the act in place, a lack of budget and child welfare counsellors makes it difficult to conduct the policies, activists said. “Child protection agencies are too short-staffed. The special law for children came into force, but implementation is difficult due to lack of counsellors, budget and infrastructure,” said the counsellor from the NCPA. The number of child protection agencies stood at 56 as of 2014, with all the facilities being run by private child advocacy organizations. The number of staff members was 522 and the number of shelters for children was 46. Each shelter can house just seven children. A counsellor roughly covers 17,000 children aged up to 17, according to a report by the NCPA. The budget offered by the state decreased from 25.2 billion won  to 18.5 billion won this year. Kim Hee-kyung, head of advocacy and program at international non-governmental group Save the Children, lashed out at the government for releasing same policies without implementing them whenever child abuse cases come to light. “The set of policies unveiled by the government are a collection of failed policies that have not been carried out,” Kim told the Korea Herald, referring to the “child abuse prevention plan” by the government in February 2014. The polices released in 2014 include plans such as monitoring long-term absentees from schools and making home visits for parents who do not take their children to hospitals for vaccinations, to more effectively prevent child abuse. “I cannot trust the government anymore. I feel that the authorities are busy rolling out policies in the face of the public outrage, but it might again pay less attention to the issue as time goes by,” she said. “The government should take responsibility for preventing child abuses, not a handful of child rights organizations.” “As ministries pass on the responsibility of coping with child abuses to each other, I think it would be better if there were a control tower encompassing all relevant ministries under the Prime Minister’s Office,” she said. “There needs to be a fundamental change in the structure of overseeing and tackling child abuses.”Currently, all child protection facilities are run by child advocacy groups, with the government providing them with budgets annually. Lee Bong-joo, a social welfare professor from Seoul Nation University, suggested in a forum held earlier this month that the role of government and private sector should be divided. “Child protection agencies should focus on providing advice and services. The police and municipalities should focus on detecting child abuse cases and conducting on-site inspections,” he said. Another expert stressed the importance of parenting education.“In the past when families were large, ways to raise children were naturally passed on to the next generation, but as families get smaller, parents have less chances to learn about parenting skills,” said Lee Bae-young, an education professor at Sungsan Hyo University and president of Good Parents Association.“Abusive parents tend to have difficulties in managing anger and feelings without being aware of what they do,” he told The Korea Herald. “But it can be improved through continued education and counselling. The government and municipalities should consider making it mandatory for all parents in the country to receive such parenting education.""By Ock Hyun-ju","budget workforce hinder child ,abuse by his parents ,hinder child abuse fight ,tragic death of year ,child abuse fight with",[],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45708033 -0.03877175

Search for the boy was initiated as part of the intensified nationwide survey on children who have not been admitted to school in time or have been absent for a long time.Won-young’s biological father, identified only by his surname, admitted to finding Won-young dead on Feb. 2, a day after he allegedly suffered another round of beating by his stepmother. The couple testified that they had wrapped the body of the boy and kept him hidden at their veranda at home before moving and burying the body some 5-meters away from the gravesite of the man’s father.Police carry the body of 7-year-old Shin Won-young from a mountain in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, on Saturday. YonhapThe couple had given mixed testimonies of their whereabouts. Credit card records had placed them near the mountain, before they confessed. The police excavated the body of the boy early Saturday morning. The police are planning to charge both with murder. They said Shin had admitted to having known about the abuse by his new wife but that he had been afraid of facing punishment.The couple had also allegedly attempted to cover up their crime by sending each other text messages after Won-young’s death.One of the messages sent by Shin to Kim read, “Won-young is doing ok right?,” to which Kim responded, “He ate well and even brushed his teeth.” The messages were exchanged on Feb. 3, the day after Won-young’s body was found in the bathroom.Since being arrested earlier last week, they have also given mixed testimonies including how they left Won-young on a street, resulting in hundreds of members of the police force and various equipment, such as drones, being mobilized in search of the missing child.A mourner extends condolences during the funeral service of Shin Won-young in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, on Sunday. YonhapThe funeral of Won-young was carried out on Sunday and it was reportedly attended by his birthmother, who had divorced Shin some three years ago with limited visitation rights to her son. The mother had reportedly lost contact with Won-young and his sister, who has also been living with the father and the stepmother since August, 2014.Controversy persists over the legal and systematic loopholes in protecting children from abuse, especially from their parents, as such acts by them are considered easier to hide.Reports said that while there was evidence since 2013, such as pictures of Won-young’s beaten-up legs taken by a child protection agency, neither his father nor his stepmother had been questioned by the police. At the time, there were no regulations that required police to accompany counselors in suspected cases of child abuse.The officials attempted to move Won-young to a child protection facility in 2014 but this was refused by his father. There were no legal grounds to force the separation.Special laws were enacted in 2014, bestowing greater authority to the police and counselors at child protection organizations to investigate child abuses cases. Additional revisions to relevant laws have been made this year to better protect children but experts have pointed to a need for more fundamental changes, such as in the areas of social perception toward abuse by parents and chronic insufficiencies in budget and the workforce at child protection agencies.","brutal abuse of year ,week was discovered buried ,to police on friday ,father stepmother tried to ,he was allegedly killed","['Cheongbuk', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Shin Won - young']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44035354  0.25734472

The baby was seriously injured after the accident. She fractured her right arm and ended up with scrapes on her head. Even then, he didn’t take her to the hospital and left her untreated. He and his wife are also suspected of physically abusing the baby from Feb. 15-March 8. The couple took their baby to the nearby general hospital on Wednesday, claiming they discovered she was dead after they woke up in the morning. A physician in the hospital, who suspected the late infant had been abused, reported the couple to the police.

The poster put up across the campus included testimonies from about 40 female students who had experienced sexist remarks based on their gender. The comments that had allegedly been made by professors described women in general as only looking after their appearance and relying too much on men. Some of the lecturers allegedly advised female students to “behave” themselves and not to smoke or swear.  One of the comments on the poster read: “Women are not popular when they are clever. I was once set up with a female prosecutor, but she talked too much. Women can be loved when they are slightly stupid.”The poster was put up by members of Korea University’s feminist magazine Seoksoon. “Comments that disparage women can be commonly heard in university lecture rooms. People probably could not raise the issue or talk right back at such comments, but discomfort has been shared by many,” said Lee So-min, a member of Seoksoon. “We decided to put up the poster to raise awareness about gender discrimination faced by female students.” South Korea is known to have a wide gender gap, with the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Report in 2015 placing Korea at 115 out of 136 nations in terms of gender equality. According to the group, one of the professors at the university took issue with a menstruation leave system granted for women on their period. He allegedly said that he would only allow students to take the leave once a semester, accusing them of abusing the system. The group did not identify the professors quoted in the poster. Gender discrimination has been seen as prevalent on campuses, as shown by a 2010 survey.According to the survey on 530 male and female students by job search engine Albamon, 52.8 percent of men and 56.3 percent of women said that they had experienced discrimination at schools. Of them, 57.6 percent said that the offenders were professors, followed by senior students at 23 percent, fellow students of opposite sex at 14.2 percent and school council members at 12.8 percent.The survey also suggested that 27.4 percent of the sexual discrimination took place at alcohol-fueled gatherings, followed by lecture halls at 25.7 percent and college events at 20.8 percent. No Jeong-min, a counsellor at the university’s gender equality center, pointed to a generational gap as one of the reasons behind such gender discrimination on campus. “Gender discrimination has existed for decades on campuses in Korea, not only at Korea University,” No told The Korea Herald. “Sexual stereotypes have long existed in Korea’s patriarchal society and the older generation might still be gripped by such perceptions,” No said.“But as society changes students are more sensitive about gender issues nowadays ... Especially at educational institutes, lecturers should make more efforts to understand what constitutes gender discrimination and why such discriminatory remarks are problematic.” The discrimination is equally felt among male students on campus, said a 28-year-old university student, who wished to remain anonymous. “I was devastated when I felt that school assignments were evaluated not by fair yardsticks but by gender,” he said of his experience in engineering classes with a few female students. “Some professors are notorious among male students for giving advantages in school tests to female students.” The Albamon survey also showed that 23.8 percent of the respondents considered giving generous scores to a student of a certain gender as sexually discriminative.“Gender is not given, but it is shaped by social perceptions. Women and men alike can be discriminated against on campus,” said Lee Na-young, sociology professor at Chungang University. “Gender equality pursues that personal differences such as sexual preferences and gender should not lead to discrimination.”“Such a movement  is a good sign that students are aware of sexual discrimination and are taking action to tackle the problem,” she said. “This is the beginning.” By Ock Hyun-ju","female students lambasted their ,female students suffer discriminatory ,of female students lambasted ,female students lambasted ,40 female students who","['Korea University', 'Seoul']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.35295627  0.17919384

The rejection prompted the former soldier to turn to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission for help.The commission said it has confirmed that the man did suffer through torture after investigating army officers and soldiers he was on duty with, and recommended to the ministry that he be registered as a veteran so that he could be entitled to a monthly state subsidy and various other social benefits.""There is medical opinion that the former soldier is currently suffering from mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder due to the torture while serving in the military,"" the commission said.The ministry said it will review his case by taking into account the commission's recommendation.","tortured soldier be recognized ,soldier suffered through torture ,tuesday the soldier suffered ,soldier who was tortured ,panel recommends tortured soldier",[],16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26356572  0.19120306

She left her child tied overnight on the terrace and she was found dead later the next day. Police added charges for beating the daughter to death.Park previously argued that she had lost her first child at a playground in 2009. She was arrested for not having her second daughter registered for school. This is the first case in which a Korean parent has been arrested for neglecting to provide education for children.According to Goseong police, she buried the daughter’s body in a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, with the help of three acquaintances who lived together in an apartment. They lived together from January 2009 along with their respective children after Park ran away from home over domestic troubles.  Police head to a search for the first child’s body at a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. The police arrested two of the accomplices and booked them for helping to discard the body. The third was booked without detention. The investigators found Park in the midst of a nationwide search for the whereabouts and statuses of students who have been reported absent from school for a long time, or those who had never been admitted to school. The move was launched as part of the government’s efforts to curb child abuse amid a series of high-profile crime cases involving children. The police probed Park as they found that Park’s second daughter, now 9 years old, was never admitted to school, while the first child was missing but never reported. The mother had insisted that she was hiding from debt collectors.  Investigators are currently searching for the child’s body.By Lee Hyun-jeong","murdering year old daughter ,arrested mom confesses murdering ,mom confesses murdering year ,mom confesses murdering ,beating her first daughter","['vA', 'Park', 'Goseong , South Gyeongsang Province']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50067389  0.15532567

This memory really hurts. It makes me very sad,” said Kim, who described blueberry yogurt as the patient’s favorite food.  Three nurses, who treated MERS patients at the Seoul National University Hospital last year, pose for a photo during the interview. The interviewees asked that their names not be specified in the picture. Claire Lee/The Korea HeraldIt has been more than six months since South Korea declared the de facto end of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak -- which infected 186 and claimed 38 lives here -- but nurses like Kim who cared for MERS patients are still feeling its impact. A number of her colleagues have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. A colleague, Hyun Jin-ah , has had to take antidepressants and her condition has even led to her sending her eldest child to therapy sessions. The nurses plan to file industrial accident claims for the emotional damages they suffered during and after the outbreak. “There were no detailed guidelines. We were all new to the whole situation and I did not feel like I was being protected.” Hyun told The Korea Herald. “We were not given any safety training before caring for MERS patients. Throughout the outbreak I barely slept and ate -- I constantly worried about what would happen to me if something went wrong, or if the situation got worse. Not knowing what to do and not having any guidelines to rely on made me incredibly anxious the whole time.”In the early stages of the outbreak, Kim, Hyun and their colleague Choi Eun-young were asked to care for MERS patients without proper protective gear, even when the patients were receiving aerosol-generating procedures. The procedures are known to expose health care workers to respiratory pathogens, thereby increasing the risk of contracting the associated infectious diseases. However, the nurses were told that wearing a facial mask would be enough. Kim found out a month later that when using nebulizers -- a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs -- on MERS patients, medical staff are actually required to use power air purifying respirators with a hood or helmet according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in the U.S. “No one told us anything,” Kim said. “Often I felt I could get infected at any minute and end up dying.”There were many situations in which the nurses did not feel safe. The nurses claim that the hospital did not do enough to protect its own staff. For instance, there was an incident in which a MERS patient threatened to kill the patient whom he had contracted the virus from. He would violently throw things when he was quarantined and felt frustrated about his condition. In another case, a stressed patient experienced a violent stroke. As it was crucial that he had to keep his intubation tube in -- he could have died if it fell out -- Hyun went into his room and tried to hold on to the tube until someone else came in to calm him down. She was kicked by the patient several times and was badly bruised. When she told her superior about this, she was told in return, “You knew . So why did you go in  in the first place?”“I did not know what to say to that,” she said. “Was I supposed to leave the patient alone knowing he could die if the tube fell out?”During the outbreak, the nurses had to be separated from their families. As the hospital had seemingly made no plans to ensure their safety, the nurses had volunteered to stay away from their children and spouses. For two and a half months starting from June, they stayed in nonresidential rooms that had previously been used for research in the hospital. They were only given dehumidifiers and had no access to washing machines. “We would hand wash our clothes and cry before going to bed,” Kim said.MERS patients had to be quarantined and nurses even had to take on responsibilities that were usually performed by other caregivers. On top of their usual daily duties, nurses had to perform extra tasks, such as cleaning rooms and washing patients’ hair. They had to maintain reports of patients’ medical histories, carry out treatments, administer medications and provide emotional support to patients. And as if this was not hard enough, fighting MERS literally made the nurses break into a sweat because of the protective gear they were required to wear. “You sweat a lot in the protective suit. You would be soaked in sweat after wearing it for 30 minutes,” Kim said. “Once you wear the goggles, you can barely breathe. We would spend more than an hour in each patient’s room. When you get out, you are completely dehydrated and extremely dizzy. When I tried to take a shower to maintain my personal hygiene , my superior said showers were not necessary.”Being cut off from their families was also not easy, and the nurses had to deal with social stigma against their family members. One nurse was contacted by her child’s school teacher who suggested the child stay at home as his mother works at a hospital with MERS patients. “We were already separated from our families, and getting such text messages were hurtful,” said Hyun. Upon returning home after two and a half months of staying in the hospital, Hyun found herself unable to control her emotions. She could not sleep either.“I was always angry,” she said. “Even when my children were just being children -- running and laughing -- I would scream at them to be quiet.” Hyun’s youngest child, who suffered stress from being separated from her mother, would cry every morning when she tried to leave home for work. This lasted for two months. Her eldest son, 9, started to develop unusual habits, such as constantly rubbing his palms against one another. Hyun sought professional help and was diagnosed with PTSD. Her 9-year-old was diagnosed with a stress disorder. She was treated by a psychiatrist at the hospital where she worked, but her employer did not offer to pay for her or her son’s treatment. Hyun’s colleague, Choi, has had to deal with another kind of trauma. She felt that the MERS patient who was the 80th confirmed case in Korea had been unfairly treated. This patient had been suffering from cancerous lymphoma prior to contracting the virus. He was diagnosed with the virus on June 7 and was released from a quarantine facility on Oct. 3. Prior to this, he had tested negative for the virus twice consecutively.However, he was hospitalized on Oct. 11 at Seoul National University Hospital after experiencing symptoms once again. There, he was tested again for MERS. Choi claims that the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had held a press conference about the patient’s positive test results on Oct. 12 before even informing the patient and his family. The KCDC told The Korea Herald that they are unable to confirm whether or not Choi’s claims are true. “It was such a disrespectful thing to do,” Choi said. “The patient learned about his test results on TV.”On Oct. 13, Choi went into the patient’s room to check on him. He told her he had found out about his results by watching the news. He also mentioned that acquaintances who had met him in person before his hospitalization had called him to ask what they should do about their safety after finding out about his condition via the TV news. Choi remembers that the patient had looked visibly hurt. “And then he told me it was his birthday,” she said.As the patient was in quarantine, Choi was the only person who could visit him. She left the room and returned again with a birthday cake and a lit candle. Clad in protective gear, with the cake in her hands, Choi sang “Happy Birthday” to the patient. He died about a month later on Nov. 25. He had wanted to see his 4-year-old son before his death, but his wish was never fulfilled. The South Korean government declared a formal end to the MERS outbreak on Dec. 23. “The memory of the patient’s birthday pains me. I keep getting flashbacks. I still vividly remember his facial expressions that day,” said Choi.

This is the first time in Korea a parent has been arrested for neglecting the parental duty of giving education. Goseong Police in South Gyeongsang Province said they detained a 42-year-old woman identified by her surname Park for not providing proper educational care for her two daughters, aged 9 and 12. Suspects in the death of a teenage girl are moved to a holding cell from Sosa Police Station in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province on Feb.3. Police launched a nationwide search last month for the whereabouts and status of students who have been reported absent from schools for a prolonged period of time, or those who have not been admitted to schools in time. The campaign is part of the efforts to curb child abuse upon a series of high-profile murder and violence cases involving children and their parents this year.In the midst of the search, police found that Park’s second daughter was never admitted to an elementary school. Park’s first child remains missing, but was never reported, the police said.Park defended herself, saying she was afraid of exposing her identity as she was hiding from debt collectors. She also said she lost the first child at a playground in 2009. Police are further probing the case, suspecting that Park may be involved in the case of the missing 12-year-old.

This memory really hurts. It makes me very sad,” said Kim, who described blueberry yogurt as the patient’s favorite food. It has been more than six months since South Korea declared the de facto end of the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak -- which infected 186 and claimed 38 lives here -- but nurses like Kim who cared for MERS patients are still feeling its impact. Three nurses, who treated MERS patients at the Seoul National University Hospital last year, pose for a photo during the interview. The interviewees asked that their names not be specified in the picture. A number of her colleagues have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. A colleague, Hyun Jin-ah , has had to take antidepressants and her condition has even led to her sending her eldest child to therapy sessions. The nurses plan to file industrial accident claims for the emotional damages they suffered during and after the outbreak. “There were no detailed guidelines. We were all new to the whole situation and I did not feel like I was being protected.” Hyun told The Korea Herald.  ""We were not given any safety training before caring for MERS patients. Throughout the outbreak I barely slept and ate -- I constantly worried about what would happen to me if something went wrong, or if the situation got worse. Not knowing what to do and not having any guidelines to rely on made me incredibly anxious the whole time.”In the early stages of the outbreak, Kim, Hyun and their colleague Choi Eun-young were asked to care for MERS patients without proper protective gear, even when the patients were receiving aerosol-generating procedures. The procedures are known to expose health care workers to respiratory pathogens, thereby increasing the risk of contracting the associated infectious diseases. However, the nurses were told that wearing a facial mask would be enough. Kim found out a month later that when using nebulizers -- a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs -- on MERS patients, medical staff are actually required to use power air purifying respirators with a hood or helmet according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in the U.S. “No one told us anything,” Kim said. “Often I felt I could get infected at any minute and end up dying.”There were many situations in which the nurses did not feel safe. The nurses claim that the hospital did not do enough to protect its own staff. For instance, there was an incident in which a MERS patient threatened to kill the patient whom he had contracted the virus from. He would violently throw things when he was quarantined and felt frustrated about his condition. In another case, a stressed patient experienced a violent stroke. As it was crucial that he had to keep his intubation tube in -- he could have died if it fell out -- Hyun went into his room and tried to hold on to the tube until someone else came in to calm him down. She was kicked by the patient several times and was badly bruised. When she told her superior about this, she was told in return, “You knew . So why did you go in  in the first place?”“I did not know what to say to that,” she said. “Was I supposed to leave the patient alone knowing he could die if the tube fell out?”During the outbreak, the nurses had to be separated from their families. As the hospital had seemingly made no plans to ensure their safety, the nurses had volunteered to stay away from their children and spouses. For two and a half months starting from June, they stayed in nonresidential rooms that had previously been used for research in the hospital. They were only given dehumidifiers and had no access to washing machines.  “We would hand wash our clothes and cry before going to bed,” Kim said.MERS patients had to be quarantined and nurses even had to take on responsibilities that were usually performed by other caregivers. On top of their usual daily duties, nurses had to perform extra tasks, such as cleaning rooms and washing patients’ hair. They had to maintain reports of patients’ medical histories, carry out treatments, administer medications and provide emotional support to patients. And as if this was not hard enough, fighting MERS literally made the nurses break into a sweat because of the protective gear they were required to wear. “You sweat a lot in the protective suit. You would be soaked in sweat after wearing it for 30 minutes,” Kim said. “Once you wear the goggles, you can barely breathe. We would spend more than an hour in each patient’s room. When you get out, you are completely dehydrated and extremely dizzy. When I tried to take a shower to maintain my personal hygiene , my superior said showers were not necessary.”Being cut off from their families was also not easy, and the nurses had to deal with social stigma against their family members. One nurse was contacted by her child’s school teacher who suggested the child stay at home as his mother works at a hospital with MERS patients. “We were already separated from our families, and getting such text messages were hurtful,” said Hyun. Upon returning home after two and a half months of staying in the hospital, Hyun found herself unable to control her emotions. She could not sleep either.“I was always angry,” she said. “Even when my children were just being children -- running and laughing -- I would scream at them to be quiet.” Hyun’s youngest child, who suffered stress from being separated from her mother, would cry every morning when she tried to leave home for work. This lasted for two months. Her eldest son, 9, started to develop unusual habits, such as constantly rubbing his palms against one another. Hyun sought professional help and was diagnosed with PTSD. Her 9-year-old was diagnosed with a stress disorder. She was treated by a psychiatrist at the hospital where she worked, but her employer did not offer to pay for her or her son’s treatment. Hyun’s colleague, Choi, has had to deal with another kind of trauma.

The KCDC told The Korea Herald that they are unable to confirm whether or not Choi’s claims are true.  “It was such a disrespectful thing to do,” Choi said. “The patient learned about his test results on TV.”On Oct. 13, Choi went into the patient’s room to check on him.

She left the room and returned again with a birthday cake and a lit candle. Clad in protective gear, with the cake in her hands, Choi sang him  “Happy Birthday."" The patient died on Nov. 25, about a month after his birthday. While quarantined, his last wish was to see his four-year-old son. The wish was never fulfilled. About a month after his death, the South Korean government declared a formal end to the MERS outbreak on Dec. 23. “The memory of the patient’s birthday pains me.

Although the couple is ready to marry, Lee asked her boyfriend to postpone marriage, citing her career ambitions. A couple gets married in a wedding ceremony. “I think I’m still too young to tie the knot. I have a dream to work as a documentary producer someday soon and have more studies I want to do. I would like to invest more time and energy to myself for now,” Lee told The Korea Herald. Lee is one of many Korean singles who delay marriage for their personal development. In a survey conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 36 percent of singles responded that they have not gotten married yet because of their self-improvement plans, followed by difficulties in finding affordable housing for newlyweds at 14.8 percent and unstable job status at 12.7 percent.While self-improvement was picked as the top reason by both men and women, the second top reason differed by gender. Men chose difficulties in getting housing whereas women selected challenges in balancing work and domestic affairs. The survey was conducted on 1,000 individuals in January last year, with 260 singles included. Meanwhile, among married respondents who raise only one child, 49 percent said that they gave up on having more children due to financial burdens. “Although my wife and I want to have a second child, it is realistically nearly impossible since raising one toddler already requires a lot of money,” said 36-year-old office worker Kim Jin-sung who raises a 2-year-old son with his working wife.“From diapers to the allowance that  gives to the mother-in-law who takes care of our son in the day time, everything is money when bringing up a child.” About 17 percent said they gave up because of difficulties in handling work and child care at 17.2 percent, followed by concerns over securing their job positions at 7 percent. In order to solve the low birthrate problems, reducing the economic burden for childbirth and child care must be the top priority of the government, 40 percent of the total respondents said in the survey. The majority - over 74 percent - thought that the government’s efforts to alleviate the low birthrate problem were not enough. Of this proportion, about 31 percent said the current measures were not feasible while 25 percent said that the measures were not suitable for them.

The couple had admitted to beating the girl, but said her death was unintentional.Suspects in the death of a teenage girl are moved to a holding cell from Sosa Police Station in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. Preliminary autopsy results of the victim by the National Forensic Service showed a femur fracture and abdominal bleeding. “It is impossible to determine the exact cause of death at this point, but we cannot rule out the possibility that  died of shock from trauma,” the NFS officials said. The NFS will release the full results next week.The victim’s body was found at her father and stepmother’s house Monday morning, after she died on March 17, 2015, and was stashed away for nearly 11 months. Police believe that Lee may have purposefully created a dry environment at his home to hide the smell from the body, which was nearly mummified when it was recovered.Neighbors testified that they did not notice any foul stench, but noted that the ventilator was turned on each night.Lee told the police that he and his wife hit his daughter with a broom for five hours on the day of her death. He claimed to have kept the body at his home out of belief that “prayers will bring her back to life.”But police said Lee’s claim is unlikely to be true, as he had reported the girl missing and told her teachers that she had absconded with a large sum of money. The room where the mummified body of the teenage girl was found, surrounded by dehumidifying agents placed inside the room. It was reported that the girl’s school did not report her disappearance to the local education authorities, although the law mandates school officials do so when a student misses school for 14 days without a reason given.The case, which was unearthed during a police investigation of people who have gone missing for a long period, is the latest in a series of child abuse cases by parents that has sent shock waves reverberating through the country. In response, the Education Ministry announced last week that it would conduct a pangovernmental checkup on elementary and middle school students who have missed school for three months or more from Jan.1 to March 31. The Justice Ministry has rolled out plans to curb child abuse, which includes creating a department dedicated to crime on children and women at district prosecutors’ offices in Daegu and Gwangju and deploying 111 prosecutors specializing in child abuse cases across the country. The government will also expand the range of people mandated to report child abuse on sight, including workers at adoption agencies, centers for sexual victims, and child care support centers. Last month, a man was arrested on charges of beating his 7-year-old son to death, mutilating the body and hiding it for more than three years.According to the Welfare Ministry, 87 percent of child abuse occurred at homes while 83.3 percent of the perpetrators were parents. Korean law says parents who repeatedly abuse and injure their children will lose custody. But it is rare for parental abusers to actually be punished.According to the Korea Institute of Criminology, legal action was taken in only 572 of the 55,484 confirmed cases of child abuse from 2004 to 2013. Often, the victims are guilt-tripped or threatened by their abusers against blowing the whistle.Police investigation of the death of an 8-year-old girl in Chilgok, North Gyeongsang Province, initially pinpointed her older sister as the primary suspect. But further probing found that the girl had been forced to falsely confess by her stepmother, who had abused both sisters.By Yoon Min-sik","child killer couple police ,warrant for child killer ,old daughter to death ,arrest warrant for couple ,couple police on thursday","['Sosa Police', 'Bucheon', 'Lee', 'Baek']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72303218  0.12449834

""The welfare of U.S. citizens is one of the Department's highest priorities. In cases where U.S. citizens are reported detained in North Korea, we work closely with the Swedish Embassy, which serves as the United States' Protecting Power in North Korea.""   Toner said he has no further information to share due to privacy considerations.   The North's move came as the U.N. Security Council is working on a fresh resolution for tougher sanctions against North Korea following Pyongyang's nuclear test earlier this month.   ""The North seems to keep the U.S. in check as Washington is moving to take stronger sanctions against the North,"" said Hong Hyun-ik, a senior researcher at Sejong Institute.   Experts said that the North has used detained Americans as leverage to force the U.S. to open bilateral talks with it.   In 2014, Pyongyang released three detained Americans -- Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Fowle.   Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen, was detained by the North on charges of espionage, after being arrested in October last year, according to a report by CNN earlier this month. The U.S. has declined to confirm Kim's detention.   Lim Hyeon-soo, a Korean-Canadian pastor, has also been held in captivity in the North since he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission in January 2015.   In December, the North's highest court sentenced Lim to life in prison, citing his ""subversive plots"" against the North's regime.   Meanwhile, three detained South Koreans -- missionary Kim Jung-wook, Kim Kuk-gi and Choe Chun-gil -- in North Korea face criminal punishment as they were sentenced to hard labor for life on charges of spying for Seoul's intelligence agency.   In October, Pyongyang freed Joo Won-moon, a New York University student with a U.S. green card, after a six-month detention, on what it claimed was humanitarian grounds.","has arrested college student ,arrested college student for ,arrested college student ,korea detains american for ,has arrested college","['North Korea', 'U.S', 'Warmbier Otto Frederick', 'the University of Virginia', 'north korean', 'Korean Central News Agency']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43955606 -0.10289108

He denied killing the child on purpose and was charged with manslaughter, desecration of a dead body and violation of child protection laws. His wife, who deliberately did not report him, was arrested for violating child protection.The case demonstrated the lack of a safety net for children who may be facing abuse. While officials advise teachers to report possible abuse by parents to the authorities, the manual lacks details about specific measures they should take.The Education Ministry last month announced that it would revise the teacher manual to allow an individual teacher to visit a student‘s home to check if an instance of abuse had occurred. A bulletin board is filled with fliers looking for missing children near Cheongnyangri Station in Seoul. YonhapLast year, an 11-year-old girl had escaped the clutches of her abusive father by climbing down a gas pipe. The girl was 120 centimeters tall and weighed just 16 kilograms, suffering from severe malnutrition. Current regulations state that a school is mandated to send a notification to the parents if a child misses school for one week or more, after which the case is reported to the community center and subsequently to the Education Ministry.If the period reaches three months, authorities are no longer mandated to keep tabs on the student.An official from the Gyeonggi Province Ministry of Education said there is no way for an administrative body to forcibly request the whereabouts of a student if the parents of the child refuse to communicate or cooperate.The elementary education law states that those who deprive a student of the right to mandatory education be subject to a fine of 1 million won  by the education superintendent of the area. But so far, not one person has been fined for such a case, despite hundreds of students missing school without an apparent cause given. Oh Seung-hwan, a professor of social welfare at Ulsan University, said that there needs to be system to force parents’ hands on possible abuse. He also called for deployment of child experts at schools with the power to intervene on such cases. The Korea Federation of Teachers’ Associations said the country needs to mandate parents of students missing school to consult the teachers, and also implement punishment on those who refuse.

The body of the boy, who had been absent from school for nearly four years since 2012, was found by the police Friday at the home of an acquaintance of the father. The authorities had launched an investigation Wednesday, two days before the discovery of the body, after the boy’s school staff filed a request in hopes of getting in touch with the long-absent student.The police confirmed that the father admitted to mutilating the body of the son. The authorities also announced that an autopsy would be performed to determine the exact cause of the boy’s death. “We are conscious of the possibility that the boy may have been killed by his own parents,” said Lee Yong-hee from the National Police Agency. According to the police, the 34-year-old father told the authorities that in October 2012, his son tripped and fell unconscious after he physically and forcibly dragged the child into a bathroom. The child had been reportedly refusing to take a bath at the time. A father, who has been arrested on charges of mutilating the body of his seven-year-old son, steps out of a police station in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. Yonhap.The boy eventually woke up, but the father didn’t take him to the hospital. The father said he “neglected” the son after the injury and the child eventually died the following month at his home in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province. The father never reported the son’s death. Instead, he placed the body parts in the freezer, and took them with him when he and his family moved to Incheon from Bucheon in 2013. He moved the frozen body to his acquaintance’s house in Incheon on Friday, as he was afraid of being caught, the same day the police eventually discovered the boy’s body and arrested him. The reasons behind the negligence and mutilation of the body are still unknown. Police confirmed that the father currently does not have any mental illness, nor does he have any history of it.  The boy enrolled in an elementary school in Bucheon as a first-grader in March 2012. He stopped showing up to classes the next month. According to police, the school sent two letters, one on May 9 and the other on May 18 in 2012, to the boy’s home, but received no response. On June 11, the vice principal of the school and the boy’s homeroom teacher together visited the home in person, but reportedly no one was at the property at the time.The police also found that the boy’s younger sister, who is currently in the third grade, had been showing up at school regularly. Her teachers reportedly didn’t notice any signs of abuse within the last two years, the police said.The children’s mother told police she didn’t report her husband to the authorities as she was “worried about raising her daughter alone.”Just last month, following another high profile child abuse case in Incheon where a father confined his 11-year-old daughter at home and continually abused her for more than two years, the South Korean government announced that it was launching a special investigation nationwide on all schoolchildren absent from school for more than a week.South Korea has seen a dramatic increase in its number of reported child abuse cases, from 7,406 in 2010 to 15,025 in 2014, partly due to stricter rules on reports. In 2014, more than 80 percent of the abusers were confirmed to be parents of the young victims.
