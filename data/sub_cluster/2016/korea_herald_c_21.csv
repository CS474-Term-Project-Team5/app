Among couples with a single breadwinner, however, only 29.9 percent were childless.Matches with the husband and wife both in their early 30s accounted for 18.8 percent of all newlywed couples, closely followed by duos where the husband was between 30-34 years and the wife between 25-29 years at 18.4 percent. Also, 506,000 couples, or 42.9 percent, were double-income families, and the percentage reached 50 percent for those who married less than one year ago.Among 853,000 marriages that include salaried workers, 30.6 percent of them have a combined annual income of 30 to 50 million won, while 21.9 percent are in the basket of 50 to 70 million won, and 18.4 percent are in the 10 to 30 million won income group.The findings reflect that an increasing number of South Korean people get married and have children when they are older, or give up on tying the knot and having babies altogether.A separate survey showed that half of people thought that marriage is necessary in their lives last year, down from 56.8 percent polled in 2014.The average age that a woman has her first child was 31.2 last year, up from 31 years in 2014. Some 23.9 percent of first-time moms were over 35 years of age.The country's fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, has hovered around 1.2 since it dropped to a record low of 1.08 in 2005.It reached 1.24 in 2015, marking the second-lowest fertility rate among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, following Portugal with 1.23 based on available data compiled in 2014.The average birthrate of OECD countries was 1.68 as of 2014.","35 percent of newlywed couples ,newlywed couples had no kids ,total 35 percent of newlywed ,than 35 percent of newlywed ,35 percent of newlywed","['Statistics Korea', 'match', 'south korean', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Portugal', 'OECD']",7,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.77221441  0.64520639

Per 1,000 outpatient and emergency room visits of those aged 7-18, 153 were flu patients. The previous record was set in 2013 at 115 flu cases per 1,000 hospital visits. A nurse examines a child at a pediatrics clinic in Seoul on Friday. A total number of suspected cases for seasonal influenza reached 61.8 patients per 1,000 visits across the nation, about a 77 percent jump from 34.8 cases, the KCDC said. By age group, those aged six or below showed the highest number of infected cases at 59.6 patients, followed by those aged 19-49 at 51.5.Those aged 65 or more showed the least number of flu cases at nine per 1,000 hospital visits, followed by those aged 50-64 with 22.2 cases. The virus currently raging is the influenza A virus subtype H3N2, the doctors said.While doctors stress that simple hygiene etiquette is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the contagious virus, they said that the influenza B virus is likely to appear early next year.“Seasonal flu shows different types of aspects of spreading and considering the current spread of influenza A, the second round of seasonal flu -- influenza B -- may begin spreading early next year,” said Doctor Jung Yong-pil of Asan Medical Center.“These two different strains of the virus share almost identical symptoms such as high fever, headache and muscle pain,” Jung added. Getting a vaccination, either a flu shot or a nasal-spray type vaccination, is a simple method to reduce the chances of catching both influenza A and B, experts say, but fundamental preventive steps such as washing hands often can sometimes work better.According to Doctor Lee Jae-gab of Hallym University Gangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, it is difficult to expect which subtype virus of influenza B would spreading, making it hard to guess which vaccination to get for prevention.“There are two subtypes of virus under influenza A and B, while a vaccination cannot always create the specific antibodies to resist the viruses, it depends on people,” Lee said.“That’s why doctors stress flu prevention methods, such as wearing a mask and washing hands often, as the most certain and basic ways to stay away from a cold,” he added.The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced earlier this week that it would temporarily expand the health insurance coverage for those aged 10-18, so they can get antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu at a 30 percent discount and promptly receive treatment.By Kim Da-sol","flu patients this week since ,seasonal influenza reached 61 patients ,of flu patients this week ,of friday per 000 outpatient ,2013 at 115 flu cases","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Seoul', 'KCDC', 'H3N2', 'Jung Yong - pil', 'Jung', 'Lee Jae - gab', 'Hallym University Gangnam Sacred Heart Hospital', 'Lee', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Kim Da - sol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35780001  0.62728995

The KCCR began collecting data on the occurrence rate of cancer in 1999. It peaked in 2012 with 323.3 cases per 100,000 people, but has since been on a gradual decline. By type of cancer, thyroid cancer topped the list with 30,806 people diagnosed in 2014 -- about 28.1 percent lower than in the previous year -- followed by colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer and prostate cancer.Researchers said the fall in the occurrence rate of thyroid cancer compared to previous years could be due to the heightened public awareness regarding overdiagnosis and the resulting unncessary surgery.Among the five kinds of cancer monitored by the National Cancer Information Center, breast cancer was the only type that showed an increasing trend, with the number of cases rising by 5.7 percent from 17,398 in 2013 to 18,381 in 2014.

Currently, there have been no reports of infections through people or livestock.Chung Ki-seok, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks Tuesday in a briefing held at Sejong Government Complex. “While the possibility of the bird flu infection spreading to humans is extremely low, simple but fundamental steps, such as washing hands for 30 seconds and avoiding visiting poultry farms or habitats for migratory birds can prevent the outbreak spreading to people,” said Chung Ki-seok, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a briefing.“We also ask that citizens who find symptoms or suspicious cases visit ministry-designated hospitals. We appointed some 17 hospitals across the nation equipped with special sanitation facilities to report and treat cases immediately,” Chung added.As of Monday, 9,183 people working at poultry farms or participating in the mass culling of poultry at the disease-hit areas had been vaccinated and classified as a high-risk group to receive state monitoring.Authorities said 26 people among the high-risk group reported flu-like symptoms, but just one of them was confirmed with the H3N2 strain of the seasonal flu.The highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of the flu is currently being examined at the National Institute of Environmental Research to find out if the outbreak can spread to people, authorities added. The CDC said it also published and distributed guidelines for bird flu prevention measures in 14 different languages, including Thai, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and more, in an aim to help foreign workers in rural areas understand the situation and follow the measures. Officials said that while the seasonal flu is sweeping the country at an alarming pace, it is theoretically possible for a human to catch both seasonal flu and bird flu infections, but it is very less likely for the outbreak to spread to people. “The most significant step for people to prevent both  viruses is to wash hands often and eat heated food,” the CDC official said.By Kim Da-sol","bird flu strain week after ,pathogenic bird flu strain week ,prevention speaks tuesday in briefing ,the bird flu infection spreading ,distributed guidelines for bird flu","['the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Chung Ki - seok', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Chung Ki - seok', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Chung', 'H3N2', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'CDC', 'Thai', 'Tagalog', 'Vietnamese', 'CDC', 'Kim Da - sol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38445911  0.17742714

The ruling party, the largest political bloc in the Assembly with 129 seats, has been divided on whether to support the motion.The following is a real-time running update of the National Assembly's move to vote on the impeachment motion. -- Ed.6:40 p.m.At the moment Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun announced the passage of the impeachment motion, it was rather somber inside the room where the 299 lawmakers sat.

Still we have a long way to go until the final decision . I will participate in tomorrows and future rallies until it all ends,” Choi Hye-jeong, 29, said at the scene. On the other side of the cheering citizens stood others with grim faces in a group supporting President Park Geun-hye, as they called out that the results were unfair and irresponsible. Police guarded the gate of the parliament and surrounded the loud crowds, guarding against possible violence. 4:16 p.m. The impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye passed at 4:10 p.m., Friday. Out of the 299 votes cast, 234 votes were in favor of impeaching the president, 56 were against, two were withdrawn and seven were invalide votes. 3:58 p.m.Vote count begins for the 299 ballots cast.

She has also come under fire for failing to make key rescue decisions during the Sewol ferry sinking incident in 2014.“We have realized that truth  may never come to light as long as the Park administration is in charge,” said Yoo Kyeong-keun, the committee head of the Sewol Families for Truth and a Safer Society.“Impeachment will mark the start of a new era in which we may reveal the truth about Sewol and step forward into a safe society.”The participating members pledged to exert pressure upon the parliamentary floor to vote in consent of impeachment and thus embrace the public sentiment.Shortly after the opening of the session, Rep. Kim Kwan-young of the runner-up People‘s Party presented the impeachment bill to the floor, stating President Park’s violation of the nation‘s Constitution and other laws. 2:30 p.m.Thousands gather at the front gate of the National Assembly on the day of impeachment vote.

They made impromptu speeches on a makeshift stage and sang Korean folk songs. They also put up yellow flags bearing various messages condemning President Park. Placards read “immediate resignation” and “prompt punishment.” Protestors relentlessly chanted “Park Geun-hye, resign,” while facing the national assembly building. Many of the protestors echoed hope for a better, more just society by impeaching the president. If the motion does not pass, many said they would continue to fight until she resigns. Conflicts have erupted as a farmer drove a tractor to the main road in front of the National Assembly building packed with protestors.

According to an award-winning paper released by Jeon Sae-ran and Lee Myeong-hoon of Korea University, those in rural areas were 1.37 times more likely to have plans for children than those living in cities, when comparing on equal income conditions.The paper studied 2,207 couples who registered for marriage from 2010 to 2014 with their annual average income standing at 48 million won  and spending an average of 280,000 won monthly in debt.By marriage length, couples married for less than two years in rural areas were 1.39 times more likely to have a childbirth plan than those in cities, while those outside cities married for three to five years were 1.25 times more likely than their counterparts in urban regions.The team explained that despite that many in their 20s and 30s, who are the primary birth-givers, live in cities, the rate difference occurs due to the high living cost and child-rearing expenses in urban regions. The average home price stood at 400 million won in the capital area, higher even than the average of metropolitan cities like Busan  and other regions .Child care expenses turned out to be more burdensome in more urban areas as well.Households with a child in big cities spend a monthly average of 717,000 won, while those in small and middle-sized cities spend 615,000 won, data from Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs showed. Residents in the countryside spent an average of 521,000 won per month.“Last year’s birthrate was 1.24, which means newlyweds gave birth to just one child . We need to come up with more fitting policies for new married couples to increase the birthrate,” the research team said.

YonhapIn the third quarter, the tally decreased to 10.02 million, but still remained above 10 million. Senior workers accounted for 38.5 percent of total workers in the third quarter, adding almost 10 percentage points from 27.9 percent in 2006. The proportion of seniors in the total workforce has been gradually increasing over the past decade. In the second and third quarters of 2006, a total of 6.49 million workers were 50 years old and above. The number exceeded the 7 million threshold in 2008 for the first time, 8 million in the second quarter of 2011 and 9 million in the second quarter of 2013. The rapid increase is largely due to the growing population of the older generation, which includes Korea’s baby boomer generation who were born between 1955 and 1963. As of September, the population in their 50s increased by 113,000 to a total of 8.2 million from a year ago, while those in their 60s added 475,000 to 9.96 million. Meanwhile those in their 30s and 40s has decreased by 88,000 and 56,000, respectively. “The baby boomers have failed to prepare for their postretirement life,” said Park Yoo-soo, a researcher at the state-run Korea Development Institute. “As a result, they still remain in the job market.”The reason behind the lack of preparation for their postretirement life can be attributed to polarization in the Korean job market, Kim Yoo-bin, associate fellow with the Korea Labor Institute, told The Korea Herald. “Those who earned low incomes and worked irregular jobs are likely to be the ones who are not ready for retirement and forced to stay in the workforce even after the retirement age.” The average retirement age in Korea was 72.9 for men and 70.6 for women in 2014, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor in July, meaning that Korean workers remain in the workforce seven to eight years longer than average among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The fall in her popularity is especially notable in her core support base -- Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province and the over-60 age group. In Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, her approval rating stands at 11 percent. In Busan, Ulsan and South Gyeongsang Province, 12.4 percent said that the president was doing okay. In Seoul, 8.3 percent said they backed Park. The poll showed that 41.3 percent of the supporters of the ruling Saenuri Party thought that the president was doing OK, while 40.6 percent thought otherwise. Among those who voted for Park in the 2012 presidential election, only 20.1 percent still support her, with 66 percent turning their backs on her. Park was the least popular among the younger generation. Only 5.3 percent of those in their 20s and 5 percent of those in their 30s said that she was doing a good job. Among those in their 60s, 18.1 percent had a positive view of Park.The survey was conducted on 1,088 mobile phone users aged 19 or over on Oct. 31 through the random digit dial method.

The number of South Koreans aged between 16 and 19 who are eligible to donate blood dipped by an average of 68,000 annually over the past five years, the Korean Red Cross said.Unless the problem is addressed, the number is expected to drop by an average of 125,000 per year over the next five years.Currently, South Korea relies heavily on blood donations by students and soldiers for its blood supply. They account for 66.9 percent of total donations.Last year, the blood demand by local medical services institutions exceeded the donated blood supply, with the situation worsening this year, added the officials.The Korean Red Cross plans to focus efforts on reducing the dependence on the young for the blood supply and expanding donations by older generations through various joint programs and campaigns with the Ministry of Public Safety and Security and regional governments.","blood donations nationwide fell percent ,of blood donations nationwide fell ,their 20s decreased 15 percent ,blood donations nationwide fell ,donations nationwide fell percent","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'South Koreans', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'South Korea', 'the Korean Red Cross', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41817915  0.60811216

Ideally, social innovation helps us to tackle the root cause of the problems, instead of just to mitigate symptoms,” said Tim Draimin, the executive director of Social Innovation Generation based in Vancouver, in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.For over a decade, Draimin has put effort into international nonprofit organizations and the social innovation ecosystem in Canada. In particular, he actively worked on bridging social innovation initiatives among the government, private companies, educational institutes and others. He visited Seoul last week to give a speech at the 2016 Future Innovation Forum in Seoul, hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government under the theme of “A Window to the Future.”Tim Draimin, executive director of Social Innovation Generation, speaks during the 2016 Future Innovation Forum hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government last week. According to Draimin, social innovation is a set of new ideas that help people to tackle challenges such as social and environmental issues. It also helps people to imagine future forms of innovation. “Generally, business and social organizations we have now were built about half a century ago. Now is the time to challenge ourselves to change our minds,” said Draimin. He emphasized that partnerships across organizations, sectors and countries can lead to new and better outcomes for citizens, citing Grameen Danone as one such example. Established in 2006, Grameen Danone is a joint venture between French food product group Danone and Bangladesh’s Nobel prize-winning microfinance organization Grameen Bank. It provides children with key nutrients missing from diets in rural Bangladesh. “Hiring people in  Bangladesh community not only gave social impact in Bangladesh, but also led to new business opportunities and more cash flow to Danone.“Progressive businesses which want to retain smart employees and improve their relationship with community, should ask this question to themselves: How can we incorporate thinking about community in our project and economic values in our business model?”Draimin also spoke about government organizations’ role of establishing and promoting cross-sectoral business models through education.Draimin’s team at SIG is currently running a number of education programs and diploma courses at the University of Waterloo and other educational institutions. Some of the programs are even available online.“Younger people are generally more open to newer ideas and opportunities represented by social innovations. Young people can learn how to apply innovation principals to existing social problems, that are also applicable in business, government, community and universities,” Draimin said. “We face a lot of social challenges. In the future, many of these problems will require us to collaborate in order to understand the cultural differences between sectors. It will help us create new architecture of how we collaborate together to solve problems.”By Kim Da-sol","social innovation ecosystem in canada ,innovation ecosystem in canada ,innovation ecosystem in canada in ,bangladesh nobel prize winning microfinance ,in vancouver in recent interview","['herald interview]one', 'Tim Draimin', 'Social Innovation Generation', 'Vancouver', 'the Korea Herald', 'Draimin', 'Canada', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'draimin', 'Social Innovation Generation', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Draimin', 'Draimin', 'french', 'Danone', 'Bangladesh ’s', 'Grameen Bank', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladesh', 'Draimin ’s', 'SIG', 'the University of Waterloo', 'Draimin', 'Kim Da - sol']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53545165  0.67543191

Researchers at Yonsei University in Seoul said on Monday that children in middle and high school who were obsessed with dieting, fasting, or binge eating, and the use of unprescribed medication are twice more likely to commit suicide than those on a normal diet. The study’s result came after they had reviewed the previous survey from the Minister of Health and Welfare in 2014, which surveyed around 70,000 middle and high school students here who were on a diet.  123rfThe research team first divided the group of the surveyed participants into two groups. One had what the researchers described as a “normal diet” with regular exercise, prescribed weight loss pills and “one food diets,” in which the dieter only eats one kind of food. The diet methods of the other group included 24-hour fasting and unprescribed pills that caused vomiting and diuretic effect. The second group showed a higher probability of contemplating or attempting suicide than the first group, the study showed. The male subjects in the second group who were not eating for 24 hours or more turned out to be 1.7 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts and 1.8 times more to attempt suicide. For the girls, the difference was even higher: Those on extreme diets were 2.2 times more likely to commit suicide, the study revealed. Professor Park Eun-cheol who led the research attributed the result to “side effects regarding anxiety, decreased concentration and mood swings that are caused by unhealthy diets.” He added that “psychological problems and eating disorders seem to be the cause of the bad choices.” The researchers published their findings in the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences journal.

A petition was originally brought to the NHRCK in July 2009 by an assistant teacher at an elementary school. The school had refused to renew her contract after she did not submit to the test.The commission initially dismissed the case, citing it as an individual complaint, even though thousands of teachers took the test each year and 50 teachers had already filed a similar report. But in dismissing the complaint, the commission allowed the case to be taken to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which told Korea last year to apologize to the teacher and pay compensation, as well as remove visa requirements for HIV testing.Now, the NHRCK has backed the CERD decision, telling the Ministry of Justice to amend or rescind its rules on medical testing.“The Republic of Korea should actively implement CERD recommendations stemming from the individual communication system,” it said, citing in particular “compensation for damages suffered by the petitioner.”“Even the vast discretion embedded in immigration control hardly renders it reasonable that while Korean teachers and ethnically Korean foreign language instructors are exempted from the testing, only foreign E-2 visa holders are under an obligation to test for HIV,” the NHRCK said in its decision.It also highlighted the stigma that could be created by mandatory testing of specific groups.“Such stigmatization imputes the cause of infection to the group and misleads the general public to think that they are safe from the disease as long as it is limited to a small group of people,” it said.The decision is dated Sept. 8, but Ben Wagner, who represented the petitioner in both the CERD and NHRCK cases, said he was only notified Thursday. There is no notification of the decision on the commission’s website.Wagner welcomed the decision, which he said had exceeded his expectations.""This decision has been too long coming, the NHRCK delayed for nearly 8 years and that has to change. But I can say without hesitation that the decision is a very good one indeed,” he said. ""The NHRCK has taken a very strong position on protecting the rights of foreigners. But even further than that, the NHRCK has been very direct in insisting that the government ‘walks the talk’ when it comes to the international law standards that it professes to uphold and abide by but doesn’t always live up to.

According to Education Ministry data released by Rep. Lee Jong-bae of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of English teachers from native English-speaking countries at public schools fell from 8,520 in 2012 to 4,962 this year. Native English teachers and Korean teachers at primary and secondary schools in northern Seoul. High schools saw the biggest drop of 68.7 percent, followed by middle schools at 55.3 percent and elementary schools at 29.6 percent during the period of 2012 to 2016. By region, Incheon saw a 71.8 percent plunge over the same period, followed by Gyeonggi Province at 63.1 percent, North Chungcheong Province at 54.6 percent, South Chungcheong Province at 47.3 percent and North Gyeongsang Province at 46.8 percent. In the nation’s capital of Seoul, the number decreased by 43.2 percent. The reduction in native teachers appears to be a direct result of a national policy to have regional education offices fund a state free child care program. “We have limited budget, but the priority seems to have shifted from English education to other things, like funding child care programs or investing in school facilities,” an official from Seoul Education Office told The Korea Herald. “It seems that demand for native English teachers has also decreased, especially for high school students, as they tend to focus more on preparing for college admission exams.” “It also has been our goal to enhance English training for local teachers to gradually replace native speakers in the long term,” she said. Currently, foreign teachers are selected and dispatched to public schools through a program run by the National Institute for International Education and they are paid by regional education authorities. “Parents are increasingly bearing more burden to give private education to their children as the number of the native English teachers decreases,” lawmaker Lee said. “There need to be measures to lift the burden for English private education by hiring more native English teachers.” Under the previous Lee Myung-bak administration, the government encouraged public schools to recruit native English teachers as part of efforts to improve the quality of public English education and ease reliance on private education. Seoul Education Office, for example, assigned at least one foreign teacher to its public schools by 2012. According to the Education Ministry’s data, an estimated 5.9 trillion won  was spent for South Korean elementary, middle and high school students’ private education across the nation last year. But English fluency among students ranked just No. 27 out of 70 surveyed countries, down three notches from the previous year, according to global education institute Education First’s index.

According to the Korean Institute of Criminology, the total number of crimes stood at 1.93 million in 2014, which marks 3,767 offenses per 100,000 in the country with a 50 million population. The number of criminal offenses has remained at around 1.9 million since 2010 after it reached a peak of 2.16 million crimes in 2009. But only 69.5 percent of those committed crimes involved arrests in 2014, compared to 78.4 percent in 2005. The number of murders committed in the country over the period of 2005-2012 remained at around 1,000, before falling slightly to 966 in 2013 and further to 938 in 2014. The number of robberies dropped from 5,266 in 2005 to 1,618 in 2014.In contrast, sex crimes including rape and sexual harassment soared from 13,631 in 2005 to 29,863 in 2014, with the crime rate per 100,000 people having risen from 28.3 in 2005 to 59.2 in 2014. “Unlike other types of serious crimes seeing a decline in number in recent years, the number of sex crimes has increased,” said researcher Hwang Ji-tae of the KIC. “For sex crimes, it is more difficult to learn about the status quo with official data as victims are less likely report such crimes to the police.” The report also showed a rise in the number of senior offenders. Those aged between 51 and 60 among criminals arrested for murder and other serious offenses accounted for 7.5 percent of the total in 2005, but it more than doubled to 14.4 percent in 2014. The portion of those aged 61 or over surged from 3.1 percent to 6.7 percent during the same period. Violent crimes committed by those aged 51 or over accounted for 13.1 percent in 2005, which increased to 28.4 percent in 2014. The proportion of those who committed asset-related crimes including fraud rose from 16.5 percent in 2005 to 30.6 percent in 2014. The portion of those in their 50s who committed sex crimes also saw an increase from 8.1 percent in 2005 to 13.9 percent in 2014. Those in their 60s committed 3.2 percent of such crimes in 2005 and 6.7 percent in 2014. “There was a clear rise in the number of criminals in their 50s and 60s who committed serious, violent and asset-related crimes, while there was a decline in the number of 20s and 30s who committed such offenses,” Kim Ji-seon, a researcher at KIC, said in the report. “It is a result of a growth in the number of the baby boom generation who are now in their 50s and 60s.” By Ock Hyun-ju","16 million crimes in 2009 ,million crimes in 2009 but ,fraud rose from 16 percent ,peak of 16 million crimes ,million crimes in 2009","['the Korean Institute of Criminology', 'Hwang Ji - tae', 'Kim Ji - seon', 'KIC', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51090378  0.36424333

These and other plans were released by the Health and Welfare Ministry in the latest round of cancer management measures. YonhapFor early diagnosis of lung cancer and to lower the death rate from the disease, low-dose spiral computer tomography will be offered free of charge to those aged 55-74 who have been smoking about one pack, or 20 cigarettes, a day for the past 30 years.Further details of those eligible for the checkup will be decided upon reviewing the examination capacities of each region’s public and state-run cancer centers and their respective budgets.Lung cancer has been the country’s biggest cause of death among cancer patients, accounting for 22.8 percent. Some 23.5 percent of lung cancer patients live for more than five years upon diagnosis, shorter than the average 69.4 percent of all cancer patients. Early diagnosis is therefore imperative, the ministry said.The ministry said it will also set up regional support centers for some 1.37 million cancer patients nationwide. It will also diversify hospice services so that up to 25 percent of terminal-stage cancer patients would have access by 2020.Low-income cancer patients will receive state subsidies regardless of their place of diagnosis.Currently, health insurance subscribers could benefit from the subsidies if they were diagnosed through state-managed examinations.Those who have received abnormal findings in their general checkup will also be advised to take further tests with state subsidies. Currently, the system is only available for those in risk of stomach and colorectal cancers. It will expand to liver, breast and cervical cancers.The government will also work to advance an infrastructure to manage cancer such as by constructing a data base for each cancer type to follow the diagnosis, treatment and development of the diseases.A geographic information system will be established to help figure out the causes and risks related to cancers to be released for public viewing by 2017.","2020 low income cancer patients ,implemented next year cancer patients ,37 million cancer patients nationwide ,of lung cancer patients live ,by 2020 low income cancer","['south korean', 'the Health and Welfare Ministry', 'YonhapFor', 'lung']",8,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.55402392  0.15503369

According to a report on the employment structure and income disparity of seniors released by the Korea Labor Institute, the Gini coefficient -- a measure of inequality -- for people aged 65 or over in Korea was 0.422, the second highest after Chile at 0.428. On a scale between 0 and 1, the closer the Gini ratio is to 1 the greater the income inequality. When the Gini index is above 0.4, the extent of income disparity is seen as serious.The inequality among senior citizens is in stark contrast to the relatively low level of income disparity among the working population. YonhapThe Gini coefficient among Koreans aged 18 and 65 was 0.28, lower than major economies like the United States at 0.392, the United Kingdom at 0.353, Germany at 0.299 and France at 0.294. The income inequality among the elderly is attributed to a growing number of retirees landing low-quality, low-paying jobs, according to the report. “The increase in the employment rate for senior citizens will likely continue as baby boomers born between 1955 and 1963 have started to retire,” researcher Kim Bok-soon said in the report. “But the jobs are mostly irregular, part-time and unstable, providing poor working conditions.” The employment rate for senior citizens aged 60 or over was 38.9 percent last year, with them accounting for 21.9 percent of the working-age population. According to Statistics Korea, 11.6 percent of the entire working population took home less than the minimum wage  last year, while 37.1 percent of the elderly earned less than the minimum wage. Nearly 57 percent of the senior citizens received low-pay, which is two-thirds of the nation’s median income. Women in the age group were also more exposed to income disparity, with 71.6 percent of them receiving low pay and 46.6 percent of them being paid less than the minimum wage, the data showed. The poverty rate -- the proportion of people with net income below a defined threshold -- for senior citizens with more than two family members in a household was 47.6 percent, while the figure for elderly living on their own was 67.1 percentMost of the working seniors found temporary, irregular employment in the services, health care and social welfare industries, the report said. “Given the senior generation entering the labor force right now has not prepared themselves for after-retirement life and most of them are willing to remain in the labor market even by holding low-quality job, the government needs to release policies to curb income inequality and create quality jobs for seniors to make use of their experience at work,” said Kim.

By law, tunnels must have various safety facilities, depending on their length and the level of potential danger. Tunnels longer than 500 meters must have an escape route, for instance, while some are required to have broadcasting speakers installed to warn drivers of an accident ahead. The report given by the ministry showed that 86 of 236 tunnels on highways and 133 out of 278 tunnels on national roads did not have the mandatory escape routes. It also said 27 of 192 highway tunnels and 40 of 231 national road tunnels did not have the needed speakers.Also missing were emergency phone boxes, automatic fire detectors and entrance blockades, according to the report. Rep. An Ho-young, a member of the parliamentary committee on transportation who had asked for the ministry data, said the chances of an accident turning into a bigger disaster is especially high inside tunnels because paths for escape are limited and drivers cannot see what's ahead.

Those with manufacturing jobs retired at the age of 58.7 on average.The prescribed retirement age by the companies’ regulations, however, was the same for all types of jobs, at 58 on average.The biggest gap in retirement age among job types was in the petrochemical industry. While those with manual jobs retired at 58 on average, those working desk jobs retired at 50. A similar phenomenon was seen in the shipbuilding industry.The steel industry, on the other hand, showed almost no gap between the job types in their average retirement age. The report cited a relatively larger number of companies in the industry with employment stability, such as POSCO.“It is true that there are more demands on site for those with experienced skills in the manufacturing field,” Lee Ho-chang, a senior researcher at Korea Labor Foundation, told Yonhap News.“It also seems that the lower participation rate among those with desk jobs in the companies’ labor unions also was a factor.”The report also revealed that earlier retirement was more rampant in large companies than small and mid-sized businesses.While the official retirement age for those with desk jobs at companies with at least 500 employees averaged at 58.5, the actual retirement age was 51.8.The official and actual retirement age for those with office jobs at smaller companies that had between 100 to 299 employees was 57.8 and 57.6 respectively. Those in blue-collar jobs retired at 59.8 on average, meaning they worked past the official retirement age at 57.6.The report said this could be due to active re-employment among the smaller companies with high demand for skilled workers with labor shortages.It added that employment policies against an aging society should not just focus on alleviating personnel expenses, such as through voluntary resignation or a wage peak system, but comprehensively reconsider how to foster the retired workforce aged 60 and older. A peak wage system gradually decreases the salaries of employees past retirement age to make the employment market more flexible.South Korea’s portion of the population aged 60 and over is expected to grow from 18.5 percent last year to 47.4 percent in 2060.“Advanced countries such as Germany put much effort into advancing the work capacity and skills of elderly laborers through consistent re-education,” said senior researcher Park Myung-joon at the KLI.“We must also reinforce such a retraining system and introduce a wage system that centers on job functions and skill levels as we prepare for the full enforcement of the extension of the retirement age to 60.”The obligatory extension of the retirement age to 60 came into effect for all companies with at least 300 employees this year and will expand to smaller companies from next year.","with desk jobs retire earlier ,desk jobs retired at 50 ,labor institute surveyed 272 businesses ,manual jobs retired at 58 ,biggest gap in retirement age","['the Korea Labor Institute', 'POSCO.“It', 'Lee Ho - chang', 'Korea Labor Foundation', 'Yonhap News', 'South Korea ’s', 'Germany', 'Park Myung - joon']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47438803  0.26087976

Two victims who raised objections after the second round of verifications in April 2014 were also confirmed as category 2 victims.However, members of a group of victims and their families known as Gapimo and the Asian Citizens Center for Environment and Health argued that the government’s standard for recognizing the victims of toxic disinfectant was unfair. They also charged that the government did not consider victims suffering from other long-term health illnesses and underlying diseases.According to the government’s victim verification process, which was introduced in 2014 to provide due compensation and medical treatment, the scale goes from 1-4. A rating of 1 indicates a high level of certainty that their lung diseases were caused by the use of humidifier disinfectants. The ministry-run Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute explained that those who suffered lung-related diseases are classed as category 1 or 2 victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories 3 and 4.“The government still left some 130 people out, with 50 percent of them being put as category 4, a group that cannot even receive health monitoring from the government,” said Choi Ye-yong, head of ACCEH, during a press conference in Seoul on Friday. Choi Ye-yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Friday. YonhapThe ACCEH also argued that the government has so far put more victims into categories 3 and 4 than categories 1 and 2.In the first round of victim verifications in June 2013, 184 victims were confirmed as categories 3-4, whose health conditions were recognized by the government. After the second verification process in April 2014, 69.2 percent or 117 victims were put into categories 3-4. On Thursday, the ratio of categories 3-4 victims went up to 79 percent or 130 victims.“The government defines category 4 victims as those whose health problems have almost no connection with the use of humidifier disinfectants. There were three category 4 victims who passed away but are still listed as alive on the government record,” said Choi of the ACCEH.“This is because the government ignored the severity of the victims’ health conditions and did not conduct in-depth investigations into their health,” added Choi.Victims also argued that deaths of infants, victims with blood-flow disorders and a mother who had a stillborn child -- all confirmed as category 4 -- should be reconsidered. They argue they should be reclassified as categories 1-3, to at least receive state care and contribute to understanding the relationship between the use of humidifier disinfectant and other diseases.However, the ministry has so far deferred their decision to revise the standard by which victims are verified, sticking to categorizing victims by disease.“We will consider establishing an additional standard to find the relationship between the use of toxic disinfectant and diseases other than lung-related diseases,” said Seo Heung-won, director of the Environment Health Policy Division under the Environment Ministry.The ministry said that it would soon conduct another verification process regarding the remaining 587 victims who filed reports in December.But the number of victims is likely to increase as the government started receiving a fourth set of applications in April. A total of 3,031 cases have been filed as of Friday.Meanwhile, the National Assembly’s Special Committee said Friday that it cancelled its on-site inspection plan at the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters in Slough, UK, after RB headquarters notified them that they want to keep the investigation private. The Special Committee’s three-day trip to UK was slated for Aug. 22.RB CEO Rakesh Kapoor reportedly told them that RB headquarters cannot open the entire investigation process to media. CEO Kapoor also declined to offer an official apology to victims in Korea, according to the lawmakers.“It is very regrettable that the RB headquarters is not cooperating with us,” said Rep. Woo Won-sik of The Minjoo Party of Korea, the head of the special committee, during a press conference.But RB Korea said in an statement on Aug. 19 that the “RB headquarters was prepared to receive the National Assembly delegation in the UK and that the group's CEO intended to provide a full apology to the victims' representatives and the National Assembly members.""Rep. Woo added that it would request the RB headquarters to send a person in charge to be present for the Oct. 4 hearing. The humidifier disinfectant case came to light after four pregnant women died of unidentified lung-related diseases in 2011. A state-led investigation later confirmed a connection between at least 100 lung-related deaths and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants.By Kim Da-sol","after four pregnant women died ,media ceo kapoor also declined ,of 37 victims of toxic ,victim verifications in june 2013 ,four pregnant women died of","['the Environment Ministry', 'Gapimo', 'Asian', 'Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute', 'Choi Ye - yong', 'Seoul', 'Choi Ye - yong', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'Seoul', 'YonhapThe ACCEH', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'victim', 'Seo Heung - won', 'the Environment Health Policy Division', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the National Assembly ’s Special Committee', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'Slough', 'UK', 'the Special Committee ’s', 'UK', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'Kapoor', 'Korea', 'Woo Won - sik', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'RB Korea', 'National Assembly', 'UK', 'National Assembly', 'Kim Da - sol']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17066315  0.5913139

YonhapAccording to a poll on 873 people by job portal site Saramin released in November, a job seeker spends 60,000 won to prepare for each job interview. Nearly 70 percent of those surveyed said that they felt expenses were a “burden” and 30 percent gave up on attending job interviews due to financial problems. The announcement came amid mounting controversies over the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s implementation of the “Youth Allowance.” The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been opposing the program, ordering the city government to cancel the project and take back the money already distributed to 2,831 applicants. In what many see as a similar program, the municipality provides 500,000 won per month for up to six months to some 3,000 selected young people, who have lived in Seoul for more than a year, work less than 30 hours a week and are aged between 19 and 29. The Labor Ministry, however, drew a clear distinction between its scheme and Seoul City’s version. “It is serious that youth looking for a job give up on taking part in job interviews due to financial difficulties,” the minister said.“But Seoul City’s ‘Youth Allowance’ would take away job opportunities  because it does not set the young’s participation in job searching efforts as a precondition,” he said.“Seoul’s plan also broadly acknowledges individual activities unrelated to finding employment, it is highly probable that the youth are just settling for cash subsidies rather than actively look for a job.” Lee also said that some 35 of about 110,000 participants in the ministry-led job support program cancelled their application to apply for Seoul City’s “Youth Allowance” as the ministry does not offer support for expenses.  The Seoul Metropolitan Government welcomed the Labor Ministry’s plan, saying that it corresponds to the principle of the municipality’s program. “As the central government is rolling out a measure that is rarely different from Seoul City’s policy, the Ministry of Health and Welfare should withdraw its decision to cancel the ‘Youth Allowance’ program,” an official from Seoul Metropolitan Government said. “We will cooperate with the central government if there is common ground.”Under the current program, job seekers received cash in the first and second stage of their nine-month-long job consulting program encompassing counselling, vocational training and internship. The new plan, which will take effect in September, will benefit some 24,000 job seekers chosen by counsellors at job centers. The Youth Hope Fund will provide the budget of 7.4 billion won for the program. The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 9.2 percent in August.

His hair fell out just from a breeze of wind or from merely walking around,” said the mother. The boy became completely bald within a week of taking the medicine. His parents took him to several hospitals, including Seoul National University Hospital, Severance Hospital, and Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. According to the parents, the doctors said the possibility of a full cure is only about 10 percent. The story of Chang spread after the mother sued the herbal medicine clinic and posted on an Internet cafe photos of her son before and after the baby took the medicine. The insurance company under which the clinic is registered investigated the issue. It found that the clinic was accountable for the baby’s physical condition and set the compensation fee at 3 million won . Many online commenters and the boy’s parents say that the fee is too low. The clinic is continuing to deny accountability. The clinic asserts that the toddler had health issues such as bronchitis before it took the medicine. It stated that he had been hospitalized due to enteritis and had taken other medications prior to taking herbal medicine. Based on that, it argues that herbal medicine is therefore not necessarily the reason for the baby’s hair loss. However, doctors who had treated the toddler before he started taking herbal medicine in November stated that his former physical condition should have nothing to do with the hair loss. The Association of Korean Medicine recently launched an investigation into the medications that Chang took.

Following the accord signed by the municipalities with the ministry, some 1.4 million diesel cars registered before 2005 in metropolitan areas that are under air pollution control will be restricted on the road.But old diesel cars that have passed an inspection conducted by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority every one or two years will be excluded from the restriction. Cars that attached exhaust reduction devices or went through engine modification will also be excluded.The accord will take effect starting with Seoul in 2017, followed by Incheon and 17 cities in Gyeonggi Province in 2018 and the rest of the metropolitan areas across the country in 2020.The ministry explained that the measure is being introduced as diesel cars registered before 2005 are produced without exhaust reduction devices. The ministry added that those cars can produce as much as eight times more emissions compared to recently produced diesel cars.YonhapTo encourage drivers’ participation, the government said it plans to provide a discount for car owners when they purchase new vehicles after scrapping old diesel cars. Negotiations on the discount is currently under review with local automakers, the ministry added.For drivers in the low-income bracket, the government will cover 90 percent of the cost to attach exhaust reduction devices on their cars and modify their engines.

Obesity was measured according to the body mass index, the stress level by respondents' answers ranging from one to four, and illnesses by the number of diagnosed diseases.According to the study, the stress level for rural residents was 2.9, higher than the 2.86 for city dwellers. It was higher as the town size became smaller -- 2.84 for residents of towns with 500,000-plus populations compared with 2.97 for those in towns under 100,000.

For some men, this appears to apply even to their mandatary military service. Since the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, or KATUSA, is widely perceived as an opportunity to practice the language and enjoy enhanced welfare as a soldier, interest in enlisting as a KATUSA soldier is high. Potential applicants have been turning to cram schools to get the required English scores.Some of these institutes are run by ex-KATUSA soldiers who know a thing or two about spending time in the U.S. barracks, in a bid to appeal to their potential clients. There are even some exclusive classes designed just for KATUSA aspirants. KATUSA soldiers and their parents participate in a ceremony to mark the completion of their basic training at KATUSA Training Academy in Camp Jackson in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, where they were also assigned to their respective positions for the rest of their military service. Active KATUSA soldiers are picked by a public lottery in November each year. The applicants are asked to hand in their English test scores meeting the minimum requirement earlier in August.Korean men who are eligible to enlist have to earn scores of 780 or above at the Test of English for International Communication, or the equivalent scores in four other written English tests and three oral proficiency tests, to qualify for the lottery session. Yang Jun-kyu, a KATUSA reserve soldier, said he chose to attend one of the cram schools in his pursuit of joining the unit.“I was able to earn the score I wanted by the deadline ,” said the 26-year-old Yang, who entered the force in January 2010.When he was chosen, Yang once again turned to a private course, to prepare himself for communication in English. “I was still worried after I was accepted,” he said. “I was not fully confident with my English skills then.”The minimum English requirement was introduced in the 1980s as part of the military authorities’ struggle to find those suitable for the job.According to the Military Manpower Administration, KATUSA soldiers were randomly selected from the ROK Army’s basic training camp until 1987. It was in 1987 that an entry examination was introduced, and applicants were tested on English, Korean, ethics and Korean history. Half of the quota was still filled by selection from the ROK Army.TOEIC was first adopted in 1996 as means to measure English proficiency of KATUSA soldiers. In the beginning, those with the highest scores were accepted. Two years later, the Korean Army employed the lottery system among all applicants with a TOEIC score of above 600 to unify the conscription system.The minimum TOEIC score was 600 or 700 for 10 years until 2008, when the minimum was raised to 780.Lim Hee-joe, a self-help book author and private TOEIC instructor, sees himself as a mentor for aspiring KATUSA soldiers. He went through the then-26-month service as a KATUSA military policeman starting in 1998.The popularity Lim gained with his special classes for aspiring KATUSA soldiers has allowed him to operate a blog to share experiences as a KATUSA military policeman covering some 20 U.S. military posts. In 2013 he published “All About KATUSA,” a self-help book that delves into the KATUSA routine.With the applicants being allowed to submit their oral proficiency test scores instead of the written ones, it has motivated some cram schools to provide intensive classes for speaking. For instance, a two-week cram course by one of the institutes promises to help applicants earn above Level Intermediate II in the Oral Proficiency Interview by Computer.The oral test result was included as a required document as part of the Korean Army’s move to address the lingering problem that a high written test score does not necessarily correspond with a good command of spoken English.By Son Ji-hyoung","mentor for aspiring katusa soldiers ,korean army employed the lottery ,korean army move to address ,classes for aspiring katusa soldiers ,policeman covering some 20 military","['south korean', 'the Korean Augmentation', 'the United States Army', 'KATUSA', 'KATUSA', 'U.S.', 'KATUSA', 'katusa', 'KATUSA Training Academy', 'Camp Jackson', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'korean', 'Yang Jun - kyu', 'KATUSA', 'Yang', 'Yang', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'KATUSA', 'the ROK Army ’s', 'korean', 'korean', 'the ROK Army', 'TOEIC', 'KATUSA', 'the Korean Army', 'TOEIC', 'TOEIC', 'KATUSA', 'KATUSA', 'Lim', 'KATUSA', 'KATUSA', 'U.S.', 'KATUSA', 'Level Intermediate II', 'the Korean Army ’s', 'Son Ji - hyoung']",13,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.28496107  0.22472161

The 4-week average, which is less volatile, dipped slightly to 264,750.Unemployment claims are a proxy for layoffs. The 70-week streak of claims staying below 300,000 is the longest since 1973. It's evidence that employers view their business prospects as being strong enough to keep workers on the job, even as Britain's vote to depart the European Union has further compounded the volatility seen in the financial markets this year.There were recent signs that employers were turning somewhat pessimistic about the pace of growth as monthly hiring slowed sharply in April and May. Employers added just 38,000 jobs in May, the fewest in more than five years.But economists expect the government jobs report being released Friday will show a pick-up in June, with estimates that employers added 180,000 workers.The modest level of unemployment benefits indicates that employers are looking past the sluggish 1.1 percent annual U.S. economic growth recorded from January to March. The total number of people receiving benefits has dropped 7.8 percent from a year ago to 2.12 million.Many economists are forecasting growth in excess of 2 percent for the second quarter ended in June.Still, the Federal Reserve has held off on any changes to its short-term interest rates. The U.S. central bank that once hinted at the possibility of multiple hikes in its federal funds rate this year has yet to take action so far, citing uncertainty about the economy and global factors such as weaker growth abroad.","growth as monthly hiring slowed ,americans sought unemployment benefits last ,unemployment benefits last week sign ,weekly applications fell 16 000 ,hiring slowed sharply in april","['WASHINGTON', 'Americans', 'U.S.', 'the Labor Department', 'Britain', 'the European Union', 'U.S.', 'the Federal Reserve', 'U.S.']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5177387   0.64812946

The amount included the incomes that those who died by suicide or addiction would have earned in their lifetime. “The burden coming from deaths and diseases from drinking in South Korea tend to be relatively higher than other advanced countries,” Jung said. “As the World Health Organization also recommends aggressive intervention to reduce the harmful effect of drinking, we also need wider interference by the state in terms of drinking.”","week have nearly double the ,addiction amounted to 54 trillion ,higher chance of suicide than ,times week have nearly double ,2011 and 2013 among adults","['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the Health Insurance Corporation', 'YonhapResearcher Jung Sung - ho', 'South Korea', 'Jung', 'the World Health Organization']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61092007  0.87793589

The average unit cost of imported masks also decreased from $0.055 in 2013 to $0.045 in 2014. YonhapImports of air purifiers increased by 21.8 percentage points to $32 million last year.Within the first five months of this year, the total amount of imported air purifiers reached $43 million, surpassing last year’s $32 million. Industry watchers said that costly home appliances such as air purifiers and vacuum cleaners equipped with strong dust filters that are built to remove microorganisms were also gaining popularity. Air purifiers manufactured in Malaysia, China and Canada and vacuum cleaners manufactured in Vietnam and Denmark topped the list.The KCS did not reveal the specific brands.Imports of vacuum cleaners totaled $220 million last year, a 31.6 percent point increase from 2014. Sales of vacuum cleaners from January to May this year reached $130 million. Imports of daily supplies for oral hygiene also went up by 3.7 percentage points, reaching $16 million last year.Mobile social commerce company Ticket Monster -- one of the most-visited shopping platforms for household appliances -- said last month that the sales of products related to air purification, such as masks, air purifiers and pot plants, saw two- to fourfold on-year sales increases in May. It explained that while the sales of air purifying products mostly ceased around May last year, sales and consumer demands on those products have been constantly increasing this year even after the spring.It added that the largest group of consumers who purchased goods related to air purification last year were mostly women in their 30s , followed by men in 30s , men in their 40s and women in their 40s.By Kim Da-sol","masks hit 23 million last ,imported masks hit 23 million ,cleaners totaled 220 million last ,surpassing last year 32 million ,43 million surpassing last year","['the Korea Customs Service', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Malaysia', 'China', 'Canada', 'Vietnam', 'Denmark', 'KCS', 'mobile', 'Ticket Monster', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.02136981  0.19116484

The phase-out is due to the country’s dwindling population, according to the officials.Nine percent answered they supported the plan, while the other 2 percent were not sure.YonhapAll able-bodied South Koreans are required to serve in the military for 21 to 24 months, depending on the branch of service, as the country remains technically at war with North Korea.But each year, around 28,000 people with special skills -- mainly majors in natural sciences and engineering -- are allowed to serve in alternative fields, which include working at research institutes. Other alternate service posts include assisting the police, Coast Guard, firefighters and work in other public sectors.The survey by BRIC showed 92 percent of the respondents thought the conscripts benefited from the alternative service, with most of them in their 20s and are budding researchers. One researcher pointed out that students of medicine, law and administration are able to utilize their expertise in the barracks, and that researchers should be allowed the same opportunity.

Ministry of Patriots & Veterans Affairs recently made a pre-announcement of legislation outlining expanded support for those with national honorees status, so as to get more companies to hire these people who have made sacrifices for the country. According to the changes, employing a wounded veteran or other honorees with a disability level of five or higher will be counted as hiring two disabled employees. Levels five to one on the disability scale translates into increasing severity of injuries.The ministry expects that the ""market-friendly"" approach will motivate companies to hire more people with injuries and prop up the employment rate of soldiers, police, firefighters and other people who have done good deeds for the country.The revised rules comes amid rising complaints that local companies are shunning hiring national honorees. The companies, on the other hand, voiced reservations that the mandatory employment quota for such people are unrealistically high. According to local law, companies are legally bound to maintain a 3-8 percent employment quota for disabled patriots and those injured while helping others. However, the regulation has stayed largely nominal, as a majority of local companies would rather pay fine of 5 million won  than hire people with physical impairments.","hiring two disabled employees ,motivate companies to hire more ,sunday ministry of patriots veterans ,employment quota for disabled patriots ,hiring national honorees the companies","['South Korea', 'Ministry of Patriots & Veterans Affairs']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32555804  0.49825591

The increase contrasts with those in their 30s, whose employment fell by 38,000, and also those in their 40s whose number decreased 14,000.But a closer look showed that the types of jobs younger hires held were mainly menial work. The study said there were 23,000 more people in their 20s working as security guards, building cleaners, delivery personnel and in other physically demanding jobs compared to the year before. The number of people of the same age group working in sales increased by 22,000 and those in machine and equipment operations by 16,000. The increase in professional jobs stopped at 8,000, while desk job holders fell by 3,000.Short-term contract jobs were also prevalent.For the 15-29 age group, 20.7 percent of first jobs after graduation were on a contract of one year or shorter, up from 8.7 percent in 2006. Discontent over such job market conditions was growing.

Among the cases, 6,900 involved theft and robbery, while 4,500 involved violence and 2,700 were intellectual crimes. In the period leading up to May this year, 1,044 teenagers were arrested and 547 of them had committed violent crimes such as murder, robbery and arson. Experts said that most of the juvenile delinquents had spontaneously committed their crimes out of curiosity and lacked a sense of guilt for their wrongdoing. In Gwangju, South Jeolla Province on Wednesday, a 17-year-old runaway high school student surnamed Choi, was arrested under charges of breaking into an apartment and robbing and murdering a housewife in her 50s. The police said Choi had prepared three knives and pliers for the allegedly premediated crime. According to the police, Choi had brutally murdered the victim and meticulously removed traces from the house. In Daejeon, North Chungcheong Province in May, a teenager brutally beat a woman he did not know, because he was upset after fighting with a friend. In Ansan, Gyeonggi Province in April, a teenager set an extracurricular academic institute on fire, which resulted in the death of two. In Hwasun, South Jeolla Province, a high-school student strangled his girlfriend and abandoned her body.

Lawmaker Kim Seung-hee of the ruling Saenuri Party pointed out Wednesday that the legal working age in Korea started at 15, and that middle school students between 12 and 14, in cases when they ran away from home for personal reasons, were unable to obtain money through proper channels and became easy prey to prostitution. Notwithstanding this, article 305 of the Korean criminal law currently dictates that children above the age of 13 are considered as being able to exert autonomy, and therefore having a consensual sex with them is not legally punishable. Having sex with children under 13 is punishable at all times. Among the 258 reported cases of underage prostitution, only 16 cases ruled immediate prison terms to the adults involved in the act. The rest 98.8 percent of the cases handed out suspended sentences and unsubstantial penalties, citing the voluntariness of the teenagers as the reason. Representative Kim said, “In other advanced nations such as the U.S. and the European states, despite their relatively liberal ideas regarding sex, the minimum protected age for the sex trade is 16.”Kim plans to submit a revision to criminal law to raise the threshold age for protection of teenagers involved in sex.By Lim Jeong-yeo","prostitution involving minors abruptly rose ,underage prostitution only 16 cases ,underage prostitution only 16 ,of underage prostitution only 16 ,of prostitution involving minors abruptly","['the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'Kim Seung - hee', 'Saenuri Party', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'european', 'Lim Jeong - yeo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50291276  0.03362171

Some of the tips include how to register a birth certificate, how to bathe a newborn and how to care for a wife suffering from postpartum depression.A parenting guide for young fathers published by South Korea’s Gender Ministry. “We came up with this booklet for many different reasons, and they are all related to one another,” said Park Seo-young from the Gender Ministry. “Greater involvement by men in child care would lead to better work-life balance for both men and women. Poor work-life balance is one of the biggest reasons behind the nation’s low fertility rate. We also want to form a social atmosphere where it’s natural for fathers to be interested in child care and actively seeking information.”South Korea has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, with a growing number of women choosing to get married later in life. Last year, 47.5 percent of Koreans said child care is the biggest obstacle for women’s careers here. Notably, 65.4 percent of Koreans in their 30s, and 52 percent of those in their 40s, said women are facing disadvantages in the local job market because of prenatal duties and lack of social support. Men’s participation in child care remains low in Korea. In 2014, only 3,421 men took paternity leave from work, accounting for just 4.4 percent of all working fathers in the country. A number of studies have shown that many men do not take such leave as they fear possible career disadvantages such as a demotion. The booklet was coauthored by two working fathers, and reviewed and edited by a group of professionals including a pediatrician and researchers. Based on their personal experiences, the authors, who are fathers who actively engage in child care, give hands-on and sometimes hilarious advice.  One example states: “Do not forget to show your wife your appreciation if you arrive at the hospital after the baby is born. Many men become too excited at the fact that they’ve just became a father and forget the fact that their partner just went through labor by herself.” Another said: “My wife spent a lot of time making homemade baby food. Our baby hated it. So I ate it for breakfast.” The book also offers recipes for baby food and tips on how to manage parental stress as a new father. Lee Sang-hun, a 30-year-old father of a 2-year-old daughter, said it would have been helpful for him to have attended a parenting class before his child was born. He said one of the biggest challenges for him was bathing his newborn daughter. “I didn’t find diapering too hard. You get used to it after about three or four tries,” he said, identifying himself as a “self-taught dad.”“But so many things could go wrong when you bathe your newborn. The water temperature has to be right. You have to support her neck and head with one hand the whole time. I wish I had an opportunity to somehow prepare myself for it before my daughter was born.”Lee also said he would have liked to attend a class on ways to play with an infant. “At first it was just really hard. I didn’t know how to ‘play’ with a baby,” he said. “So in the beginning I would just shake a rattle for her as I didn’t know what else to do. It obviously got better as I spent more time with her, but things would’ve been easier if I were told what to expect in advance.”Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee said education on parenting is especially crucial for couples during pregnancies. “It’s when they can really prepare themselves before their baby arrives,” she said. “We hope this booklet can be a way for men to grow as an individual and learn life lessons from parenting.”The booklet will be distributed for free at all health care centers and obstetrics clinics nationwide from later this month.

The victims and their families, however, remain opposed to the plan, saying the additional compensation still neglects victims with relatively less damage and overlooks different causes of death allegedly caused by the products.In a closed-door meeting attended by some 150 victims and their families in Seoul on Sunday, RB Korea’s representative director Ataur Rashid Safdar said the company -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014 -- would increase the amount of compensation to 350 million won  to victims classified in categories one and two, in addition to the originally proposed 150 million won.The plan was offered after the third round of talks with victims and their families since May.Victims and the families of victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectants enter a meeting with Oxy Reckitt Benckiser in Seoul on Sunday. The company would also provide 1 billion won in compensation for the deaths of infant and child victims.The adjustment to compensation cost was to “console the agony of not only the victims, but also their family members.” “ to understand the grave loss of father, loss of caregiver and mother,” according to RB Korea.The company also vowed to provide victims with lifelong medical treatment by calculating the amount of income that a victim would have been able to make if not affected by the toxic humidifier. It also added the company would actively execute the compensation plan before the victims go through hassles to file damage report to receive compensation. However, victims and their families remained bitterly opposed to the new plan.They demanded the new compensation plan be applied to all victims, including those classified under categories three and four.As of May, there were 309 victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants classified in categories three and four. There were 221 victims in categories one and two. The scale goes from one to four, with the lowest being highly certain that health damage came from the use of humidifier disinfectants. According to the government, those who suffered lung-related diseases are confirmed as category one or two victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories three and four. Victims and their families also argued that the compensation scheme still fails to address different kinds of cases of deaths and the suffering of victims, such as a mother who lost her life from using Oxy’s product while she was pregnant. The prosecution probe into the toxic humidifier disinfectant tragedy is nearing its end, but victims and their families have said that RB Korea is trying to wrap up the incident by proposing a “still incomplete” compensation plan.“RB Korea’s move  seems like an effort to end the situation as quickly as possible as the prosecution investigation nears the end,” said Lee Ye-do, a family member of the victim.“We have waited for five years to see whether we could get compensated. Why is RB Korea in such a hurry to conclude everything so soon?” asked another family member of the victim. The prosecution said last week that the five-month investigation into toxic humidifier disinfectants would come to an end, with charges being pressed against some 20 people related to the incident. The subjected companies include Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, Lotte Mart, Home Plus and Cefu.RB Korea said that it had formed a task force team to process the compensation payment and complete the payment to the victims by the end of this year. It added that there are no more planned rounds of official meetings with victims and their families.

The percentage of people below 30 decreased to 9.9 percent of the total from 25.5 percent in 1995, while those for people over 50 increased to 26.3 percent from 13.9 percent.The trend is attributed to the abolishment in 2009 of the age limit in applying for the state-run test to become a civil servant, extension of retirement in 2009 for mid-level civil servants and an unstable job market that is forcing more educated people to seek jobs in the government.Reflecting this, among the local government officials, the number of university graduates with a master's degree rose significantly to 22,336 last year from 3,607 in 1995 and that with a bachelor's degree also increased to 230,909 from 107,203.Meanwhile, women are increasingly accounting for a bigger portion of the workforce at the regional government level.

Among the 51 women who secured seats in the parliament, 25 of them were elected by proportional representation. “Both the ruling and the opposition parties had initially pledged that they’d allocate 30 percent of all nominations for assembly constituencies to women, but it never ended up happening,” researchers for the group wrote in their report.  Rep. Lee Hye-hoon of the Saenuri Party. Researchers also found that almost 90 percent of the 26 women who won the constituency seats, including Rep. Nam In-soon from The Minjoo Party of Korea and Rep. Lee Hye-hoon from the Saenuri Party, had run in the Seoul metropolitan area, suggesting that “gender disparity may be more prevalent in regional politics,” said Choi Seon-young, a researcher at the organization. Rep. Nam In-soon of The Minjoo Party of Korea. The only three female politicians who won constituency seats outside the metropolitan area are Rep. Kwon Eun-hee from the People’s Party, who ran in Gwangju, Rep. Cho Bae-sook from the same party, who ran in Iksan, North Jeolla Province, and Rep. Kim Jeong-jae from the Saenuri Party, who ran in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province.Rep. Cho Bae-sook of the People’s Party. Also, none of the 33 candidates who did not belong to the four major parties -- the Saenuri Party, the Minjoo Party of Korea, the People’s Party and the Justice Party -- were able to win a seat. “This shows how hard it is for women to win seats as either independent candidates or members of smaller parties,” researcher Choi told The Korea Herald. “Also, the fact that parties avoid nominating women for constituencies means that there’s gender disparity within the parties. We also assume that the lack of resources and mentoring programs for aspiring women politicians who are based in remote regions is a contributing factor.”The organization also surveyed 909 Koreans aged 19 or older on women’s presence in Korean politics as well as the results of the 20th general election held in April. Researchers found that 69.5 percent of participants think that women are not participating enough in politics, despite Korea being a developed nation.  When asked why they think women are being underrepresented in parliament, the biggest proportion of the participants -- 26.6 percent of them -- said it’s because “ Koreans don’t feel comfortable with women politicians.” Meanwhile, 24.5 percent said it has to do with the public’s prejudiced thoughts that male politicians are “supposed to be more capable” than their female counterparts.However, a significantly high proportion of the participants, 37.8 percent, said for future elections they would vote for a female candidate if she were competing against a male politician whose credentials and experiences were similar to her own. At the same time, 29.1 percent of participants said they would vote for the male candidate even if the female candidate had a resume just as good as his.Currently, Rwanda and Bolivia have the highest number of seats held by women lawmakers in their national parliaments.

More than 92 percent of lawmakers from the third-largest People’s Party supported a revision.Compared with the two opposition parties, the ruling party appeared to take a more cautious stance as President Park Geun-hye has been opposed to the revision on the grounds that the issue could divert attention from more urgent issues, such as revitalizing the economy.The current election system is based on a mixed form of a small electoral system, in which one person represents one constituency, and a proportional representation arrangement. It has long been criticized for worsening regionalism and encouraging elected politicians to focus only on the interests of their provincial voters. It remains to be seen whether a change in the Constitution could actually happen as there has been little consensus among potential presidential contenders over when and how it should be carried out.To rewrite the Constitution, either the president or half of the 300 lawmakers have to propose a change in a motion, which must be approved by more than two-thirds of the lawmakers and supported by a majority of voters in a national referendum.In the survey, 46.8 percent of those polled said they favor a presidential system in which the chief executive is allowed to serve two four-year terms. The current system bars the president from seeking reelection. Meanwhile, 24.4 percent of lawmakers said they were in favor of a “dual executive system” under which more power is given to the prime minister, while 14 percent supported the adoption of a purely parliamentary cabinet system like the one in Japan.The dual executive system is a power-sharing model in which the prime minister is given substantial power in handling state affairs, such as public security, economic policies and personnel, while the president is in charge of external affairs, including foreign affairs and defense.As for the timing of the revision, 47.6 percent of those surveyed said that the revision should be completed before the presidential election in December next year, while 41.2 percent said that the revision should be carried out under the next government.Meanwhile, the survey also found that 65.6 percent of those in favor of the constitutional revision acknowledged that the revision should come with a change in the current election system. But 28.8 percent of them remained opposed to the change in the election system.In light of the growing calls, some senior lawmakers appear to be taking a more active stance. Rep. Won Hye-young.The Minjoo Party’s fifth-term lawmaker Rep. Won Hye-young over the weekend said that he was picking up the suspended move to launch a cross-party group to discuss constitutional revision.“As there is high focus being paid to the constitutional change, the discussion will greatly pick up pace if there is a group dedicated to it,” Won told a local media outlet. “As each lawmaker and each party has different suggestions to discuss the amendment,  will pave a way for the discussion to be conducted in an open manner that fits the spirit of the current times.”Won had previously pushed to open such a meeting during the 19th Assembly. Prior to his latest move, Won reportedly shared common ground with the party’s members that have been vocal about the need for a change to the Constitution. They include Assembly Secretary-General designate Woo Yoon-keun and Reps. Baek Jae-hyun, Jeon Hae-cheol and Lee Choon-suak.“The group will also gather members belonging to the Saenuri Party. Rep. Na Kyung-won has also showed willingness to join,” Won was quoted as saying. He has also reportedly relayed his proposal to Saenuri Party’s veteran Rep. Suh Chung-won, who leads the faction loyal to President Park. Suh reportedly responded that he would think about it.Another pro-Park member and former head of the Korean Constitutional Law Association Rep. Chong Jong-sup has also created a research gathering to “innovate the state,” along with the Minjoo Party’s sixth-term Rep. Moon Hee-sang and People’s Party’s third-term Rep. Yoo Sung-yop. Within this week, Won said he will send out a letter urging for a full-fledged discussion on the constitutional amendment to the 300 members of the new Assembly.“A constitutional change is the demand of the times, and the main agent for the change is undoubtedly the National Assembly. No matter what position Cheong Wa Dae takes, it is the Assembly’s job to fulfill its innate role,” Won said on his Facebook page.","all 300 lawmakers showed sunday ,300 lawmakers showed sunday ,300 lawmakers showed sunday that ,last week with heavyweight politicians ,growing calls some senior lawmakers","['the National Assembly', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Park Geun', 'Japan', 'Won Hye - young', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Won Hye - young', 'Won', 'the 19th Assembly', 'Won', 'Assembly', 'Woo Yoon - keun', 'Baek Jae - hyun', 'Jeon Hae - cheol', 'Lee Choon', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Na Kyung - won', 'Won', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Suh Chung - won', 'Suh', 'the Korean Constitutional Law Association', 'Chong Jong - sup', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Hee - sang', 'People ’s Party ’s', 'Yoo Sung - yop', 'Won', 'Assembly', 'the National Assembly', 'Cheong', 'Dae', 'Assembly', 'Won']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64532775  0.81509537

The index was developed by the World Health Organization to evaluate the level of drinking habit. The AUDIT score of stressed-out single women was 6.9 points, which was 1.25 points higher than those who felt less stress.The score of those with depression was 7.81 points, which was about 2 points higher than those with no depression. The score is determined based on the frequency and amount of drinking as well as self-control ability. People with an AUDIT score of over 8 are considered to have a problematic drinking habit. “The survey showed that single women not only have higher stress or depression but also tend to cope with their mental problems by drinking,” said researcher Kim Hyo-jung who participated in the study.“Drinking can negatively impacted their health, including pregnancy.”Another survey in 2014 by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs had shown that the high-risk drinking rate -- drinking at least five glasses of alcohol a day, more than twice a week -- had surged to 6 percent in 2012 from 3.4 percent in 2005 among women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.Experts have noted the higher risk of alcohol dependency among women who choose to drink alone to evade societal prejudice against women who drink.The study was published in the latest issue of Perspectives in Nursing Science, a journal published by Seoul National University Research Institute of Nursing Science.

The key action plan is to limit the entry of old diesel-powered cars into the Seoul metropolitan area and to shut down coal-powered power generation plants which have been in action for 40 years or more.Reflecting the study result that diesel vehicles account for 30 percent of fine dust emissions in the city, the government will also increase funds to replace bus fuel from diesel to compressed natural gas. A special tax cut will be offered to CNG buses, starting from 2018.It also pledged to increase the proportion of environment friendly electric cars up to 30 percent by 2020, and to establish some 3,000 electric charging stations around the nation.As for barbecue places, authorities decided to provide subsidies so that they may set up filtered vents to reduce the amount of smoke and dust particles.Earlier on, the Environment Ministry suggested that the roasting of pork and fish accounted for a considerable amount of fine dust emissions, raising the argument that it was shifting the blame onto restaurant owners.The task force did not, however, include a diesel price hike, a plan earlier suggested by the ministry but which was met with fierce backlash from industrial circles.Fine dust refers to particles that are smaller than 10 micrometers which are known to cause various respiratory problems and harm the human immune system.A fine dust watch is to be issued when the average concentration exceeds 65 micrograms per cubic meter over the past 24 hours or remains at 90 micrograms per cubic meter for more for two hours straight.By Bae Hyun-jung","gas special tax cut will ,replace bus fuel from diesel ,friday that it will abolish ,however include diesel price hike ,for possible diesel price hike","['south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'european', 'Hwang', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.31084719 -0.08770689

The victims and their families sued the government last month, claiming that authorities had allegedly overlooked harms from toxic humidifier disinfectant since 2011.Environment Vice Minister Jeong Yeon-man leaves the briefing room after announcing additional subsidy plans for humidifier disinfectant victims on Friday. Along with the subsidy, the government will also provide the victims and their families with counseling for any mental suffering.The ministry also said that it would expand medical checkups at eight more hospitals across the country, so more victims can find out whether their symptoms are linked to the disinfectants. As of now, Asan Medical Center in downtown Seoul is responsible for treating applicants who have reported such health problems.The current damage reporting system will be revamped to allow victims to file damage complaints year-around. Until now, the reports were received only when the ministry conducted related surveys.Meanwhile, the prosecution carried on with its probe on the distributors and sellers of the harmful humidifier disinfectants.On Friday, the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office summoned the former CEOs of Lotte Mart and of Homeplus for questioning, mainly on whether they had conducted safety test on their disputed products. Humidifier disinfectants containing PHMG were on sale at the two wholesale stores in 2004 and 2006 respectively, allegedly causing more than 41 and 28 deaths each.Since the toxicity of the disinfectant was first reported back in 2011, South Korea has confirmed 221 victims, of which 177 had used Oxy products, produced by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser.By Kim Da-sol","940 000 won per month ,humidifier disinfectant victims on friday ,victims with monthly living costs ,humidifier disinfectant victims with monthly ,checkups at eight more hospitals","['the Environment Ministry', 'the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act', 'Jeong Yeon - man', 'Jeong Yeon - man', 'Asan Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Central Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Lotte Mart', 'Homeplus', 'South Korea', 'Oxy', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Kim Da - sol']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34973991  0.32366258

The said clause was first introduced as a guideline in June 2014 and was formally implemented earlier this month.According to the ministry, officers who were in the bottom 5 percent in terms of patient evaluation will all be forwarded to a relocation committee. They include officers deemed as neglectful in writing their medical charts, or have faced three or more complaints of rudeness.A personnel official of the Defense Ministry said the new measure will preemptively prevent possible slacking of medical officers. YonhapThe new posts of such officers will be at places less favored by them, officials said.But relocating the substandard officers to less-favored locations has sparked concerns about the well-being of soldiers already stationed there. The general outposts adjacent to the inter-Korea border are known to be least favored by most soldiers, while being the most likely places for injuries.“The criteria for relocation is not based on the medical officers’ medical skills or competence, but is based on their attitude at work,” said a ministry personnel, emphasizing that the regulation would not necessarily mean that the underqualified officers will be dispatched to the frontlines.He added that the officials will hold further reviews on implementing or revising the new clause.There have been reports of substandard treatment by some of the military medical officers. Medical officers outrank most of their patients, most of whom are enlisted soldiers.In 2013, the military hospital diagnosed corporal Shin Sung-min with a simple headache. But his personal visit to a civilian hospital during his leave revealed a brain tumor that eventually killed him five months later.The military reform team of the minority opposition Justice Party recently revealed a case in which  military officers overlooked the severe injury of two brothers, both of whom were servicemen at the time, and pressured them to return to their platoon, accusing them of feigning injury. The belated treatment resulted in the two getting complex regional pain syndrome, a form of chronic pain associated with the nervous system.By Yoon Min-sik","medical officers yonhapthe new posts ,months later the military reform ,the military hospital diagnosed corporal ,involve relocating medical officers evaluated ,2013 the military hospital diagnosed","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Shin Sung - min', 'Justice Party', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30834022  0.60939294

The study randomly picked officers of different ranks in nine types of Army units. BMI is derived by dividing the weight by the square of the height. A value above 25 is regarded as obese, and between 23 and 25 is viewed as overweight.The link between the years in service and weight gain was highly visible. The chances of obesity for those in service for over 20 years were 3.41 times higher than those who had been in the Army for less than a year.Officers in front line units were 3.65 times more likely to become fat than their counterparts posted in special warfare units.The number is even higher for officers at rear units, at 4.48 times.Authors of the study said that the frequent relocation that often results in having to live apart from family exposes the officers to eating out, irregular eating habits and an unbalanced diet compounded by work-related stress and sleeping disorders that raise the risk of obesity.""We need weight control programs for officers who have been in service for lengthy periods and for those who are bound to desks in their jobs,"" Park said.

According to industry estimates, insurers have yet to pay 246.5 billion won  for suicide-related deaths.The tally said the number one cause of deaths for those in their teens was suicide by leaping from a tall building.

If a policyholder killed himself two years after he bought the policy, the life insurer has to deliver insurance benefits to his bereaved families without fail,"" an FSS official said.In a case of suicide by depression or other mental illness, life insurers also have to pay insurance money to the bereaved families of those who take their own lives. In this case, the insurers have to deliver the money regardless of the length of the policy-holding period, he said.""Insurance terms previously stipulated that insurance money should be paid in case of suicide two years after the purchase of the policy, or for a suicide resulting from a mental disorder,"" said the official. ""If insurers delay or refuse the payment of all suicide insurance money, they may face a probe  into their past payments of insurance money to customers.""From March 2015, the family of a policyholder who kills himself is required to apply for the suicide insurance money within three years of the suicide.

According to a survey conducted last year by Asan Medical Center’s medical professor Hong Soo-jong, 31.3 percent of children aged 7 were found to have used the humidifier disinfectant at home. About 1,500 children were surveyed. Participants attend a forum on ecotoxic substances at the National Assembly on Wednesday. “If their families are included, about 30 percent of the total Korean population is speculated to have used the disinfectant,” said Hong at the second forum on ecotoxic substances held by the Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology and Korean Society of Environmental Health. Hong claimed that the disinfectant may have affected organs other than the lungs. “According to the toxicity experiment of PHMG and PGH, fish which were exposed to those chemicals died within 70 minutes, which indicates that they affect other organs. Rhinitis, diabetes, arteriosclerosis or fatty liver should also be considered,” said Hong. Occupational medicine professor Paek Do-Myung of Seoul National University suggested that about 11 million of the population might have been exposed to the disinfectant -- about 22 percent of the population -- considering the three rounds of a health probe conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its epidemiologic survey. Paek was cochair of the probe team.“Although the significant association between the product toxicity and lung damage has already been revealed, more concrete facts should be uncovered. The government and civic groups should draw up support measures that embraces the victims,” said Paek. Meanwhile, another former CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser is likely to be summoned later this month, investigators said. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said it would soon question former Korean-American CEO John Lee who had headed Oxy -- currently RB Korea -- from June 2005 to May 2010. This period was when sales of toxic humidifier disinfectant had soared. The 48-year-old has been serving as the chief of Google Korea since 2014. The prosecution will look into whether he had known of the product’s toxicity and whether he had responsibility in decisions to skip the safety test. It will also question him about whether there was direction or involvement from the U.K. headquarters over the sales. Lee is the second former CEO to be summoned. Former Oxy CEO Shin Hyun-woo was arrested Saturday for accidental homicide charges along with two other officials including Oxy’s senior researcher surnamed Choi. In the latest revelation of evidence, prosecutors said Choi had been warned of chemical toxicity in 2000 by the head of a household chemical product manufacturer surnamed Noh whose firm had developed the humidifier disinfectant for the first time in 1994. When the two met in 2000, Noh reportedly said that an independent safety test must be conducted as the inhalation-toxicity of PHMG had not been proven anywhere in the world. Noh had substantial experience in the field, having acquired more than 10 patents in the use of disinfectant substances.  When the prosecution raided Oxy’s office and research center in February, it found a note that Choi had written about Noh’s warning. The humidifier disinfectant was introduced in the market in October 2000 without the inhalation-toxicity test.By Lee Hyun-jeong","30 percent of the korean ,arrested saturday for accidental homicide ,question former korean american ceo ,those chemicals died within 70 ,disinfectant an expert claimed wednesday","['korean', 'Asan Medical Center ’s', 'Hong Soo - jong', 'the National Assembly', 'korean', 'Hong', 'the Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology', 'Korean Society of Environmental Health', 'Hong', 'PHMG', 'PGH', 'rhinitis', 'Hong', 'Paek Do - Myung', 'Seoul National University', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'paek', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'korean - american', 'John Lee', 'Oxy', 'RB Korea', 'Google Korea', 'U.K.', 'Lee', 'Oxy', 'Shin Hyun - woo', 'Oxy ’s', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Noh', 'Noh', 'PHMG', 'Oxy ’s', 'Choi', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43016437  0.81074256

Jeju Free International City Development Center, an investment arm of the Ministry of Land, Transport and Infrastructure, established Haeul to take charge of the project.The South Korean government first floated the ambitious education experiment in 2008 as a growing number of parents sent their children abroad so they could learn English and avoid the brutally intense competition of the Korean educational system.  But the boom in early study abroad often resulted in the separation of families, with the mother accompanying the children abroad and fathers earning the money at home and occasionally flying to visit them, garnering the nickname ""wild goose dads.""North London Collegiate School from Britain opened the first sister school in Jeju in 2011, followed by Korea International School by South Korean language education company YBM and Branksome Hall Asia from Canada. St. Johnsbury Academy, a private American boarding school, will open its Jeju campus containing primary and secondary schools in September 2016.   ""The project was initially aimed at absorbing demands for overseas study by offering a more global and English-language curricula at home. So far, it has fulfilled its initial purpose as more students are opting to come to Jeju for a better education,"" Jung Wook-su, the chief executive of Haeul, said during a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""This is only beginning. We plan to attract not only Korean students but also talent from Asian neighbors, including China, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.""The average registration rate started from 35 percent of the full capacity, and now stands at 70 percent. About half of the students are from Seoul and 15 percent of students are foreign nationals, with most of them Chinese. Annual tuition fees range from 25-50 million won depending on grades and residence options, which are much more expensive than Korean public schools and less than comparative programs in such countries as the U.S. and Britain that entail additional living costs.Jung said that the schools expect to fill 80 percent of the full capacity within two years, which would cause them to turn to black for the first time. ""I think we will be able to make a turnaround by 2018,"" the 53-year-old said.While Incheon Free Economic Zone was considered one of the potential candidates for the project to draw students from wealthy families living in the Seoul metropolitan region, the official said Jeju is better suited for such a global project as it is more free from government influence. ""Jeju's status as a special autonomous province gives it a competitive edge over other regions, making it an ideal test bed to draw foreign investment,"" Jung said. ""Air travel also gives a feeling of being abroad, while it is close to allow families to get together more often.""The southern resort island is a one-hour flight from Seoul and Shanghai, and two hours from Beijing, with low-cost carriers offering cheap fares. The project initially planned to invite 12 prestigious foreign schools by 2015, but Haeul has lowered the target to seven by 2021. Talks are currently underway to attract direct investment from private institutions, he said. English proficiency and a diploma from a foreign university can give anyone an easy pass to land decent jobs when returning to South Korea in the past, but the prolonged economic slowdown has now created a hard time in the tight job market for those with a lack of connections here. That has made more people rethink when considering making the big investment in studying abroad, as early as elementary school. As a result, the fever of study abroad has recently lost steam with the number of students from elementary to high schools dipping to slightly over 10,000, nearly one-third of the peak at 2006, according to education ministry data.Having seen the early batch of graduates enter top-ranking universities abroad also sparked more interest in Jeju among eager Korean parents.  ""The first year of graduates showed good results in terms of receiving admissions from prestigious universities abroad, and second year graduates have produced even better outcome,"" he said.The global education infrastructure also allows foreign investors to bring their families to do business in the popular vacation destination with an accommodative visa policy. Several large-scale development projects are currently underway, involving China's property developers Greenland Group and Landing International Development Ltd as well as Genting Singapore Plc., Southeast Asia's largest casino operator.""There are many Chinese investors who operate businesses here and also want to educate their children,"" Jung said. ""I expect a steady surge in the number of Chinese students attending these schools as their parents have to stay here to run their business."" Jung said a diverse mix of ethnicity and background is important to help students improve communication skills and develop a global perspective. ""We are making efforts to double the ratio of foreign students from the current 15 percent to 30 percent,"" he said, noting overseas presentations in such major Chinese cities as Beijing and Shanghai. To be able to compete with Asia's education hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong, Jung called for the government to ease regulatory hurdles to foster a global education campus. A bill aimed at easing rules on schools sending profits to their home country is currently pending in parliament. ""After having four English-speaking campuses, we are considering hosting specialized schools related to arts, tourism and China,"" he said. In response to the unavoidable criticism over the schools only for those ""born with a silver spoon in their mouth,"" Jung said the government has assigned 500 million won to scholarships for students from lower-income families since last year. The amount, however, is not enough to draw a meaningful number of low-income families to the schools, which charge extra money on some afterschool programs and overseas excursions. ""Opportunities should not just open to a few selected children from affluent family background,"" the official said, though he fell short of elaborating on support measures citing Haeul's operating deficit at present.","jeju global education city landed ,first sister school in jeju ,jeju for better education jung ,invite 12 prestigious foreign schools ,trillion won education project","['the Ministry of Land , Transport and Infrastructure', 'Haeul', 'south korean', 'korean', 'London Collegiate School', 'Britain', 'Jeju', 'Korea International School', 'south korean', 'YBM', 'Canada', 'St. Johnsbury Academy', 'american', 'Jeju', 'Jeju', 'Jung Wook - su', 'Haeul', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'korean', 'asian', 'China', 'Japan', 'southeast asian', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Britain', 'Jung', 'Seoul', 'Jeju', 'Jeju', 'Jung', 'Seoul', 'Shanghai', 'Beijing', 'Haeul', 'english', 'South Korea', 'Jeju', 'korean', 'China', 'Greenland Group and Landing International Development Ltd', 'Genting Singapore Plc', 'chinese', 'Jung', 'chinese', 'Jung', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'Shanghai', 'Singapore', 'Hong Kong', 'Jung', 'China', 'Jung', 'Haeul']",0,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.20044994  0.48040938

Taking into account extra payment for business expenses such as the cost of running the office and supporting legislative work, the lawmakers’ salary amounts to 235 million won. Considering the payment given to his aides and staff, the total payment is estimated to be 676 million per year.The six figure salary has often been singled out as extravagant privileges granted to the lawmakers. In a 2014 survey conducted by then main opposition Democratic United Party, more than 70 percent of respondents said that the lawmakers’ high income was “unnecessary” and that the salary should be reduced.

The team studied 403,250 babies born in 2009-2010 in seven major cities, based on health insurance applications. The findings were published in the newest edition of the journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.Statistics provided in the study showed birth defects during the measured period, 548.3 per 10,000, or 5.5 per 100, was an increase from 3.7 per 100 in the years 1993-1994. In the latest study, the ratio of anomalies was higher among boys than girls, 306.8 per 10,000 compared with 241.5 per 10,000.  The most common abnormalities were found in the circulatory system, 180.8 per 10,000, followed by urinary organs  and musculoskeletal functions , according to the study. The number of cases of urinary system anomalies, which was 0.7 per 10,000 in 1993-1994 period, jumped to 9.9 in the 2009-2010 period.Heart defects from a hole in the heart, known as atrial septal defect; cystic kidney disease; and dislocated hip joints also showed an increase over the measured periods. Other defects have decreased, notably anencephaly, or an absence of a major portion of the brain and skull, that fell from 3.4 per 10,000 to 0.05, and problems in the pulmonary valve, which decreased from 23.1 to 8.2. The research team did not provide conclusions on the causes of these congenital defects but conjectured that those related to the circulatory system could be from technological advances in detecting the problems at the birth stage and from environmental pollution. Hormonal imbalances in mothers from environmental hormones and other external factors were cited as possible reasons for abnormalities in the urethral and reproductive systems.""The rate of some of the birth defects in the country is very high, and we direly need to make efforts to prevent them,"" professor Lim Jong-han, who led the study, said of the results.

The control group was comprised of 60 same-age, same-gender peers who lived in the same neighborhoods but didn't use the sterilizers.Instead of releasing the survey results, the CDC belatedly announced them in the form of a thesis in the U.S. science journal of PLOS one in 2015. It sparked criticisms that it should have revealed the results sooner given the severity of the lung damage in affected consumers.Most of the victims used humidifier sterilizers made by Britain's Oxy Reckitt Benckiser. Oxy is currently being probed by state prosecutors over its toxic humidifier sterilizers that have been cited for causing many deaths and illnesses. Oxy started selling its products here in 2001.Korea confirmed 221 people as victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products. Out of 90 deaths, 70 are believed to have been using Oxy products. In early May, Oxy Korea CEO Ata Safdar made an official apology and vowed to fully cooperate with the Korean government in the ongoing investigation. Now the focus is on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Prosecutors reportedly plan to summon several foreign executives, including former CEO John Lee, definitely involved in key management decisions at Oxy Korea in mid and late 2000s. They are suspected of pushing forward sales of the toxic products despite consumer complaints about side effects.The ruling Saenuri Party will ""positively"" consider holding a parliamentary hearing and probe into the case in a follow-up to the on-going prosecution investigation, party officials said after their consultation with the government earlier in the day.The party also agreed with the government to hold safety tests of each and every biocide product on the domestic market, the officials also said.","lung damage in 16 people ,humidifier sterilizers increased the risk ,lung damage in affected consumers ,state health agency said sunday ,90 deaths 70 are believed","['the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'U.S.', 'PLOS', 'Britain', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Oxy', 'Oxy', 'Oxy', 'Oxy', 'Oxy Korea', 'Ata Safdar', 'korean', 'John Lee', 'Oxy Korea', 'Saenuri Party']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21981362  0.84165859

Questions, however, persist over the direction of the investigation, the current legal system and the government’s role in the tragedy that has led to more than 200 deaths allegedly caused by using the products.“We are going to help them with practical compensation, by discussing with representatives of the victims group within this week,” an official from the special probe team was quoted as saying.A group of protesters participate in a campaign to boycott Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products calling for corporate punishment for the firms behind toxic humidifier disinfectants during a press conference in Seoul on Monday. Park Ki-ho, a male victim’s father, told The Korea Herald, “We decided to work with lawyers from the Lawyers for a Democratic Society and we will strive to get our voice heard until the firms  apologize in front of us.” Victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectant agreed Sunday in a closed-door meeting to push ahead with a group litigation. Victims and their families also decided to promote the boycott of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products. According to the prosecution, the special probe team is set to summon four executives of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- including former CEO Shin Hyun-woo -- on Tuesday. Shin headed the firm in 2001 when it started selling the disputed humidifier disinfectant. Last week, the prosecution reconfirmed the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report that there is a significant association between the health impacts and the use of Oxy’s humidifier disinfectant.The KCDCP in 2011 had submitted a report that the use of humidifier disinfectant can cause serious health damage.However, the company submitted its own 77-page report last month to refute this, saying the deaths may have been triggered by other factors such as yellow dust in spring. The prosecution argued that the newly submitted report has “low credibility.”Oxy’s PR agency Prain Global told The Korea Herald that the firm’s additional report was in line with “earnest cooperation with all investigations and steps to pursue a solution.”Experts voiced concern that it could take several years to figure out whether the deaths of disinfectant users were due to yellow dust as claimed by the company. They would need to conduct additional tests to figure out the correlation or redo the toxicity test for the use of disputed humidifier disinfectant. According to the Korea Institute of Toxicology, experiment on toxic chemicals and its health impacts normally takes 24 to 36 months to ensure the accuracy of the test.“Experiments to test harmful chemicals or carcinogenic substances on animals take at least two years. Chemicals that are tested by inhalation  may especially take longer with more detailed processes, with at least 1 billion won  as experiment fee,” an official from KIT told The Korea Herald. Prain Global said it cannot check whether Oxy will conduct another toxicity test on its disputed humidifier disinfectant. Experts also criticized the weak legal basis to punish the companies, as well as the government’s unsystematic reaction to the incident. Current law has no stipulation to punish companies responsible for huge loss of lives.In July 2015, some 800 civilians signed and submitted a legislation petition to the National Assembly in order to penalize companies who do not follow due civic and crime responsibility.In 2014, when the sinking of the Sewol ferry left 304 dead or missing, then-ship operator Cheonghaejin Marine Co. was only fined 10 million won for an oil spill. The prosecution last week summoned officials from Oxy’s marketing team to question them over false advertising and for claiming that its products are “99 percent sterilized and not harmful even to children.”“It is quite a light punishment for Oxy to just get penalized for false advertising, which can amount to a maximum of 150 million won in fines,” lawyer Hwang Kyung-hwa told The Korea Herald.“The Environment Ministry designated more than 200 patients to just one hospital in Seoul, which takes about three years per patient to check if their health damages are related to the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant. Even before the cause of their health damage is confirmed, the statute of limitation against firms behind the toxic disinfectants will lapse,” she added.On Monday, Rep. Jang Ha-na from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea contended that local chemical manufacturer SK Chemical should be held responsible as well for producing and selling PHMG, saying that “the firm was aware of the toxicity of the chemical when inhaled.”“SK Chemical should step up and take responsibility for providing the base material of the disputed humidifier disinfectants to companies,” said Rep. Jang in a statement. The prosecution said they would focus on finding out whether the Oxy executives had known of the toxicity of PHMG contained in their products, as well as whether they had destroyed related evidence after four disinfectant users died in 2011. It will also question if the firm fabricated the materials safety data sheet, on suspicion that Oxy bribed professors at Seoul National University and Hoseo University in exchange for overlooking toxicity test results.By Kim Da-sol","toxic humidifier disinfectant agreed sunday ,prosecution last week summoned officials ,humidifier disinfectants during press conference ,products calling for corporate punishment ,million won in fines lawyer","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Seoul', 'Park Ki - ho', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'victim', 'victim', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Shin Hyun - woo', 'Shin', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s', 'Oxy ’s', 'KCDCP', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Korea Institute of Toxicology', 'KIT', 'the Korea Herald', 'Oxy', 'the National Assembly', 'Cheonghaejin Marine Co.', 'Oxy ’s', 'Hwang Kyung - hwa', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul', 'Jang Ha - na', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'SK Chemical', 'PHMG', 'Chemical', 'Jang', 'Oxy', 'PHMG', 'Oxy', 'Seoul National University and Hoseo University', 'Kim Da - sol']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30550033  0.48254961

139,139,Korea aims to ease commutes with more double-decker buses,"At 6:50 a.m., a group of people with eyes half-closed make a long line outside Seoul Station.“This is quite usual (to wait in a long line). Even if the bus is packed, I will still hop on and ride the bus standing for the entire 40 minutes,” said Jeong Hye-ryoung, who commutes to Pangyo in Gyeonggi Province for work every day.Like Jeong, as many as 24,000 or 12.5 percent of bus commuters in the metropolitan region t...","At 6:50 a.m., a group of people with eyes half-closed make a long line outside Seoul Station.“This is quite usual . Even if the bus is packed, I will still hop on and ride the bus standing for the entire 40 minutes,” said Jeong Hye-ryoung, who commutes to Pangyo in Gyeonggi Province for work every day.Like Jeong, as many as 24,000 or 12.5 percent of bus commuters in the metropolitan region travel crammed into a bus daily, barely standing up and holding onto the seat for safety every morning. Gyeonggi Research Institute estimates an average bus commute to be over 61 minutes.According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, there are 2,203 red buses -- which run between downtown Seoul and nearby suburban areas in Incheon and Gyeonggi Province -- on 166 bus routes. Passengers wait at a bus stop. In July 2014, the Transport Ministry banned standing in a traveling bus for safety reasons. But faced with protests from commuters, the ministry eased the restriction, instead promising to replace the packed single buses with double-decker buses as soon as possible.Buses operated by Gyeonggi Province that travel to and from Seoul -- also called Mbuses -- are normally equipped with 39 to 41 seats. But double-decker buses can carry more passengers, with 79 seats. South Korea’s first double-decker bus was introduced in December 2014, as part of a pilot operation by the Transport Ministry and the municipalities to alleviate road traffic.There are nine double-decker buses running in Seoul so far, still far too few to dramatically ease the packed public transportation situation. Around 10 double-deckers will be added by August.The first double-decker bus introduced by Gyeonggi Province to operate between Gimpo and Seoul “We are seeing that one double-decker bus is more efficient than two single-decker buses, since the operation costs of buying the buses and put them on the street is similar ,” said Kwon Ho-jeong from the Transport Ministry’s public transportation division. “Our ultimate goal is to replace old single-decker buses with double-decker buses, without having to increase the current rotation rate of buses,” he added. The Gyeonggi Research Institute said that between October and March, the number of standing travelers in Namyangju and Gimpo in the province dropped by half after double-decker buses operated along those routes.The plan, however, has encountered several problems, including the current restrictions against vehicle height and resistance from bus operators, who cite budget limitations.Unlike those in Hong Kong or London, Korea’s road traffic law limits the maximum height of a bus to 4 meters.When considering the total height of double-decker buses, the second floor of a bus in Korea needs to be built with a lower ceiling of 168 centimeters in height or less. This means it is more difficult for taller people to use the upper deck, not to mention the added cost of adjusting the height of buses that do not meet specifications, as is the case with many models. In Hong Kong, double-decker buses are built 4.1 to 4.4 meters tall.The Transport Ministry explained that customizing the height of Korea’s double-decker buses is doable by getting them tailor-made or importing models that fit the standards set by the Automobile Management Act.“But it could be problematic when it comes to setting the price at an appropriate level as there are certain costs and budgets set by each municipality and operators to introduce the double-decker buses,” said Kwon Ho-jeong of the ministry’s public transport division.Some experts noted that flexibility may be needed to achieve the greater benefit of securing safety of commuters.“The reason  cannot be over 4 meters tall is because of sign boards or displays on the road. It does not cost too much to adjust those, so why not be realistic?” said professor Kim Young-chan of traffic design from University of Seoul. According to the industry insiders, local bus operators have also been reluctant to use double-decker buses due to purchasing and operation costs. One double-decker bus costs about 450 million won  -- with government funding of 300 million won putting the cost for bus operators at 150 million won.But the operators are still not keen to buy them, citing existing financial difficulties.An official at Gyeonggi Bus Workers’ Union, who wanted to be anonymous, claimed the numbers envisioned by the government were too vague.“The amount of funding is not enough , as we are running at a deficit,” he said.“, the ministry will increase bus capacities for passengers, either by introducing longer buses  or higher buses with more seats.” The Transport Ministry said it would not provide extra funding, but that it could consider arranging tax benefits.There are also criticisms that the high cost of the double-decker plan is due to the high price of the bus model selected by the ministry. The buses are manufactured by Volvo and imported from Taiwan. The government said the model was the “most optimized” one with its safety verified in other countries.Local double-decker buses made by companies such as Hyundai or Kia are priced at 150 million won , only 30 percent of the price of imported versions. The ministry officials said the option of switching to local brands is still being reviewed.By Kim Da-sol","crammed into bus daily ,travel crammed into bus daily ,into bus daily barely standing ,crammed into bus daily barely ,into bus daily","['Jeong Hye - ryoung', 'Pangyo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Jeong', 'Gyeonggi Research Institute', 'the Metropolitan Transportation Authority', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'South Korea ’s', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Gimpo', 'Seoul', 'Kwon Ho - jeong', 'the Transport Ministry ’s', 'the Gyeonggi Research Institute', 'Namyangju', 'Gimpo', 'Hong Kong', 'London', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Korea', 'the Automobile Management Act', 'Kwon Ho - jeong', 'Kim Young - chan', 'University of Seoul', 'Gyeonggi Bus Workers ’ Union', 'the Transport Ministry', 'Volvo', 'Taiwan', 'Hyundai', 'Kia', 'Kim Da - sol']",19,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19318041  0.07986867

I hope lawmakers can actively pass more bills to support younger generations,” said 24-year-old Kim Han-nuri, who voted in Itaewon and was recently discharged from his compulsory military duty in March.Voters wait in line at a polling station in Jamsil, Seoul, Wednesday. As of last month, just 643 out of 5,288 bills that passed the 19th National Assembly were related to youth employment. While younger people hoped to see more hardworking lawmakers, senior voters wished to see a harmonious National Assembly, disenchanted at the past 19th National Assembly.“I have been so disappointed in lawmakers so far, but I am here again  to give one more chance to work in harmony, regardless of their parties,” said 77-year-old Kim Jin-soon at a polling station in Itaewon 2-dong Community Service Center. “I think lawmakers forget to work on legislation and miss the right timing to pass bills because they fight all the time,” said a female voter in her 40s in Seocho-gu.In 2012, the votes were split approximately equally between ruling-party affiliated candidates and the rest, but the assembly was tainted with frequent scuffles over legislation.When the Sewol ferry disaster broke out in 2014, the National Assembly was faced with public criticism as a “vegetative National Assembly” for not being able to pass a single bill during a five-month period.With continued backbiting and delayed bills, some voters said they had lost hope in Korean politics.A taxi driver in his 50s who abstained from voting in this year’s general election questioned the eligibility of aspiring lawmakers.“To be honest, when I found out all three candidates who are running for my community have a criminal record for driving under the influence, I did not want to vote,” said Kim Yong-gyu, who lives in Seoul’s northwestern Yangcheon-gu.“If a lawmaker does not abide by the law, how can they lead the country? I really want to question their qualifications.”By Kim Da-sol","pass bills because they fight ,some 14 000 voting stations ,voter turnout public officials drove ,42 million eligible voters ,election commissions to encourage voting","['National Assembly', 'the National Election Commissions', 'Yongsan ’s Community Service Center', 'Kim Doo - jin', 'Yongsan', 'National Assembly', 'Kim', 'National Assembly', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Kim Han - nuri', 'Jamsil', 'Seoul', 'National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Kim Jin - soon', 'Community Service Center', 'the National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'korean', 'Kim Yong - gyu', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4300926   0.05262065

The jobless rate of those in the same age bracket also reached a monthly high of 12.5 percent in February.Against such a backdrop, both the ruling and main opposition parties have named creating jobs for young workers, or voters, as their No. 1 priority in their respective economic platforms ahead of the parliamentary elections to be held on April 13.They differ, however, as to how they are seeking to expand job opportunities.The ruling party insists companies are reluctant to invest more partly due to sluggish local spending.Kang Bong-kyun, a former finance minister and three-term lawmaker of the main opposition bloc who is currently leading the Saenuri's campaign committee, claims increased spending by firms, especially large conglomerates, will lead to more spending by smaller firms, which in turn will spur spending by general consumers.To this end, the 73-year-old has proposed the central bank take over outstanding loans of policy lenders, such as the Korea Development Bank, to private firms, which he says will allow the state-run banks to lend more to companies and thus lead to increased spending and investment by private firms.However, the proposal, dubbed a Korean-style quantitative easing, is causing a heated debate as it could be seen as an attempt to tell the Bank of Korea what to do while many say the central bank is and must be insulated from any outside pressure when making its monetary policy decisions.Unionized workers of the BOK dismissed the ruling party's campaign pledge as a populist idea, noting the very reason the central bank is legally protected from outside pressure is to prevent such an attempt by political parties to utilize or abuse the bank's note issuing rights for political gains.The call for the so-called Korean-style quantitative easing ""seriously undermines the independence of the central bank and is the worst populist idea,"" they said in a statement released Thursday, two days after Kang announced the party platform.Abusive or not, the main opposition party says the ruling party's economic policy will not save the local economy, let alone help a great number of local firms.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of the Minjoo Party and also a former finance minister, says the ruling party policy, if realized, will only benefit rich and large conglomerates, which are already sitting on record amounts of cash reserves.""The Saenuri government has consistently advocated quantitative easing and eased regulations for large conglomerates for the past eight years, but they have brought no changes to economic conditions while only driving the youth jobless rate to a record high of 12.5 percent,"" Kim said earlier.Following its victory in the upcoming elections, the main opposition party says it will encourage or require public firms to create more jobs for the young instead of entrusting a few, large private companies with the seemingly impossible task.Also, the party claims a recovery in spending can only be achieved when a majority of people and companies are able and willing to spend more.To this end, the opposition party has pledged to levy more taxes on large conglomerates, and use the fresh funds to help small and medium-sized firms.Its main campaign pledges also include increased monthly allowances for the elderly to help spur consumer spending.Currently, the government is paying an allowance of between 100,000 won and 200,000 won per month to about 70 percent of people aged 65 years or above.The Minjoo Party has promised to pay a flat amount of 300,000 won each month to all people aged 65 years or above.The ruling Saenuri Party, too, has accused the main opposition party of leaning on populist and empty pledges, noting there simply are not enough funds to realize all such promises.""Welfare programs must be pursued carefully while closely keeping in mind financial circumstances of the government,"" ruling party chairman Kim Moo-sung said. ""There is no country on Earth that can finance all populist welfare programs that are introduced recklessly without such care.""An earlier analysis showed the ruling party's campaign pledges will cost 56 trillion won over the 2017-2020 period, while those of the main opposition Minjoo Party will require nearly 148 trillion won over a five-year period starting in 2017.","high unemployment rate for young ,facing asia fourth largest economy ,record high unemployment rate for ,sluggish local spending kang bong ,record high unemployment rate","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Kang Bong - kyun', 'Saenuri', 'the Korea Development Bank', 'korean', 'BOK', 'korean', 'Kang', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'Minjoo Party']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.423713    0.25658375

Moreover, the number of new high school entrants slightly increased between 2015 and 2016, due to the so-called millennium baby boom.""The so-called 'demographic cliff' phenomenon, which began in elementary schools in 2008 and 2009, appears to have expanded to affect middle and high schools,"" a ministry official said.He noted that the local education authorities have begun measures to adjust the number of high school classes in anticipation of the upcoming demographic change.The Seoul Metropolitan Office Of Education, for instance, recently recommended that the number of high school classes in the capital city be reduced by about 700 by 2018.Education experts say the falling population of high school students will drastically pull down the competition ratio for entrance into domestic colleges and universities, starting in 2020.At present, about 550,000 people attend colleges and universities, including two-year colleges, in South Korea.South Korea has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members, stoking concerns that it could cripple the country's growth potential and possibly result in more welfare expenses.The government's latest data showed that the fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, stood at 1.24 in 2014, well below the proper level of 1.8 percent to sustain the current population. South Korea's population is projected to start to decrease in 2030, when it will peak at 52.16 million, with the pace of aging and the low birthrate to continue.","high school freshmen will shrink ,school freshmen will shrink ,high schools nationwide will fall ,school freshmen will shrink by ,new high school students decreased","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Education', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', ""South Korea 's""]",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48104244  0.37663469

The competition rate is 3.7 to one, compared with 4.84 to one in the 2004 parliamentary elections.The remaining 47 seats will be allocated to political parties according to the numbers of votes that they receive overall under proportional representation, the National Election Commission said late Friday.The election watchdog also said a total of 25 political parties participated in the elections, although three major parties -- the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party and the splinter People's Party -- currently hold most of the seats in the National Assembly. Other parties have little, if any, influence in local politics, as some of them were formed just one month ahead of the parliamentary elections.Ten candidates are set to face off in the Jongno Ward of central Seoul, making it the most heated race in the elections.Jongno Ward -- home to Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office and the government complex building -- is a crucial electoral district, as it carries political significance for candidates and their political parties.A recent poll showed that Oh Se-hoon of the ruling Saenuri Party is a frontrunner in Jongno Ward. He is set to face off against Chung Sye-kyun of the main opposition Minjoo Party, who currently represents Jongno Ward in the National Assembly.Oh resigned from the Seoul mayorship in 2011 after he failed to block an opposition-led free school lunch program in the city's first-ever referendum.In a country where about one-fifth of its 50 million people live in the capital city, the Seoul mayorship often serves as a key stepping stone for the country's president. Former President Lee Myung-bak served as Seoul mayor in the early 2000s before being elected president.Meanwhile, Lee Koon-hyon, a candidate of the ruling party, was elected even before the elections began, as he is the only candidate running in the country's southeastern port city of Tongyeong.In Seoul, nine candidates -- some of them from minor parties or independents -- have paid no taxes over the past five years, whileAhn Cheol-soo, head of the splinter People's Party, paid 20.7 billion won  in taxes over the same period.The election watchdog also said 82 out of the 205 candidates in Seoul have criminal records, including drunk driving, theft and violation of the country's National Security Law. The election watchdog said the richest candidate is Kim Byoung-gwan of the main opposition Minjoo Party. Kim's wealth is valued at 263.7 billion won. Kim is the largest shareholder of South Korea's online game developer Webzen Inc.

According to the report by the Government Public Ethics Committee, 74.6 percent of senior government officials reported an increase in their wealth in 2015. The average assets of those surveyed was 1.31 billion won  last year, up 55 million won from 2014.Under the country’s public service ethics act, 1,813 senior officials, including high-ranking government officials, lawmakers, senior judges, heads of municipalities and chiefs of universities, are required to report their personal assets every year. Government Public Ethics Committee officials look through the report on the wealth of high-ranking officials in the public sector. A rise in the value of real estate, stocks and personal savings contributed to the wealth gains, the committee said. President Park Geun-hye had assets of 3.5 billion won, up 349 million won from the previous year. The jump was attributed to royalties from her autobiography and the rise in value of her house in Samseong-dong in southern Seoul. Her book was published in 2013 in China, and more than 150,000 copies were sold. The richest government official was Woo Byung-woo, a senior official at Cheong Wa Dae, for the second consecutive year. He recorded personal wealth of 39.3 billion won. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon had the least wealth among 17 heads of municipalities for the fifth straight year, reporting a debt of 680 million won. By party, ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers were found to be wealthier than those in the opposition parties in general. When three lawmakers with over 50 million in wealth are excluded from the calculations, Saenuri lawmakers had an average of 2.33 billion won, while those from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea had an average of 1.3 billion won. Those from the minor opposition People’s Party had an average of 1.9 billion won. The wealthiest lawmaker was entrepreneur-turned-politician Ahn Cheol-soo, cochairman of People’s Party, with his wealth of 162.9 billion won. His assets shrank by 78.1 billion won as he donated half of his shares in AhnLab to a charity last year. But the value of the remaining shares increased by 85.1 billion won. Six lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party, two from People’s Party and two independent lawmakers comprised the top 10 richest lawmakers.The poorest lawmaker was Rep. Jin Seon-mi, reporting debt of 1.4 billion won. Meanwhile, three in 10 senior officials refused to disclose the wealth of their families. They are allowed to decline to reveal their family’s wealth when their family members are able to make a living independently. The committee also found that about 13 percent of the 3,147 senior officials falsely reported their wealth. It took disciplinary action against one official, imposed financial penalties on 10 and cautioned 400.

It marked the second consecutive year of decline, following a 2.1-percent drop in 2014. According to the statistics agency, the number appears to be falling again this year, with the tally for the January-February period showing a 1.2-percent decline.The trend is new, considering that the number of stay-home married women has been increasing every year from 2000 when related recordkeeping began. The increase had continued even as young women were starting to have careers of their own from 2000. For instance, in the age group of 25 to 54, the percentage of economically active married women rose from under 50 in 1990 to 59.6 percent in 2015.The cycle was broken only in 2014, with marked changes among elderly housewives. The number of households where both husband and wife work increased 2.6 percent last year from the year prior. This compares with a 6.7-percent rise for couples in their 60s, the largest hike of all age groups, and a 4.7-percent hike for those in their 50s. Contrarily, the number for couples in their 30s fell 0.4 percent.Experts say part of the phenomenon of older women working has to do with demographic shifts as the society ages, but it also has to do with the elderly having to work to sustain livelihood.""The rising trend of home prices has been broken and interest rates have fallen, dragging down the value of assets,"" Lee Geun-tae, senior researcher with LG Economic Research Institute, said.

The disaster pushed up the national average.According to the ministry, the rapid increase in the number of maritime accidents is largely blamed on poor maintenance of vessels and equipment.Accidents from poor maintenance rose to 854 ships last year from 377 in 2014, while those due to using faulty equipment sharply increased to 676 ships from the previous year's 305.Also accidents involving vessels that drifted due to empty fuel tanks shot up to 224 from 104 the previous year.By type of vessel, fishing boats accounted for most of the accidents, at 1,566, followed by water leisure crafts at 324 incidents, and tugboats and barges at 145.With the rise in the number of maritime accidents, the safety ministry plans to organize what it calls a vessel safety consultative body to make prompt and follow-up measures after maritime accidents.Meanwhile, the Coast Guard will also start operating a mobile maritime safety corps by the end of May to crack down on vessels operating without properly working transceivers, navigating under the influence of alcohol and fishing in off-limit areas.","accidents last year was double ,previous year 305 also accidents ,year was double the annual ,year resulting in 112 deaths ,300 people died when the","['the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'the Coast Guard']",1,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71307272  0.76051092

But now, Kim rarely goes to the library. Instead, she simply turns to the Internet to download digital books and reports available.“Most of the reading material is up online, so I don’t find it necessary to go to libraries now,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “I prefer to download material from an e-library as it is easier for me refer to when I write up a report.” Latest statistics show that Kim is one of an increasing number of university students who rely more on the Internet than school libraries to do research and access books. According to a report on students’ usage of libraries by the Korea Education & Research Information Service, students borrowed 7.4 books per person on average in 2015. This has been dropping for five years. The average number of books per person was 10.3 in 2011, 9.6 in 2012, 8.7 in 2013 and 7.8 in 2014, according to the report. The state-run KERIS conducted the survey on 409 university libraries across the nation in 2015, involving more than 2 million students.Among the students, only 57.7 percent said that they have borrowed a hardcopy book from their school libraries. “I can definitely feel a downward trend in the number of students borrowing books from school libraries,” said Kim Seung-cheol, associate manager at Sungkok Library at Kookmin University in Seoul. Kim cited the high-speed Internet and increasing usage of smartphones as major reasons for this tendency. “I think Koreans are now more used to reading content and acquiring information on smartphones.”According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted on 40 nations, 88 percent of adult Koreans own a smartphone, more than double the global median average of 43 percent. Korea also ranked highest for Internet usage, with a rate of 94 percent.The competitive job market, in which youth unemployment rate stands at 9.5 percent, also contributed to the trend as students tend to focus more on preparing themselves to find employment these days, he noted. “Students normally look for books about English tests, job interviews and so on,” he said. “They tend to buy those kinds of books from bookstores rather than borrow them from libraries.” Among those who do opt to visit libraries, literature is still the most popular genre, according to the KERIS report.Nearly 21 percent of the books borrowed by students attending four-year college programs were literary books. Another 20.5 percent of the books were in social science while 13.4 percent were technology science books. “Short reading material is more popular in e-book form, but long ones including text books or literary books are still more popular in print forms,” he said. “I believe it is premature to predict an end of paper books. Rather, e-books and print books are complementary.” Among the surveyed universities, Seoul National University had the highest rate of students borrowing books from libraries, with a person on average taking out 24 books per year. Among the universities with four-year programs, the total amount of money spent on purchasing materials, including paper and electronic books, was 871 million won , down 2.1 percent from a year earlier. The proportion of budget spent on buying digital resources has been rising since 2012, with e-books accounting for 64.4 percent of the total budget. This means that less is being spent on hardcopy books. The average number of books in the 20 largest university libraries in Korea increased by 56,000 per library per year, significantly less than libraries registered under the Association of Research Libraries. The ARL, an organization encompassing over 120 libraries in the U.S. and Canada, saw an increase of 229,000 books per library, per year. But the librarian Kim said the decrease in the amount of money spent on hardcopy books could be a result of a rise in the prices of digital books. “As the total amount of budget has remained almost the same and digital material gets more expensive, libraries have less money to buy hardcopy books.”By Ock Hyun-ju","the internet than school libraries ,borrowing books from school libraries ,largest university libraries in korea ,survey on 409 university libraries ,technology science books short reading","['Kim Min - jin', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'late', 'Kim', 'the Korea Education & Research Information Service', 'KERIS', 'Kim Seung - cheol', 'Sungkok Library', 'Kookmin University', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Koreans', 'Pew Research Center', 'Koreans', 'Korea', 'KERIS', 'Seoul National University', 'Korea', 'the Association of Research Libraries', 'ARL', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'Kim', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39926362  0.22590278

The report was written after surveying a total of 3,155 Koreans who attended anti-violence education provided by the ministry last year.  On a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being “strongly agree,” the participants were asked to rate statements such as “sexual violence is preventable as long as the victim resists the attack.”The research found that those who are aged 50 or older, regardless of their gender, were most lenient towards violence among all groups. Men rated 2.94 out of 7 -- with 7 being the most lenient towards violence -- and women were rated at 2.56. Those in their 50s rated 3.17, while Koreans in their 20s rated 2.46. Meanwhile, those who had never attended postsecondary education rated 3.05, while Koreans who attended graduate schools rated 2.52.The number of reported sexual violence cases have been steadily on the rise in South Korea since 2009.

It not only provides a new source of economic growth with innovative technology but also strengthens democracy by attracting citizens to participate in policymaking and keeping information transparent,” Nam Young-sook, secretary-general of the World e-Governments Organization of Cities and Local Governments, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Nam Young-sook, the secretary-general of the World e-Governments Organization of Cities and Local Governments Chung Hee-Cho/The Korea HeraldThe e-government refers to a system using information technology and digitizing administrative affairs to effectively offer public services and improve interaction among agencies, and between the government and citizens. Established in 2010 by Seoul Metropolitan Government, WeGO has promoted administrative efficiency and sustainable development of global cities by sharing digital government know-hows and bridging the digital divide. This is the first multinational city-led organization dedicated to information and communications technologies for public administration.Nam, an economist and former international relations professor at Ewha Womans University, was named to the post last month.As of this year, a total of 95 cities -- including Paris, Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Barcelona -- and two friendship organizations have joined the group. Once the cities join the organization, they can benefit from various programs ranging from e-government consulting to training workshops. Seoul City was reelected a president city last year for the third consecutive time in recognition of its advanced digital government technology and systems. South Korea has topped the United Nations’ e-government survey three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2014. It also ranked the first for six consecutive years in the Rutgers World e-Governance Survey conducted by Rutgers University in the United States.“The central government’s active efforts to provide customized digital administrative service for the public and its policy to share information have played a major role in getting the world’s recognition,” Nam said. The state has been active in promoting the online government system with various measures. It has allowed residents to have their personal documents -- such as birth certificates -- issued or change their residence address online without visiting public institutions. It has also run a “complaint report system” that receives public complaints via mobile applications and social network services. Regardless of the central government’s efforts, the role of each municipality is essential in ensuring that citizens benefit from the e-government system, Nam stressed. “Although the main policies of the e-government system are mapped out by the central government, it is the cities that carry out and deliver the public services based on the distinguished needs of each city. The municipalities connect the citizens and the central government,” she added. As the new leader of the organization, Nam is pushing to widen WeGo’s role in promoting a “smart sustainable city” -- a sustainable city development based on the e-government system -- and in supporting developing countries to better adopt the e-government system. “One of our main goals this year is to expand the support for member cities to enhance their digital capacity with various programs while tightening the cooperation with other international bodies for better global networks,” she added.The organization is gearing up to raise the digital capacity of member cities such as Vietnam, Nepal and the Philippines.“Although we have seen high demand from many cities, most of those which ran the trial programs could not introduce the e-government system due to the financial burden,” she added. Member cities can apply for WeGo to conduct a feasibility study in their countries. This involves a customized on-site consulting program that runs a trial online system for six months and advises how to efficiently utilize the e-government system. About a dozen cities received the free consulting but none of them were able to afford the actual introduction of the system. As part of efforts to solve the funding issue, WeGO has built partnerships with the Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Korean International Cooperation Agency to financially support member cities so that they will be able to run the system. The organization is also preparing a series of training and workshop programs. It is planning to cohost a “smart city forum” with the United Cities and Local Governments Asia-Pacific, the local government union of 140 Asia-Pacific cities, at the United Nations Conference on House and Sustainable Urban Development or Habitat III, in Ecuador in October.The Habitat III is a conference held to “reinvigorate” the global political commitment to the sustainable development of towns, cities and other human settlements. It will also co-host a workshop with the Asian Development Bank in May in Korea, and a “smart city regional forum” with International Telecommunication Union, the U.N’s specialized agency for information and communication technologies, on July I in Phuket, Thailand.   “While providing various network and training programs, WeGo will put more effort to offering more funding schemes based on tighter ties with international bodies such as the World Bank and ADB,” the secretary-general said.  By Lee Hyun-jeong","sustainable development of global cities ,strengthens democracy by attracting citizens ,helping cities to pursue sustainable ,reinvigorate the global political commitment ,cities to enhance their digital","['the Korea Herald', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'WeGO', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'San Francisco', 'Hong Kong', 'Barcelona', 'Seoul City', 'the United Nations', 'Rutgers University', 'the United States', 'Nam', 'Nam', 'Nam', 'WeGo ’s', 'Vietnam', 'Nepal', 'Philippines', 'wego', 'the Export - Import Bank of Korea', 'the Korean International Cooperation Agency', 'the United Cities and local government Asia - Pacific', 'the United Nations Conference', 'Ecuador', 'the Habitat III', 'the Asian Development Bank', 'Korea', 'International Telecommunication Union', 'U.N', 'Phuket', 'Thailand', 'WeGo', 'the World Bank', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.1603632   0.39252347

The IoT is a concept in which all tangible objects are connected to the Internet and can identify themselves to other devices in order to exchange necessary data, with smartphones playing a crucial part in the management of other devices.Seoul also aims to set up an integrated parking system in which car owners can check the locations of their vehicles in parking places and receive relevant data with their smartphones. The city said it would include 550 public and private parking places in that integrated system by 2020.Seoul's ambitious plan for a ubiquitous digital platform comes amid growing worries that the city has lost its momentum for growth with a decline in its population of 10 million people.","seoul digital general plan 2020 ,will provide free wifi networks ,other devices seoul also aims ,seoul metropolitan government said tuesday ,seoul mayor park won soon","['Seoul', 'WiFi', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'the Seoul Digital', 'Seoul', 'IoT', 'Seoul', '2020.Seoul']",0,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31152177  0.8334896

It is also aimed at choking off sources of cash for the regime by sanctioning trade in coal, minerals and precious metals, as well as blacklisting those helping with Pyongyang's money laundering, counterfeiting, cash smuggling and narcotics trafficking.","hiring about 10 additional employees ,five years to implement north ,missile tests the congressional budget ,hiring about 10 additional ,10 additional employees to implement","['North Korea', 'Congress', 'Pyongyang', 'the Congressional Budget Office', 'North Koreans', 'north korean', 'Senate', 'House', 'the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act', 'Pyongyang', 'U.S.', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang']",11,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.02731116 0.45030695 0.41846171]

He would post selfies, details of his daily activities and share about coffee shop and restaurants that he frequented.This has since changed as Kang now sees more pitfalls than benefits to the social networking services which were once a crucial conduit for the 24-year-old college student to share about his day-to-day life with relatives, friends and acquaintances. “I used to put my personal information, such as my phone number and address, on my SNS accounts. I was flabbergasted when these were leaked and circulated online without my consent,” Kang said. He said he eventually chose to remove his previous accounts and establish new ones, finding himself unable to cut off from social media completely, to stay relevant. Kang frets constantly about the possibilities of identity theft, a personal data leak or even online and offline stalking by complete strangers. While Kang’s case involved personal risk and damage, the overwhelming usage of social media in the daily routines of the general public have become a source of unexpected risks for businesses as it could amount to tangible and intangible losses. For businesses, social media accounts have been vital tools to promote products, communicate with customers and foster favorable marketing environments. But they have also been exploited to spread groundless rumors and emotion-laden customer responses, which affect their sales and corporate image. It is for this reason that analysts stress the need for a thought-out crisis management strategy in regards to social media. “Crisis management has been increasingly important as the range and speed of the spread of SNS risks have become substantially bigger than how they were in the past,” said Jung Kyung-hwa, the director of the online team at the local public relations consultancy KPR & Associates Inc. “Through SNS, what used to be a petty issue in the past could escalate into a new crisis, which could give rise to yet another crisis more serious than the previous one. The amount of time needed for an issue to become a crisis may also be shortened as  can serve as a catalyst to make situations worse.”In recent years, firms that care greatly about their corporate image have increasingly focused on managing the potential risks that can arise from social media. They have formed special teams to handle online issues and conduct daily analysis of risk factors vis-a-vis social media. “For enterprises, social media is a double-edged sword: Given its capabilities to quickly disseminate information, social media is a very effective channel for promotional activities. But it can also pose great risks,” said an official at LG Electronics Inc. speaking on condition of anonymity. “We, under the principle of ‘expeditious and sincere’ communication, try to respond to online questions from customers within 24 hours, maintain candid communication with customers and strengthen our monitoring of social media accounts.”Jung of KPR & Associates Inc. pointed out that companies should actively prepare against potential social media-related crises with various scenarios in mind -- largely in three stages: before, during and after those crises. Before a crisis erupts, companies should strengthen their monitoring of issues and problems circulating through social media, she said, noting that false online information about a company could result in an uncontrollable crisis.  During a crisis, a firm should take care of it in a “prompt and active” manner to prevent it from further worsening. Thoroughly verifying the root cause of the crisis and maintaining effective communication with customers is vital at this stage, Jung said.After a crisis, the company should continue carefully watching the situation to ensure the crisis does not spill over into any other areas, she added. By Song Sang-ho","losses for businesses social media ,for businesses social media accounts ,problems circulating through social media ,businesses social media accounts have ,social media related crises","['Kang', 'SNS', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'Kang', 'SNS', 'Jung Kyung - hwa', 'KPR &', 'SNS', 'LG Electronics Inc.', 'KPR & Associates Inc.', 'Jung', 'Song Sang - ho']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88367176 -0.28440601

In order to measure the level of corruption, the study looked at factors such as research, administration and contracting with outside vendors. It also examined the frequency of corruption scandals as well as any other act that might compromise the credibility of the institutions. The study was conducted from October to December last year.The 2015 average score was a slight increase from 2014 when the score marked 5.67. It also showed general improvement in areas such as the tendency of schools to provide favors to university officials and general corruption levels in research, administration and personnel management. However, corruption within labs still appears to take place frequently, with 10.5 percent of the survey’s university respondents having pocketed research funds and 12 percent of them misusing funds. The following categories had also worsened: corruption risk, corruption awareness, transparency of procedures and responsibility towards tasks. The schools were classified into five groups, with Group 1 being the least corrupt. No university was put into the first group, with the top-scoring universities all in Group 2. Included in Group 2 were Seoul National University of Science and Technology , Gangneung-Wonju National University  and Korea National University of Cultural Heritage. Seoul National University’s lecture room The bottom three were Chonbuk National University , Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  and Korea National Sport University .Seoul National University, which is widely regarded as the top higher education institute in Korea, barely made it into the fourth group with a score of just 5.44.“We have taken into account 38 corruption cases that occurred at 17 universities in the past year, which was actually less than the year before when there were 45 cases,” said an official from the commission. There were 17 cases involving the embezzlement of research funds, which was the most frequently occurring form of corruption. Meanwhile, 76.3 percent of those caught doing dishonest deeds were professors.“Based on the 2015 results, we will conduct assessments on universities that have scored poorly and induce voluntary anticorruption efforts on their part,” said the commission’s official.

Those who sell, distribute, lease or openly screen such pictures can also face the same punishment.Various types of illegal hidden cameras confiscated by police in Seoul last year YonhapThe court currently reviews the following when making rulings: the way the victim was dressed when he or she was violated; the place the violation took place; camera angles used for photographs; and whether or not the photograph captures specific body parts. Yet the specific crime is difficult to curb mostly because the subject of the violation is often unware of the harassment, and therefore feels no “sexual shame.” Also, many smartphone applications, including those that enable users to take pictures without a shutter sound, or zoom in, make it easier for voyeurs to commit the crime, prosecutors said.There also has been debate as to what kind of photographs cause sexual stimulus or shame. On Sunday, the Supreme Court ruled that a man in his 20s who had been charged with following a female stranger and taking pictures of her in an elevator as not guilty. The court explained that the woman wasn’t wearing any “revealing” clothes at the time, and the photograph, which captured the upper body of the woman without her face, can’t be seen as “sexual,” as it did not zoom into any specific body parts. However, the woman testified at the court that she was scared and felt sexually harassed because of the man’s behavior. She said she noticed him taking pictures of her body without her consent and reported him to the police the next day after checking security video footage. In November, a 36-year-old man received a “not guilty” verdict for taking a total of 16 pictures containing different women’s full bodies, rather than specific body parts such as breasts, at a subway station in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province. But he was sentenced to eight months in prison with two years of probation for 42 other pictures he took, all of which captured bare legs of women in the subway in the summer.In explaining its decision, the Seoul Northern District Court said it was illogical to interpret a woman in her summer clothes as constituting a “body that may cause any sexual stimulus,” as more women choose to dress casually and less conservatively today.Lee Soo-yeon, a researcher at the Korean Women’s Development, argued that the laws should expand the definition to acknowledge all forms of voyeurism as stalking. “With the current laws on the punishment of sexual crimes, it is hard to punish voyeurism offenders. But taking pictures of someone without the person’s consent is just wrong,” she told The Korea Herald.“It would be more efficient if the law acknowledges the specific behavior as stalking  and make it punishable.”Meanwhile, the Ministry of Gender Equality was criticized during a National Assembly inspection last year for its campaign ad against sexual harassment using smart devices in public transportation. The ad encouraged women not to wear miniskirts, or to cover their legs when they do, when riding the subway or climbing the stairs at stations -- instead of discouraging possible offenders from committing the crime. Rep. Lim Su-kyung from the then-New Politics Alliance for Democracy, now The Minjoo Party of Korea, said at the audit, “Such ads are based on the notion that when a woman gets sexually harassed, she must have done something to deserve it.” By Claire Lee","sexual shame also many smartphone ,probation for 42 other pictures ,percent of all sex crime ,police in seoul last year ,crime perpetrators caught in 2014","['South Korea', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Seoul', 'YonhapThe', 'the Supreme Court', 'Anyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the Seoul Northern District Court', 'Lee Soo - yeon', 'the Korean Women ’s Development', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality', 'National Assembly', 'Lim Su - kyung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Claire Lee']",12,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52886653  0.26510474

From 2005-2015, power output grew at an annual average rate of 3.5 gigawatts.Last year, thermal power plants that used liquefied natural gas as the source of fuel generated 33 percent of all power output at 32.2 gigawatts, followed by coal-fired plants that made up little over 28 percent or 27.3 gigawatts. Nuclear power added 21.7 gigawatts or 22.2 percent of power output for the country, with renewable energy making up 7.6 percent and 7.4 gigawatts.According to government plans, the Shin-Kori No. 3 reactor capable of generating 1.4 gigawatts will go online in April with two coal-fired thermal power generation units in Dangjin and two others in nearby Taean to start generating power. The combined output of the new power generation units in Danjin and Taean on the west coast will reach 4 gigawatts.Industry insiders said that while growth in power output is a positive development, the country's growing reliance on fossil fuel is worrisome, as other countries are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which are cited for causing global warming.Coal is a cheap source of power generation but it releases 2.2 times more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere than LNG.""The country's dependence on coal-fired thermal plants is due to actions taken by the government following the 2011 limited blackout shock,"" a business insider said. He, however, said that because it takes such a long time to build power generation plants it is very hard for policymakers companies to predict energy demand trends down the line. Last year, South Korea actually had excess capacity.The insider said that with demand not rising as fast as expected, and with LNG becoming cheaper, the country needs to follow what other countries are doing to meet electricity demands.The United States has already said LNG will make up 60 percent of its power generation needs by 2035, with China pledging to reduce its dependence on coal. Britain has said it will halt all coal-based power generation by 2025.","hit 108 gigawatts this year ,100 gigawatt mark this year ,largest economy from 2005 2015 ,gigawatts last year thermal power ,108 gigawatts this year marking","[""South Korea 's"", 'Dangjin', 'Taean', 'Danjin', 'South Korea', 'LNG', 'the United States', 'LNG', 'China', 'Britain']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70396632  0.78356296

In a report to President Park Geun-hye, the education ministry said Wednesday it will also decrease by 160,000 the enrollment quota of the nation's university students by 2022 by restructuring universities nationwide.Instead, it will increase the enrollment of students majoring in technology and engineering sciences by 20,000 to meet the industries' requirements for more skilled manpower.According to the education ministry, its plan to increase the enrollment ratio for vocational schools to 30 percent from the present 19 percent by the year 2022 is aimed at easing the severe unemployment rate for young adults.The ministry said the increase of students for vocational high schools, such as ""meister"" schools, is necessary to produce more young and skilled jobseekers that can work at job sites at various levels. South Korea currently has 39 meister schools aimed at giving students technical education and apprenticeships so that they can develop expertise in particular fields, including shipbuilding, mechanical engineering, semiconductors and medical equipment.Boosting employment for young people has become a top priority for the Park administration, since youth unemployment is roughly three times higher than the national average.In South Korea, nearly 80 percent of high school students go to college due to the widespread social practice of judging one's abilities based on one's academic background. This so-called academic inflation has been a chronic social problem in the country.In this sense, the government's plan to utilize a more skilled workforce from vocational high schools is designed to tear down common social practices and promote the employment of high school graduates without college education.","2022 by restructuring universities nationwide ,by 2022 by restructuring universities ,vocational schools to 30 percent ,2022 by restructuring universities ,government will expand the ratio","['Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",11,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53503263  0.51894724

My male colleagues are always referred to as doctors,” she said.“And many older male patients don’t take me seriously. Once I told a senior male patient to stop calling me agassi. He said, ‘A young, pretty woman like you shouldn’t act so difficult. No man will want to marry you if you continue to do so.’ I think this would be considered as sexual harassment overseas.”Park’s experience is reflected in the latest research findings released by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea on Tuesday, which found more than 50 percent of female health care workers who have filed complaints with the agency from 2001-2015 were about being sexually harassed at work. The NHRCK researched a total of 59 human rights abuse cases suffered by the nation’s female health care workers -- including physicians and nurses -- that were reported to the commission in the last 15 years.  123rfAmong them, the largest proportion, 54.2 percent, were sexual harassment cases at the workplace.Meanwhile, 35.6 percent of the complaints were about being discriminated at work for being pregnant. Also, 5.1 percent experienced physical or emotional bullying at work.The report found that the majority of those who have been sexually harassed at work were nursing assistants, referring to those who obtained a yearlong certification program offered in non-university institutions. In the local medical field, there is a defined hierarchy among physicians, registered nurses and nursing assistants, whose pay rate, responsibilities and duties vary.Compared to registered nurses, who attended four-year university degree programs and whose responsibilities include providing doctor-ordered treatments, nursing assistants usually have a lower pay with their primary duties consisting of cleaning and bathing patients as well as administrative tasks. The report pointed out that such a hierarchy was one of the reasons behind the high number of sexual harassment victims among nursing assistants. The highest proportion of perpetrators were male patients , and the second-highest proportion  were doctors and owners of the medical institutions where the nursing assistants were employed.Meanwhile, among 153 female medical residents surveyed by the NHRCK, 77.8 percent said they felt hospitals prefer to hire unmarried female residents. Also, 53 percent of them felt they experienced gender-based discrimination during training, while also perceiving barriers to promotion.While not feeling as strongly as female medical residents, Korea’s nurses and nursing assistants also believed that there is gender discrimination in the workplace, the report found. Among the 977 nurses and nursing assistants surveyed by the human rights agency, 58.3 percent said single women have a higher chance of getting a job in the field than those who are married. Also, 55.3 percent said one’s appearance, such as her height, weight and physical attractiveness, played a factor during the job selection process at medical institutions. “Whenever the president of the hospital had guests over, our boss would selectively ask those who are slim and good looking to greet them in a docile manner and keep them entertained,” one of the nurses interviewed for the report was quoted as saying.As of 2015, 98.3 percent of nurses nationwide are female, according to the Korean Nurses Association.The report also revealed that a significant portion of the surveyed women felt that pregnancy can ruin their career prospects. A total of 71.4 percent of female medical residents and 39.5 percent of nurses and nursing assistants said they felt they could not plan on having children freely and were practically required to consult their employer before getting pregnant. Also, 61.7 percent of the nurses and nursing assistants and 77.4 percent of the medical residents said they worked beyond the legal limit while pregnant. One of the cases included in the report consisted of a medical resident who had to work until just a few hours before her own labor -- assisting other mothers giving birth at her hospital’s obstetrics unit. “Most female residents aren’t allowed to breast-feed their babies at work,” said Hyun Jung-hee from the Korean Public Service and Transport Workers Union at a forum in Seoul on Tuesday. “Isn’t it ironic how a female doctor can’t breast-feed her own children at work while their job is to encourage as many women to breast-feed as possible?”Hyun said the biggest problem is that most medical institutions don’t hire enough staff to save on labor costs.“According to government data we obtained from the Health Ministry, more than 80 percent of medical institutions don’t follow the law which stipulates that all hospitals should have at last two nurses per five patients,” she said. “And by allowing hospitals to be so understaffed, the government should know that citizens’ safety and health is at risk.”The report claimed that female health care workers have a higher risk of developing sleep disorders, mental health conditions and cardiovascular disease. “And from our research, we found that they are constantly exposed to gender discrimination at work, which can severely deteriorate the quality of their private and family life,” it said.By Claire Lee","female medical residents korea nurses ,obstetrics unit most female residents ,patients calling her agassi korean ,female medical residents korea ,last two nurses per five","['Park Hyun - ju', 'korean', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'NHRCK', 'NHRCK', 'Korea ’s', 'the Korean Nurses Association', 'Hyun Jung - hee', 'the Korean Public Service and Transport Workers Union', 'Seoul', 'the Health Ministry', 'Claire Lee']",13,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15009783  0.42045933
