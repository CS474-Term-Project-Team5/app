The bill intends to force companies responsible for selling or manufacturing toxic humidifier disinfectant, namely Oxy Reckitt Benckiser and SK Chemicals, to make contributions to the envisioned 200 billion won  fund based on quotas allocated by the South Korean government. The legislation, if it passes the parliament’s plenary session early next year, will pave the way for some 300 more victims of the toxic sterilizers to receive state support. Families of toxic humidifier disinfectant victims and civic group members hold up placards showing the number of deaths attributed to the products at Gwanghwamun Square on Monday, pressing the government to expand the related investigation and legislate a special law for damages. According to the government’s current victim verification process, set in 2014, the scale goes from 1-4, with one being highly certain the health damage resulted from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants.Based on personal clinical results, diagnostic images and the level of exposure, victims who suffered lung diseases are classified as category 1 or 2 victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories 3-4. The latest data in May showed that there were 309 victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants classified in categories 3-4, compared to 221 victims in categories 1-2.Self-claimed victims, their families and civic groups have been demanding the government broaden the scope of the victim recognition and compensation process to include non-lung related symptoms. Since July, the Environment Ministry has been providing government subsidies to humidifier disinfectant victims in categories 1-2 with monthly living costs and nursing fees.When Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- announced the final compensation plan in August, categories 3-4 victims were excluded from the compensation list. The company said it would compensate up to 350 million won to victims categorized upon government investigation as categories 1-2, but it was bitterly opposed by the victims’ group that the final plan does not cover all victims as it leaves out those classified category 3-4.RB Korea is responsible for some 4.4 million toxic humidifier disinfectants sold between 2000 and 2014, accountable for 62 percent of the total volume in the humidifier disinfectant market. In 2011, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially confirmed the link between health damages of victims and the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant. So far, 189 deaths, mostly of lung failure, have been formally recognized as being linked to the products. Damage claims filed this year have reached over 3,400.By Kim Da-sol","labor committee on thursday ,more toxic disinfectant victims ,decision came after lawmakers ,korean government is close ,committee on thursday cleared","['south korean', 'the National Assembly ’s Environment and Labor Committee']",7,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.19214068  0.42296398

The ministry also scrapped plans to mandate all schools to use the state-authored textbooks, effectively signaling the renunciation of one of the most disputed projects initiated by the Park Geun-hye administration.“Schools that wish to use the state-written history textbooks earlier  may start doing so in March ,” Lee Joon-sik, the education minister and deputy prime minister for social affairs said at a press briefing at the government complex in Sejong City. Education Minister Lee Joon-sik speaks during a press briefing at the Sejong Government Complex on Tuesday. YonhapThose who start using the history textbooks earlier will test them out before their official release.“Though there have been demands to discard the state-authored textbooks entirely, we also received some positive feedback and so decided to allow the usage of both the state-written and state-authorized textbooks,” Lee said. After the ministry’s announcement, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae expressed disappointment over the decision.“It is regrettable  but there was nothing we could do under the current circumstances,” a Blue House official said.President Park, who has been in seclusion since her impeachment resolution on Dec. 9, is also said to have urged for the implementation of the textbook plan during a meeting with officials last week.Opposition parties, however, refused to embrace the ministry’s compromising solution and continued to push for the pending motion billed to ban state-authored textbooks. “Discarding all the state-authored textbooks is the only answer, not delaying the application date,” said Rep. Ki Dong-min, the floor spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. The runner-up opposition People’s party also condemned the ministry, calling it “irresponsible” and “stubborn” for ignoring the public sentiments. The lawmakers and civic groups have criticized Park’s drive to mandate the state-written textbooks, accusing her of attempting to glorify the military dictatorship of her father. Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, was a military strongman who ruled the country for 18 years until his assassination in 1979. The Education Ministry had released three draft copies of the state-authored history textbooks and made them available to the public in order to gather opinions, up to last week.Some 76,949 citizens looked over the textbooks a total of 146,851 times, and 2,334 of them submitted their opinions on the textbooks, the ministry revealed. The Education Ministry said it will edit 21 errors pointed out by citizens, while another 808 errors will be discussed by experts. Pundits predict Park’s history textbooks might be abolished after the next presidential election, which is expected to take place earlier than scheduled, as Park’s impeachment charges are currently being examined by the Constitutional Court. If her impeachment is approved by the court, the next election has to take place within 60 days. The government released plans for the state-authored history textbooks in October last year, as the president showed concerns that the seven existing history textbooks contain some biased, left-leaning interpretation of history.

The main opposition Democra...","Dozens of lawmakers defected from President Park Geun-hye’s governing Saenuri Party on Tuesday over the corruption scandal involving Park and her aides, pledging to create a new conservative party in the run-up to next year’s presidential election.The departure of 29 anti-Park lawmakers left Saenuri with 99 parliamentary seats, making it the second-largest party in the National Assembly. The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea has now emerged as the biggest political party with 121 seats. The People’s Party is third with 38 seats. The lawmakers defecting from the ruling Saenuri Party on Tuesday pledge to create a new conservative party. Behind them is a banner reading “starting anew as conservatives.“ The conservative party’s split marks a turning point for South Korean politics as it witnesses four major parties competing for power for the first time since 1990. At that time, there were two conservative and two liberal parties until they realigned into one big conservative and one minor liberal party. “We will begin our journey to play a pivotal role for the conservatives and provide them with orderly and stable reform. We will preserve liberal democracy, achieve social unification and create a warm community,” said the defectors in a statement. A total of 30 lawmakers joined the new party, including 29 defectors and Rep. Kim Yong-tae, who had already left Saenuri in late November. Last week, 35 Saenuri members vowed to leave the party, but some withheld their decision at the last minute to consult with their constituents.The lawmakers said that they will launch a new party named “New Conservative Party for Reform” on Jan. 24. Later in the day, the new party registered themselves as a parliamentary negotiating group, who can receive a government subsidy and exercise tie-breaking votes between the major parties.Their rebellion against Saenuri came after most anti-Park lawmakers joined opposition parties in passing the impeachment motion against the president earlier this month. Up to 62 Saenuri lawmakers are thought to have approved the motion in a secret ballot. Since then, they have clashed over control of the party with the pro-Park faction, who dominated leadership positions. The factional feud ended in favor of the pro-Park faction when one of Park’s loyalists was elected as the new floor leader on Dec. 16. “The mass defection which claims to advocate reform was in fact a pursuit of political ambition and a move to salvage  faction,” said Saenuri floor leader Chung Woo-taik, dismissing the defection as a “failure” because anti-Park lawmakers failed to attract the 35 lawmakers they had initially promised.The defection group includes a number of former Saenuri heavyweights, such as former Saenuri leader lawmakers Rep. Kim Moo-sung and former Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min. Both had clashed with Park over her welfare policies and nominations for the 2016 general election. There are other high-profile legislators working at parliamentary committees. Among them are third-term lawmaker Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, chairman of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee who will represent the legislative body during the impeachment trial against Park at the Constitutional Court. With the initiation of a new party by Saenuri defectors on Tuesday, the National Assembly turned into a five-party structure.  The Democratic Party of Korea, the Saenuri Party, the People‘s Party, the reformative conservative party , and the Justice Party. The defectors said that more Saenuri lawmakers would quit the party once UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joins them to run for the 2017 presidential race. The world’s top diplomat has distanced himself from President Park and her loyalists since the corruption scandal erupted in October. “I don’t want to make a move until Ban returns to Korea,” said former Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, who is considered close to Ban, who is expected to return to Korea in mid-January. Chung succeeded Yoo for the post in 2016.It was not the first time that conservative parties have split up before presidential elections. In 1997, former Gyeonggi Province Gov. Rhee In-je left the then-ruling New Korea Party to rebel against Lee Hoi-Chang, a presidential candidate then. Lee also defected from his party to run for the 2007 presidential race. But their defections did not work out as they expected. Gov. Lee came in third in the 1997 presidential race, trailing behind Lee Hoi-Chang and late President Kim Dae-jung. Lee Hoi Chang also ended the 2007 presidential race at third place, behind liberal candidate Chung Dong-young and former President Lee Myung-bakFor the Saenuri defectors to avoid the same fate as their conservative predecessors, experts said, they have to move beyond opposition of the president and focus on showing conservative voters policies tailored to them.  “Being critical of Park and approving the impeachment of her is not enough,” said Lee Jung-hee, a political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Currently, they appear to advocate a hawkish stance on national security and a liberal stance on economy issues. It is too naive. They need to be more specific.” Myongji University politics professor Kim Hyung-joon said that the anti-Park lawmakers’ defections could expand their appeal to independent centrists if they focus on political reform, rather than rallying behind establishment powerbrokers.By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday over the corruption ,dozens of lawmakers defected ,lawmakers defected from president ,29 anti park lawmakers ,park lawmakers leave dozens","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park', 'Saenuri', 'the National Assembly', 'Democra']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48499009  0.61125773

The county has been allocated 2.1 billion won  to establish a park commemorating Ban's term at the United Nations.Ban has been leading in major opinion polls here, being effectively tied with Moon Jae-in, former head of the Democratic Party who lost against President Park Geun-hye in 2012.

An Hee-jung, who also served in the former liberal Roh Moo-hyun government along with Moon, claimed the idea of an immediate constitutional revision is “irrational.”Some minority party candidates, however, have claimed that a revision of the basic law is needed to fundamentally reform the nation’s political system. Among them are former Democratic Party Chairman Sohn Hak-kyu and Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, a fourth-termer in the conservative stronghold city of Daegu.The central point of dispute is the adoption of a runoff election in the upcoming presidential race.The idea of putting two finalists to a second round, in case neither attains a majority vote in the first round, has recently been suggested as a way to assure the public’s approval of the winner.It was mostly runner-up candidates who called for such reinforced competition, in an apparent move against Moon’s lead among opposition hopefuls.“Only by adopting a runoff election may we properly reflect the people’s will in the election result,” Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung wrote via his Twitter account.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party, one of the strongest advocates of the runoff system, even accused Moon of dismissing the competitive system out of fear of losing his upper hand in the race.Although Moon admits the need for a runoff election, he said a constitutional revision is first needed to introduce a system that is not currently in place under current law.He also expressed disapproval of the idea of reducing the term of the incoming president from five years to three years, so as to let the following presidential election take place in 2020 along with the general election.“The reduction of the  term should be based on a constitutional revision into a Cabinet government system,” he said last week, effectively dismissing the issue for the time being.But Mayor Lee and Rep. Kim, along with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, all argued that given the current political situation, the next president’s term should be shortened.All three runner-up figures are considered to have relatively low chances of winning against Moon in next year’s race.By Bae Hyun-jung","planned presidential election next ,runoff separates presidential aspirants ,planned presidential election ,presidential election next ,corruption scandal involving president",['Park Geun'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57213128  0.28163132

Yoo Seong-min, a ranking non-Park figure, to steer the distressed party until the election of an official party leader.But the pro-Park members, while vowing to put an end to factional divides, argued that the non-Parks are just as responsible for the current political consequences, denouncing their threats of defection.Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik speaks Tuesday at a party meeting, effectively denouncing the nonmainstreamers’ call to name Rep. Yoo Seong-min as emergency council leader.“Floor leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik, who is effectively the head of the party’s pro-Park group, has rejected our recommendation of Rep. Yoo as interim chief,” said Rep. Hwang Young-cheul on Tuesday, speaking for the dissenters.“Considering the urgency of the situation, we shall hold a meeting at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow  and finalize our stance .”When asked about the detailed format of their Saenuri Party exit, Rep. Hwang said they would “split into a new political party,” instead of going independent.He also denied rumors on the internal divide within the nonmainstreamers’ group.“Should there be division of any sort among ourselves, we will face harsh criticism from the people and fail to achieve our goal,” he said.Meanwhile, a group of pro-Park lawmakers had decided earlier in the morning to disband their recently formed entity in a gesture to put an end to factional feuds.They, however, continued to disapprove of the non-Parks’ notion of having Rep. Yoo as interim chief.“From now on, we shall never constitute any group that speaks for the pro-Parks,” said Rep. Jeong Kab-yoon, a fifth-term Park loyalist, pledging to serve for a conservative victory in next year’s presidential race.“ should be ashamed of playing a blame game regarding the Choi Soon-sil scandal. It is hard to understand that some lawmakers should seek to shun responsibility.”“If there is anyone who can navigate through this crisis to bring unity to the  party, an outsider is also welcome,” Rep. Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader-elect from the pro-Park group, said in a press conference Tuesday. Rep. Yoo Seong-min answers reporters’ questions on his way to the parliamentary interpellation Tuesday afternoon. Rep. Yoo hinted at the high possibility of leaving the party, citing he was willing to “sacrifice” if it helped the sincere reform of the conservative party. Another non-Park leading figure, former Saenuri head Rep. Kim Moo-sung, previously announced he would establish a new party.For the dissenters, the key task is to gather at least 20 lawmakers to form a negotiation body at the National Assembly and become the No. 3 party at the parliament by garnering at least 40 members to outnumber the 38 seats the People’s Party holds.  “Possible resignation of the lawmakers should not just be viewed as acts of individuals, but rather a separation process of the conservative party,” Rep.

7,7,Ex-ruling party floor leader says separation may take time,"A former floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party said Tuesday the political breakup will take some time as the ultimate goal of such a move is to strive for a ""balanced conservatism"" in the country and not independence itself.""There's no need to leave the party, if Saenuri strives to become a true conservative party,"" said Rep.

Yoo Seong-min, a leading member of Saenuri's dissenter group that has been at odds with President Park Geun-hye and her loyalists. On Monday, the dissenters group proposed that Yoo should head its emergency committee and warned they would leave if the proposal is not accepted by those loyal to the president.Saenuri has been suffering from the factional feud amid Park's alleged corruption scandal, which led to her impeachment earlier this month.While the dissenters group says Saenuri should seek a full reshuffle to regain the public's trust, Park loyalists have countered that now is not the time to engage in infighting and said those that disagree should leave.""If our main goal was just to leave, we can always find excuses. But that's not our goal,"" Yoo said. Yoo served as the party's floor leader in 2015 and was forced to step down over disagreements with the president.Political pundits said the dissenters group will also need time to win the support of more lawmakers, as South Korean parties must secure at least 20 lawmakers to establish a negotiation body at the National Assembly.Yoo said he is also open to staying in the party and reforming it.""But if Park loyalists, including new floor leader Chung Woo-taik, only chase their political interests and remain reluctant to reform, there will be no hope,"" Yoo said.Chung, a Park loyalist, was elected the new whip through an in-house vote, which came as a disappointment for impeachment supporters. His predecessor Chung Jin-suk, who is viewed as neutral, stepped down in response to the passage of the impeachment.The new whip, meanwhile, said Yoo need to come up with detailed plans on how he will resolve the factional feud.""I do not intend to side only with the pro-Park faction,"" Chung said, adding he will seek to persuade both factions on the designation of the emergency committee chief.Chung has been claiming that the factional feud could actually escalate once Yoo heads the committee. The election for the party interim leadership seat will be held within three days, the whip said.Observers said initially some 20 lawmakers may leave the party, with the figure growing to as high as around 40, which would be enough to form a parliamentary negotiation body.If successful, the dissenters will be able to become the National Assembly's No. 3 party, outpacing 38 seats held by the People's Party.The size would be bigger if former Saenuri head Kim Moo-sung, who also hinted on leaving the party, join forces with Yoo, pundits added.""If Kim leaves alone, he would only take some 10 lawmakers,"" a pro-Park lawmaker predicted.","tuesday the political breakup ,the political breakup will ,ex ruling party floor ,said tuesday the political ,floor leader says separation","['Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Saenuri']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48400941  0.36910105

While the Saenuri’s reformist members demanded clarification, the opposition circle argued that the disputed members should be ousted immediately from the related parliamentary committee.The ruling Saenuri Party’s Reps. Chang Je-won, Ha Tae-keung and Hwang Young-cheul, all members of the parliamentary committee probing into the Choi Soon-sil scandal, demand Monday for clarification on the perjury allegations of some committee members. Korean media outlet Monthly JoongAng revealed Sunday that Rep. Yi Wan-young, a Park loyalist of the ruling party, directed K-Sports Foundation’s former Chairman Jeong Dong-chun to give a false testimony over a key piece of evidence -- a tablet PC which had allegedly belonged to Choi. According to the media outlet, Choi’s former associate Ko Young-tae claimed that Yi had told Jeong to testify that the PC containing confidential documents from the presidential office belonged to Ko, not Choi.“A Saenuri lawmaker and a K-Sport official will say  that they saw me carry around the disputed PC,” Ko was quoted as saying. Two days after the release of the interview, Rep. Lee Man-hee of the Saenuri Party questioned Park Heon-young, an employee of the foundation, at the National Assembly. Park answered that the PC was Ko’s, just as he had predicted, raising suspicions that Rep. Lee was also involved in the conspiracy.However, the Saenuri members denied all charges.“I have never told anyone to falsify testimonies. I did hear from Jeong that the tablet PC may be Ko’s, but I did not think of it as credible information,” he told reporters at an emergency press conference Monday. “I did not prepare any questions on that issue for the hearing.”Parliamentary hearing committee Chairman Rep. Kim Sung-tae held an emergency investigation to clear up doubts, as some reformist figures of the Saenuri had also called for a thorough probe earlier in the day. Members of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, however, did not attend the emergency investigation, lashing out at the ruling party instead. It demanded the two lawmakers be ousted from the parliamentary inquiry committee on the Choi scandal.“It would clearly constitute a criminal act, if the committee members colluded with witnesses to make false testimonies, instead of finding out the truth on behalf of the people, as they should,” said the party’s Floor Leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho in the morning. He also said that the two Saenuri lawmakers should reveal the conversations they allegedly had with key witnesses.The committee decided to summon the two lawmakers to the upcoming hearing Thursday. “If they fail to offer a valid explanation, the two should resign ,” said Rep. Chang Je-won of the ruling Saenuri Party at a press briefing.By Jo He-rim","peddling scandal involving president ,hit monday by allegations ,lawmakers face perjury ,lawmakers face perjury claims ,the ongoing parliamentary probe","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18448123  0.41506991

The Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the legitimacy of the motion and has up to 180 days to deliver a ruling. Park was accused of allowing Choi to exert undue influence on state affairs.The president then said the motion itself violated clear rules that ban ""guilt by association"" as well as ""presumption of innocence,"" strongly suggesting a media bias and that lawmakers carried out the impeachment without actually checking evidence.Park, moreover, claimed she was not aware of any wrongdoings committed by those around her, and referred to Choi as a ""kitchen cabinet"" member or informal adviser, which is commonplace in countries like the United States.""Any attempt to delay the Constitutional Court's proceedings will not be tolerated,"" Rep. Choo Mi-ae, head of the Democratic Party said. Choo said the impeachment was not based on guilt by association, but considered Park an accomplice to her confidante Choi.","park rebuttal of impeachment ,opposition condemns park rebuttal ,rebuttal of impeachment south ,of impeachment south korea ,court on her impeachment","[""South Korea 's"", 'Democratic Party', 'Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71507674 -0.07404298

In the eighth Saturday rally in central Seoul against the embattled president, rally organizers said they would also call for the resignation of acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, denouncing him as an “accomplice” to Park.An association of 1,500 civic groups plan to stage a candlelight vigil at the Gwanghwamun Square starting from 5 p.m., with several pre-rallies planned in the afternoon to call for the abolishment of the controversial police pushed by the Park administration. As in previous rallies, they plan to march toward Cheong Wa Dae, as close as 100 meters from it through 11 routes. The protestors will march near the Constitutional Court building to step up pressure on it to make a ruling rapidly and near the prime minister’s office to demand he resign. A left-wing news outlet had reported on allegations that Hwang peddled influence over the prosecution when he was serving as justice minister in April 2014. He allegedly forced investigators not to charge maritime police officers, who failed to save passengers from the sinking ferry Sewol, with professional negligence. Hwang denied the allegations in a statement. Protesters hold up slogans asking for President Park Geun-hye's ouster on Dec. 10, the day after the parliament passed the impeachment bill. YonhapSouth Korean lawmakers on Dec. 9 voted to impeach Park, with the approval of 234 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly. Park was stripped of presidential authority and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is serving as acting president. Now, the fate of her presidency is left to the Constitutional Court as the impeachment requires its final approval, which could take up to 180 days.As the police have banned the rallies near the acting president’s office and the court, rally organizers are awaiting a court’s decision on the ban. The court has backed the protestors holding anti-Park rallies near the presidential office for the past two months, citing freedom of assembly. There are possibilities for clashes as some 50 conservative groups supporting President Park plan to stage a large-scale rally from 10 a.m. near Anguk Station and march toward the presidential office. South Koreans have taken to the streets relentlessly and lit candles across the nation for the past seven weeks to call for Park’s ouster, with cumulative participation standing at about 7 million, according to the rally organizers.Despite the passage of the impeachment vote, many of the protesters vowed to hold up candles until Park voluntarily resigns and those who assisted her in committing wrongdoings are held accountable.President Park has been criticized for colluding with Choi Soon-sil, who has neither an official government post nor policy background, to extort money from conglomerates and let her meddle in state affairs.By Ock Hyun-ju","lawmakers impeached president park ,week after lawmakers impeached ,after lawmakers impeached president ,resign week after lawmakers ,lawmakers impeached president","['Park Geun', 'South Koreans', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66227555  0.45332724

Lee is among the three justices of the Constitutional Court chosen to lead preparations for the impeachment trial. Lee Jin-sung President Park, embroiled in a cronyism scandal involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, was impeached by the parliament last Friday amid public fury and reproach. While nearly 8 in 10 South Koreans want her gone, the embattled president is determined to fight for her job and name at the court. She denies all eight criminal charges that state prosecutors investigating her scandal has raised against her. Right now, Park is exempt from criminal liability as sitting head of state, but she will become subject to, once the top court confirms her impeachment. The phase that Justice Lee used -- “in the name of the people” -- appears to be a theoretical reference to the Article 1 and Clause 2 of the Korean Constitution: “The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea shall reside in the people and all state authority shall emanate from the people.” Justices of the Constitutional Court are meeting daily this week, with Lee and two others preparing to set dates for pretrial hearing sessions next week. They are waiting for written statements from two related parties -- the sanctioned president and the National Assembly -- plus the Justice Ministry, in order to get a grip on their key arguments and opinions on the case.

Woo is among the witnesses being summoned for a parliamentary inquiry session on Dec. 22. Woo Byung-woo The former prosecutor who served the now-impeached Park as senior secretary for civil affairs had previously nixed repeated calls for his attendance at a parliamentary hearing and went into hiding. Some opposition lawmakers had even promised a cash reward for tips on his whereabouts.  Woo was allegedly handpicked by Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s infamous friend at the center of the corruption scandal, for the powerful job of overseeing the inspection of many government agencies, including the prosecution. Park was impeached by the parliament last week on allegations that she allowed Choi, who holds no public positoin and has no policy background, to meddle in state affairs. While many of Park’s former aides are under arrest and facing criminal charges, Woo has remained unscathed so far.Woo claimed that was not able to testify “due to rules that bar him from making public comments related to his job at the presidential office.”Opposition lawmakers serving at the bipartisan inquiry committee said that he has yet to notify them of his attendance. “He has not told us that he will attend the inquiry,” said Rep. Kim Kyung-jin, who represents the runner-up opposition People’s Party at the committee. “He just said to a reporter close to him. I don’t think it is his official position.” Woo also faces other allegations, including an accusation he embezzled money from a real estate company run by his family and that he abused his power to help his son secure an easy assignment during his mandatory military service. Woo has denied all allegations. Now that Woo has decided to step up to the plate, the bipartisan committee has set their focus on the allegations surrounding the president that could prove to be crucial during her upcoming impeachment trial: Park’s missing seven hours during the Sewol ferry tragedy. The partisan committee is to hold a parliamentary inquiry Wednesday to find out whether Park neglected her duties to oversee rescue operations for seven hours during the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster which saw more than 300 people killed or missing. Even though the presidential office claimed Park oversaw the situation at her private residence, rumors are rife that Park might have been doing something else. Once such rumor is that she was receiving plastic surgery with assistance from military medical officers during the nation’s worst-ever maritime disaster. Cheong Wa Dae said last month that Park received briefings or issued directives related to the rescue operation. But it showed the president was not briefed by anyone in person and did not hold a meeting while the nation watched the ferry slowly sink on live TV, with hundreds of students on a class trip trapped inside.“Given that the president was only briefed by paper, not in person, the president was not aware of the situation. It means that the president neglected her constitutional duty to protect the people’s lives and safety,” said the impeachment motion drafted by the opposition parties. The committee summoned top presidential aides and presidential medical staff, who had worked at Cheong Wa Dae during the Sewol tragedy, in the hopes that they would provide exact information about the president’s whereabouts during the seven hours. Among the listed witnesses are Kim Jang-soo, former chief of Presidential National Security Office, and Kim Seok-kyun, former chief of the Coast Guard who handled the rescue operation. Former presidential doctors and medial officers are expected to testify as well.

Her fate hinges on a Constitutional Court decision due in six months.South Korea has been seeking to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  system in the country to improve its defense capabilities against Pyongyang's provocations. The opposition parties here, however, have been protesting against the move, adding it may make China uncomfortable.The government originally planned to complete the deployment by May.""The schedule must be reviewed. An administration impeached by the people can not push forward the project,"" the main opposition Democratic Party said through a statement, adding the issue should be concluded by the next administration. The party said the deployment could lead to a decrease in Chinese tourists, adding South Korea should be careful as the United States is also expected to have an icy relationship with Beijing with its new administration led by President-elect Donald Trump.The splinter People's Party echoed the view, adding Park's controversial policies must be scrapped and be re-discussed by the new administration.While South Korea originally planned to hold the presidential election in December next year, the race is expected to be held earlier in 2017 after the impeachment of Park.Once Park is completely removed from office, South Korea has 60 days to elect a new leader.","park impeachment signaling major ,opposition party on tuesday ,parliament approved park impeachment ,park impeachment signaling ,approved park impeachment signaling","[""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41435137  0.19749732

Adding more chaos to the conservative camp, which is on the verge of a breakup, the party’s Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk called it quits, saying he wanted to take responsibility for the president’s impeachment. “The governing party bears the same amount of responsibility as the president, when the president is suspended from office,” Rep. Chung said. The party’s chief policymaker Kim Gwang-lim also expressed his intention to quit. Infighting over control of the party has been raging at Saenuri, following the parliamentary impeachment of President Park last week. A group of lawmakers opposing the current leadership led by Rep. Lee Jung-hyun singled out eight party members, including the party chief, as “the entourage” of the president’s now-infamous confidante Choi Soon-sil, calling for their immediate ouster from the party. Choi, a friend of Park for 40 years, is alleged to have manipulated power from behind the scenes. “They have manipulated the government system, betrayed the people’s mandate and neglected the Choi Soon-sil scandal,” said Rep. Hwang Young-chul, a second-term lawmaker who represents the dissenting group. “They have to leave the party immediately.” Rep. Hwang Young-chul of the Saenuri Party. YonhapThe eight accused are: Saenuri Chairman Lee, two Supreme Council members, Reps. Cho Won-jin and Lee Jang-woo, and Reps. Seo Chung-won, Choi Kyung-hwan, Hong Moon-jong, Yoon Sang-hyun and Kim Jin-tae. They are key figures representing the party’s mainstream faction loyal to President Park. Dominating leadership positions in the party, they had previously wielded influence over the party’s decisions, but have recently been under mounting criticism, with the president’s fall from grace. Yet, throughout the presidential scandal, they stood steadfastly behind Park and refused to give up leadership positions in Saenuri. Party chief Lee, along with the others, refused to step down from their positions or leave the party. Instead, they demanded the departure of Reps. Kim Moo-sung and Yoo Seung-min, the two bigwigs of the rebels’ group who were once the president’s key allies. “I think they are the epitome of betrayal and treason,” said Rep. Lee Jang-woo who sits on the party’s top decision-making Supreme Council. The conservative party’s factional feud was evident, when the parliament passed the motion to impeach Park in a surprising 234-56 vote. This means that at least 62 Saenuri lawmakers voted for the motion in a secret ballot, which almost doubled the expectations of the faction that supported the opposition-mounted bill. The three opposition parties and independents control 172 votes in the 300-seat National Assembly. It was not the first time that Saenuri’s factional strife has made headlines. In the lead-up to the general election that took place in April, they clashed over how to nominate candidates for the election. After the pro-Park faction refused to nominate anti-Park lawmakers, they decided to quit and run as independents. But some experts say that neither faction will bolt from Saenuri and form a new political entity. “I don’t think we will see the party split,” said Lee Sang-hui, a political analyst who worked as a presidential aide during the previous Lee Myung-bak government. “Building a new party requires massive money and legitimate cause. I don’t think both factions have them.” By Yeo Jun-suk","of breakup the party ,conservative ruling camp factional ,the impeachment of president ,factional strife reached boiling ,breakup two rival factions","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chung Jin - suk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.97093582 -0.13390487

18,18,Court set to kickstart impeachment deliberation,"With the National Assembly having passed the ball to the Constitutional Court, justices are set to kick-start their deliberations Monday on the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.

They are expected to discuss the deliberation schedule, the planned operation of a task force and other related issues...","With the National Assembly having passed the ball to the Constitutional Court, justices are set to kick-start their deliberations Monday on the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Eight of the nine justices -- all except Kim Yi-su who is visiting Peru -- turned up at the court during the weekend. They are expected to discuss the deliberation schedule, the planned operation of a task force and other related issues. Kang Il-won, the chief justice on the case, cut short his business trip to Venice and returned home Saturday. Upon his arrival, he met with the court’s president, Park Han-chul, to review the case, officials said. “I am well aware of this case’s meaning and significance,” Kang told reporters as he appeared at the court in central Seoul late Saturday. “I will do my best so that the court will make the correct, righteous decision in a speedy manner according to the Constitution and law.” Shortly before entering his office Sunday, he said he came to finish examining records and sorting out materials for Monday’s session. Soon after the bill’s passage Friday, the court convened a meeting and asked the president to submit answers to its questionnaire within a week, shorter than the 10 days given to President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004.  “During the first gathering, which seven of the nine attended, they agreed on the need to process the case impartially and promptly for the safeguard and upkeep of the Constitution,” court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon said. For the motion’s ultimate approval, at least seven judges must attend a trial and six must give consent. The court is required to provide its verdict within 180 days, or until June 6, but it might come earlier given high public and political demand. Opposition parties are ramping up pressure for an early ruling. While urging Park’s voluntary resignation, Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, has said the decision should be made no later than the end of January to “avoid uncertainties” and put state affairs back on track as soon as possible. Her remarks apparently reflect concerns over the forthcoming retirements of two justices, scheduled for January and March. But whether acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn is entitled to nominate their successors remains in question. If they are not replaced, the motion would require the endorsement of six of the remaining seven judges, thus lowering the chances of its approval. “For an early normalization of state governance, the Constitutional Court should give advanced approval,” Choo wrote via her Facebook account Sunday. “It has been revealed that President Park has made a grave violation of the Constitution and thus is no longer qualified to protect it. ... The purpose of the impeachment trial is to swiftly restore the constitutional government.” Other opposition big shots echoed her view, including former chiefs of the minor opposition People’s Party, Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo and Park Jie-won, and Democratic Party Floor Leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. A rapid court process is essential to minimize a vacuum in state leadership and stabilize the situation in line with the people’s wishes, they said. Protest organizers reiterated Sunday their pledge to continue mass rallies until Park is ousted, stressing the need for stringent monitoring of the court’s activities. But the ruling Saenuri Party displayed discomfort with the opposition calls, urging the other parties to refrain from making any attempt to influence the justices. Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk also said the trial should be wholly left to the court and politicians ought not to present any “direction or guideline” one way or another. “The opposition would face the people and Constitution’s merciless judgment should it attempt an anti-constitutional offensive and rash presidential race, capitalizing on public anger,” party spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-won said in a statement later in the day. Meanwhile, Hwang moved ahead with his takeover of state affairs during the weekend, as he was briefed on various government tasks and held meetings with a focus on security. His emphasis on security is deemed a bid to veer away from internal issues, wary of the opposition and public’s criticism of his failure to keep the Choi Soon-sil scandal at bay throughout his four years in government, including as the justice minister. Concerns are growing over stalled summit diplomacy and a possible vacuum in foreign and security policy leadership at a delicate time. A presidential transition is taking place in Washington and China appears to be continuing to retaliate for Seoul’s plan to station a US missile shield. On Saturday, the acting president and prime minister met with Park’s Chief of Staff Han Kwang-ok, Office for Government Policy Coordination Minister Lee Suk-joon and other top officials from Cheong Wa Dae and the Prime Minister’s Office. They consulted on how to divide functions and protocol and escort issues, among others. Hwang then convened his second Cabinet meeting since the impeachment motion was adopted. Singling out national security as the “most important and urgent matter at this point,” he once again cautioned against North Korea’s possible military and cyberattacks aimed at taking advantage of the South’s nationwide uproar.  On Sunday, he visited the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul. “A small ant hole may tear down a great embankment,” Hwang told military commanders during the visit. “I want you to maintain a solid security posture such as by tightening vigilance so that the North could not miscalculate our domestic situation and commit a reckless provocation.”  With Park unable to attend a weekly meeting with top presidential secretaries, the acting president plans to preside over a ministerial gathering to oversee the current situation Monday, his office said.

A tough legal battle looms, as the president, embroiled in a corruption and nepotism scandal involving her secret confidante Choi Soon-sil, is determined to defend her job and name. Legal issues aside, observers say the court itself is stacked against forces that want Park gone as soon as possible. Two factors come into play: The ideological makeup of the justices and the expected departure early next year of two of them. In a survey of six Constitutional law experts, conducted by The Korea Herald last month, three said the court was likely to approve Park’s impeachment. Two refrained from making predictions, while one said the impeachment could be overturned by the court due to the two factors. Chief Justice Park Han-chul  and Justice Kang Il-won enter the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Sunday. Conservative judgesPark’s ultimate removal from office requires consent from at least six of the nine judges of the Constitutional Court. Of the nine, seven are considered to be right-leaning and pro-government. They are those appointed by President Park, her predecessor Lee Myung-bak, the conservative governing party, or the chief justice of Supreme Court, who was named by Park or Lee. Such a composition -- different from the equivalent system in other democracies like Germany where lawmakers elect all the judges -- presents an uphill battle to forces campaigning to unseat Park. On top of that, the court’s independence and political neutrality have been thrown into question recently. A memo left behind by a now deceased presidential aide claimed that Kim Ki-choon, Park’s chief of staff until last year, gave a directive to the chief justice of the Constitutional Court in 2014, ahead of the court’s ruling to dissolve a small leftist party accused of supporting North Korea. Kim has denied any interference with the judiciary branch. The Constitutional Court has taken a conservative stance on other divisive issues. In 2012, the judges ruled that punishment of medical professionals who performed an abortion was constitutional. More recently in 2015, it upheld a lower court’s decision to strip a union of some 60,000 liberal-minded teachers of its legal status, saying it has eight members who are no longer teachers. Because of this, even opposition lawmakers who wanted Park gone were at first reluctant to campaign for her impeachment. “I’m not fully confident that the court will approve the impeachment,” said opposition People’s Party Floor Leader Rep. Park Jie-won. “If the conservative judges reject the motion, it would be like giving Park immunity.” The Constitution states that the approval of the parliamentary impeachment of the president requires consent from six, not two-thirds, of the nine judges. This is important because two of the justices are slated to retire early next year and are unlikely to be promptly replaced, with the president standing trial and suspended from work. There is a legal dispute as to whether acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn can appoint new judges. How likely is Park’s impeachment? The aforementioned factors, however, are not the core issue. The real question is whether the allegations listed in the parliamentary impeachment bill warrant Park’s removal. This is why some experts predict the Constitutional Court may deviate from its previous conservative stance in the country’s second presidential impeachment trial. They say Park’s violations of the Constitution and laws are serious and grave and that the majority of the public want her gone, pressuring the judges to decide against the president. The impeachment bill, drafted by opposition parties, says that Park violated her Constitutional duties to preserve democratic values by allowing her confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs. Park’s is also accused of committing abuse of power, bribery and extortion when she colluded with Choi and others to force private businesses to make donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations run by Choi and give contracts to certain companies. “Park’s scandal is not about the political ideologies of conservatives and liberals. It is about the very basic ethics of a president and the core democratic values of the nation,” said Shin Pyung, a professor at Kyungpook National University School of Law and chairman of the Korean Constitutional Law Association. Constitutional scholars agreed that only if the court finds those allegations substantial and convincing, then they would find it warrants a dismissal.In a previous presidential impeachment trial in 2004 against President Roh Moo-hyun, the Court reinstated the liberal president. It said that the president had indeed violated the election law, but it was not a grave enough offense to remove him. “Compared to other public officials subject to impeachment, the effect of impeaching the president is far more serious. Thus, when trying to impeach the president, there needs to be some grave violations of the Constitution or law that can override the expected negative effect,” the court has said. The court gave examples of what constitutes as “grave offenses.” Among them are abusing presidential authority to engage in bribery, undermining the country’s core national interests, infringing upon people’s basic rights and manipulating election results. Unlike Roh, who admitted to a breach of political neutrality before the court reviewed his case, Park denies any wrongdoing. Since the nepotism scandal erupted in late October, Park has apologized three times but rejected the notion that it was her who committed corruption. Her only fault was dropping her guard down with longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, who used her closeness to Park to interfere in state affairs and win business favors. Due to their contrasting attitudes, the duration of the trial could differ, some experts warn. In Roh’s case, the verdict was out on the 63rd day after the impeachment bill was passed. This time, the court’s deliberation could take longer. By law, the court is required to deliver a verdict within 180 days. Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said that the 180-day-limit could be compromised, depending on case. The court could suspend its deliberation process to see what lower courts decide on the criminal cases brought against Park’s allies and foes involved in the scandal. Prosecutors named Park an accomplice to them, but couldn’t press charges against her due to her non-indictment privilege as the sitting president. Some experts say the court, if it wants, can speed up the process. “Regardless of how pending criminal trials related to this scandal end, the Constitutional Court can finish their own proceedings independently,” said Lim Ji-bong, a constitutional law professor at Sogang University Law School.

Some experts say the court, if it wants, can speed up the process. “Regardless of how pending criminal trials related to this scandal ends, the Constitutional Court can finish their own proceedings independently,” said Lim Ji-bong, Constitutional law professor at Sogang University Law School.  By Yeo Jun-suk","president embroiled in corruption ,voted to impeach park ,court tough legal battle ,nepotism scandal involving her ,scandal involving her secret","['Park Geun - hye', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Choi Soon - sil']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.09833173  0.27380064

From now on, I will calmly response to the Constitutional Court’s impeachment trial and the independent counsel’s investigation  in accordance to the procedures outlined by the law,” she said. All of Park’s authorities as a president were suspended at 7:03 p.m. Friday, upon the Constitutional Court accepting the Assembly’s motion to dismiss the president. The court will now deliberate the case to determine where Park’s alleged actions constitute impeachable offenses, a process that can take up to 180 days.“I hope that each minister -- with the prime minister and acting president  playing the central role -- will do their best to minimize any government vacuum, including in the economic and security fields,” Park said at the Cabinet meeting. Park is suspected of conspiring with Choi Soon-sil, her friend of 40 years, and her former aides on a series of wrongdoings, which include pressuring local conglomerates to donate funds to two nonprofit organizations controlled by Choi. Investigators suspect the money has actually been a bribe for Park and Choi’s inner circle.The embattled president denies the allegations. She insists that everything she did was for the sake of the country and she had no knowledge of the alleged wrongdoings of Choi and her former aides. By Yoon Min-sik","impeachment vote with heavy ,parliamentary impeachment with heavy ,will accept impeachment vote ,her impeachment yonhap truly ,resign immediately she called","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', 'the National Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60973614  0.09229945

22,22,[News Analysis] Impeachment heralds fall of Park loyalists,"Despite the lingering last minute uncertainties over the fate of President Park Geun-hye, the National Assembly on Friday passed the impeachment bill in a landslide vote of 234 to 56.The sweeping approval, which immediately suspended the embattled president from office, was taken as an undeniable signal of the fall of one particular political force -- President Park’s loyalists who dominate the leadership of the rul...","Despite the lingering last minute uncertainties over the fate of President Park Geun-hye, the National Assembly on Friday passed the impeachment bill in a landslide vote of 234 to 56.The sweeping approval, which immediately suspended the embattled president from office, was taken as an undeniable signal of the fall of one particular political force -- President Park’s loyalists who dominate the leadership of the ruling Saenuri Party. Some Saenuri reformists even claimed that the conservative party has no other choice but to disband itself and form a new entity that represents revamped conservatives after the demise of Park. Rep. Suh Chung-won  of the Saenuri Party participates in Friday`s impeachment vote on President Park Geun-hye at the National Assembly. Among the 300 legislative members, 299 participated in the plenary session to participate in the impeachment bill vote. Of them, 234 voted in consent, while 56 objected, two abstained and seven were counted as invalid.The prime focus prior to the floor vote was whether or not the number of consenting ballots from the Saenuri will make it past 28, the minimum needed for the opposition to attain the quorum to have the bill passed.But the 234 consents indicated -- on the premise that all 172 opposition and independent lawmakers voted in favor as pledged -- that a total of 62 Saenuri figures advocated impeachment.This not only exceeded the 35-40 mark which Saenuri rebels had earlier claimed but also constituted a near majority in the 128-seat ruling party.“If the  votes exceed 220, it will mean that a considerable amount of pro-Park members decided to stand with us, which will fundamentally change the political map hereafter,” Rep. Lee Choon-suak of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said in a radio interview earlier in the day.The parliamentary floor‘s 78 percent approval for impeachment largely came in line with the recent set of public polls.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea in the week running up to Friday’s vote, Park’s approval rating stood at 5 percent, with 81 percent of the respondents giving a negative assessment on her state affairs capacity.The voting result also meant that a significant number from those classified as pro-Park secretly casted their ballot in favor of driving out the president.In particular, it was the junior first- and second-termers who are rumored to have broken from the leadership’s leverage and casted a secret vote in favor of impeachment.Most of them, owing their April general election candidacy to the pro-Park leadership, have so far refrained from clarifying their stance over the bill, but have alluded some discontent over the disgraced president.The secret vote system, once considered a loophole which may let undecided figures slip away from the impeaching group, thus turned out to have acted in favor of the bill, allowing reserved pro-Parks to express their disapproval.As if aware of the growing sense of division, the pro-president group had urgently called for the rejection of the impeachment bill, especially during the last few days before voting.“We must at all costs prevent impeachment, which will not be the end of confusion but only the start of greater chaos,” said Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan at an urgent party meeting which was allegedly summoned by the pro-Park cluster.Choi, along with party chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun and eighth-termer Rep. Suh Chung-won, is deemed a leading Park loyalist. He was also the only one who did not appear in the session, thus making it clear not to vote for impeachment.Despite all these desperate efforts to rescue the embattled president from forceful ouster -- and thus to safeguard their own political career -- the pro-Park group failed to hold its members together.“It is only right that floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk and I should take responsibility and step down,” Chairman Lee said in a press conference following the voting result announcement.“I am ready to resign as soon as a minimum level of measures are made to prevent a power vacuum within the party.”What now lies ahead for political parties is an earlier-than-expected presidential election next year, which is likely to take place between April and June.All political parties are to readjust their political clock to have their presidential candidates selected in time and gear up for campaigning.Another key issue is the Constitution of an interim power which will take over the suspended president’s authority until the Constitutional Court‘s impeachment decision.While incumbent Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has come in charge, opposition camps have been denouncing his role, citing his close political affiliation with the president.By Bae Hyun-jung","embattled president from office ,impeachment bill in landslide ,friday passed the impeachment ,suspended the embattled president ,news analysis impeachment heralds","['Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78711832  0.19182517

The impeachment was a victory for many of South Koreans who have taken to the streets for the past six weeks in massive street rallies to demand her resignation.It was the candle-holding protesters who unwaveringly demanded Park’s immediate removal ever since the scandal broke in late October and pushed lawmakers to cast ballots to impeach her. The National Assembly in Seoul, a day prior to the impeachment. “Parliamentary impeachment of Park wouldn’t have happened if citizens didn’t light up their candles,” said former Rep. Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, referring to the large-scale candlelight vigils held nationwide every Saturday demanding Park’s resignation. “South Koreans are writing a new history today, with the candles. The parliament’s impeachment of Park is the beginning of a great civil “candle” revolution that will lead our country into a better future.” The first anti-Park candlelight vigil was relatively small, but grew with each passing week as more Koreans became enraged by the series of revelations implicating Park in the scandal and her refusal to step down.The first protest was held on Oct. 29, a few days after local TV channel JTBC found a discarded tablet PC, supposedly owned and used by Choi, which contained files of Park’s photos, presidential speeches and policy drafts. Protestors hold placards reading ""President Park Geun-hye, resign!"" during an anti-Park rally. The president made an apology a day later, saying she sought advice from Choi, who had previously helped her through difficult times, on public speeches. She rejected other accusations, saying she knew nothing about Choi’s alleged influence-peddling and embezzlement of public funds. As her apology fell short of clarifying suspicions, the first protest in central Seoul drew about 30,000 people. They voiced anger towards Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil who, despite holding no government post and having no policy background, manipulated power from behind the scenes.At that time, the protestors, mostly unaffiliated citizens who came with their family and friends, demanded the truth from the president. Only a few called for her resignation. The following week, Park reshuffled her Cabinet and presidential staff to diffuse public anger. But such actions were only seen as clinging to power amid the spiraling scandal. A day before the second rally on Nov. 5, Park made a second apology, saying she would accept prosecutorial questioning and an independent counsel investigating her. But she insisted that all she did was for the sake of the country’s economy and people’s livelihoods. At that time, the opposition bloc didn’t campaign for Park’s departure from office. Its stance was that a new, neutral Cabinet should be formed and Park should relinquish some of her presidential power to it. The second protest on Nov. 5 saw a nearly ten-fold increase in participants. Some 200,000 flocked to Gwanghwamun Square, vehemently calling for Park’s resignation. Startled by the massive outpouring of public fury, opposition parties leaned towards removing Park from office.The third rally came on Nov. 12, attracting up to 1 million people in central Seoul. It was the biggest rally in decades since the country’s democratization in the late 1980s. It was also the first time that protestors were allowed to get as close as 200 meters to the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae. Since the Nov. 12 rally, politicians from opposition parties have joined protesters on the streets, calling for Park’s ouster. The ruling Saenuri Party started to falter, with the pro-Park leadership and defiant rebels clashing over what to do with the embattled leader. Despite the large-scale rally, Park was still seen fighting back resignation calls, appointing a new culture minister and ordering the prosecution to thoroughly investigate a lobbying scandal involving a real estate development project in the southern city of Busan. Then came the fourth weekend rally on Nov. 19, which attracted 960,000 people at 60 locations across the nation. Protestors were further angered by signs of President Park refusing to step down and a remark by Rep. Kim Jin-tae, one of the staunch loyalists of Park in the ruling Saenuri Party: “The candles are blown out when wind blows.”A day after the rally, public prosecutors investigating the scandal named the president a suspect in the influence-peddling scandal and accomplice to Choi Soon-sil and her presidential aides on charges of extorting donations from local conglomerates. Breaking her earlier promise, the president refused to respond to the face-to-face questioning by the prosecution through his lawyer, saying it is politically “biased.”Days before protestors gathered again for the fifth anti-Park rally, all three opposition parties -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- declared a campaign to impeach Park. Then the rally on Nov. 26 set a new record -- 1.9 million participants across the country. By this day, Park’s approval rating had slipped to an abysmal 4 percent, according to a Gallup Korea poll. Stung by the undying public censure, pro-Park loyalists within the ruling Saenuri Party came up with a plan in which the president steps down in April, allowing the next presidential election to be held in June. The emboldened opposition set Dec. 2 as the impeachment vote day. About 1.9 million people packed the Gwanghwamun area during the sixth weekend rally against President Park Geun-hye held on Dec. 3. In her third apology on Nov. 29, just days before the crucial vote on her fate, the president offered to give up her presidency, but only in accordance with a schedule and legal procedure that the rival parties agree on. Park’s offer was a veiled jab at her foes and it did succeed to an extent in shaking the pro-impeachment coalition. The impeachment vote was delayed, as Saenuri lawmakers who had earlier supported the opposition-led motion changed their mind. It was again the people who showed up in even bigger numbers to lash out at both Park for refusing to resign and the lawmakers for so far failing to remove her from office. An estimated 2.32 million people poured onto the streets in the sixth rally on Dec. 3, making it the largest protest in the nation’s history. The rally forced the grey-zone lawmakers within the ruling Saenuri Party to switch sides again and rejoin forces to oust Park. The decision led to the passage of the impeachment motion on Friday, which many see as a triumph of people’s power. “If the public had not taken to the streets in large numbers like this, the lawmakers would have not moved to pass the impeachment motion,” Lee Byoung-hoon, sociology professor from Chungang University, told The Korea Herald.“It was South Korean people who forced lawmakers to end their political power game, listen to the public and join forces to remove President Park from office,” he said, adding it was an opportunity for South Korean democracy to mature. “From now on, rallies should evolve into a platform for the public not only to vent anger, but to reveal problems and find the solutions in society,” he said.

According to the National Assembly on Thursday, no lawmakers have requested time to address the floor ahead of the ballot during a plenary session slated for 3:00 p.m. Friday. “Traditionally, the motion related to the seat of public officials does not require additional debate among those that approve and those that disapprove,” an official from the National Assembly dealing with legislative process told The Korea Herald. The lawmakers could make last-minute requests for speeches during the session and take the stand if the National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun allows them to, the official added. The impeachment motion against President Park, proposed by 171 lawmakers on Dec. 3, is the only issue on the agenda for the upcoming session. Protesters hold up candles outside the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday, as they continue their daily rally demanding the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Since Friday is the last day of the Assembly’s current term, the bill will automatically die if the vote does not take place before midnight Friday. The Assembly official said secret ballots usually take more than 30 minutes, but the impeachment vote -- to be held in an old-fashioned and secret manner using ballot papers -- could take even longer. “Lawmakers may hesitate until the last minute given the seriousness of the matter,” the Assembly official said. In 2004 when lawmakers voted to impeach then-President Roh Moo-hyun, the voting session lasted for about an hour. Lawmakers will be given one ballot paper as well as one plate with their names engraved on it, which is designed to prevent multiple or illegal voting. If there is a mismatch between the number of ballots and plates, the voting is declared invalid and held again. The ballot, which is slightly bigger than a name card, includes a space where lawmakers can mark their vote for or against the motion, using symbols in Korean or Chinese. Other symbols -- such as O or X -- are counted as invalid. Wary of potential dissenting votes from those who had vowed to support the motion, some liberal politicians and civic groups suggested that the lawmakers should take a “proof picture” to show the voters that they had followed through on their commitment.The leadership from the main opposition Democratic Party and runner-up People’s Party voiced concerns that the move would clash with the principle of a secret ballot and decided to leave the decision to the lawmakers.“It seems to me that if the lawmakers refused to take the picture, they would be labeled as those who oppose the impeachment,” said People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won. “I am hoping that fellow lawmakers make their decision by themselves.” The ruling Saenuri Party leadership, however, dismissed the idea as “unconstitutional,” claiming that the measure would undermine the rule of modern democracy. “Each lawmaker is required to cast their ballots in accordance with their conscience and political faith,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.” Taking the picture of the vote and posting it online is an absurd request that I don’t need to respond to.”By Yeo Jun-suk","thursday no lawmakers have ,friday parliamentary vote ,on thursday no lawmakers ,thursday no lawmakers ,like friday parliamentary vote","['Park Geun', 'the National Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69325453  0.445802

Hong Moon-jong Thursday in a radio interview on YTN.“Even some among those who claim that  should participate in the vote  do not necessarily advocate impeachment.”The pro-Park faction, which still accounts for the majority of the ruling party, including its leadership, says party members should participate in the secret ballot, but vote against it.The party leadership thus seems to anchor its hope on “shy Park” figures -- those who have been concealing their allegiance to Park, aware of the public’s fury against the scandal-ridden president.South Korean President Park Geun-hye “Shy” voters are those that conceal their intentions until the actual ballot, creating a mismatch between polls and the final result of a vote.But public opinion experts expressed skepticism over the existence of such supporters.“The current corruption scandal makes it difficult for supporters to justify the president in any way,” said Bae Jong-chan, chief director at local pollster Research & Research.He also described the general sentiment of silent Park proponents as “ashamed” rather than “shy,” suggesting the Saenuri Party members would not easily slink away from sanctioning the president.The anticipation of the nonmainstream group standing against the president, on the contrary, is that the secret vote will encourage neutral lawmakers to break from the leadership’s pressure and uphold impeachment.Rep. Chang Je-won, in a radio interview with CBS on Thursday, optimistically speculated the number of consenting votes could go as high as 220-230, which means that at least 48 Saenuri Party figures will back impeachment. This figure is even higher than the 35 earlier confirmed by another non-Park member, Rep. Hwang Young-cheul. The number of Saenuri votes required to pass the impeachment bill is 28. The three opposition parties and independent lawmakers, all united for Park’s ouster, currently control 172 votes, 28 short of the required 200.Rep. Hwang, who speaks for the nonmainstream group, also referred to the possibility of going public with the names of consenters, in case the bill is voted down Friday, aggravating the already agitated public sentiment.Within the opposition camp, calls are increasingly being made for lawmakers to post their ballots -- approving the impeachment -- to their social media accounts, effectively turning the secret vote into an open one.The current National Assembly Act states that the floor vote on impeachment should proceed anonymously, though the given clause has been criticized for impeding on the public's right to know.But Saenuri reformists are still hesitant to bend to the pressure and go fully public with the names.“I hope that the rights of our lawmakers  as individual constitutional organs are not hindered by illegitimate means,” Hwang said.By Bae Hyun-jung","president faction alluded thursday ,crucial vote on president ,vote on president park ,number of undecided lawmakers ,hye impeachment the ruling","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Saenuri']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57666761  0.46304682

In their full-fledged efforts to push to remove Park from office, the three main opposition parties -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- pledged to resign from the National Assembly if the motion is rejected. “We are determined to pass the motion to take Park down from office, and tendered our resignations to the party leadership in case it is voted down,” floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea said after a general meeting of lawmakers Thursday. The party decided as its official stance that all of its 121 lawmakers would abandon parliamentary membership if impeachment fails. A flag reading ""impeachment Park Geun-hye Resignation,"" set up bya civic group, flutters in the air in front of the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. “This is a watershed moment in history,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the party’s chief, calling on all members to think only about the nation and its citizens and make sure Park is removed from office.  The runner-up opposition People’s Party and Justice Party followed suit, also announcing that all of their respective 38 and 6 members would give up their parliament seats if the conservative president survived the vote. The Justice Party went further to call for the complete disassembling of the National Assembly in that case. “The impeachment train has departed. Nothing can stop the train,” floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party said. Public opinion is overwhelmingly supportive of the opposition coalition’s campaign to oust Park over a corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. According to local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, 78.2 percent of the surveyed 1,511 citizens agreed with impeaching the president. The impeachment bill against Park lists multiple violations of the Constitution and laws. The president is also accused of “neglecting her constitutional duty to protect the lives of the people when the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing nearly 300 people.” Supporting her ouster are some members of the governing Saenuri Party. In fact, the fate of Park depends on a group of the Saenuri rebels. According to a poll conducted by a local daily, only 23 Saenuri lawmakers surveyed said they would vote for impeachment, while others either did not reply or express their stance.To pass the parliament, the bill needs all of the 172 lawmakers from the three opposition parties and independents, plus 28 votes from the Saenuri Party. “Just one vote can change the results. We will continue to push for the passage of the bill,” Rep. Hwang Young-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party said.If the impeachment motion passes Friday, the assembly speaker has to deliver the impeachment resolution to the parliament‘s Legislation and Judiciary Committee and send the copies to the Constitutional Court and President Park. At that moment, she would be suspended from her presidential power and the prime minister would take over.The beleaguered president is on the verge of ending her presidency after a swirling scandal revealed she had allowed her confidante and longtime friend Choi to meddle in state affairs. Choi is suspected of using her ties to the president to extort money from conglomerates and secretly intervene in government appointments.Despite the public’s strong call for the immediate resignation of the president, Park hinted she would face impeachment “according to legal procedures” in her meeting with the loyal conservative leadership of the ruling Saenuri Party on Tuesday. Rep. Choo demanded that if the president is impeached, the entire Cabinet, including Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, leave office in a news interview Wednesday.“The citizens would not let the prime minister stay in his position and stand in for the president,” she said.

The opposition parties handed in the motion to parliament last week, saying that Park violated the Constitution and other laws by allowing her confidante Choi Soon-sil to exert power in state affairs and enjoy unlawful benefits. State prosecutors have accused Park of being Choi's accomplice.A successful passage calls for approval from at least 200 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly. Accordingly, at least 28 lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party must give it a nod, even if every single opposition and independent lawmaker votes for the impeachment.A group of non-Park lawmakers in Saenuri said it has secured support from around 40 lawmakers, but uncertainties remain, with some casting doubts on the level of support.While the group earlier asked the opposition parties to exclude the sinking of the Sewol ferry, which left more than 300 dead or missing, as one of the grounds for Park's impeachment, the main opposition Democratic Party said it has no intention to do so.The opposition parties claim Park failed to protect the safety of the people as stipulated by the Constitution.The Park dissenters' group said it will continue to persuade the opposition parties, adding the issue remains one of the major hurdles for Saenuri's participation in the motion.Lawmakers of the Democratic Party said they will resign en masse if the impeachment fails to pass the parliament on Friday.Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the Democratic Party's floor leader, said the announcement reflects its members' determination.Members of the splinter People's Party also said they will step down if the vote is rejected.Park loyalists at Saenuri continued to protest the motion, adding the parliament should instead seek a peaceful resignation for Park.""It is still not too late to stop the impeachment, and have Park step down in April and hold the presidential election in June,"" Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, the Saenuri chief emphasized.National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun said the parliament will not be open to the public Friday as requested by some opposition lawmakers, but said he will allow protests at the front gate. Once the motion is passed, Park will be barred from the management of state affairs and her powers will be handed over to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.Among the key authorities of the president as stipulated by the Constitution are the control over the military, the right to clinch treaties with other countries, and the power to exercise vetoes.Following the passage of the impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court will then review its legitimacy, with the proceedings to take upwards of 180 days. Park earlier said she will wait for the outcome, ruling out the possibility that she will step down voluntarily. In 2004, the National Assembly passed an impeachment motion for late former President Roh Moo-hyun, although it was later turned down by the Constitutional Court. Park, who was then a lawmaker of the Grand National Party, the predecessor of Saenuri, also participated in the motion. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the head of the Democratic Party, voted for Roh's impeachment, although Rep. Chung Dong-young of the People's Party took a leading role in the campaign against his ouster. Both of them support the impeachment of Park at present.During the Constitutional Court's proceedings, Park will still receive the same protection and support as president. Her paycheck will also remain unchanged, although some duty-related expenses will be cut. If the impeachment is approved by the court, Park will not be able to receive the benefits provided to former presidents. By law, former presidents are provided with pension, secretaries, drivers and medical coverage. An impeached chief executive, on the other hand, would only receive security protection.A local pollster Real Meter, meanwhile, said 78.2 percent of South Koreans approved the impeachment poll this week, up 2.9 percentage points from a week earlier. The survey was conducted on1,047 South Koreans with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","impeachment vote for friday ,sets park impeachment vote ,friday during the parliamentary ,parliament sets park impeachment ,park impeachment vote","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Park Geun', 'Constitutional Court']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53348231  0.34994617

Jang Si-ho, the niece of Choi Soon-sil Currently, the 37-year-old Jang is suspected of embezzling some 1.1 billion won  from Samsung Group’s donation of 1.6 billion won to Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, an organization which she and Choi founded in an alleged attempt to make undue profits ahead of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.When questioned over the accused embezzlement, Jang partly denied the given charges.“The suspected amount of embezzlement is wrong. There is still a sufficient amount in the center’s account,” she said, in answer to Rep. Kim Han-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.“From what I know, the center received 600 million won from the Culture Ministry and 1.6 billion won from Samsung Group. They are used for students.“Speaking for the Samsung Group was Kim Jae-yeol, president of Samsung Sports Business of Cheil Worldwide Inc.“Samsung Electronics’ Global Marketing Group made the decision ,” Kim said. As for the operation of the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, Jang claimed that it was her aunt Choi‘s idea to create the center.”When I was on Jeju Island, she suggested that I come and work . I wasn’t in a position to disobey her orders as she is my aunt,“ she said. After filling in the application and establishment plans of the center, she turned it in to former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong, she added. While shifting the liability upon her aunt, Jang claimed that her mother and Choi’s elder sister Soon-deuk were not involved in the series of allegations.”My mother has never visited , nor has she visited Cheong Wa Dae to meet with the president,“ Jang said.Over the suspicion that she used her ties with Choi to enter Yonsei University, Jang argued that she won her acceptance upon her own ability as a student equestrian rider.Just like Choi‘s daughter Chung Yoo-ra, Jang has also come under fire for excessive benefits when entering university in 1998.Rep. Song Ki-seok of runner-up opposition People’s Party had previously released Jang’s low academic achievements in high school, suggesting irregularities in her college acceptance.By Jo He-rim","at parliamentary hearing wednesday ,the niece of president ,assembly summoned 27 witnesses ,parliamentary hearing wednesday about ,parliamentary hearing wednesday","['Jang Si - ho', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Choi']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5890305   0.2861844

Since 2008, the yearly size of the fund has remained at near 1 trillion won.Meanwhile, the government newly allocated 13.5 billion won to implementing a new law aimed at improving North Korea's human rights situation.Under the law, which went into effect in September, Seoul set up an agency tasked with compiling North Korea's human rights abuses.The law also calls for the establishment of a foundation to support the relevant civic groups' activities to improve Pyongyang's rights situation.But the formation of its board has yet to be finalized, as rival political parties have not yet recommended any candidates.","ministry dropped 20 percent ,fall the 2017 budget ,unification ministry dropped 20 ,dropped 20 percent ,dropped 20 percent from","[""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'inter - korean']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35770926  0.59869683

The vote will take place as scheduled, they confirmed, regardless whether Park announces her plan for early departure. The president said on Tuesday that she is willing to resign if the political parties offer her a time frame and legal process for it, but the opposition parties rejected the call. According to their agreement, the three parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the runner-up People’s Party and minor Justice Party -- will gather signatures from lawmakers beyond the required count of 150 by no later than Saturday and submit it to the floor next Thursday. The lawmakers are required to vote within 72 hours of an impeachment motion being submitted.“There will be no faltering in our commitment to impeaching Park,” said the parties in a statement. “We were supposed to see Park suspend her duties today, but apologize for failing to uphold the people’s resolution.” The motion contains the allegation that Park violated the Constitution by allowing her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs. It also states that Park committed crimes of abuse of power, bribery and extortion when she colluded with Choi to force private businesses to make donations.The agreement came a day after the parties bickered over the voting schedule amid concern that they had yet to secure enough votes to pass it. The Democratic Party and Justice Party demanded prompt action, but the People’s Party urged them to wait until they secured enough votes from the ruling Saenuri Party. The opposition parties said that passing the motion on Dec. 9 is the most “viable timeframe” for them to convince as many Saenuri lawmakers to approve the motion. They had pushed to hold the voting session next Monday, but the move was rejected by Saenuri lawmakers. Saenuri lawmakers critical of Park --  whose votes are crucial to meeting the two-thirds majority required at the 300-seat National Assembly to pass an impeachment -- said that they would support the impeachment unless Park clarifies when she will step down by 6 p.m. on Dec. 7Rep. Park Jie-won , head of the People's Party, Woo Sang-ho , the floor leader of the Democratic Party and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party meet at the National Assembly in Seoul on Friday. The three parties agreed to vote on an impeachement motion on President Park Geun-hye on Dec. 9 “The president needs to clarify her plan to leave office and transfer her powers to the prime minister,” said Rep. Hwang Young-chul, who represents the group. At least 28 Saenuri lawmakers must approve to pass the motion, assuming that all opposition and independents vote in favor of impeaching Park. In a surprise announcement Tuesday, Park said she was leaving everything to the National Assembly, including the timing of when her own presidency will end. She asked the legislative body to decide the time frame and legal process of her early departure from office. Her term officially finishes in February 2018.The dissenting group also pressured the opposition parties into coming up with a unified plan to remove her from office. In a general assembly on Thursday, Saenuri lawmakers officially decided to recommend that the president leave office this April and hold a presidential election two months later. Until now, the opposition coalition has rejected the call, demanding Park resign immediately and unconditionally. Pointing to the fact that Park did not offer any specific timeline for her resignation, opposition lawmakers dismissed the proposal as a stalling ploy aimed at luring back her opponents in Saenuri Party.  “ is the most rational plan for us,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. Earlier in the day, Chung said that Saenuri members are willing to abandon ther parliamentary seats if the president refuse to accept her resignation plan offered by political parties. But it is still unclear how many of them would stick to their commitment in a secret ballot. In a survey released by local daily JoongAng Ilbo on Friday, Among 31 Saenuri lawmakers supporting impeachment in its previous poll, 21 said they would change their mind if Park decided to step down next April. Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the former Saenuri leader who had vowed to spearhead the effort to impeach her, told reporters on Friday that if the president set a date for her resignation, the lawmakers would not have to impeach her. Other Saenuri impeachment supporters said that if the political parties failed to come up with a unified plan for Park’s resignation, they would push ahead with her impeachment, even if the president said that she would resign next April. “There are no changes to our plan for impeaching her,” said Rep. Yoo Seong-min of Saenuri Party, another key Park opponent. “If the political parties fail to reach an agreement when opposition parties rejected Park’s April resignation plan, we would join in impeaching Park.”By Yeo Jun-suk","opposition coalition decided friday ,impeach park next friday ,next friday an opposition ,president said on tuesday ,parliamentary impeachment of president","['Park Geun', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66357338  0.40262479

Jeong Dae-chul of the People’s Party was quoted as saying. The 71-year-old veteran diplomat, who has been with the UN for the past 10 years, was once considered the conservatives’ best shot at winning the next presidential election. Ban, though considered to be leaning center-right, has never publicly made clear his political inclination. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attends a press interview in New York, Monday. The UN chief has not yet declared his run for the presidency, although he has made several remarks that were taken as hints for such an ambition. South Korean conservatives are in disarray, with President Park, who won the election on the ticket of the Saenuri Party, deeply unpopular in the wake of a humiliating political scandal. Speculation is rife that Ban may team up with Park’s now-estranged allies and some center-left politicians to forge a new political force that stands in the center of the country’s polarized political spectrum.  Rep. Kim Moo-sung, a key figure representing the anti-president conservatives, also said recently that there is no reason for Ban to join the foundering pro-Park faction of Saenuri Party. Ban had a flurry of meetings with politicians this year, which some suspect may have been related to his presidential ambitions. In May, during his visit to Korea, the UN official encountered several political bigwigs of the Saenuri Party, including floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.In September in the US, he met with the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party and two major opposition parties. Ban is reported to return to Korea in mid-January after his term as UN secretary-general ends on Dec. 31. With President Park and Saenuri Party’s approval ratings plummeting to all-time lows, Ban’s popularity has also declined.According to a Realmeter survey released Thursday, Ban continued to rank as the second-strongest presidential hopeful, and is closely followed by a rising presidential hopeful from the Democratic Party of Korea, Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myeong, by 3 percentage points.

The conservative ruling Saenuri Party, in a general assembly of its lawmakers, officially decided to propose the schedule, in response to the president’s call Tuesday for rival parties to decide the fate of her presidency.It was a surprise agreement because the party is deeply divided into two factions: the over 40 lawmakers moving to join the opposition-led campaign to impeach Park and the rest who remain loyal to the president. “For a safe and smooth transition of power and preparations for a presidential election, party lawmakers unanimously agreed that the end of April would be the best timing ,” Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told reporters. Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-sukHe added that the schedule does not deviate greatly from one that would be presented by the opposition-led impeachment of Park. If the impeachment motion succeeds and the court approves it, Park would be stripped of her job around April, he said. The opposition coalition is trying to vote on Park’s impeachment no later than next Friday. The Constitutional Court is required to decide whether to approve it within 180 days of the parliamentary resolution. In the previous case against the late President Roh Moo-hyun -- in which the court decided against the parliamentary motion and reinstated the president -- the trial took 63 days.  The Presidential Office of Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday reiterated that the president has made clear her intention to accept whatever time frame and legal procedure that rival parties agree on.  By Lee Sun-young","should resign in april ,some 40 lawmakers ,april and an election ,resign in april ,the new president should",['Park Geun - hye'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77377295  0.65280783

Calling it the “Park Geun-hye textbook” after the incumbent president who initiated the drive to mandate state-authored history textbooks, they called for a complete abolishment of the plan. “The textbooks are not just partly wrong, but need to be retracted as a whole,” said Rep. Yoo Sung-yeob of the People’s Party, who heads the parliamentary culture and education committee. Lee Joon-sik, education minister and deputy prime minister for social affairs, formally unveils the three draft versions of controversial state-authored history textbooks at the government complex in Seoul on Nov. 28, 2016.On Monday, the Ministry of Education and National Institute of Korean History unveiled draft copies of three history textbooks stipulated by the state, which they claimed were designed to assert the country’s legitimacy and remove political bias. Opposition politicians and some civic groups suspect the move to introduce state-compiled books is an attempt by President Park to glorify the military dictatorship of her father. Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, was a military strongman who ruled the country for 18 years until his assassination in 1979. One of the newly released history textbooks is 286 pages, about 100 pages shorter than the current books, according to Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. An education ministry official distributes the pilot editions of controversial state-authored history textbooks to journalists at the government complex in Seoul on Nov. 28, 2016. There are eight publishers producing different textbooks that schools can choose from. The government plans to replace these options with one state-authored book.“While the pages were cut by a third, the modern history part has only been reduced by 0.4 percent. It is thought that the part about the former President Park Chung-hee administration increased,” he said. Rep. Yoo Eun-hye of the Democratic Party of Korea also pointed out errors in the draft copy.“In the high school history textbook, a picture of a performance in Paris is described as if it was taken in Korea,” Yoo said at the party’s special committee against the history textbook Tuesday. “Even the smallest facts are wrong.”The nation’s superintendent of education association released a statement Monday denouncing the textbooks, calling for the ministry to immediately discard them.“The whole process of the project and the intention was against the Constitution and cannot be justified. It does not even deserve the public’s review,” the statement said. A union of some 2,000 middle and high school history teachers echoed the statement Tuesday, saying the government’s unilateral distribution of history textbooks is not appropriate for the subject, which should be taught to nurture diverse thinking and critical points of view of students. “The textbook is poorly made without considering the current status of history education,” the group added.The conservative Korean Federation of Teachers Association also stated they cannot accept the history textbook as designated by the government. “The political stances of the writers are not balanced and it had stipulated wrong information, such as the date of establishment of the nation,” the group said. Education Minister Lee Jun-sik said Monday that the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Korean History will confirm after Dec. 23 whether or not the introduction of the textbook in schools in March will go as planned.  He mentioned a possible delay in the adaption of the books, adding they may only be tested in a small number of schools first. The Education Ministry previously revised the education law last December to use the state-authored textbooks from March, at least a year earlier than the previous plan.

The ministry and National Institute of Korean History revealed three history textbooks for middle school and high school students, called the “Correct History Textbook,” which they said were designed to assert the country’s legitimacy and remove political bias.“We developed these textbooks to help our students gain a balanced view on the country and its history without leaning toward any particular ideology,” said Education Minister Lee Jun-sik during a press briefing at Seoul Government Complex. “It is difficult to anticipate a bright future if students doubt the legitimacy of the country without feeling proud of our history,” he said, adding that existing textbooks issued by private publishers have been biased.  But the official introduction of state-issued textbooks next March is likely to face a tough road ahead in the face of massive rallies against the scandal-hit President Park and her signature policies. Following the unveiling of the book, civic groups heavily criticized the textbook for “beautifying” dictators, including President Park Geun-hye’s late father and former president Park Chung-hee, and their economy-focused policies. “The unveiled textbook is unilaterally glorifying benefits from economic growth by stressing roles of authoritarian governments and family-owned companies,” an association of some 480 civic groups opposing state-issued history textbooks said in a statement. “We are not going to recognize it as an official textbook.”The government, which has refused to reveal the full list of writers, released the names of 31 of 46 writers for the history textbook. The move is likely to further stoke dispute as it included mostly right-wing scholars and teachers left-wing scholars accused of justifying pro-Japanese activities during the colonial era and glorifying dictatorships.“Prominent scholars, experts and teachers in the field participated in producing the textbooks to base it on historical facts and constitutional values,” the ministry said. A third of the writing staff are from state-run organizations. Four out of seven writers of Korean modern history belong to neo-conservative organizations. There is not a single scholar who majored in modern history among them. The new textbooks cover some of the most disputed parts of the nation’s history, from its foundation through its depiction of economic achievement by former dictators to the pro-democracy movement.  The reinstatement of state-issued history textbooks has sparked resistance from who opponents who claim Park is attempting to rewrite history.In the revised version, the textbooks describe South Korea as being founded on Aug. 15, 1948 -- three years after Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule. That is the day of “foundation of the Republic of Korea,” or South Korea, instead of the “establishment of the ROK government,” according to the books. Right-wing politicians and historians see the country as having been officially launched in 1948 by former President Syngman Rhee. Leftists, on the other hand, say the country was established in Shanghai in 1919 in the form of the government-in-exile to fight against Japan. They accuse the new state-authored history books of undermining the independence fighters’ activities to win independence from Japanese colonial rule.The ministry also said that it stressed North Korea’s human rights violations, military provocations, nuclear development and how its leader Kim Jong-un uses its self-reliance ideology to justify its regime. The “establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” or North Korea, was revised to the “establishment of the North Korean government,” the ministry said. It also stipulated that the 1950-1953 Korean War was sparked by North Korea’s invasion on June 25, 1950. The government had criticized some privately published history textbooks for claiming both countries shared blame for the war. The government announced its plan to revise the current textbook publication system in October last year, criticizing the previous textbooks for being biased against leftists and highlighting the need for “balanced” state-authored history books.Park had emphasized the necessity of state textbooks to “normalize history education,” and recently said that failure to learn history “in a correct way” can cause one’s soul “to become abnormal.”Currently, South Korean middle and high schools use history textbooks that are published by eight private publishing companies and approved by the government. Primary schools already use a single set of state-authored history textbooks.The ministry plans to make public the draft version and receive feedback from experts and the public by Dec. 23, by releasing the textbooks in e-book form at http://historytextbook.moe.go.kr. Taking into account the opinions, the final version will be confirmed in late January next year, the ministry said. The final version of the history textbook is slated to be used at middle and high schools nationwide starting from the next semester, which begins in March. Lee dismissed speculation that the ministry is considering delaying the introduction of the textbooks or allowing both state-authored and privately published books to be used at schools in the wake of the massive anti-government protests.“We are going to adopt the state-authored textbook as planned. We don’t consider at all scrapping it, but we review ways for schools to better use them in the field,” Lee said.By Ock Hyun-ju","revealed three history textbooks ,three history textbooks for ,three history textbooks ,state authored history textbooks ,history textbooks despite criticism","['the Ministry of Education', 'Park Geun', 'National Institute of korean History']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21983063  0.29515344

Lee reiterated that the ministry is intent on gathering opinions from experts and the public to come up with a more ideal way to introduce the textbooks, not to abolish them. He was seeking to clarify his remarks made Friday during a parliamentary hearing, which had given rise to speculations that the ministry may scrap the textbook plan, depending on public and academic reactions to a preliminary version of the governmental compilations to be unveiled Monday. He had said then: “After seeing reactions to the draft version, we will consider how to proceed.” Opponents of the state-authored history textbook plan hold a rally at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul on Sunday. Opponents of the plan have been putting pressure on the government to annul the unified textbook plan, which is a project of President Park Geun-hye, riding on the overwhelming public disapproval of the conservative leader amid a major political scandal involving her confidante. They claim that the plan to replace history textbooks at schools with ones that are authored by government-chosen scholars is an attempt by Park to glorify former dictators, including her own father. Park’s father -- President Park Chung-hee -- seized power through a military coup and ruled the country for 18 years with an iron fist until his assassination in 1979.   Currently, South Korean middle and high schools use history textbooks that are published by eight private publishing companies and approved by the government.

This is the fifth week of major anti-Park protests since the scandal surfaced in late October. It appears to be the largest in scale since the pro-democracy protests in the 1980s. The police put the turnout number in Seoul at 270,000.Protesters hold a candlelight rally calling for President Park Geun-hye's resignation at Ghwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, Saturday. As in previous rallies, most of the participants were unaffiliated citizens who came with their family and friends. Many of them wore thick winter jackets and rain coats to keep warm, as Saturday saw the first snow fall of the season.  Participants sit in front of the makeshift stage at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul ahead of the main event to begin in the evening during anti-Park Geun-hye rally, Saturday. “It is difficult to take care of my children on the street during the rally, especially because it’s snowing and cold, but it is peaceful, so it’s OK,” Jung Young-hoon, a 36-year-old father of two, told The Korea Herald. “I had to come to show my kids that this is democracy. My children are young, but it is them who will lead the future of this country.” Jung Young-hoon and his family in front of Sejong Art Center in central Seoul during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally, Saturday. “I am afraid nothing will change despite the rallies, but I will still come to contribute even a little to making a change,” he said. Cheerful songs calling for Park’s ouster blared from loudspeakers. Street vendors sold candles, mats, raincoats and heat packs. There were also stalls selling hot snacks such as chicken skewers, sausages and fish cakes.   Protestors march towards the presidential office during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. “I thought this kind of mass protest was only possible in the past. I am proud and touched that we are showing the people’s power,” said Hwang Yoon-sun, a 20-year-old university student. “I will hold up a candle until she steps down.”Ahead of the main event in the evening, nearly 400,000 protestors flocked to four locations within a kilometer from Cheong Wa Dae, surrounding the presidential office. The marching rally was made possible after a local court ordered police to withdraw a ban that had previously sought to prevent protestors from doing so. Upon the court order, protestors were able to get closer to the presidential office than past rallies, gathering in front of Cheongwoon-dong community center, just 200 meters from Cheong Wa Dae.  Protestors are barred from marching to the presidential office by police bus barricades during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. As protestors were blocked from further access by police buses forming a barricade, they confronted police for hours, peacefully, singing and making impromptu speeches from the top of vehicles.“I am so proud that I am raising my voice against President Park Geun-hye as near as possible to Cheong Wa Dae. I will tirelessly speak alongside others to call for her resignation,” said Kang Geum-sook, 50, who came with her daughter. “We elected Park Geun-hye to represent us, not for her to abuse her power.”Protesters were careful to prevent violence. When signs of a possible flare-up appeared, protesters chanted, “No violence!” There were no clashes or arrests reported.  A protestor attaches a flower sticker to a police bus during the anti-Park Guen-hye rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. They also attached some 100,000 flower stickers to the police buses parked near the presidential office. The stickers appeared last week, paid for through arts crowdfunding website 7Pictures. The stickers were artist Lee Gang-hun’s idea to resist the police by turning the wall of buses into a “wall of flowers.”After the rally, some protesters volunteered to remove them. Korean National Police Agency chief Lee Chul-sung said last week he would tolerate the use of flower stickers, citing the title of a book -- “Don’t hit People, Even With a Flower.”“Many people are joining the rally, but are blocked by police buses. I thought putting flower stickers on the police buses is a beautiful and peaceful way to show our resistance against violence by the government,” said Jang Jong-ho, a 27-year-old office worker. As the sun set and people lit candles, the eight-lane boulevard of Sejongno turned into an outdoor concert hall. The protest reached its climax when legendary folk singers Ahn Chi-hwan and Yang Hee-eun took to the stage and sang their signature songs.  A sea of candlelights in central Seoul during the anti-Park Geun-hye rally, Saturday. Some were even seen shedding tears while singing along to Yang’s “Evergreen Tree” when the lyrics went “Although we do not have much, we shed tears hand in hand. Although our road is a long way to go and even precipitous, we shall overcome and be victorious.”At 8 p.m., demonstrators blew out their candles and chanted “Park Geun-hye, resign” in one voice. They relit them a minute later to show they would continue to hold candles until Park leaves her post. The crowd started to shrink at around 10 p.m. with people heading home. Some of them stayed until the early hours of Sunday, making impromptu speeches and enjoying musical performances.The first anti-Park rally held in late October was relatively small in scale, drawing about 30,000 people. But the protest has grown bigger as more Koreans have become enraged by the series of allegations implicating Park in the corruption scandal and her refusal to step down.Prosecutors suspect President Park of letting her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil, who holds no government post, meddle in state affairs and helping her extort donations from local conglomerates for foundations Choi controls. Choi was arrested for fraud and abuse of power this month. Park made two apologies in the face of public anger, but has refused calls for her resignation. The parliament is taking steps to remove Park from her post, with a vote for impeachment likely to take place as early as Friday.Park’s approval rating has slipped by 1 percentage point to reach 4 percent, the lowest for any sitting South Korean president, according to a Gallup poll released Friday. On Saturday, staunch supporters of President Park rallied at Seoul and the southern city of Daegu from 1 p.m. to counter the anti-Park protests. Some 100 gathered at Seoul Station, while in Daegu, Park’s political home turf, about 400 -- mostly senior citizens -- showed up.By Ock Hyun-ju","largest protest demands park ,corruption scandal protestors waved ,protest demands park resign ,largest rally in decades ,scandal protestors waved candles","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30767834  0.46111146

Hwang Young-cheul, spokesman of the emergency council of Park opponents, said the estimate is based on a survey of lawmakers participating in the group. He added the number of supporters may be higher if other lawmakers are counted.In the wake of the scandal, the ruling party was overtaken this week by the People's Party to rank third in public approval for the first time, according to the pollster Realmeter.

43,43,Park’s secret antiaging formula?,"President Park Geun-hye is facing her biggest political crisis, embroiled in a scandal that involves some serious wrongdoings -- corruption, abuse of power and leaking sensitive information to her longtime friend. Making her fall from grace even more humiliating has been the barrage of revelations that the country’s first female president may have undergone all sorts of anti-aging medical procedures -- even at Cheon...","President Park Geun-hye is facing her biggest political crisis, embroiled in a scandal that involves some serious wrongdoings -- corruption, abuse of power and leaking sensitive information to her longtime friend. Making her fall from grace even more humiliating has been the barrage of revelations that the country’s first female president may have undergone all sorts of anti-aging medical procedures -- even at Cheong Wa Dae when she should have been attending to her official duties.  President Park Geun-hye On Thursday, Cheong Wa Dae officially refuted the speculation, saying it is not possible to perform plastic surgery at Cheong Wa Dae’s medical clinic. It also said the purchase of some of the disputed medicines by the office was not to augment Park’s appearance, but for the health and well-being of all staff members working at its secretariat and security service at the presidential office. “It is simply not possible to do cosmetic skin care here at the Blue House medical unit,” Lee Sun-woo, head of the Presidential Office’s medical unit, said in a statement. A controversy has flared up this week after Cheong Wa Dae’s list of drug purchases was revealed to have contained injection doses of human placenta extract and vitamin shots commonly used for anti-aging and fatigue treatment, as well as pills to treat erectile dysfunction, including Viagra. According to the list made available by Rep. Kim Sang-hee of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea, Park’s office purchased 323 kinds of medicine worth more than 20 million won  between March 2014 and August this year. Among them was Laennec, for administration via intravenous injection, which is made of human placenta extract and known to improve the function of the liver, remove wrinkles and whiten skin. There were also Fursultiamine, known to help prevent vitamin deficiency, aging and fatigue, and Emla 5 percent, a numbing cream widely used for Botox treatments, laser facial rejuvenation treatments or dermal filler injections. “Such injections are not prescribed to patients at university hospitals because their safety and efficacy have not been verified,” Oh Sang-woo, a family physician from Dongguk University, said. The presidential office purchased etomidate-lipuro injections, which are intravenous anesthetic agents and known to have similar effects as propofol. Since propofol was designated as a psychotropic drug in 2011, imports of etomidate-lipuro injections have increased more than six times.On Viagra and the generic version of the drug in the list, Cheong Wa Dae said a day earlier that it was to ease possible mountain sickness during Park’s visit to high-altitude nations in Africa. In May, Park went on a trip to Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, whose capitals are some 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers above sea level. In regard to the purchase of the topical narcotic cream, the main doctor at the presidential office said: “It is to relieve pain of injuries staff members suffer.” Even before the Cheong Wa Dae medicine provision list was exposed, Park’s secrete anti-aging formula had been the talk of the town. Photos of her taken between 2004 and 2016 have circulated online, with online users alleging she looks years younger now, with less wrinkles and brighter skin than 12 years ago. A series of local media outlets reported that Park received expensive medical care at the Chaum Clinic, at costs of 150 million won a year, before she was elected president. She was found to have used a bogus name -- Gil-la-im, the name of a female lead in a local TV series in 2011, and is suspected to have not paid for the services. It was additionally reported that she even visited Chaum Clinic twice in 2013 during the day while serving as president. One of the medical treatments was reportedly for anti-aging by Dr. Kim Sang-man. Kim, a doctor who worked at Chaum Clinic, is suspected of prescribing vitamin shots to President Park under the name of her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Kim admitted he treated the president on 12 occasions at Chaum Clinic or at the presidential office. Kim even tested Park’s blood under Choi’s name at his clinic without the knowledge of the official presidential medical staff. Rep. Kim took issue with the nation’s top leader, whose health information is considered a national secret, having been examined and taken care of by a civilian doctor who holds no government post. “I doubt that the medical system at Cheong Wa Dae properly worked. I think that President Park’s civilian confidants peddled influence even over the official medical system,” said Rep. Kim in an interview with local media. Lee Byung-suk, head of Severance Hospital, who served as the first official doctor for Park, said that all the medical staff members from the presidential office were asked not to be present when the doctor Kim treated Park. Kim had been a family doctor for Choi and her family members since 2011. He was later appointed as one of the president’s medical advisers in 2013. Since he left Chaum Clinic in 2014, he has headed Green Cross I-Med.But speculations grew that Kim received special favors from the government for the dubious prescriptions for Park, as most of the injection drugs and vitamin shots were found to be made or imported by Green Cross. The prosecution said Tuesday it will investigate why Park received her prescriptions under Choi’s name at private medical clinics. Kim’s qualification as a doctor have been suspended for 75 days.

It has a mandate to investigate the high-profile case for a period of up to four months.Meanwhile, the presidential office renewed calls for media prudence, arguing there are many erroneous reports on its purchase of medicine.A local media outlet reported that in June 2014, Cheong Wa Dae purchased ""EMLA Cream 5%,"" a medicine to numb the surface of the skin before certain medical procedures. The report came amid rumors that the president underwent plastic surgery during a ferry disaster on April 16, 2014, that left more than 300 passengers dead or missing.""When there is a cut on your skin, you can apply it to anesthetize the area,"" Jung said, dismissing the speculation that the cream was purchased to carry out cosmetic surgery.Amid controversy over a list of medicine Cheong Wa Dae has purchased over the past several years, the medical office said those drugs were bought to provide timely medical services to all employees working under the president.Among the drugs was Viagra, a drug for men with erectile dysfunction, which the presidential office said is effective in preventing and treating altitude sickness. Park traveled to Mexico in March and Ethiopia in May, which are located 2,200 meters and 2,400 meters above sea level, respectively.The medical office also dismissed the rumors about cosmetic surgery, stressing there was no equipment to carry out any surgery.","officials resignations the presidential ,presidential office dismisses speculations ,senior officials resignations the ,resign due to conflict ,presidential office dismisses","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Justice', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'Choi Jai - kyeong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67155856  0.30483168

Woo Sang-ho, the party's whip.South Korea's three opposition parties have been seeking to impeach Park amid the influence-peddling scandal of her confidante Choi Soon-sil, who allegedly exerted power on state affairs and enjoyed personal benefits.Woo said the party will not discuss appointing a new prime minister or the Cabinet for the time being, adding it will instead focus solely on the impeachment issue. Local parties have been seeking the formation of a neutral Cabinet, with a new prime minister amid the leadership crisis brought on by the scandal.It will mark the first time in 12 years for the parliament to hand in a motion to impeach a president. In 2004, the National Assembly sought to impeach late former President Roh Moon-hyun, which was later turned down by the Constitutional Court.Political pundits expect 172 lawmakers to support the proposal of the motion, while the number could increase if Saenuri lawmakers from the non-Park faction join the move.For the successful passage of the motion, at least 28 Saenuri lawmakers must vote for the impeachment. While 32 lawmakers from Saenuri expressed support, pundits said there could be some lawmakers in the opposition parties that may vote against it.Once the motion is passed, the result will be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. Experts estimate the process will take some three to four months.","vote on park impeachment ,democratic party said thursday ,on park impeachment early ,vote on the impeachment ,park impeachment early in","[""South Korea 's"", 'Democratic Party', 'Park Geun', 'Woo Sang - ho', ""South Korea 's""]",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30782515  0.29785314

Nam Kyung-pil and third-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae -- called on other Saenuri members to break away from a clearly wrongful past and join the opposition-led campaign to impeach Park over the scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.“A president who undermines the values of the Constitution and violates the law for the sake of personal interests does not deserve the mandate granted by the people,” Gyeonggi Gov. Nam, formerly a five-term lawmaker, told a press conference at the National Assembly.  “A political party exists to serve public interests and realize its democratic values. Saenuri has lost its raison d’etre as a political party,” he added. Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil  and thrid-term lawmaker Kim Yong-tae, both affiliated with the ruling Saenuri Party, attend a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday to announce their decision to leave the party. With Nam and Kim out, Saenuri now has 128 lawmakers, and is still the second-largest negotiating bloc in the 300-member parliament. Nam’s Gyeonggi Province is a key political battleground along with the capital Seoul, whose mayor is an opposition politician. The Saenuri feud is deepening, with the faction that was less loyal to Park before the scandal having turned increasingly critical of the president. The faction of Park loyalists, led by party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, dominates the party’s leadership council. It is resisting growing calls from within the party to step down to allow new leadership to win back voters. With Park’s poll numbers down to record lows, public support for Saenuri has also plummeted. According to Gallup Korea, Saenuri’s popularity is at 15 percent, the lowest for the conservative camp under Park’s leadership. Its main rival, the Democratic Party of Korea, has 31 percent support. Whether Tuesday’s defections would trigger mass defections of other anti-Park members or lead to an eventual split of the party remains to be seen, political pundits said. On the same day, Reps. Kim Moo-sung, Yoo Seong-min and other bigwigs in the anti-Park faction either refrained from commenting or ruled out the possibility of them following suit, at least in the short term. Yet, with the opposition gathering signatures for the impeachment motion and the president gearing up for a legal battle to oppose the move, it will not be long before Saenuri lawmakers make their choice between Park and the public. Rep. Choung Byoung-gug said, “Right now, Saenuri looks like Park’s private organization. We can’t go on like this.” By Lee Sun-young","tuesday quit the ruling ,members on tuesday quit ,governor lawmaker bolt from ,heavyweight members on tuesday ,rift between president","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Nam Kyung - pil', 'Kim Yong - tae', 'Saenuri']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31081825  0.34370905

The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and runner-up People’s Party officially decided to push for Park’s impeachment at their respective general assembly of lawmakers. The Democratic Party has also decided to install an organization to strategize on the impeachment process.“The reason why we decided to seek impeachment is that we believe it is the only measure left for the opposition parties and the people to bring the nation back on track,” said Democratic Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae. But the opposition parties have not yet clarified when they will submit an impeachment motion to the National Assembly.Democratic Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho said that the party would submit the motion when they “feel confident” about getting it through the legislative hurdle. The passage of the motion requires consent from more than 200 lawmakers of the 300-member National Assembly. Currently, three opposition parties and liberal-minded independents have 171 votes, 29 short of the required quorum. This means assuming there are no dissenting votes from the opposition bloc, at least 29 lawmakers from the president’s governing Saenuri Party must cast their votes across the aisle.Though a group of Saenuri lawmakers critical of the president -- such as its former leader Rep. Kim Moo-dung -- have demanded the impeachment of Park, it is still unclear whether they would cast their votes for a motion and how many Saenuri members would join them. “I think we have to wait and see until we figure out what  are talking about. I don’t know whether they would join us in proposing the impeachment motion or agree with us on beginning proceedings for impeachment,” said Woo. On Sunday, a total of 32 Saenuri lawmakers agreed on the proceeding for an impeachment, but refrained from suggesting they would vote for the motion. A poll released Monday by a local daily said at least 31 Saenuri lawmakers are willing to vote for Park’s impeachmentGiven that the Assembly law states that the impeachment motions should be put to a secret vote, opposition parties rushed to come up with a measure to ensure that dissenting Saenuri members would vote across the political spectrum. The People’s Party said Monday that they would launch a campaign to gather the signatures of more than 200 Saenuri lawmakers approving the impeachment. Democratic Party’s former leader Rep. Moon-Jae echoed the move, saying that the measure can help constituents convince their representatives to join the impeachment and prevent hesitant lawmakers from changing their mind during the voting session. “We have to make sure that the lawmakers reveal to the public whether they will approve or disapprove the impeachment. If some lawmakers refuse to do that, the voters can protest against their decision and help them change their mind,” said Moon during press conference Monday. Another concern lingering among the opposition bloc is on the Constitutional Court: Even if the impeachment motion gained bipartisan support and subsequently cleared the Assembly, the measure would eventually be scrapped unless six out of nine judges in the court approve it.The judges are dominated by conservative scholars appointed by President Park, her predecessor Lee Myung-bak and their governing Saenuri Party. And they are known to have applied strict standards when reviewing an impeachment motion. The Constitution stipulates that a sitting president can be impeached by the Assembly when he or she is found to have violated the Constitution or other laws. When the Assembly passed the motion against the late President Roh Moo-hyun and referred it to the Constitutional Court in 2004, the judges rejected the motion for the reason that the allegations were not “grave enough.”But opposition leaders have noted that the charges facing President Park, who prosecutors say played a key role in the influence-peddling and bribery scandal tied to Choi, is more serious than that of her predecessor Roh, who was subject to impeachment for violating political neutrality.“If the Assembly passes the impeachment, the investigation result indicating the president’s criminal act is compelling enough to convince the Constitutional Court of delivering a rational decision,” said Democratic Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae on Monday. People’s Party leader Rep. Park Jie-won warned against the possibility that the impeachment motion would face a stricter quorum in the Constitutional Court --  six out of seven judges -- as two of the incumbent judges are to retire early next yearTo avoid such a scenario, Rep.

Park has about 15 months left in her term. “ was included in the statement made by  legal representative and myself yesterday,” Presidential Spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters Monday, avoiding further questions on the allegations involving the feud-ridden president. He stuck to his earlier announcement that Park would no longer cooperate with the prosecution and would face the forthcoming independent counsel investigation instead. This also meant that the president would rather face impeachment than voluntarily give up power. “We hope that the current argument is solved through a legitimate procedure to judge the president’s liability on a constitutional and legal level,” Jung said Sunday, after Park’s lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha vowed to no longer comply with the prosecution’s investigation.While highlighting her disapproval over the probe, in which she was named as a suspect, Park did loosen up on her earlier attempts to retain her grip over state affairs.“President Park will not be chairing the Cabinet meeting tomorrow . Deputy Prime Minister for Economy  Yoo Il-ho will take charge instead,” said a Cheong Wa Dae official.This remark came in answer to the growing speculation that Park, after weeks of seclusion from the public, may at last make an official appearance as administrative chief.The president has recently engaged herself in a number of state actions, such as offering certificates of appointment to new ministers and secretariat officials and meeting with her Kazakhstani counterpart. None of the occasions, however, included an official keynote speech.It had been anticipated that if Park were to chair the Cabinet meeting Tuesday for the first time since the scandal broke out, her words at the meeting would effectively reflect her views on the situation. But by crossing out such a scenario, the president apparently leans toward the strategy of keeping the status quo, choosing to hold out until a possible turnaround in public sentiment.Such unyielding actions by the presidential house left the opposition political circles with few options other than impeachment -- the only binding legal action to force a state chief out of his or her elected position.The three opposition parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, runner-up People’s Party and progressive minority Justice Party -- on Monday called for an impeachment motion.Their intensified reaction came in the wake of the prosecution’s decision Sunday to include the president as a suspect, instead of a mere witness, in the corruption charges involving her aides.But in consideration of the time-consuming and challenging process of impeachment -- which not only requires a parliamentary consent but also the approval of the Constitutional Court -- the parties also vowed to continue their calls for Park’s voluntary resignation as part of a two-pronged strategy.By Bae Hyun-jung","battle to remove president ,impeachment the embattled president ,political battle to remove ,battle for impeachment begins ,begins the political battle","['Park Geun', 'Blue House']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71218407  0.11736032

On Sunday, prosecutors first mentioned Park's alleged ""complicity"" in the scandal involving her friend Choi Soon-sil and her former key secretaries -- Ahn Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong -- among others. The prosecution said Park colluded with Choi, Ahn and Jeong in ""considerable parts"" of the alleged criminal acts, effectively turning the president's status to a suspect from a witness in the high-profile case that has rocked the country over the past several weeks.  The prosecution vowed to continue its probe into the president, though it said it cannot indict Park due to a constitutional clause that stipulates a president is immune from prosecution except in cases of insurrection or treason.The interim investigation result is expected to further infuriate citizens, who have been calling for Park's immediate resignation through massive street rallies across the nation, and spur political discussions for her impeachment. Park now faces allegations that through her aide, she allowed Choi to gain access to some 180 presidential speeches and government documents, some of which included classified information. The allegations raise the possibility of Park violating the law governing the handling of official secrets. The president is also alleged to have directly or indirectly pressured major conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations, which legal experts say could constitute an abuse of authority. Through her addresses to the nation on Oct. 25 and Nov. 4, the president admitted to handing over some of her speech drafts to Choi to get her advice, and claimed that her role in raising funds for the two foundations was based on ""pure motives"" to benefit the country.","very regrettable presidential official ,regret over the prosecution ,regrettable presidential official ,presidential office expresses regret ,regrettable presidential official told","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Cheong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61773789  0.4130038

Lee Jung-hyun, has been facing a backlash from party members.A growing number of Saenuri members are demanding a complete overhaul of the party leadership which is chaired by Lee and dominated by his fellow Park loyalists. Some members are even fasting while calling for Lee to step down immediately. Yet, the three-term lawmaker is refusing to budge.  Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Junyonhap)“I’m an elected Saenuri leader whose term ends on Aug. 9, 2018,” Lee told reporters Wednesday, marking his 100th day in the party’s top office. “No one can ignore average members’ votes that chose me.” Instead of bowing out, he pledged to retain his position at least until late December, a month before the party elects new leadership on Jan. 21, 2017. Rep. Lee’s insistence on his own timeline has pushed Saenuri to split. Earlier in the day, those critical of the embattled President Park, Lee and other pro-Park loyalists formed their own leadership organization and held their first meeting. A heavyweight figure, Rep. Kim Moo-sung, even mooted possible impeachment of Park. They cite Lee’s “special relationship” with Park as the rationale for his reluctance to leave the top office. Lee may be helping the president who is facing the biggest crisis in her political career but not the Saenuri Party. The chairman is hampering efforts to revamp the conservative bloc and win back voters, they say. “He is like a cult member worshipping President Park,” said Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, one of Saenuri’s presidential hopefuls, on Tuesday. “He is unqualified to lead a political party.”Lee’s “extraordinary” allegiance to Park is well known in political circles. Since running for parliamentary election for the first time in 2004, Lee was considered to be a “mouthpiece” for Park, who then led the main opposition Grand National Party, a precursor to Saenuri. He worked as a senior spokesman until Park was defeated in the party‘s primary for the 2007 presidential ticket. Though most GNP members who supported Park switched sides and worked for Lee Myung-bak, who went on to win the presidential election, the politician decided to stay with Park. Lee once told Park that he would leave politics if he lost the opportunity to work for her. Such a loyal attitude has earned the trust of Park, who observers say has commitment issues after seeing her father, the late President Park Chung-hee, assassinated by his long-time confidant. “I have never seen Lee say what I didn’t say,” Park famously said in 2013 when she served as GNP leader. After Park was elected president, Lee worked as senior presidential secretary for political affairs, and later, as senior secretary for public relations. Even after being elected as the Saenuri Party leader in August, Lee’s relationship with Park changed little. “What the president thinks and what the Saenuri Party thinks should not be different,” said Lee during his first party meeting after taking office on Aug 10. “If you think that confronting the president is the right thing to do, you don’t deserve to be Saenuri member.” Now, with Park’s approval rating at a record low of 5 percent and the public’s call for her ouster growing, Lee looks determined to be in the same boat with the beleaguered president. By Yeo Jun-suk","facing backlash from party ,backlash from party members ,scandal tied to president ,backlash from party ,his fellow park loyalists","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Saenuri', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Lee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26128969  0.39870611

Making good on their pledge, the three groups -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- decided to submit a parliamentary motion to recommend the minister’s dismissal on Nov. 30 and put it to vote at a plenary session slated for Dec. 2.Its passage is likely, since the opposition bloc controls more than a majority of seats in Parliament.  Defense Minister Han Min-koo. A provisional deal was reached in Tokyo on Monday evening on the General Security of Military Information Agreement, which aims to enhance cooperation in coping with North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats. It does not require parliamentary ratification. A previous effort to sign the deal was derailed in 2012 in the face of strong public disapproval in Seoul. The opposition parties have threatened to unseat the defense minister if he pushes through the deal this time, without public consensus. The tentative signing came less than two weeks after talks reopened between the two countries on military intelligence sharing. The first working-level meeting was held on Nov. 1. Seoul and Tokyo had made official the negotiation’s resumption on Oct. 27. In 2012, many South Koreans had viewed a military cooperation deal with Japan, which had formerly colonized Korea, as inappropriate, particularly as the neighbor, with a history of imperialism, was seeking to boost its military posturing in the region. The necessity of military information sharing has increased, Defense Minister Han asserted, as North Korea is apparently racing toward nuclear armament. In 2016, Pyongyang conducted two nuclear tests and test-fired over 20 missiles, including its first successful launch of the intermediate-range Musudan and a submarine-launched KN-11.The ministry has been emphasizing the benefits South Korea will gain from Japan’s superior intelligence assets, namely its six Aegis destroyers, advanced radar technology and numerous anti-submarine reconnaissance equipment.The two countries have been indirectly sharing information via the Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement signed by South Korea, the US and Japan in 2014. But military officials have cited the need for faster and more direct exchange of information.The US Defense Department on Monday welcomed the provisional signing of a military intelligence sharing agreement between South Korea and Japan.“We noted the recent media reports that the Governments of the Republic of Korea and Japan reached a provisional agreement on a bilateral General Security of Military Information Agreement,” Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, told Yonhap News Agency. “A potential ROK-Japan GSOMIA could strengthen cooperation between our two closest allies in Northeast Asia, particularly in light of the growing threat posed by North Korea,” he said.From news report","signing opposition parties tuesday ,opposition parties tuesday ,opposition parties tuesday set ,minister dismissal on nov ,cries foul over korea","['Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Japan', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08140381  0.27590364

Park appears to have this plan in mind, having asked the opposition to field a new prime minister. Doubts, however, persist that Park may continue to remain the effective president, especially as she has so far refrained from clearly defining the intensified role of an incoming prime minister.Skeptics have also pointed out that a fill-in prime minister would not be able to exert actual power on state affairs, which would eventually lead to a power vacuum -- a situation no better than the possible political upheaval caused by impeachment, or even an earlier-than-expected presidential election.Another challenge is that the selection of a new prime minister is still up in the air.With her earlier appointment of Kim Byong-joon thwarted by the opposition, Park proposed that rival parties recommend an alternative candidate, an idea unlikely to pick up momentum due to the ongoing partisan divide.ImpeachmentImpeachment, the official sanction which the legislature is entitled to impose upon the state chief, has so far been shelved due to risks of backfiring.Based on Clause 65 of the Constitution, the National Assembly may vote on a motion of impeachment, if the president has breached the Constitution or other laws. Once the motion obtains the legislature’s approval, its final effectuation is to be decided by the Constitutional Court.Some opposition figures, mostly those from the People’s Party, have claimed that such a forceful procedure has now become inevitable given the president’s apparent refusal to step down.But it was former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung who rekindled talks of impeachment on Sunday, becoming the first ruling party official to call for the legal penalty upon the president.The ruling party bigwig’s move gave momentum to the stalled impeachment gesture, as the opposition camp, despite its parliamentary majority, would need some dozens of extra votes in order to pass the motion.The three opposition parties together hold 165 seats on the floor, short of a quorum of 200, which is two-thirds of the 300-seat Assembly.But ironically, as binding as the impeachment may be, this may be a less harmful solution for Park, considering the precedent of the late President Roh Moo-hyun.The then-opposition conservative party had motioned for the impeachment of the liberal president in 2004, but soon was hit by political backfire as the Constitutional Court dismissed the motion.It is, in fact, the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea that is refraining from suggesting impeachment, as it claims the months-long procedure would only buy more time for the distressed president and ruling party.Voluntary resignationDifferentiating themselves from the main opposition, the two minority opposition parties -- the runner-up People’s Party and progressive Justice Party -- assert that immediate resignation is the only acceptable response from a president who has utterly lost the nation’s trust.If Park decides to resign, though the choice seems unlikely, the Constitution states that a by-election be held within 60 days to elect a successor, who would take office not for the remaining of the predecessor’s term, but for a full five-year term. Until then, the prime minister would fill in.The only plausible reason Park may resort to this scenario -- and become the nation’s first democratically elected president to step down mid-term -- is that she has already reached a political dead end, only facing harsher consequences otherwise.The president’s approval rating, since recording a record-low of 5 percent on Nov. 4, still remained in the 5-11 percent range as of Monday, depending on the pollster.This unseen near zero public support, combined with a series of massive protests held each weekend, has already posed critical challenges for the president’s state operations.It has, however, been the consistent stance of the Blue House that a state leadership vacuum would only further intensify the current political chaos, as well as increase risks on the nation’s economy.Park’s resignation has also been shunned by the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which has no leading presidential hopeful other than UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose affiliation with the party remains speculative.By Bae Hyun-jung","series of corruption scandals ,political deadlock the presidential ,political pressure the scandal ,corruption scandals involving her ,ever worsening voter sentiment","['Park Geun', 'Cheong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49778014  0.27055383

Lee Jung-hyun, the head of Saenuri, said it would be unconstitutional for Park give up control entirely, adding Moon has made a hasty remark.""Moon is a lawyer and also formerly worked as a presidential secretary.  presidents vow to follow the Constitution when they take oath of office,"" Lee said, adding Moon needs to explain himself in regards to his demands.Lee said Moon should make it clear if he is trying to bring about a paralysis of state affairs.The Saenuri head also requested opposition parties to hold discussions on the selection of a new prime minister to head the neutral Cabinet.Park earlier said she would withdraw the nomination of Kim Byong-joon, a prime minister designate, requesting the parliament to recommend another candidate amid the opposition parties' criticism that they cannot accept a designation that did not reflected the voice of the National Assembly.Opposition parties have distanced themselves from starting discussions about a new prime minister, adding the president should first clearly define her role for the remainder of her term in office that ends in February 2018 and hand over most of her powers to a neutral Cabinet.","opposition call for president ,the military is unconstitutional ,next year presidential race ,park renounce control of ,control of military unconstitutional","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Democratic Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.646281   -0.2690998

55,55,Park withdraws disputed PM nomination,"President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday requested the legislature recommend a new prime minister candidate, giving in to the opposition’s resistance to her earlier appointment of Kim Byong-joon.She also indicated consenting to a prime minister taking charge of most domestic state affairs -- a direction that could reduce her power as state chief.“I have come to meet with Speaker (Chung) today as I believe it is my greate...","President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday requested the legislature recommend a new prime minister candidate, giving in to the opposition’s resistance to her earlier appointment of Kim Byong-joon.She also indicated consenting to a prime minister taking charge of most domestic state affairs -- a direction that could reduce her power as state chief.“I have come to meet with Speaker  today as I believe it is my greatest obligation to normalize state affairs,” Park said in a rare meeting with legislative chief Chung Sye-kyun.President Park Geun-hye talks with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun on Tuesday. “Should the National Assembly recommend a suitable candidate through interparty agreement, I will name that person as prime minister to practically control the Cabinet.”Park’s move to hand over the nominating right to the legislature was largely taken as consenting to the idea of a “neutral Cabinet.”Earlier proposed by both the ruling and opposition parties, expanding the role of the Cabinet is considered a countermeasure to the current political deadlock, as well as an alternative to the disgraced president’s resignation.The president’s surprise visit came two weeks after she suggested a constitutional revision in a regular parliamentary address -- an issue soon overshadowed by reports of the extensive corruption scandal involving the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil.This was also the first time the president showed up at the legislature with no preset agenda, which seemed to reflect Park’s sense of crisis over public antipathy toward her administration.Park was accompanied by her new Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok and political adviser Hur Won-je, who had visited the parliament the previous day to mediate between the president and opposition parties.“I believe that the president has made a difficult decision ,” Speaker Chung said.“I hope that  embraces the public sentiment, which was shown in the candlelight rallies over the weekend, and uses the current crisis as a stepping stone for improvement.”But in spite of the progress made on the prime minister issue, the 13-minute meeting largely fell short of the Blue House’s original intention.“We are currently asking for cooperation from the opposition, so as to make a breakthrough in the current situation,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters earlier in the morning.Jung’s explanation followed a Facebook post by Rep. Park Jie-won, floor leader and interim chief of the second-biggest opposition People’s Party.“According to a notice from the speaker’s office, the president is coming to visit the Assembly at 10:30 a.m. today. I am not going,” the fourth-term lawmaker wrote.The senior opposition lawmaker’s remark reflected the political strife over the president’s prime ministerial nomination of Kim Byong-joon, a former chief policymaker for the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.Though Kim was considered a likely figure, embraced by both the ruling and opposition camp, his surprise designation came under fire for lacking prior consultation with political parties.It was also taken as a sign that the president would neither accept a reinforcement of prime ministerial power nor heed public calls for her resignation.Standing by their earlier position, the three opposition parties -- the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the People’s Party and the progressive minority Justice Party -- staged a protest upon Park‘s arrival.Their consensus was that the president’s visit to the Assembly in spite of the obvious conflict was just a political show.“The president did not mention a single word on renouncing her power, which is the most crucial issue at hand,” said Democratic Party spokesperson Rep. Park Kyung-mee.People’s Party chief spokesperson Rep. Son Kum-ju even suspected the president had deliberately made an unheralded visit so as to make it look like the opposition was cutting off communication.The more outspoken Justice Party stepped up its calls for the president’s resignation.“The only way to express apologies to the people and to restore state affairs is for the president to step down,” said the party’s spokesperson Rep. Chu Hye-seon.The ruling Saenuri Party -- especially its President Park supporter Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun -- was alone in giving a positive appraisal of the president’s move.“The president has understood and responded to the opposition’s call for a neutral Cabinet,” Lee told reporters.“Also, her visit implies a strong determination to break through the current political deadlock by all means.”Some of the party’s nonmainstream members also claimed the president‘s decision, though not fully sufficient to the public’s eye, was a significant gesture.“The president admitted the fault in the process of prime minister nomination and provided a clue in solving the current circumstances,” said Rep. Yoo Seong-min through a press release.“It is now time for rival parties to work together in discussing the range of prime ministerial power and the incoming Cabinet, as well as the independent counsel .“By Bae Hyun-jung","tuesday requested the legislature ,park withdraws disputed pm ,new prime minister candidate ,disputed pm nomination president ,hye on tuesday requested","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Chung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52784598  0.55587685

President Park Geun-hye leaving after addressing Assembly ""If the National Assembly recommends a new premier, I will appoint him and let him control the Cabinet.""Later in the day, Chung plans to hold a meeting with the floor leaders of the three major parties, including the ruling Saenuri Party, to discuss the nomination of a new prime minister.On Wednesday, Park tapped Kim Byong-joon, chief policy advisor to the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, as new prime minister in a government reshuffle aimed at placating escalating public anger over the political scandal involving Park.The surprise designation came without consulting political parties, drawing intense criticism from opposition parties, which have demanded that a new premier be picked based on bipartisan agreement.During his talks with Park, Chung urged the president to ""uphold public opinion"" in her efforts to find a way out of the current political crisis.""The crisis facing the president is a crisis in state governance and a crisis of the nation as a whole, and thus people are very worried,"" Chung told Park.""Therefore, what is most important is placating public concerns,"" he added.The embattled president, then, urged the legislature to muster up efforts to overcome economic challenges, pointing to sluggish exports and the fallout from the ongoing restructuring of the shipbuilding and shipping industries.In the wake of the unprecedented scandal, opposition parties, as well as some ruling party members, have pressured Park to take a back seat in state affairs and delegate her executive power to a ""neutral"" Cabinet formed based on bipartisan agreement.To address the political deadlock, Park on Friday proposed holding talks with the heads of ruling and opposition parties. But opposition parties rejected the proposal, demanding Park first cancel her premier nomination and agree to the creation of a bipartisan Cabinet.  At the center of the scandal is Choi Soon-sil, who has been accused of abusing her longtime friendship with the president to meddle in state affairs and gain financially.The scandal has sent her approval ratings plummeting and left state governance in disarray, with her detractors calling for her to step aside.","park withdraws controversial pm ,withdraws controversial pm nomination ,tuesday effectively jettisoned her ,aggravated political deadlock sparked ,controversial pm nomination president","['Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34308633  0.29322651

As preconditions for the talks, they demanded Park withdraw the “unilateral” nomination, declare she will step back from state affairs and give up her ruling party membership.""The meeting can take place only when the nomination of Kim Byong-joon is canceled and other conditions are met. A meeting for the sake of a meeting is meaningless,"" Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters.Choo Mi-ae, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party Odds are growing that Park will dump the premier pick in the face of strong objection from the opposition parties. A Cheong Wa Dae official said “Time is running out. We have to discuss even the option of discarding Kim Byong-joon.” The president named Kim and Han last Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, in a government reshuffle aimed at coping with the fallout from the so-called Choi Soon-sil gate. Kim’s nomination was a surprise to many as he served as senior presidential policy adviser under the liberal administration of the late President Roh Moo-hyun, who ruled the country from 2003-2008.But it was far short of defusing her political crisis.Opposition parties and her rivals in the ruling party lambasted the president for not consulting with political parties. The opposition bloc has also demanded that Park take her hands off politics and delegate her executive authority to a neutral Cabinet formed on bipartisan agreement.During his meeting with Saenuri leader Lee Jung-hyun, Han appealed for bipartisan cooperation in coping with the negative repercussions the scandal has brought on state governance. ""Talks are held even during a war,"" Han said. ""The role of the legislature is crucial in this difficult situation.""The ruling party leader echoed the need to promptly hold the top-level political meeting to discuss a range of issues, including setting up a nonpartisan Cabinet -- a key demand by the opposition parties. Han also met with Park Jie-won, the interim leader of the minor People's Party, who repeated the demand that Park cancel her nomination for a new prime minister.Amid growing calls for the president to play only a nominal role in running the country, the presidential office said that if approved by the legislature, Prime Minister-designate Kim will be given the ""entire scope of authority"" allowed under the current law."" will give the new prime minister powerful authority,"" a presidential official told reporters, declining to be named.The official, however, showed reluctance over the opposition parties' demand that Park clearly state she would ""take a back seat"" to a new prime minister.""The question is whether the prime minister will have substantial authority in carrying out his duties,"" he said. ""I don't think the wording itself is important.""Meanwhile, Choo, the Democratic Party leader, plans to hold a breakfast meeting Tuesday with her party's presidential hopefuls to discuss how to cope with the fallout from the political scandal.Among the participants are former party leader Moon Jae-in, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and South Chungcheong Governor Ahn Hee-jung, a party official said.Choo has also scheduled a meeting with the leaders of the People's Party and Progressive Party on Wednesday to discuss their cooperation in handling the ramifications of the scandal.","opposition parties rejected president ,political deadlock on monday ,parties rejected president park ,opposition parties reject park ,parties reject park offer","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Han Gwang - ok', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3006053   0.26690018

Still, they denied reports filed by a local media outlet that the files indicated Choi's intervention in a Cabinet meeting held in November last year.Jeong Ho-seong, a former personal secretary of President Park Geun-hye, appears at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in Seoul on Nov. 7, 2016, to undergo questioning over suspicions he leaked confidential presidential documents to Choi Soon-sil. Jeong is one of Park's top aides who resigned on Oct. 30, following the latest scandal involving Choi, who is suspected to be the behind-the-scenes power broker of the current administration.He has been in custody since Thursday over allegations he leaked official secrets to Choi, the longtime friend of Park. Jeong was formally arrested early Sunday along with another former presidential secretary An Chong-bum, as a local court issued warrants. On Oct. 25 President Park apologized, admitting to handing over drafts of presidential speeches to Choi, who holds no governmental post, and letting her edit them.She offered a second apology on Friday, but failed to allay public outrage over the burgeoning scandal with her approval rating crashing to 5 percent last week. It is the lowest record ever for a sitting South Korean president, according to a survey conducted by Gallup Korea. Tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets over the weekend, demanding her resignation. Also on Monday, prosecutors questioned a number of officials from companies and foundations suspected of their involvement in the scandal, including executives at the Federation of Korean Industries, the country's largest business lobby. The FKI is suspected to have spearheaded the collection of nearly 80 billion won  from local conglomerates for two nonprofit foundations. There have been allegations that the money was then unlawfully funneled to Choi.The 60-year-old Choi is undergoing interrogation in custody, as the same court issued a warrant to formally arrest her Thursday night.","prosecutors find phone recording ,ex presidential aide prosecutors ,aide prosecutors said monday ,presidential aide prosecutors said ,they confiscated cell phone","['Park Geun', 'Jeong Ho - seong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48765081  0.45060468

The liberal opposition’s bigwigs are rushing to turn public anger over the Choi Soon-sil scandal into an opportunity to rally support. Heavyweights from the ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, are trying to set themselves apart from the embattled president and position themselves as conservative alternatives.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is rumored to be President Park’s pick for her successor, has taken a hit from the scandal, losing his longtime lead in polls of potential presidential contenders.     For the first time in 15 weeks, Realmeter polls Thursday put Ban’s popularity behind Moon Jae-in, the former Democratic Party leader. Moon’s approval rating was 20.9 percent, but Ban stood at 16.5 percent, 4.4 percent points down from a week earlier. Scheduled to end his term at the UN this December, the world’s top diplomat has not clarified his post-UN career, including his presidential bid for next year’s election. Many have speculated that if he does, he would run on Saenuri’s ticket. Now with the Choi scandal, some say he may not want to be linked to the disgraced party. “Given that our party is on the brink of being completely abandoned by the people, do you think Ban will join us?” Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk was quoted as saying by Saenuri officials during a closed-door party meeting Friday. Reeling from the scandal that has worsened factional strife between the pro-Park clique and their dissenters, some Saenuri heavyweights aim to present themselves as moderate power brokers by denouncing the president and her faction’s sway over the party’s affairs. Saenuri’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung called for a “complete overhaul” equivalent to the reestablishment of the party. Its former whip. Rep. Yoo Seong-min offered what he considered as an “alternative vision” for the conservative party by addressing income disparity and promoting fair growth. Though the two dissenting bigwigs had once built close ties with the president during their political careers -- former leader Kim once famously said, “Every Saenuri knows who Choi Soon-sil is” -- they noted that it is time to move beyond Park’s legacy. Encouraged by the remarkable, if not significant, increase in their popularity, the opposition parties’ heavyweights are trying to seize the momentum and turn public outrage over the conservative president into support for their presidential bids. While Moon has emerged as the front-runner for the 2017 race, other liberal or centrist bigwigs such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and former People’s Party leader Ahn Cheol-soo have not seen considerable boosts in their popularity. According to the latest Realmeter poll Thursday, Mayor Park’s approval ratings was 5.7 percent, 0.4 percent point lower than similar survey a week earlier. Ahn’s approval rating stood at 10.3, 0.2 percent point down from the last week’s survey. Such results appeared to reflect how each opposition bigwig responded to the burgeoning political scandal -- all three politicians demanded President Park stay away from state affairs, but they differed on specific requests.  Democratic Party’s front-runner Moon has refrained from publicly demanding the impeachment -- or resignation -- of President Park, fearing that such a radical approach would cause backlash among the general voters.  But most recently -- as the president appears to maintain her grip on state affairs by nominating the prime minister and Cabinet members -- Moon has adopted a more assertive tone. He said that unless the president backs down, he would make an “important decision,” alluding to a push for Park’s resignation. Former People’s Party leader Ahn and Seoul Mayor Park, on the other hand, were among the first politicians to demand the ousting of the president. The central-left politicians said President Park has lost the “authority and ability” to act as commander in chief and that political confusion caused by a power vacuum could be offset by electing the next president earlier than scheduled. “Even if the president were to step down, it doesn’t bring disruption to the country,” said Ahn in a parliamentary speech Thursday. Mayor Park told protesters at Saturday’s rally that “he will get the president to step down and bring an end to the president’s failure.” Among the politicians has emerged Seongnam City’s Lee Jae-myeong, whose unapologetic leftist message resonates with longtime supporters and is now extending to average voters since the outbreak of the scandal. The latest Realmeter poll showed that Mayor Lee ranked the fourth favorite presidential hopeful. He led Mayor Park by 4 percentage points, 9.7 percent to 5.7 percent. His gap with Ahn was only 0.6 percent points.

61,61,Park appoints ex-opposition figure as new chief of staff,"President Park Geun-hye on Thursday named her new chief of staff and senior political adviser, wrapping up the extensive shake-up of her secretariat aimed at defusing protest over the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Her previous reshuffle decisions had triggered backlash for “failing to reflect the calls for reform,” but this time the president chose to embrace a ranking opposition figure...","President Park Geun-hye on Thursday named her new chief of staff and senior political adviser, wrapping up the extensive shake-up of her secretariat aimed at defusing protest over the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil. Her previous reshuffle decisions had triggered backlash for “failing to reflect the calls for reform,” but this time the president chose to embrace a ranking opposition figure in an apparent gesture of reconciliation.It remains doubtful, however, whether the series of personnel replacements will be a valid solution to growing public fury against the president’s alleged connections to the unprecedented scandal.Han Gwang-ok Park’s pick to steer the presidential staff was Han Gwang-ok, the incumbent chairman of the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion and a former chief of staff for the late liberal President Kim Dae-jung.For the post of senior presidential secretary for political affairs, she tapped Hur Won-je, a former journalist-turned-politician and vice chairman of the Korea Communications Commission.“With his ample experience, as well as his devotion to democratization, Han will assist the president amid these difficult times and contribute to stabilizing state management,” said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk.Han reciprocated by saying that he will “gather opinions from all social standings and deliver them to the president.”The incoming presidential chief of staff is marked for his past affiliation with the liberal opposition. He served as chief of staff for the late President Kim Dae-jung and was also a fourth-term lawmaker in former bodies of the current main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Han seconded to the ruling conservative Saenuri Party in 2012, shortly before the presidential election, and has been in his current post as national cohesion chief ever since Park’s presidential transition team kicked off in January 2013.Park’s appointment of the former opposition figure was regarded back then as a gesture of political reform and social tolerance -- campaign pledges which she had vowed to achieve.The fact that he came from Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, which is part of the longtime liberal stronghold area in the southwest of the nation, also adds to the symbolic significance of his appointment.Despite the gesture of reaching across political boundaries, Park’s personnel decision was at odds with the opposition.“Not a day has yet passed since the latest shake-up which reflected her disconnection, not only from the public and opposition but from the ruling camp as well,” said Democratic Party spokesperson Rep. Keum Tae-sup in a briefing.The runner-up opposition People’s Party, too, blasted the president for turning a deaf ear to those asking for her explanation, apology and even resignation.Hur, the new senior presidential secretary for political affairs who replaces the feud-ridden Woo Byung-woo, formerly worked as a journalist for several local papers including the nation’s leading progressive voice Kyunghang Shinmun. He also worked several years in broadcasting companies KBS and SBS, after which he joined political circles as a ruling party lawmaker in the previous 18th National Assembly.He served as a campaign strategist for Park during the primary back in 2007 to win the presidential nomination of the Grand National Party, the former body of the current Saenuri.His expected function as the president’s political agenda chief is to “play a bridging role” so as to ensure communication with the legislature and citizens, according to the Blue House spokesperson.Though the post of senior secretary for policy coordination, formerly occupied by scandal-linked An Chong-bum, still remains vacant, Thursday’s appointments more or less filled most of the personnel blanks in top presidential posts.The embattled state leader appointed two new senior secretaries Sunday and a new prime minister Wednesday, along with a new deputy prime minister and public safety and security minister.Meanwhile, the prosecutorial investigation on Choi continues. She is the controversial friend of the president who allegedly used her ties with the state leader to sway key state affairs.After reports seemingly indicating the president’s liability, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said Thursday that he will suggest the president volunteer for questioning.By Bae Hyun-jung","thursday named her new ,protest over the corruption ,political adviser wrapping up ,park appoints ex opposition ,corruption scandal involving her",['Park Geun - hye'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41432878  0.42436239

The purported behind-the-scenes power broker does not hold any official position in the Park administration.""The current party leadership is responsible for failing to properly stop Choi's involvement in state affairs,"" Rep.

The ruling Saenuri Party convened an emergency meeting of senior members and agreed to recommend Park form a neutral Cabinet while reaffirming its demand for an across-the-board shake-up of Cheong Wa Dae staff. The session followed a Saturday gathering of core pro-Park legislators during which they explored ways for a sweeping personnel overhaul in the presidential palace and Cabinet.The decision came as the influence-peddling scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil continues to unravel, fanning concerns over a possible government vacuum. Rep. Kim Sung-won “We urge the president to set up a neutral Cabinet that could be approved by the ruling and opposition parties and trusted by the people,” Saenuri spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-won told reporters, adding the prosecution should carry out a thorough probe into the scandal given the return home of the disgraced Choi. The neutral Cabinet concept has been gaining traction as leading opposition figures relay their proposals, including the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea’s previous head Moon Jae-in and the minor opposition People’s Party’s Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. Senior ruling party members such as former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil have also expressed support for the move. Other lawmakers and experts have floated a “premier with responsibilities” scheme intended to split the president’s administrative powers by ensuring the prime minister’s actual exercise of his right to nominate Cabinet members and recommend their dismissal as enshrined in the constitution.On the campaign trail in 2012, Park herself said she would empower the premiership as an election pledge. Yet she has given little authority to her prime ministers throughout her nearly four years in office, especially in personnel affairs. On Sunday, former Democratic Party Chairman Sohn Hak-kyu urged Park to designate a new premier and the rival parties to forge a coalition. “Even if the president would not make the request, the National Assembly ought to agree on a prime minister candidate and demand her nomination,” he said at an event to celebrate his new book in Gangjin County, South Jeolla Province. Earlier in the day, Minjoo Party Rep. Min Byung-doo offered to launch a campaign to collect 10 million signatures calling for the establishment of a neutral Cabinet, legislative action for prosecution reform and the minimization of presidential power until the scandal is cleared. “The ruling and opposition parties, in cooperation with other parts of civil society, should immediately begin consultations to set up a neutral Cabinet,” Min said in a text message to reporters. “While keeping her engagement in administration minimal until the Cabinet’s creation, the president should be prevented from exerting any influence in the investigation into the scandal.” But the plan poses challenges given persistent strife within the parliament and a seemingly limited pool of candidates who could win bipartisan endorsement. It could be a more time-consuming process than other options due to the scale of the entailed reshuffle and parliamentary and administrative tasks to follow. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn also cast doubt over the idea during last week’s parliamentary session, saying, “It will likely result in a mere war of words with no progress in state management.”Among the names being mentioned for the new premiership or head Cabinet post are Sohn, former Minjoo Party interim chief Rep. Kim Chong-in, former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik and former Gyeonggi Province governor and lawmaker Rhee In-je. Park, for her part, held closed-door talks with some 10 senior members of civil society later in the day after meeting with eight elder Saenuri advisers Saturday, Cheong Wa Dae said. All of the 10 top presidential secretaries, including the embattled Ahn Chong-bum and Woo Byung-woo, tendered their resignations Saturday in line with Park’s instructions. Her Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong offered to step down last Wednesday, followed by her three closest aides, who are suspected to have been playing a bridging role between the president and Choi.

YonhapIn a text message sent to the press late on Friday night, presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk announced that the president ordered her senior staff to submit their resignation and that a reshuffle of the presidential office will take place shortly.The resignation en masse would include Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong, Senior Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum and Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo.An and Woo have maintained their posts all along, despite their frequent involvement in the queue of corruption disputes which finally traced back to Choi Soon-sil, whose extensive political influence-rigging has recently been revealed.Speculations had built up earlier on Friday as Park suddenly cancelled a pre-set luncheon with members of the Presidential Committee for Unification Preparation. She met instead with Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party and one of her closest political aides, to discuss the course of action.Floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, too, met with the president in a separate session in which he vowed for the mass resignation of the party’s leadership, unless Cheong Wa Dae takes gestures of “sweeping reform.”But no tangible actions were taken during the day, while the spokesperson and the senior secretary for public affairs merely said that the president was “contemplating” various options.What pushed the embattled state leader to make the last-minute decision is the worst-ever approval ratings as revealed by the recent series of public polls, especially the unseen drop among the stronghold cluster -- voters residing in the conservative-leaning Daegu-North Gyeongsang belt, senior citizens aged 06 or more, and supporters of the ruling Saenuri Party.A nationwide survey conducted by local pollster Gallop Korea on Tuesday-Thursday this week, only 17 percent of the respondents gave positive appraisal of the president’s state management, down 8 percent from the previous week.The regional figure for the Daegu-North Gyeongsang region stood at 27 percent, and the per age figure for the 60s and older group crushed to 36 percent, falling below the 50 percent line for the first time since Park’s inauguration.During the two days following Park’s “apology” to the nation, the given figures were even lower. Only 14 percent of the respondents’ pool thought positively of Park, indicating that the public did not embrace the president’s response to the scandal.But a mere reshuffle of presidential staff, excluding the direct liability of the president, is not a sufficient solution, the opposition political circles and a number of civic groups continued to claim.“ came four days after the first report broke out on Choi’s state affairs manipulation, which was way too late considering the public’s fury over this unheard-of scandal,” said the party’s chief spokesperson Rep. Youn Kwan-suk through a statement.Floor spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min added that Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn should be replaced to give way to a new Cabinet leadership that may win back the public’s trust.The Saenuri, while welcoming the president’s “determination,” also called for more radical actions, such as replacing the disputed secretaries who allegedly were involved in delivering confidential state documents to the disputed presidential aide.Calls grew especially from the so-called non-Park faction that the party should take more preemptive measures to distance itself from the scandal, which is sure to push away supporters ahead of the by-election and the presidential election next year.“The party should come up with countermeasures, including the possibility of establishing an emergency committee, if only to overcome this unbelievable situation,” said Rep. Choung Byoung-gug.Meanwhile, a number of civic groups suggested earlier in the week to hold a candlelight rally in Gwanghwamun Square on Saturday evening, calling for the president's additional apology and resignation.By Bae Hyun-jung","sweeping reshuffle of presidential ,an unprecedented political scandal ,unprecedented political scandal ,reshuffle of presidential staff ,unprecedented political scandal of",['Park Geun'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60520059  0.5571931

South Korean media have been citing claims she was deeply involved in the foundations which collected huge donations from conglomerates, and that the money was funneled to Choi. ""I can take poison and die here,"" Choi said, stressing she is innocent of the charges raised. ""I am too exhausted and reporters have made us into criminals.""Choi said she came to Germany to ""protect"" her daughter, adding the two are being used as pawns in political intrigue.Choi's daughter is also embroiled in speculations that she was unfairly accepted to Seoul-based Ewha Womans University. Some of the university's students argued that Choi's daughter received relatively higher grades compared to her actual achievements.On prospects of her returning home Choi said her poor health prevented her from traveling at present.  ""I am suffering from a nervous breakdown and I have been diagnosed with heart issues,"" Choi said. ""If I recover, I will ask for forgiveness, and will accept punishment if I did anything wrong.""Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said the ministry is taking all necessary measures to bring Choi back home, adding it is also ""considering"" the suspension of Choi's passport.""We have an obligation to keep information confidential in terms of judicial cooperation ,"" Kim said. ""Although we cannot provide details, we are working closely with out counterparts."" The minister also said the majority of legal experts do not consider Park as being subject to an investigation. When asked if there will be any search conducted on the presidential office, Kim added it will seek ""appropriate"" measures in line with the outcomes of the investigation. South Korea's ruling and opposition parties continued to express concern over the mounting allegations. Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the former head of the ruling Saenuri Party, who had a falling out with Park, said being sick is not an excuse to stay in Germany, adding she must promptly return home for investigation.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the former head of the minor People's Party who is considered a liberal presidential candidate, called for reducing the authority of the president, while suggesting a new prime minister should take the lead in normalizing state affairs.Both the ruling and opposition parties already agreed to call for a special prosecutor to look into all allegations raised.Amid the on-going allegation, Park's approval rate crashed.According to the survey conducted by major pollster Real Meter, Park's approval rate came to 17.5 percent on Wednesday, marking the lowest rate since she took office.More than 40 percent of the respondents asked for Park's impeachment or resignation, while 21.5 percent said there must be a personnel reshuffle at the presidential office. Amid the mounting allegations, lawmakers supporting a constitutional revision said the discussion must be pushed forward.They said the scandal should be considered a milestone as it proved the negative aspects of having a president with excessive authority.""The Constitution must be changed so that we can alter the entire system related to state affairs to prevent another Choi scandal,"" Kim Moo-sung said. ""After South Korea adopted a single five-year term system, six presidents had relatives arrested, while five of them left their parties,"" Kim said. ""As the winner takes everything in the current authoritative presidential system, there has been discord in every state affair, especially since failure by the opposition to challenge the president could make it hard to take the presidency in the next election.""Rep. Kim Boo-kyum of the Minjoo Party agreed that the scandal proves the weakness of the system, adding there must be a ""revolutionary"" revision to protect the people from those with political, economic and social power.","receiving presidential documents denies ,presidential documents but denied ,news report showed thursday ,admits receiving presidential documents ,presidential documents denies other","['Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'Choi', 'Germany', ""South Korea 's"", 'Segye Times']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42603177  0.44447234

Woo Byung-woo (Yonhap)“The given repor...","Controversy on a corruption scandal-ridden top presidential aide resurfaced Monday, with Cheong Wa Dae once again denying rumors on his imminent dismissal and gesturing at continuing their back-scratching relationship.This time, it was a report by an influential daily which said the exit of Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo is just around the corner. Woo Byung-woo “The given report is completely false,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters, referring to JoongAng Ilbo’s exclusive report which claimed that President Park Geun-hye has made up her mind to replace the civil affairs chief. “I understand that the president made the decision  so as to break through the political crisis ,” the newspaper said, quoting a ranking official of the ruling Saenuri Party.The anonymous party official suggested the measure is likely to take place within the week, shortly before the parliamentary House Steering Committee’s state audit on the presidential office on Friday.The growing speculation on Woo’s impending expulsion gained further momentum as the Blue House suddenly called off the president’s planned meeting with senior secretaries on Monday morning.“The meeting will be put off, due to internal reasons,” spokesperson Jung said.Asked about the reason for the cancellation, he said “there is no special reason to pay attention to it,” adding that such rescheduling has happened before.Instead of meeting with her top officials, the president will focus on seeking solutions to “serious pending problems,” such as North Korea’s nuclear provocations and the nation’s economic situation, he said. As for the suspected connection between the sudden cancellation and the alleged plan to replace Woo, the official refuted it, accusing the daily of false reporting.While denying the dismissal rumor, Cheong Wa Dae continued to hold its ground on not sending the disputed senior presidential secretary as a witness in the state audit, citing “common practices.”In contrast to the presidential office’s thorough defense of Woo, the Saenuri camp has recently gestured at summoning him as witness, hoping to make progress in the political stalemate and to gain an upper hand over the opposition.“I personally hope that  will show up , even for just an hour or two,” the Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told reporters Monday.“The reason that senior presidential secretaries were spared from past audits was because rival parties reached a consensus on it, which is not the case this time.”Having reconfirmed the Blue House’s move not to displace Woo, the opposition camp geared up on its calls for a thorough investigation into the extensive corruption charges circling around the disputed aide.“There is a plot to smother state affairs scandals and to silence opposition lawmakers, and at the heart of it is Woo,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chief of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea at a party meeting.“Under the National Assembly Act, Woo should by all means attend the state audit session as a witness.”Minjoo kicked off a special task force on Monday to dig into the allegations that presidential confidants, including Woo, had exerted pressure upon the prosecution to intensively crack down on opposition lawmakers.Since July this year, Woo has been under fire for a series of allegations, which started off from the suggestion that he had covert ties with key figures of high-profile corruption cases.His scandal later expanded to a larger controversy on the existence of an “invisible political manipulator” group, including not only Woo, but also Choi Soon-sil, a mystery confidant to President Park.The daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min and the ex-wife of Park’s former aide Jeong Yun-hoe, Choi is suspected to have influence-peddled in various organizations by using her close ties with the state leader.By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential aide resurfaced monday ,dismissal controversy on corruption ,scandal ridden top presidential ,disputed official dismissal controversy ,controversy on corruption scandal","['Civil Affairs Woo Byung - woo', 'Woo Byung - woo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24435911  0.30440551

Lee Jung-hyun.Chung, who is originally from the Minjoo Party of Korea, effectively fueled the controversy when he was heard in a voice recording saying that the ruling party should not ""ask for something for free,"" indicating the speaker may have wanted to utilize the dismissal motion to induce Saenuri to make concessions on other issues that are important to the opposition. While the ruling party eventually ended the protest a week afterward, the repercussions continued throughout the later parts of the audit as the parties engaged in existing and new political wrangling rather than bringing key issues important to the people and the country to the table.Saenuri blamed the opposition parties for the deadlock at the National Assembly, adding they only focused efforts on criticizing President Park Geun-hye, aimed at gathering support ahead of the presidential race in 2017.""The parliament must accept the public's criticism that the audit only focused on the upcoming presidential election and ignored the livelihoods of the people,"" Rep. Kim Gwang-lim of Saenuri said.The opposition bloc, however, said they were unable to roll out proper audit proceedings due to the tie between Saenuri and the presidential office.For one, opposition parties have been claiming that Cheong Wa Dae is suspected of being involved in raising some 80 billion won  in funding for the controversial Mir and K-Sports foundations from the country's major conglomerates. The foundations were created to promote cultural content that can contribute to national economic growth. The debate surrounding the transparency of such foundations hindered lawmakers from handling other issues, political pundits said.Throughout the weeks of the regular audit, lawmakers were criticized for making hasty accusations.Rep. Park Jie-won of the People's Party had announced that the country's spy agency has been taking steps to prepare Park's retirement home, which was later revealed to be groundless.The Minjoo also accused the head of the Korean Intellectual Property Office of using his power to influence a local defense company to hire his son. It later turned out the case involved a person with the same name as his son.Rep. Han Sun-kyo of Saenuri then came under spotlight after making an alleged sexist remark to a female lawmaker from Minjoo.A union of nongovernmental organizations that oversees the parliament's audit every year gave an ""F"" to the outcome of the first audit held by the 20th National Assembly, marking the lowest grade in 18 years. The grade is a notch lower than the ""D"" earned by the preceding parliament.The official closing date of the audit is slated for Wednesday, although most of the key proceedings will end Friday.","audit virtually ended friday ,ended friday with political ,the lawmakers failed ,friday with political watchers ,parliament audit ends","[""the National Assembly 's"", 'Saenuri Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69450164  0.33737347

The Federation of Korean Industries is at the center of a snowballing political scandal surrounding Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundations, accused of pulling strings to have member conglomerates donate funds to the foundations, which are suspected to have been run by a President Park Geun-hye confidant. “The FKI was supposed to represent business interests. Now that benefit has gone,” said Minjoo Party of Korea Spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min in a press briefing at the National Assembly. “The FKI has been relegated to a corrupt venue used by the government to extract funds from conglomerates.”Federation of Korean Industries‘ headquarters in Yeouido, Seoul Mir and K-Sports, established less than a year ago under the auspices of FKI, raised a combined 75 billion won  from major chaebol groups, such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG, mostly FKI members, through what critics see as “dubious” fundraising activities. The foundations claim the donations were voluntary. The FKI, after allegations surfaced, announced the two foundations would disband and be integrated into one. Minjoo Party lawmakers suspect the merger plan is an attempt to cover up wrongdoings. Prosecutors, launching a probe into the foundations upon a complaint filed by a civic group, said Thursday they would “faithfully” investigate the case. The disestablishment call was echoed by some ruling Saenuri Party’s moderate members such as Rep. Yoo Seong-min. The Saenuri former whip, who has pushed centrist agenda since taking office and clashed with President Park Geun-hye over her economic policy, demanded “constructive disestablishment” of the business group. Even President Park Geun-hye’s former economic think tank moved against the group. On Tuesday, The Institute for the Future of State, alongside liberal-based Solidarity for Economic Reform, issued a statement denouncing the FKI for being too politicized and failing to fulfill its original purpose. The government has distanced itself from the controversy, saying the FKI should decide its own future course. But Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho acknowledged the need for a change in its membership, which includes government-led agencies such as the Export-import Bank of Korea. Opposition party lawmakers have demanded the FKI cut its ties with those entities. This is not the first time the FKI has been embroiled in a political scandal during President Park Geun-hye’s administration. The business group was accused of offering illicit funds to right-wing groups such as the Korean Parent Association and the Center for Free Enterprise to help them push government-led agendas such as state-authored textbooks. The FKI was established in 1961, supposedly to foster a cozy relationship between big businesses and former President Park Chung-hee, who sought to lift the country out of poverty by supporting big businesses. Many believe it was formed based on a deal between business leaders and the president, who rose to power through a military coup. While it was credited with playing a role in the nation’s economic growth by advocating government-led export-driven economic policies, the business group also faced criticism for fostering cronyism and business-politics collusion. In 1988, the FKI was accused of raising illicit funds for a foundation run by then-President Chun Doo-hwan. Business experts said the FKI should at least be transformed in a more transparent entity, break away from “antiquated” business practices and embrace new economic trend. “I think the group has failed to serve in the interest of the society as a whole,” said Lee Jung-hee, an economics professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. “Things have changed a lot, but they are still acting in an old-fashioned way. It needs to change.” By Yeo Jun-suk","snowballing political scandal surrounding ,disband by opposition lawmakers ,of snowballing political scandal ,snowballing political scandal ,pressure to disband lobby","['korea‘s', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'Mir Foundation', 'K - Sports Foundations']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36152977  0.13183112

Slated to kick off as early as within the month, the organization held a pre-launch symposium Thursday afternoon at Korea Press Center.“The economic policies of the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations ended in utter failure,” Moon said in his keynote speech.In order to achieve a change of government, according to the presidential hopeful, the nation should adopt a new economic paradigm.“People’s growth means a just growth, a kind that returns the profits of economic development to individual households and puts people before companies.”But Kim asserted that such ideas -- of balancing growth and democratization -- were already included in the concept of economic democratization.The senior economist-turned-politician also added that the “growth” mentioned by Moon’s think tank is not very likely to take place.“We have already stepped into a stage of low growth and are not likely to achieve growth beyond the 2 percent range,” he said.The two former Minjoo Party chiefs have long held a tense relationship. Though Moon had actively invited Kim to take over the party’s leadership earlier this year, Kim has often expressed disapproval over the alleged power monopoly of the “pro-Moon” faction within the party.The latter also often mentioned the need to create a new power group that does not involve conventional presidential front-runners, triggering speculation he may later unite forces with a runner-up candidate other than Moon.Meanwhile, Kim mentioned Saenuri-affiliated Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil as a close discussion partner when it comes to economic agenda.“We meet from time to time to discuss economic democratization,” Kim said.He, however, denied the possibility of politically uniting with the ruling party politician, citing “dissent on the methodology.”By Bae Hyun-jung","disapproval over his policy ,kim disapproves of moon ,presidential election some ranking ,minjoo chief kim disapproves ,blamed moon for misunderstanding","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Moon']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27426815  0.38480487

Since being re-elected as mayor in June 2014, the activist-turned politician has been regarded as one of the candidates for the presidential ticket of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. Former President Lee Myung-bak was a Seoul mayor when he decided to run for the top office.  Park Won-soon, Mayor of Seoul. According to a survey released Monday by local pollster Realmeter, Park ranked fourth in the list for the most favored presidential candidates -- behind former Minjoo leader Moon Jae-in, and former People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon topped the list. Rep. Ahn reiterated his pledge to transform what he viewed as “antiquated” politics in South Korea, asserting that the next year’s election would witness “big changes” that defied conventional wisdom.“I will devote myself to changing the politics that the people have been fed up with,” said Ahn in a speech Tuesday at a community college in Seoul. “Any predictions based on conventional wisdom or current polling will prove wrong.” The former People’s Party leader also expressed confidence about the prospect of his centrist party which emerged as the third-biggest party in the latest general election. Ahn resigned as its party leader in June over a bribery scandal involving his fellow lawmakers Reps. Kim Su-min and Park Sun-sook. The entrepreneur-turned-politician withdrew his bid for the Seoul mayorship in 2011 to endorse Park. In the 2012 presidential election, Ahn also yielded to Moon, then presidential candidate from the main opposition United Democratic Party, who was defeated by Park Geun-hye, the conservative flag-bearer and now the president. Meanwhile, speculation over Ban’s bid for the 2017 election continued to roil political circles. Despite the popularity, the UN official and former Korean foreign minister has been vague about his presidential ambitions.

74,74,Opposition parties propose special investigation into farmer’s death,"South Korea’s opposition parties on Wednesday submitted a motion calling for a special investigation into the death of Baek Nam-gi, an activist farmer who died last month after having been struck by a police water cannon blast during an anti-government rally. “The opposition parties, along with Baek’s family, submitted a request for a special investigation to hold the reckless public authority accountable and find...","South Korea’s opposition parties on Wednesday submitted a motion calling for a special investigation into the death of Baek Nam-gi, an activist farmer who died last month after having been struck by a police water cannon blast during an anti-government rally. “The opposition parties, along with Baek’s family, submitted a request for a special investigation to hold the reckless public authority accountable and find the truth behind his death,” said Rep. Park Ji-won of the People’s Party at a parliamentary meeting. The People‘s Party is among the three political blocs united for the motion, with the two others being the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea and far-left minority Justice Party.  “As the government, which led Baek to die, argues that Baek died of an illness, opening a special investigation is the only answer .” Under the current law, an independent counsel can launch an investigation when requested by a majority of parliamentarians or the Justice Minister. If the proposal is passed, the parliamentary speaker sets up a special committee to recommend candidates to lead the probe and the president makes the final appointment. The special prosecution is given 60 days for a probe, which can be extended once for 30 days. The special investigation will allegedly center on the legitimacy of the use of force by police, cause of Baek’s death and alleged errors in his death report written by Seoul National University Hospital. Liberal civic groups and opposition parties lashed out at the police for using excessive force to crack down on rallies, while the police and ruling party cited the need to keep public order and dismantle what they called illegal and violent protests. Controversy has intensified since the 69-year-old died on Sept. 25 at SNUH, where he had remained in a coma for 317 days, as the police called for an autopsy. Baek died of acute renal failure, which doctors, civic groups and his family see as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage Baek was diagnosed with after he was directly hit by a blast from the police water cannon.Police applied for an autopsy warrant last week, claiming there were no confirmed links between the police water cannon blast and Baek’s death. The court issued a conditional warrant, requiring the police to seek consent of Baek’s families on how, why and by whom the autopsy is carried out.Police said they plan to execute the warrant before it expires Oct. 25. Baek’s family and their supporters have protested the autopsy plan, calling it “an insult” to the deceased and an attempt to shift the blame for his death elsewhere. They said that an autopsy is unnecessary, as the cause of Baek’s death was clearly the water cannon blast. Baek’s main doctor at SNUH further enraged Baek’s family after he put “illness,” not an “external element,” for the cause of his death in a hospital report. The doctor said that additional treatment could have saved Baek’s life, adding that Baek’s family did not allow him to perform hemodialysis. The family officially demanded the hospital revise the cause of death of Baek from illness to external injury.In the parliamentary audit by the Legislation and Judiciary Committee held Wednesday, the rival parties wrangled over whether to bring in the judge who issued the warrant as a witness and the conditions set in the autopsy warrant.“Judge Seong Chang-ho himself should explain what conditions in the autopsy warrant mean how it should be interpreted to ease confusion,” Rep. Park Ju-min of the Minjoo Party said. “As the audit cannot be conducted with an aim to peddle influence in an investigation or trial, bringing in the judge for questioning could lead to problems,” said prosecutor-turned-lawmaker Kim Jin-tae of the Saenuri Party. While the opposition party claimed the warrant can only be executed when conditions in the autopsy warrant are met, the ruling party argued the police can conduct the autopsy as long as they inform Baek’s family of their plan. “The court is triggering controversy by issuing an unprecedented form of warrant,” said Rep. Oh Sin-hwan of the Saenuri Party. “The conditions in the warrant should be seen as allowing the police to conduct an autopsy on Baek’s body if the police offer information to the bereaved families.”Asked to clarify meaning of the conditions in the warrant, Kang Hyung-joo, chief of the Seoul Central District Court said: “The warrant with conditions attached means that it could be carried out within a certain criteria. It means that the warrant is dismissed .” The rival parties in unison accused the court of dodging its responsibility to decide on the legality of the autopsy on Baek’s body. “The role of the court is to resolve a dispute, but the warrant appeared to accelerate the conflicts,” said Rep. Lee Chun-seong of the Minjoo Party during the parliamentary audit.

But they continued to clash at standing committees over some highly political issues. Scandals involving close associates of President Park Geun-hye were high on the agenda for lawmakers from liberal opposition Minjoo Party, while the lawmakers from the conservative ruling Saenuri Party sought to play them down.In one of the scandals, President Park’s confidant is alleged to have used influence to offer favors to conglomerate-funded foundation, while Park’s senior secretary for civil affairs Woo Byoung-woo is accused of taking bribes in the other scandal. Opposition parties’ lawmakers at parliamentary committees dealing with legislative and tourism issues urged the prosecutors to promptly investigate the burgeoning scandals, while Saenuri dismissed the call as a political stint to undermine the president. “For the rest of the audit session, we will focus on the allegation surrounding Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho, referring to the entities suspected of raising massive funds from conglomerates by pulling strings through a close associate of Park.The Minjoo Party lawmakers at Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee grilled officials at Korea Tourism Organization and Korea Sports Promotion Foundation over whether they were involved with helping a Taekwondo team recruited by K-Sports accompany President Park’s trip to Iran in May as a special treatment. Rep. Baek Hye-ryun of The Minjoo Party urged the prosecutors to promptly investigate the allegation, arguing that the business groups tied to the scandal had ordered their employees to eliminate relevant evidence. Last month, An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, was accused by a civic group of leading the dubious fundraising efforts along with Choi Soon-sil, who was known to close with President Park and involved with establishing the dubious entities. The Minjoo Party lawmakers also stepped up their attacks on the bribery scandal involved with presidential aide Woo. Rep. Cho Eung-chun, who served as a former presidential secretary for civil service until he resigned in 2015, criticized prosecutors for being worried about Cheong Wa Dae and delaying the investigation. The Saenuri Party lawmakers, for their part, appeared to be on defensive and urged their counterparts to refrain from raising what they view as a groundless allegation for political gains. Most Saenuri members questioned the government officials and other witnesses over the issues irrelevant to the controversy. “Since we are under tight schedule for the audit session, I hope we should avoid controversial issue,” said Rep. Kim Jin-tae of the Saenuri Party who sits on the Legislative Committee. “The parliamentary audit should focus on the people’s livelihood, not political tit-for-tat.” Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on Tuesday attends the parliamentary Security and Public Administration Committee for the state audit on the metropolitan government. YonhapBut the Saenuri Party lawmakers at Security and Public Administration Committee criticized Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon over his policy to help the young unemployed find jobs by offering them monthly subsidy worth of some 500 thousand won  for up to six months. “Some young people don’t quite fit the purpose of the program,” said Rep. Chang Je-won of the Saenuri Party. Citing the case where an applicant whose family’s annual income worth of 160 million had received the subsidy, he dismissed the initiative as “populist policy.” Some lawmakers attacked the mayor over his political ambition. Rep. Lee Yong-ho of the third-biggest People Party asked whether Mayor Park, one of the flag-bearers in the Minjoo Party, would leave his office to run for the 2018 presidential election. Park said that his decision to run for the top office is something that “he cannot decide on his own but requires the peoples’ call.” “I am giving a lot of thought to this plan but I also understand how important it is to serve as Seoul Mayor,” said Park.

The comment, seemingly inviting North Koreans to defect, triggered vexed responses from the communist regime.“ is shameless to overlook the South‘s  reality and speak of ‘defection’ so out loud,” said the North’s official Rodong Sinmun in an editorial Sunday.“President Park’s words, encouraging North Koreans to defect to the South, are extremely dangerous,” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea, said in a party meeting.The main opposition whip claimed the president thus implied the intention of “bringing down” the North Korean regime, deviating from the original pledge to promote communication and cooperation between the two Koreas.Rep. Woo also pointed out that a sudden fall of the North Korean regime would inevitably lead to an excessive influx of refugees and the consequent burden upon Seoul.Rep. Park Jie-won, interim chief of the runner-up opposition People’s Party, echoed the concerns, though he added with precaution that the South needs to ready itself for such a possibility.“We should always have a contingency plan, should the North Korean regime fall and its residents defect en masse,” he said. “But never, under any circumstances, should we deliberately create such circumstances.”The ruling conservative Saenuri Party supported the president, stressing that the disputed remark was only an expression of sympathy for North Korean residents.“North Koreans, too, are nationals of the Republic of Korea as defined by our Constitution,” said floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “Should they face political and economic difficulties, the  Korean government should step up to protect them.”The president’s intention was to actively embrace those who seek asylum here, not to forcibly bring residents from the North to the South, he added, blaming the opposition for egging on the political quarrel.The Unification Ministry reiterated the ruling party‘s stance.“ was merely to point out the poor human rights situations faced by the North Korean residents, as well as the regime liability for such reality,” a ministry official told reporters.Cheong Wa Dae remained at a distance from the bipartisan battle of words, refraining from directly commenting.It did, however, allude to its stance through spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk by pointing to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal titled “Liberating North Koreans -- mass defection may be the key to regime change in Pyongyang.”“The US hasn’t been able to stop North Korea’s nuclear program, so bravo to South Korean President Park Geun-hye,” said the US-based daily.“ Park deserves credit for ending the last vestiges of the Sunshine Policy, the appeasement of Pyongyang begun under President Kim Dae-jung in 1998.”The editorial also commended Park for shutting down the Kaeseong industrial park, a facility that yielded some $100 million per year, purportedly funneled into the North’s nuclear ambitions.By Bae Hyun-jung","power struggle on saturday ,dangerous the presidential office ,opposition blue house conflict ,as dangerous the presidential ,korean residents to exit","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'north korean', 'inter - korean']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69003212  0.53233683

Warning that dissenters would be punished, the ruling party’s leadership pledged to continue their boycott of the parliamentary sessions until Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun resigns over his decision to pass a contentious motion recommending the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo.However, the party has suffered a major glitch to its boycott as some of its member lawmakers have publicly urged the leadership to stop it. Rep. Kim Young-woo, who is a chairman of the National Defense Committee, convened the audit Thursday in defiance of the leadership. The ruling Saenuri Party’s Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun  talks with floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, who joined him in a hunger strike at the National Assembly on Thursday.  Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald“The ruling party shouldn’t act the same way opposition parties did in the past by staging protests on the street,” said Rep. Na Kyung-won. “We decided to urge the leadership to do its utmost to break the legislative deadlock.” The move was joined by other ranking Saenuri lawmakers such as the party’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung and Rep. Yoo Seung-min. They have long clashed with the faction close to President Park Geun-hye who steers the party.But the party leadership rejected these calls and continued their protest and boycott of the parliamentary audit. The committee meetings chaired by the Saenuri lawmakers failed to be held -- except for the Defense Committee -- while other committees headed by opposition parties performed the audit without the Saenuri Party’s members. “I need you to respect the party’s guidance established under the consensus of party members,” said the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Chung Jin-suk, who has joined the hunger strike that Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun started. “The value of our fight will not be diminished.” Saenuri lawmakers escalated their attacks on the speaker by filling a criminal charge against him for violating political neutrality. They claimed the speaker broke the law by changing a parliamentary schedule without coordination with the Saenuri Party to hold a plenary session and pass the dismissal motion. It was the first criminal charge pressed against an incumbent Assembly speaker by lawmakers. Throughout the history of the National Assembly, former Speaker Park Hee-tae was the only one who resigned during his tenure after being involved in a bribery scandal in 2012. They also accused the speaker of instructing the Assembly secretariat to publish false reports and undermining the reputation of Saenuri lawmakers. In the report, Chung claimed that he had discussed whether to hold the Saturday session, but the Saenuri Party claimed that they were only informed with a one-page document. Rep. Cho Won-jin, a member of the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council, raised fresh allegations that the speaker had violated electoral laws when he was elected as a lawmaker in the latest general election. Cho claimed he had obtained reports of such a violation and urged prosecutors to investigate. The speaker denied the allegation and vowed to seek libel charges against Cho. “The speaker will consider every option including legal measures. Cho should be held accountable for his remark,” said Assembly spokesman Kim Young-soo during a press meeting.  The tit for tat came after the Saenuri Party proposed a motion pushing for the speaker’s resignation. In the opposition-controlled Assembly, the Saenuri party cannot force the speaker to step down unless either the opposition parties approve the motion or the speaker steps down voluntarily. Currently, the Saenuri Party holds 129 seats, while the opposition bloc secures 165.As the deadlock continued, some ranking Saenuri Party lawmakers decided to attend audit sessions in defiance of the party leadership, who vowed to punish them for disobeying the party’s instructions. The Defense Committee opened an audit session at 10 a.m. and it was attended by lawmakers from opposition parties, but other Saenuri lawmakers did not join.“The chairman’s decision will aggravate the fight between the ruling and opposition parties,” said Rep. Kyung Dae-soo who represents the Saenuri Party at the committee. A day earlier, some ranking members from the Saenuri Party locked Kim in his room to prevent him from hosting the session.

After a two-week investigation of various products, Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the minor Justice Party found that some 3,000 tons of Chloromethyl-methylisothiazolone, a synthetic biocide and preservative commonly referred to as CMIT/MIT, were distributed to 30 local and foreign manufacturers through Miwon Chemicals. Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the People’s Party questions the environment minister during the parliamentary audit on Tuesday. The firms allegedly used the substance to make toothpastes, soaps, body and bath products and laundry detergents, according to the findings. A total of 11 toothpastes made by the nation’s largest cosmetics-maker AmorePacific were found to contain up to 0.0044 parts per million of CMIT/MIT. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that it will withdraw the 11 toothpastes, including AmorePacific’s signature brands Pine Salt and Median. The ministry imposed a suspension of business on the firm, forbidding it from producing toothpastes for three months. “The toothpastes in question contain up to 0.0044 ppm of CMIT/MIT. It is not harmful to human health as it is rinsed away with water after brushing the teeth,” said an official from the drug ministry, citing that up to 14 ppm of the substance is allowed to be used in toothpastes in other countries.The CMIT/MIT, which is thought to affect the lungs, was designated a toxic substance by the Environment Ministry in 2012. The substance is banned from use in making toothpastes in Korea. The lawmaker released a list of 30 companies that Miwon Chemicals provided the chemical substance. On the list were AmorePacific, Aegyeong and Coreana Cosmetics. The foreign manufacturers include two American companies -- Norman Fox & Co and Vivion -- Russian firm Zao Rushkhimset, Japanese Kozekura Shoukai and Indian Lupin Chemicals.The lawmaker criticized the government for “loosely managing sanitary supplies.” “The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, as well as the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, should conduct a comprehensive inspection together to see which products contain the substance,” said Lee in a press release. “It was found that the Drug Ministry has not at all overseen the use of CMIT/MIT and it was not even aware of the relevant facts.” AmorePacific apologized Tuesday to customers for causing concerns over safety of its toothpastes.“We found that a very small amount of CMIT/MIT was contained in sodium lauryl sulfate, which we were provided by a chemical company,” it said in a press release. “We feel the responsibility for using improper substance. We should have more thoroughly managed the use of substance to offer safe products to customers.” The company and the ministry were allegedly not aware that the harmful substance was used to make products until the lawmaker informed them.The firm said that customers who bought the 11 recalled toothpastes can return them or exchange them from nearby stores. There is no need to present a receipt. Used items can also be returned.

Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party was to hold an afternoon session at around 2 p.m. but was blocked at around 11 a.m. by fellow party members including former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. They entered Kim Young-woo’s office and prevented him from leaving for about three hours. The chairman had declared earlier in the day that he was returning to the audit, as the nation is facing a security crisis and needs the parliamentary process to go on. Former Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung  and other lawmakers enter the office of National Defense Committee Chairman Rep. Kim Young-woo  at the National Assembly on Tuesday. “I do agree that the National Assembly speaker conducted a biased proceeding of the parliament. However, even so, I cannot refuse to hold the audit. It would be a violation of democracy,” said the committee chairman in a text message sent to reporters. “What would happen to a country where the Defense Committee cannot convene at a time of threats from North Korea and its nuclear weapon?”The Saenuri Party has been staging a boycott of the audit since Monday in protest against the opposition parties’ passage of a bill recommending the president to sack the agriculture minister who has been questioned for his ethical standards. The party is also demanding a resignation of National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, who they said facilitated the opposition by agreeing to hold a plenary session on midnight Saturday without the attendance of ruling party members, thereby going against his duty to stay neutral.Chung has repeated his refusal to step down, telling an audience during a seminar Tuesday that the role of a speaker is “not something that anyone can ignore or undermine.”Later in the afternoon, the Saenuri Party submitted a proposal to take discipline action against the speaker and demand his resignation. In the statement, they argued that Chung -- who gave up his membership in The Minjoo Party of Korea upon being elected as speaker -- violated laws in steering the plenary session in favor of opposition parties.“We think that the speaker has moved beyond the point where we can tolerate his behavior,” said Rep. Chun Hee-Kyung who supported the motion along with fellow lawmakers. “We believe that we can secure a majority to pass the motion.”For the motion to clear the Assembly, it needs to gain approval from more than half of the 300-strong Assembly. Currently, the Saenuri Party holds 129 seats, with three opposition parties securing a total of 165 seats. Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, meanwhile, entered the second day of his hunger strike, vowing to continue until the speaker steps down. “I never would have started if I just wanted to give in and accept their demand,” Lee told the lawmakersAmong meetings of the 12 standing committees originally set to take place earlier in the day, only seven committees chaired by opposition parties, such as a legislative committee, were held. The other six committees headed by the Saenuri Party was canceled, as its chairman and members refused to hold the meetings. The Defense Committee was scheduled to question the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but the session was suspended as the opposition lawmakers left the venue, saying they may seek a brief transfer of the right to convene the meeting from the chairperson.Throughout the three-hour scuffle at his office, Kim traded barbs with the lawmakers who prevented him from leaving. Inside Kim’s office, an unidentified lawmaker was heard telling the third-term lawmaker that they were “doing this to save you.”Kim, minutes later, was heard saying, “Please let me go. You have always talked of reform .” After the standoff ended, Kim came out and told reporters he would seek to convene the committee’s audit. Saenuri Party heavyweights, such as fifth-term lawmaker Rep. Chung Byoung-gug, rebuked Kim Young-woo for ignoring the party’s decision. “I think it is a party member’s duty to follow the guidelines set by the party leadership,” Chung told reporters. The Minjoo Party of Korea, meanwhile, applauded Kim for his decision, saying it was “worthy of respect” for showing responsibility as a member of a ruling conservative party.By Yeo Jun-suk","party boycott continued ,saenuri party boycott continued ,parliamentary audit with tension ,hold an afternoon session ,party boycott continued to","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'the National Assembly ’s Defense Committee', 'Kim Young', 'the Saenuri Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83485365  0.17499045

Lee Jung-hyun , former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung , floor leader Chung Jin-suk and other party officials denounce National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun's constroversial remarks at the National Assembly in Seoul on Monday. The partisan fight -- which escalated upon President Park Geun-hye’s veto of the opposition-led recommendation to dismiss the agriculture minister-designate over the weekend -- blew up into a full-fledged boycott and protests against Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. Chung, a former member of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, had arranged for a midnight session Saturday that allowed the opposition to pass the dismissal motion of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo without the attendance of the Saenuri Party. The ruling Saenuri Party’s leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun stages a hunger strike Monday in his office at the National Assembly. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldThe confrontation was aggravated on Monday upon the leaked voice recording of Chung in a closed-door conversation with a Minjoo Party lawmaker, during which he was heard suggesting the Saenuri Party offer a compromise on other controversial bills in exchange for the withdrawal of the dismissal motion. He was reportedly referring to the legislations designed to extend the working period of parliamentary committee investigating Sewol sinking in 2014 and another committee targeting a right-wing civic group accused of inciting pro-government protest. Both have been blocked by the Saenuri Party.The Saenuri Party vowed to continue to boycott the audit unless Chung resigns for passing the “illegitimate” motion they said lacked due details. “We will never tolerate Chung, who violated parliamentary laws and worked as an advocate for opposition parties,” the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk told his fellow lawmakers at the party’s general assembly. “I mistook him for something that he was not.” Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said he will go on hunger strike until the speaker leaves his post. The party leadership decided to stage a sit-in at the National Assembly to add pressure against Chung and file a petition to the Constitutional Court to determine whether the speaker abused his power. For his part, Chung said that his taped remarks were merely an “expression of regret” over legislative impasse and that he was playing a meditating role to offer the Saenuri Party a “legitimate reason” to break the deadlock.As the standoff intensified, Chung proposed the opposition parties push back the parliamentary audit for a couple of days. During the meeting with leadership from the Minjoo Party and runner-up opposition People’s Party, he asked them to postpone the session until the Saenuri Party returns to the floor.The People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won agreed to the suggestion and said he would seek consensus among the fellow lawmakers. “We shouldn’t run the business unilaterally, as President Park Geun-hye has done so far,” Park was quoted as saying.The Minjoo Party, on the other hand, rejected the proposal and pledged to hold the session as planned for the time being. “Though we cannot rule out all the scenario, we won’t change our plan,” said the Minjoo Party spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min.

Song Young-gil of The Minjoo Party of Korea said that after analyzing the reports by the relevant ministries, most of the budget requests for preparatory measures, such as expanding aseismic designs, have been denied.For the budget between 2015 and 2017, the MPSS requested 51.3 billion won, 69.9 billion won and 19.7 billion won, respectively, to undertake various preparatory measures. The requests for 2015 and 2016 were denied completely, while 1.2 billion won was set aside for 2017, Song said.Song also said that they have heard from earthquake-related officials that they had a hard time persuading the need to maintain the earthquake division under the Disaster Management Office when establishing the MPSS in 2014. These officials also reportedly claimed to have heard from the government that it would be “more economical” to subsidize the cost for damage repair rather than investing in preparatory measures.Gyeongju city officials on Sept. 18 work on covering damaged roofs of houses with nets and tents after the area suffered a 5.8 magnitude earthquake the previous week. “Safety measures without due personnel and budget are impossible. While the Park administration changed the names of relevant ministries numerous times upon the Sewol ferry sinking disaster , no safety has been maintained,” Song said.Earlier this month, the country’s strongest recorded quake rattled Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and the surrounding regions.The government later designated the city as a special disaster zone to help the estimated damage speculated to reach more than 7.5 billion won. Nearly 100 cases of damage have been found on historical artifacts. “Now the budget estimated by the MPSS to implement earthquake preparatory measures reaches over 84 billion won. We could not even confirm the budget needed by organizations such as the Cultural Heritage Administration that manages our cultural assets,” Song said.","administration slashed quake budget ,slashed quake budget ,billion won 127 million ,slashed quake budget by ,quake budget by 95","['the Ministry of Public Safety and Security', 'Song Young', 'the Minjoo Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00732915  0.01419745

The Saenuri and the presidential office have argued the dismissal motion was politically motivated and had nothing to do with actual wrongdoing.In a voice recording obtained by the Saenuri, Chung, who is originally from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, said the ruling party should not ""ask something for free.""Political observers said the recording came after Chung unknowingly left his microphone on during the session.""They  should bring up something, whether it be  Sewol or something else, but they are not doing it,"" Chung said in the recording to an unidentified person.The Sewol ferry, which sunk on April 16, 2014, was en route to the southern resort island of Jeju from Incheon, west of Seoul, with a total of 476 passengers. Most of the 304 dead were high school students on a field trip.The incident dealt a harsh blow to the government for its failure to properly rescue the passengers, as well as its negligence in overseeing the safety regulations of local ships. The opposition has tried to extend the probe as long as possible, while the government has objected to such a move, pointing out that the investigation's duration has officially expired.""The recording is evidence that  condemned an innocent minister as part of a bargaining ploy,"" the Saenuri said in a statement, adding Chung should resign from his current post.Chung's political neutrality was also questioned earlier after he seems to have sided with the opposition bloc's stance on the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system.While the government claims the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery is important in defending the country from North Korea's provocations, the opposition parties claim that the move may make Beijing and Moscow uncomfortable, and should be reconsidered.Chung, however, said the latest remark was only an expression of regret that the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow their differences on key issues.""Politics is about conversation and compromise,"" Chung said about the leaked recording, adding parties failed to come up with a solution due to the rigid stance of Saenuri lawmakers.","party boycotted the vote ,sack the agricultural minister ,ruling party boycotted the ,week south korea opposition ,the ruling party boycotted","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Cabinet']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9242503   0.24762636

Yonhap“President Park decided to reject the dismissal recommendation,” said Cheong Wa Dae Spokesperson Jeong Yeong-guk. He asserted that the parliamentary motion was irrelevant to the minister’s job qualification and the allegations against Kim, such as ethical lapses, were cleared during his hearing. A day before, the president had hinted at her veto, denouncing the National Assembly for passing a motion she said “lacked formal procedure” at a time when South Korea faces economic and security challenges. During a plenary session held at midnight on Saturday, the Assembly endorsed the dismissal motion 160 to 7, with three counted as invalid. All Saenuri members, totaling 129, boycotted the vote in protest of the session, despite their opposition.The ruling Saenuri Party pledged to boycott all parliamentary sessions -- including audit sessions scheduled to kick off Monday -- unless The Minjoo Party of Korea and National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun apologized and resigned over the decision to push through dismissal bill. “No matter how much  want to take power, they shouldn’t do such things,” Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said in an emergency meeting. Not only did the party decide to boycott all parliamentary sessions chaired by the speaker, they also decided to seek to press criminal charges against Chung for abusing his power. The main opposition Minjoo Party and runner-up opposition the People’s Party, on the other hand, denounced President Park and the Saenuri Party for undermining the democratic process by neglecting parliamentary procedure.    “President Park’s decision is the epitome of her arrogance and her lack of communication with the Assembly and the people,” said the Minjoo Party Spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min. “It is something we cannot tolerate.” The opposition parties also shunned the Saenuri Party’s call for the speaker’s resignation and urged them to join the audit as planned. “We agreed to hold the parliamentary audit as scheduled, even if the ruling party boycotts the session,” said the Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. Saenuri lawmakers claimed that Assembly Speaker Chung violated parliamentary laws by holding the midnight session without due coordination procedure. The session was held upon the proposal of the speaker.“Without coordination with political parties, the speaker cannot hold additional plenary sessions,” said Rep. Kim Do-eup, the Saenuri Party’s deputy floor leader, referring to clause 77 of Assembly law, requiring the speaker to consult with political parties to change parliamentary schedules. The speaker refuted the notion, saying his decision was made in accordance with parliamentary laws. The Assembly’s Secretariat said in a statement Sunday that the speaker had consulted with the ruling party before the vote and holding the session was “inevitable” to finalize the issue before a deadline.By law, the legislative body must hold a plenary session to deal with a motion to recommend the dismissal of a cabinet member during a time frame of between 24 and 72 hours after the motion was submitted to the floor. The dismissal recommendation was submitted on Thursday at 10 a.m. and the deadline was set between Friday 10 a.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. The parliamentary audit was originally scheduled to be held for 20 days from Sept. 26.

The emergency alert system via text messages was issued about 10 minutes after the tremors were felt by residents in North Gyeongsang Province. “We come to realize how vulnerable our country is to earthquakes and that there is almost no safety measures to prevent them,” said Rep. Park Myung-jae of the ruling Saenuri Party representing Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province. Rep. Park Chan-woo of the Saenuri Party echoed the criticism, questioning the government’s ability to come up with comprehensive measures against disasters. “Disaster manuals turned out to be irrelevant to real-life situations and public workers are poorly trained,” Park said.The lawmakers pointed out that the Safety Ministry did not include evacuation training for potential earthquakes in its annual safety drill held between May 16 and 20. They also took note of “antiquated and inaccurate” information compared to countries with advanced disaster measures such as Japan. Park In-young , the minster of public safety and security, replies to a question from Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the Saenuri Party during the interpellation session at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapPark In-yong, minister of public safety and security, acknowledged the agency’s lackluster warning system and vowed to overhaul it by eliminating the time gap in the earthquake detection system used by the Safety Ministry and the weather agency.Minister Park said that the ministry’s current warning system requires additional time before broadcasting to the public because its system, which he said was not as accurate as that of the weather agency, has to go through additional vetting.Opposition parties also criticized the government for making worse the safety concerns among the public who have been unsettled over a series of disasters such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2015 and the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014. “It is so shocking that there has been no changes to government safety protocols even though we went through MERS and the Sewol crisis,” said Rep. Won Hae-young of The Minjoo Party of the Korea.In response to public outcry upon the Sewol sinking, which left 304 dead or missing, the government had carried out a system overhaul by disbanding the coast guard and creating the Ministry of Public Safety and Security by integrating the divided roles of the administrative and maritime ministries and maritime police to improve disaster prevention systems.Rival parties, meanwhile, clashed over the government’s stance on North Korea’s mounting nuclear threat following its nuclear test earlier this month. The Saenuri Party called for prompt deployment of a US advanced missile system to improve Seoul’s deterrence capability, while opposition parties urged the government to tone down its hawkish stance toward the North. Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the Saenuri Party said that the government should promptly deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system batteries here and criticized opposition parties’ ambiguous position on the security measure.Meanwhile, lawmakers from the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party suggested the government adopt an engagement policy with the North such as by sending humanitarian support to help its massive flooding. Rep. Kim Boo-kyum of the Minjoo Party said that President Park Geun-hye should send UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon as a special envoy for the task. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn dismissed the idea during the session, saying now is the time for the government to maintain its stern policy and that inter-Korean dialogue, including a summit between the two Koreas, remain off the table unless the North abandons its nuclear ambition.By Yeo Jun-suk","government over poor earthquake ,lawmakers denounce government over ,earthquake measures lawmakers criticized ,poor earthquake measures lawmakers ,magnitude earthquake that rattled",['gye'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44250789  0.27316013

YonhapFollowing a bilateral summit on Saturday, President Park underlined the persisting military threats from North Korea, in an apparent move to defend the forthcoming installment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense here.“North Korea’s increasing nuclear and ballistic missile threats are a matter of life and death to us as we lay within minutes range ,” Park said in a joint conference held at the Far Eastern University in Vladivostok.“Any responsible government would take all possible measures so as to protect the nation’s security and the people’s lives.”Unless the international society addresses the North’s nuclear program in a firm manner, global peace and security will be put at risk, she added.Park also claimed that the two states agreed to “strengthen strategic communication” in order to solve the North Korean issue.The summit between the two states, being the fourth of its kind, was held on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic forum, an occasion to discuss regional cooperation in developing Russia’s underexploited Far East region.The Russian president shared Park’s view, albeit with more caution.“Standing against North Korea’s nuclear proliferation, we urge that the North abides by the resolution adopted by the international community and the UN Security Council,” Putin said during the EEF session earlier in the day.He, however, called for cautious negotiations so as “not to provoke the  leadership.”The idea of installing THAAD in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula by end of 2017 has been causing uneasiness among Korea‘s neighboring states, such as China and Russia.Along with their improved diplomatic ties, Seoul and Moscow also agreed to co-work for a free trade deal between South Korea and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union.Negotiations will begin as early as next month, as soon as the civilian feasibility study is wrapped up, according to Kang Seog-hoon, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs.Kicked off in January 2015, the EAEU comprises of a population of 180 million and a gross domestic product of $1.6 trillion.Cheong Wa Dae also claimed that the one-on-one business consultation sessions, an event affiliated with the state leader’s visit to Russia, led to a potential economic outcome worth some $210 million.Following her itinerary in Russia, Park arrived in Hangzhou, eastern China, on Sunday to attend a summit of the Group of 20, during which she is slated to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.By Bae Hyun-jung","park putin united against ,russia during bilateral summit ,counterpart vladimir putin sidestepped ,disapproval of north korea ,vladimir putin sidestepped the","['South Korea', 'Russia', 'North Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'US', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63168061  0.55915809

Chung Jin-suk agreed after hours of confrontation to prioritize the passage of the budget bill over a telephone conversation. Vice speaker Park Joo-sun was chosen to preside over the session in place of Chung upon the Saenuri’s request.National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun  shakes hands with the Saenuri Party`s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk on Friday afternoon. Chung had prompted Saenuri lawmakers to lodge a protest and walk out of the first plenary session of the 20th Assembly after he commented in his opening speech on senior presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo and the disputed deployment of advanced US antimissile system.The ruling party slammed the speaker for violating neutrality as he criticized Woo’s refusal to resign despite undergoing a corruption probe, and the way the decision to install Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system was made. Former member of The Minjoo Party of Korea, Chung is currently formally unassociated with the party in accordance with the Assembly rules. After a night of confrontation at Chung’s office, the Saenuri lawmakers continued to demand for Chung’s apology and a promise against a recurrence, or a resignation.Chung, for his part, has defended his remarks as speaking on behalf of the people and offered instead to issue an apology for causing delays in the parliamentary passage of 11 trillion-won supplementary budget. The Saenuri Party refused Chung’s offer as of the afternoon.The passage of the extra budget had been crucial amid faltering exports and slowing domestic demand.The extra bill, initially scheduled to be approved by Aug. 12, was delayed for the third time as the rival parties locked horns over the details. The Assembly is also set to start reviewing next year’s budget submitted by the government on Friday.The final version of the extra budget bill placed a hike in the school facility improvement funds and a cut in foreign exchange bonds and state-run bank investments, marking an overall drop of 105.4 billion won. The National Assembly Budget Office had warned that if the supplementary budget is not implemented within the third quarter, it would lead to some 3,000 job losses and a 0.02 percentage point drop in economic growth rate.Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee on culture, sports and tourism on Friday adopted a confirmation report concluding that culture minister nomine Cho Yoon-sun is unfit for the job, in a session boycotted by the ruling Saenuri Party members. The Saenuri Party members had also refused to attend Cho’s hearing held on Wednesday over a separate scuffle regarding the extra budget bill.Cheong Wa Dae said earlier in the day that it will push ahead with the appointment of Cho as the new culture minister, along with new agriculture minister nominee Kim Jae-soo. A parliamentary report upon a hearing is not legally binding.The opposition has questioned Cho’s ethical level, pointing to what they claimed was a dubious accumulation of personal wealth over the years.","after an overnight protest ,assembly passes extra budget ,won us 92 billion ,budget on friday after ,overnight protest and boycott","['the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Park Joo - sun']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37811762  0.09336323

The president is entitled to go ahead with a nomination if the Assembly rejects two consecutive requests for the report. The opposition parties have opposed Lee heading the National Police Agency, citing his drunk driving record in 1993. Lee admitted that he had concealed his job as a police officer at the time, escaping disciplinary action.According to the Personnel Hearing Act, the Assembly must complete the confirmation process within 20 days. The president can request again for the report within the following next 10 days. If the request is denied, the president can bypass the parliamentary step and formally finalize the appointment.Following Park’s decision, Lee held his inauguration ceremony in the afternoon.Cheong Wa Dae said Lee had repeatedly apologized for his drunk driving record 23 years ago.Lee replaces Kang Sin-myeong who completed his two-year tenure earlier this week.Lee served as presidential secretary for social security between September 2014 and December 2015. He was formally the deputy NPA commissioner general.","appoints controversial new police ,new police chief president ,dissent new police chief ,controversial new police chief ,the new police chief","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Chul - sing', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Lee Chul - sung', 'Kang sin - myeong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68494397 -0.10267011

Local broadcaster MBC reported last Tuesday that Lee exposed details of the investigation into Woo’s case to a local media outlet through a messaging app. Under the law, a special inspector can face a jail term of up to five years for leaking information about the ongoing probe. To reporters on his way to his office in central Seoul, he said, “Isn’t it the government’s policy that suspicions don’t necessarily lead to resignations?” He refused to comment further on the ongoing investigation into Woo as well as the alleged information leak, saying it was “inappropriate.” Woo has been under investigation for allegedly misappropriating funds from his family-run company and abusing his status to help his son get assigned to a relatively easy military post during his national service. Special inspector Lee Seok-su answers reporters’ questions on his way to his office in Seoul on Monday. Lee has recommended the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office launch a formal investigation into Woo. As for Cheong Wa Dae’s remarks over the alleged information leak and its allegedly uncooperative attitude in probing Woo, Lee refused to comment. He said that he had no hard feelings towards Cheong Wa Dae. Cheong Wa Dae said in a briefing Friday that the alleged information leak “shakes up the foundation of the nation” in an apparent move to lambast Lee.

The allies picked a South Korean air defense base in Seongju as the original site for the THAAD placement, but it is in the proximity of residents' farm and houses.""At first, all county residents formed a united front in voicing opposition against the THAAD deployment here.

After joining the legislature as a proportional representative in 2008, she soon blended into the pro-Park clique, serving as spokesperson for the party during the 2012 presidential election season and then for president-elect Park until inauguration.Based on her strong ties with the state leader, Cho took office as gender equality minister in 2013, becoming the only female Cabinet member in the Park administration as well as the youngest head for the ministry that was created in 2001.New culture minister, Cho Yoon-sun Her ministerial career, followed by 11 months as presidential secretary for political affairs, seemed to be smooth sailing until she was pressed to step down to take responsibility for the underachievement of government-led reforms of the civil servants’ pension system.She suffered another fall earlier this year during the ruling Saenuri Party’s nomination race to select candidates for the April 13 general election, in which she was outrun by rival Lee Hye-hoon.Despite such setbacks, however, Cho’s reinstatement to the Cabinet had largely been speculated, especially since Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, another ranking pro-Park figure, grasped the ruling party’s chairmanship in the recent leadership election.“The public society should set an example in breaking the glass ceiling,” said Park at a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, alluding to Cho’s appointment into a key government post.The 50-year-old Cho majored in diplomatic science at Seoul National University and acquired a master’s degree in law at Columbia University Law School. Her corporate career includes the nation’s top-ranking law firm Kim & Chang and Citibank Korea, in which she served as vice president in charge of legal affairs.By Bae Hyun-jung","lawyer turned politician first ,the new culture minister ,the lawyer turned politician ,trusted confidants of president ,lawyer turned politician","['Cho Yoon - sun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Grand National Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.985811    0.42244709

They cited the president’s apparent partiality for close aides, and the failure to dismiss a senior presidential secretary accused of irregularities.Cho Yoon-sun, former minister of gender equality and president secretary for political affairs, was tapped as minister of culture, sports and tourism. Kim Jae-su, CEO of the state-run Korea Agro-Fisheries and Food Trade Crp., was picked as minister of agriculture, food and rural affairs, while Cho Kyeung-kyu, deputy chief of the prime ministerial Office for Government Policy Coordination, was tapped as environment minister.“ nominee Cho has an intimate knowledge of culture and arts, and thoroughly understands the president’s statecraft philosophy, having served as  lawmaker, minister and presidential secretary,” senior presidential secretary for public affairs Kim Sung-woo told reporters.Senior presidential secretary for public affairs Kim Sung-woo attends a press briefing at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. Cho is to replace Kim Jong-deok, who has been in office since August 2014.For the other Cabinet positions, the president chose from senior government officials with experience in their given field.New Agriculture Minister Kim, replacing Lee Dong-phil, is considered an expert in agricultural policy, having served in the ministry’s key posts over the past 30 years.“Kim is the right person to foster the nation’s agriculture and livestock industries and revitalize the rural economy, based on his ample experience,” the presidential secretary said.Cho Kyeung-kyu, a longtime expert in economic and state policy coordination, is to head the Environment Ministry amid recent series of environmental agenda such as fine dust, humidifier disinfectant harms and diesel car emission scandals.“Cho is expected to achieve harmonious communication with other government departments on key environmental issues such as climate change and fine dust,” Cheong Wa Dae said.The president also appointed four vice-ministerial officials.Replacing Cho Kyeung-kyu in the Office for Government Policy Coordination, Park named Noh Hyeong-ouk, senior official at the ministry of strategy and finance.Jeong Marn-ki, presidential secretary for trade, industry and energy, was appointed vice minister of trade, industry and energy.Former senior prosecutor Park Kyeong-ho and presidential secretary for agriculture, livestock and food Chung Hwang-keun were respectively picked as vice chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission and head of the Rural Development Administration.Following the Blue House’s announcement, opposition parties immediately voiced their disapproval over the shake-up, reiterating their call for the dismissal of Woo Byung-woo, the senior presidential secretary for political affairs.“It is incomprehensible how a person involved in a number of irregularity disputes could qualify as a key government official,” said Rep. Park Kwang-on, spokesperson of The Minjoo Party of Korea, in a briefing.“We suspect that the reshuffle was but a pretense to dodge the public’s call for more fundamental state reform.”The disputed presidential aide came under fire last month for his monetary connection to a senior prosecutor who was arrested in a corruption scandal, as well as his alleged influence-peddling over his son’s military post.Despite the elevating dissent from opposition circles and concerns from within the ruling party, however, the president reiterated her trust upon the aide, refusing to dismiss him right away.By Bae Hyun-jung","reshuffle replacing three ministers ,dismiss senior presidential secretary ,cabinet reshuffle replacing three ,reshuffles cabinet keeps disputed ,to dismiss senior presidential","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cabinet']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50104254 -0.13373397

Its result is to be sealed for two days, until the end of the party’s national convention on Tuesday, and totaled with ballots casted that day by some 9,000 representative members, according to officials.The four candidates bidding for the ruling Saenuri Party‘s chairmanship.  Reps. Lee Ju-young, Lee Jung-hyun, Joo Ho-young, and Han Sun-kyo. Representing the non-Park faction is Rep. Joo Ho-young, who earlier united his candidacy with Rep. Choung Byoung-gug based on public polls.From the pro-presidential clique are former Maritime Minister Rep. Lee Ju-young, former senior presidential secretary for public affairs Rep. Lee Jung-hyun and former news announcer Rep. Han Sun-kyo.Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, boosted by his close ties with the president and his consecutive election victories in the opposition-leaning Yeosu region, claimed to have an upper hand but he, too, has been struggling with the split of votes within the pro-Park pool.The key factor in the one-on-three match is whether the candidacy merger of the two non-mainstreamers will have the intended synergy effect. Rep. Joo, fourth-termer in the southern city of Daegu, is hoping that his unity with Gyeonggi-based Rep. Choung will up his chances in the metropolitan region.Also, backing up the non-Park group is Rep. Kim Moo-sung, former party chairman and bigwig figure in Busan, who explicitly voiced his support for Rep. Joo. Kim’s existence is especially likely to affect the party electorate in the southeastern Busan-South Gyeongsang region, where a considerable portion of the party’s electorate voters are located.Meanwhile, Rep. Lee Ju-young made protests that each faction was delivering “orders” to its affiliated members to vote for a specific candidate.“It was for such factional dispute that we lost in the general election ,” said Rep. Lee in a press conference on Sunday.“There is no future for the Saenuri Party, should such these power games continue.”The former minister thereby pointed the finger not only at the non-Park group, but also at his own pro-Park clique, calling for fair democratic processes.By Bae Hyun-jung","next year presidential election ,leadership vote amid factional ,saenuri starts leadership vote ,starts leadership vote amid ,presidential election while","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'non - park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.07802618  0.396395

The residents fear that THAAD's powerful radar system could pose health risks and hurt their agricultural crops, and that their hometown could become a military target in case of an armed conflict on the peninsula.Strong opposition also comes from China and Russia that argue THAAD, a core element of America's global multilayered missile defense program, will needlessly escalate regional military tensions and undermine their security interests.

Members of an association of farmers hold a protest in front of the Constitutional Court against its decision to uphold the disputed antigraft law on Thursday. But the inclusion of the media and education sector had touched off complaints that it was unfair and excessively broad in scope. Related parties including the Korean Bar Association and the Journalists Association of Korea filed a petition against the Constitutional Court. “The education and the media exert large influence over the society in general, and the corruption in the cited field has great ripple effect that inflicts damage that is both long-term and extensive ... As such, inclusion of private school officials and journalists was just,” the court said in its ruling, after reaching the decision on a 5:4 vote by its judges.It dismissed claims against the section of the act that defines gifts that are allowed by “social norms” are not punishable by law. It is conventional in Korean society to hand out gifts as a token of friendship or gratitude in ceremonial occasions.It was also decided that delegating the details -- including specific amounts for gifts that are allowed, and the fee for lectures -- to the ordinance was constitutional, along with the article that mandates reporting of bribery by spouses.“ respects the decision by the Constitutional Court, and hope that the implementation of the act will root out corruption and build the integrity of the nation in a ground-breaking way,” said Kwak Hyung-suk, the head of the ACRC Anti-Corruption Bureau, in a media briefing held immediately after the ruling. “In order for the act to be taken into effect on Sept. 28, the ACRC will carry out follow-up measures  for the remaining period. This will include enacting ordinance , creating a manual and conducting information sessions for the people.The KBA, on the other hand, released a statement condemning the ruling.“Act on the Prevention of Illegal Solicitation allows those in power to reign in the press, subsequently uprooting the very basis of democracy, while aggravating distrust among spouses and infringe upon the people’s right to act freely via its vague definition of ‘illegal solicitation’,” it said. “The KBA strongly regrets the court’s decision on such unconstitutional, inhumane and anti-democratic law.” The journalists’ association also protested the ruling, saying that the act may act as a “muzzle” for the reporters.“There is now a possibility that the authorities may try to silence the press, using the Kim Young-ran law as an excuse,” the JAK said in a statement. It added that the group “fully understand the necessity for the law,” but took issue with monitoring and regulating the civilian sector. But progressive Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, welcomed the Constitutional Court’s ruling, saying that it will act as the first step toward eradicating everyday, small-scaled corruptions within the society. The education sector was split on the decision. The Korea Federation of Teachers’ Associations raised concerns over potential ”overlapping punishment, pointing out that bribery by teachers are already regulated by local education offices But the Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union welcomed the decision and said that it will contribute to curbing corruptions by private school officials.The ordinance on the Kim Young-ran law puts the threshold on the value of food and gifts during social meetings at 30,000 and 50,000 won, respectively. The money given on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, are restricted to 100,000 won.There have been complaints by local food and gifting industries that such restrictions will stifle them, as the law will make officials in the related sector reluctant to send out gifts. Agriculture Minister Lee Dong-pil had told local media that his ministry -- along with the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Small and Medium Business Administration -- will file for an adjustment of the law to the Ministry of Government Legislation, regardless of the ruling.“While I agree with the law in principle, the scope of the law is too extensive, leading me to believe that it will have critical effect on domestic consumption,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","hitting anti corruption law ,constitutional court on thursday ,in 2011 enforces criminal ,2011 enforces criminal punishm ,hard hitting anti corruption","['the Constitutional Court', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Kim Young - ran']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15586534  0.03303802

108,108,[Herald Interview] Activist-turned-scholar urges action on N.K. abductees,"On April 29, 1992, South Korea’s top intelligence agency arrested dozens of activists for plotting to overthrow the government by building underground socialist organizations.

The authorities described the groups as the biggest antistate entity ever established in the country’s modern history. One of those arrested was Baik Tae-ung, who served as leader of the South Korean Socialist Coalition of Workers or “Sanomaeng” in Korean. Despite the plea that he was exercising the right to political freedom, the then 29-year-old activist was sentenced to life in prison, a sentence which was later reduced to 15 years. Baik was designated as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International and released in 1999 through a special pardon from former President Kim Dae-jung. He flew to the United States, where he earned a doctoral degree on international human rights law and passed the bar exam in the State of New York. Now the activist-turned-professor has returned to South Korea with a new mission – to bring home people abducted by North Korea. In 2015, his related activities won him the membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, representing Asia-Pacific states. Paik Tae-ung, an associate professor at the William S. Richardson School of Law, University of Hawaii at Manoa. He is also a member of the United Nation’s Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. “The South Korean government should come forward to address this issue as it has significant meaning in the nation’s modern history. It is not just a matter of bringing an individual back home. It is about healing wounds from the past,” Baik said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “From the moment of kidnapping, individuals are deprived of the right to protect themselves and exposed to various types of torture. Forced disappearance is a grave violation of human rights, causing pain not just to those who have disappeared, but also to their family members.”The professor was in Seoul in June to attend a parliamentary seminar that discussed measures to retrieve those abducted by North Korea. According to a report by the Ministry of Unification, 4,782 South Korean nationals were kidnapped during the Korean War and 516 were alive in the North as of 2013.Some of them were reportedly subject to physical abuse while their family members faced a similar fate here after being accused of sympathizing with communism. Until now, North Korea has refused to confirm the whereabouts of the abductees and dismissed the South Korean government’s reclamation of them.The U.N. human rights expert said that his agency’s role is to act as a bridge between the families of the abductees and their government, especially when the latter fails to respond to the disappearance reports.“The organization fosters communication between the victims and their state by constantly monitoring the case until final closure,” he said. What the international organization does is not so much about finding individual people, but about coming up with a comprehensive strategy, he also explained.“We work as a sort of independent expert and offer our own professional insight. Actually, my job is not limited to North Korean issues but involves 86 states worldwide.”The key function of Baik’s agency is to gather disappearance cases, connect victims to their respective government, file related reports, help the government carry out investigations and follow up on cases on a periodic basis.Underlining the role that the U.N. organization has played in dealing with forced disappearance across the world, Paik referred to a case of 65,000 people reported missing in Sri Lanka during its 26-year civil war.The agency got the Sri Lankan government to sign the U.N. Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, under which the states must enact specific laws to prevent such disappearances, investigate reports of related cases and bring those responsible to justice.Observers are largely skeptic that such progress may happen in North Korea. The reclusive state has been refusing to discuss the disappearances issue since the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Right reported back in 2014 that the regime was responsible for the disappearances of more than 200,000 people.Paik, however, suggested that there are possibilities that the North may open up further toward international organizations, indicating some changes that it made home and abroad amid international pressure on its human right condition.“North Korea, which used to show zero reaction to our requests, is now addressing the given accusations in international platforms. Although it is still refusing to reveal the whereabouts and identification of the abductees, I believe that the scope of engagement has changed,” he said “I think North Korea is and has been making changes. Whether the changes are active or passive ones, they can no longer ignore the pressure from the international community. What we should do is to steer such changes in the right direction,” he said.The changes he mentioned were North Korea’s 2009 decision to put the word “human right” in its Constitution and its 2014 amendment in criminal law to grant the accused more opportunity to appeal the ruling. The scholar said the regime would transform itself as its neighbor China and Russia had done. To encourage more changes in the reclusive regime, Paik asserted that the hawkish approaches taken by the current Park Geun-hye administration and its conservative predecessor toward the North needs to be reevaluated. Conservative political camps have often been cited as North Korea’s human rights problem as part of their attack against Pyongyang’s nuclear provocations. Progressive parties, in contrast, tend to be reluctant to raise the given issue, in fear of harming the tense inter-Korean relations.As a solution to avoid such partisan divide, Paik suggested that the South Korean government take a two-track approach -- responding sternly to military threats while engaging in further efforts to improve human rights. “It is precarious to cross out all talks because of the nuclear issue. Given that the nuclear negotiation is expected to be arduous one, we need to take substantive measures to address the human rights agenda. If necessary, we need to engage or cooperate with them,” he said. “North Korea’s human rights issue was sometimes treated as something that can be traded off for political goals, which is an anachronistic view tracing back to the Cold War frame. Human rights is universal agenda that goes beyond the politics,” he said.His criticism also extends to the U.S., including its recent decision to slap sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and 10 other regime officials for their alleged complicity in human rights abuse against its own people.It is the first time Washington blacklisted the young leader personally. State Department spokesperson John Kirby said the report represents “the most comprehensive U.S. government effort to date” to name those linked with the communist state’s oppression of its people.Baik, however, played down the consequent impact of the sanction, asserting that it lacked “comprehensive vision” to address the human rights issue and was mostly driven by domestic pressure to take an assertive stance in Asia-Pacific against China. “I don’t think that the U.S. has a clear blueprint about how to improve the North’s human rights condition,” he said, noting that the sanction on the leader Kim is more of a security measure to curb nuclear development rather than a human rights approach.The professor said that the government should “not make too much of the decision” because it reflects the U.S. domestic politics. Both Democrats and Republicans try to use Pyongyang to mount pressure on Beijing amid its security challenge in the region, he said.Back when South Korea was under authoritarian rule, democratic campaigners largely refrained from publicly denouncing North Korea, in fear of backlash against the government’s frequent use of anticommunist sentiments to justify their crackdown on activists.Paik was a unique figure in the left-leaning group. In an article by him published in 1992, titled “Our Stance toward Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and its Workers Party,” he said that the DPRK’s personality cult and massive propaganda would eventually undermine the system.Describing the past reluctance to criticize the North as a form of protest against the authoritarian governments, the scholar hopes that liberal-minded citizens will take a more assertive tone against North Korea’s dismal human rights problems.“With the authoritarian era way back in the past, there is no reason we can’t speak out against human rights violations happening in South Korea. Its liberal society should playing a more important role in alleviating the pain of North Korea’s residents,” he said.Since Paik went to the United States after being released by presidential pardon in 1999, he has since spent most of his time overseas pursing his academic goals and trying to avoid the public spotlight. Now the 53-year-old scholar pledged to play a bridging role between his native country and the international body to which he currently belongs, promising that he would share his insight more frequently to improve the peninsula’s political and social disposition.“Sometimes it is a shame that I can’t be physically with those people spending everyday working so hard. Though I am working at an American law school and the U.N., I hoping my work there would help Korea improve. I will come to Korea more often and share my thoughts more freely.” Paik said. “I feel proud for what I have done to make Korea a better place, for being part of the nation’s democratic progress. Ultimately, social progress comes down to whether the people voice their concern against social injustices. That is what leads us to a better future.“By Yeo Jun-suk","intelligence agency arrested dozens ,arrested dozens of activists ,top intelligence agency arrested ,agency arrested dozens ,to overthrow the government","['South Korea ’s', 'Baik Tae - ung', 'the south korean Socialist Coalition of Workers']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63235217  0.08669151

The main opposition, The Minjoo Party of Korea, said Thursday that it would move forward a bill to create an investigation body to exclusively deal with senior officials’ corruption. The centrist runner-up People’s Party and progressive Justice Party pledged to support the initiative.“The bill is our top priority during the August parliamentary session,” said the Minjoo floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho.“With the opposition majority in the National Assembly and some ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers endorsing the plan, approval of the bill is highly likely.”According to the National Assembly Act, pending bills require a three-fifth quorum to clear the floor in the 300-member Assembly. Opposition party members and those considered to be in consent of the bills account for 169 seats, 11 short of the threshold line. Rep. Woo Sang-ho , floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea, speaks at a party meeting on Friday. On his side is Kim Chong-in, chairman of the party‘s interim leadership. YonhapThe draft bill provides that the anti-corruption agency must be an independent organization. Also, its leader is not required to have legal expertise but only “high reputation and extensive experience in his or her professional field.”The Minjoo Party said that the eased qualification reflects their commitment to ending the practice of legal elites monopolizing key regulatory positions. The previous version had limited the qualification as someone who has practiced law for at least 15 years.Also, at least half of the employees must be staffed with lawyers who do not work for prosecutors. The scope of the investigation was expanded to top-ranking government officials including former presidents.“ means there is no exemption from the probe,“ said Rep. Back Hye-ryun of the Minjoo Party, one of the key initiators of the bill. The requirement for launching the investigation was lowered. The agency will be obligated to kick off the probe when there is a request from a party with more than 20 members.But some legal experts expressed concern that the system could be abused by belligerent politicians with partisan agenda, saying that the relaxed scope and authority of investigation open the way for massive politicized accusation. “Technically speaking, former presidents are not classified as government officials,” professor Roh Myung-sun of Sungkyunkwan University Law School said in a media interview.”The  requirement may exponentially expand the scope of investigation.“It was not the first time that lawmakers sought to introduce an exclusive graft probe agency. Since 1996, a total of nine such bills have been motioned but mostly ended in failure, due to ruling party disapproval.Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, former prosecutor who now chairs the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee, claimed that there is no need to create additional investigating authority. “I don’t think there is enough rationale for pushing the plan,” Kwon said. “What we need to do is to refine or improve the current system. Plus, opposition parties in the previous Assembly asked for establishing permanent special prosecutors’ office, instead of building the anti-corruption agency,” he said. But dissenting voices appeared to gain ground among the lawmakers outside of the faction close to President Park Geun-hye. The non-Park lawmakers, who plans to run for the party’s top post elected on Aug. 9, have said that they agree with establishing such organizations.

Kim Chong-in, the interim leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, adding that such remarks cannot be accepted under freedom of speech.Rep. Park Jie-won, the floor leader of the minor People's Party, stressed people defaming the movement are hurting public unity and sparking social discord. In addition to the stiff penalties, the opposition has called for making ""March for the Beloved"" the official song of the May 18 movement, which would oblige everyone attending the national ceremony in Gwangju to sing it.Earlier this year, the conservative bloc opposed such calls over the song that commemorates the 1980 uprising.Since 1997, the uprising's signature song had been sung at the event, but the government of former President Lee Myung-bak decided in 2009 to have a choir perform the song and allow those that wanted to sing along to do so.","punish defamation of democracy ,opposition parties on friday ,illegal to use newspapers ,parties on friday vowed ,punished the move if","[""South Korea 's""]",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60520035  0.29920247

The regulation was further strengthened by having in the enforcement decree an all-out smoking ban at all restaurants.The restaurant owner raised the suit in August last year, saying that the comprehensive smoking ban without due compensation for consequent damages violated the right to property. He had also argued that the limit to freely operating his restaurant violated his right to pursue happiness.YonhapThe court said in its ruling that the relevant clauses cannot be deemed to have violated such constitutional rights as they did not obligate any removal or changes to the facilities and equipment of the restaurant. “As the legislation aims to protect the people staying in the restaurant from health risk through secondhand smoke, the appropriateness of the  purpose is also recognizable.”The court also said that while alternatives could include allowing adult smokers to smoke at the facility during a certain period, this would also expose nonsmokers to thirdhand smoking due to residual nicotine and other chemicals that remain in the space.Previous complaints were raised in 2011 and 2003. The rulings then had also upheld the bans, citing how nonsmokers’ rights preceded the right to smoke.","constitutional to ban smoking ,constitutional court on thursday ,court upholds smoking ban ,smoking ban on restaurants ,court on thursday ruled","['the Constitutional Court', 'the National Health Promotion Act']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0388963   0.28073466

Choi Kyung-hwan and Yoon Sang-hyun -- who lead the faction close to President Park Geun-hye -- demanded a fellow member to change his constituency citing it is the president‘s intent.Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan The two, in return, reportedly assured the politician that the pro-Park faction would support him during the party’s nomination process. The politician in question is believed to be Kim Sung-hoe, who served as a lawmaker between 2008 and 2012. Kim accepted the proposal, but failed to be nominated. Saenuri leadership quickly came to the fore on Tuesday, condemning any attempt by members without authority in meddling with the party’s executive affairs. “They are cats acting like lions who rely on the president’s name,” said the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “It is a significant violation that damages the party. Those who are involved with the nomination process without the right to do so should take time off and apologize to the people,” he said. The burgeoning scandal also prompted outrage among lawmakers who have been at odds with the pro-Park faction. The non-Parks planning to run for the leadership post in the Aug. 8 national convention were the most vocal.Third-term lawmaker Rep. Kim Yong-tae, who plans to run for the party’s top post, urged the Saenuri leadership to file a charge against Yoon and Choi for engaging in irregularities and demanded President Park clarify her positon toward what he called the “rigged” nomination process. Fourth-term lawmaker Rep. Joo Ho-young, who is also considering a bid for the chairmanship, agreed, “Those so-called power brokers have blackmailed to prevent their members from running in the elections,” said Joo who had defected from the party in April to protest against his nomination drop, and returned after the election.Meanwhile, the most senior member of the pro-Park faction Rep. Seo Chung-won on Tuesday decided not to run for the next party chairman. He had been widely speculated to join the race in place of Choi, who had earlier withdrawn his plan to run. The ongoing controversy surrounding the Park loyalists, as well as Seo’s retreat, is expected to further heat up the race by dispersing the votes of pro-Park members, observers said.The 73-year-old lawmaker is also being implicated in the nomination controversy, as his name was mentioned significantly in the leaked conversation. Rep. Lee Woo-hyun, one of Seo’s close aides, denounced the leak as an “act of cowardice” engineered to torpedo Seo’s bid for the top post. Throughout the conversation, Choi and Yoon were seen forcing Kim to change his constituency to avoid a showdown with Seo in the April election. The constituency from which Kim Sung-hoe withdrew is that of Seo who was elected there two terms in a row. “Sure, Sure, Sure. We’ll definitely help you ,” Choi reportedly said when asked by Kim whether the proposal reflects the intent of President Park. “You’d better take my advice. If you push things too hard, you would get nothing,” he said. Choi’s phone call was said to be preceded by Yoon’s, according to the report. Referring to Kim with the endearing term “brother,” the former presidential aide warned against Kim’s plan to run in Seo’s constituency. “Brother, I know how the president thinks. This is not the place to run,” Yoon said. “Be careful brother. You ask me about how the president thinks and I told you . I guaranteed your nomination. We can make it happen using the pro-Park campaign,” he said. It is not the first time that Yoon has been implicated in a political scandal.In March, Yoon said he would “get rid of” then-party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung to block his attempt to sway the nomination process in his favor. He was then kicked out of the party until he returned after winning the latest election.  Upon the revelation, both Choi and Yoon have canceled their public schedules and remained silent. Choi, who was supposed to begin his travels to the U.K. and other European nations, canceled his trip. Yoon was absent from the party’s regular meeting and parliamentary sessions. Their aides said that the lawmakers were tending to their private schedules.

Lee said that he plans to take stern action in accordance with the result of the investigation into the case. “There cannot be any excuse for the inappropriate remarks made by a public servant under any circumstances,” Lee said. “Education officials take this case as an opportunity to make utmost efforts to have a desirable work ethic as a public servant.”A local daily had reported last week that Na Hyang-wook, the director general of the ministry’s police planning bureau, described the general public as “dogs and pigs” at a recent dinner gathering in Seoul with reporters. He allegedly said that the government should just make sure they are fed and alive. The report also quoted him as saying that equality is nothing but an unattainable illusion and there should be a stricter class system in Korea.Education Minister Lee Joon-sik attends a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday. As the alleged remarks prompted public outrage, the National Assembly called Na for questioning at its Education Committee. Na, who has withdrawn from his post, did not appear, causing the committee meeting to be suspended. Education Ministry officials said Na was currently staying at his hometown in Masan, South Gyeongsang Province, due to his “frail mental and physical condition.”Both ruling and opposition lawmakers lashed out at Na’s remarks as well as the education minister for condoning Na’s absence, and called for his immediate expulsion.Rep. Lee Jang-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party said, “ remarks are just not acceptable. I cannot understand how a high-ranking official can make such comments. We should make it clear what punishment will be imposed on him.” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, called on the government to expel Na. “We cannot see a person who described the public as dogs and pigs as a public servant receiving a paycheck from taxes.” Unions also expressed concerns over his remarks in a statement. “We cannot help but be worried about the future of our education as a high-ranking official in charge of mapping out Korean education policies has old-fashioned viewpoints such as advocating the class system for the top 1 percent,” said a union for the nation’s universities. A labor union for the nation’s public servants blamed the Park Geun-hye administration’s “authoritarian ruling system,” which led to the appointment of a person with “distorted” views in a key post. “The Constitution stipulates that public servants serve the public and take responsibility for the public. Na should be expelled from the public post forever,” it said in a statement. Na, who passed his civil service examination in 1993, previously served as the secretary for the minister and an administrative officer at Cheong Wa Dae under former President Lee Myung-bak. He was promoted to the head of the policy planning at the Education Ministry in March.

Park Jie-won speaks during a party meeting at the National Assembly on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldIn a phone conversation leaked last week, former presidential press secretary Rep. Lee Jung-hyun demanded KBS broadcasting director Kim Shi-gon revise a news story about the ferry disaster. In the recording, Lee of the ruling Saenuri Party asked the news director to “remove” and “rerecord” the report because it could paint a negative picture of now-defunct Korea Coast Guard, which was tasked with the rescue operation. The Coast Guard’s lackluster response to the disaster had sparked public outrage and led President Park Geun-hye to disband it later. The news director, who left his post after the disaster, claimed Wednesday that he was forced to resign under pressure from KBS chief Gil Hwan-young who, according to Kim, said that the decision was the “intent” of President Park Geun-hye. Since the allegations surfaced, Lee has insisted that the conversation was part of his job as a press secretary. Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Jung-hyun announces his bid to run for the party’s chairman post at a press conference on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldDespite the controversy, Lee announced Thursday his bid for the party’s chairmanship.“There is only one purpose to my bid. I will change the politics of the Republic of Korea,” Lee said in a press conference. “I will protect the country, protect the people, and protect the values of the Republic of Korea,” Lee said.This is his third bid to become chair of the ruling party. The other candidates are fifth-termer Rep. Lee Joo-young and third-termer Rep. Kim Yong-tae. Kim is the only candidate outside the Pro-Park faction. The chairperson will be elected at the party’s national caucus on Aug. 9. The new leadership will be elected in lieu of simmering in-house competition among potential candidates for next year’s presidential election and amid the looming lame duck period of President Park.Lee Jung-hyun, who hails from Gokseong, South Jeolla Province, is considered a trusted mouthpiece of the president. The third-termer famously cried in a television interview during the 2012 presidential race while defending Park from critics of her political disposition in relation to her late father and former President Park Chung-hee. Park’s campaign four years ago picked up pace after a series of setbacks, after Lee joined the campaign team as head of communications. He first joined the National Assembly as a proportional representative in 2008. He has also served as Park’s senior secretary for political affairs. Lee won his latest term in his hometown that is part of a region traditionally considered anti-Saenuri.By Yeo Jun-suk","people party threatened thursday ,party threatened thursday ,censorship scandal rep park ,party threatened thursday to ,thursday to hold parliamentary","['Park Jie - won', 'the People ’s Party', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Otherwi']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65000784 -0.10106625

119,119,Saenuri secretary-general resigns amid factional pressure,"The ruling Saenuri Party’s Secretary-General Rep.

Kweon Seong-dong offered on Thursday to resign, succumbing to pressure from the leadership during a factional feud over the party’s latest decision to readmit controversial defectors.Kweon, who is considered part of the faction that rivals those loyal to President Park Geun-hye, had initially refused to step down despite mounting pressure led by the party’s emergency chief Kim Hee-ok. Kim and the pro-Park faction had called on Kweon to resign to take responsibility over last week’s decision to bring back all seven defectors through a vote. The pro-Parks had claimed the vote was premature and not conducted with sufficient consensus among the other party members.The decision to reaccept the defectors, however, remained intact and the party’s seats in the National Assembly have since grown to 129.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk talks with resigning Secretary-General Rep. Kweon Seong-dong , while emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok sits next to them, at the party’s meeting on Thursday. “I have expressed my intention to keep my position as I have been  demanded to take responsibility over the matter. But as the chairman  expressed regret and promised to lead the party well, I will be accepting his request for me to step down,” Kweon said during a morning party meeting. Kweon was named to the post on June 2. Kweon also took time to lament the latest flare-up, saying, “While the emergency committee decided to accept the independents in its pursuit of reform -- and the decision was praised by many -- the controversy over the calls for my resignation has tarnished such efforts.”In response, Kim expressed regret and said that he had brought up the need to replace the secretary-general over differing views on how to conduct party affairs, marking a subtle change of his earlier position of holding Kweon directly responsible for the vote.“I will take necessary follow-up measures to correct the party’s discipline and achieve integration, and plan to name the next secretary-general who is neutral, capable and competent.”Kim had boycotted party affairs upon the committee’s June 16 unsigned vote, in which the majority agreed to bring back the defectors. He returned to the party three days later after party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk visited him near his residence and offered an apology. Kim, a former justice, had taken issue with the party’s “lack of discipline” saying that his authority had been undermined when the committee pushed ahead with the vote despite his opposition. Kweon later told the press that he decided to resign as he deemed his honor has been somewhat restored, with Kim showing regret over the matter, and because he thought further pursuing the matter would not help the party and would aggravate public fatigue over politics.He also accused some of the pro-Park members of framing him as the force behind the decision to bring back the defectors, saying that such action ran counter to the party’s recent declaration to be rid of factional politics.The Saenuri Party has been reeling from the April 13 election defeat that stripped it of its majority and No. 1 parliamentary bloc status. While most of the defectors -- who won in their constituencies as independents after having been dropped from the Saenuri’s nomination -- have repeatedly expressed their desire to return to the party, the staunch pro-Park members had objected, citing conflicting political dispositions and values. Among the returning defectors, the key person that the pro-Parks had rejected was former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who had been singled out by President Park Geun-hye as a traitor upon their disagreement over a parliamentary revision bill last year.“The way  are moving around in groups just because of their personal association rather than based on their political conviction or philosophy neither helps the party nor is received well by the public,” Kweon said.The third-term lawmaker also said that his plan to publish a white paper that goes over the responsibilities and reasons for the election defeat should continue regardless of his resignation. “An attempt to suspend it will be the same as digging our party’s own grave,” he said.","resigns amid factional pressure ,thursday to resign succumbing ,general resigns amid factional ,on thursday to resign ,resigns amid factional","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kweon Seong - dong', 'Kweon', 'Park Geun - hye']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60410857  0.18654899

Lee Hae-chan who defected from the party in the run-up to the April 13 general election and won his legislative seat for Sejong City as an independent candidate.The senior lawmaker on Monday motioned a revision bill of the National Assembly Act, including the establishment of a legislative branch in the administrative city. The bill was backed by 38 parliamentary members, mostly those based in nearby Daejeon or the surrounding Chungcheong provinces.The establishment of the regional branch, involving the relocation of some 10 parliamentary committees and 100 representative offices, will cost about 107 billion won , according to the National Assembly Budget Office.After meeting with parliamentary Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, who has temporarily exited the Minjoo Party due to his post, Rep. Lee claimed that Chung had “promised to look into the matter on a parliamentary level,” raising hopes for the plan.The reason that the political circles have advocated a “partial” relocation of the Assembly traces back to the Constitutional Court ruling back in 2004 which, citing basic law, said that the nation’s core symbolic functions should remain in the capital city.Nam Kyung-pil and An Hee-jung, governors of Gyeonggi Province and South Chungcheong Province respectively, took the agenda a step further by claiming that the relocation plan to Sejong should include Cheong Wa Dae as well.“The Republic of Korea is suffering from the side effects of having all of its political and economic powers concentrated ,” said Nam, calling for constitutional revision.An also pledged in a press briefing on Wednesday to “join efforts with Gov. Nam” in nurturing Sejong City into an administrative capital city and to achieve balanced regional growth.But their blueprint also resembled preceding election pledges involving large-scale infrastructure made by former and incumbent conservative presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, who both had pledged to build an international airport in the southeastern part of the country. The multi-trillion won state project had helped gather a considerable number of votes from expectant local voters, but years of talks have gone down the drain, as the government has crossed out both of the rival candidate cities.The idea of creating Sejong City was initiated under late President Roh Moo-hyun back in 2002 as part of efforts to relieve the overcrowding metropolitan cluster.The plan, however, was often used as a political strategy to appeal to Chungcheong voters, who have often acted as the largest swing voter pool in national elections.The recent rise of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as the next presidential hopeful has also brought the Cheungcheong region to public attention. The former diplomat, who hinted at his bid in the 2017 presidential election, was born in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province.By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential office rekindled concerns ,feuds political parties promptly ,the thwarted airport plan ,moving the presidential office ,news focus sejong resurfaces","['Sejong', 'Cheungcheong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.06628847  0.50684357

121,121,Human rights watchdog opposes ban on students' cellphone use in Korea,"Last year, Kim Ji-hoon, a middle school student, filed a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, claiming his school’s ban on cellphone use limits his social life.

Since 2012, all students attending school have been prohibited from bringing cellphones to class, except on specific circumstances such as school trips and outdoor field work. The ban was introduced in 2012 to prevent possible traffic accidents caused by cellphone use, as well as to encourage all students to focus on their studies without being disturbed by their smart devices. Still, Kim claimed the ban was unfair, as most students did not agree with it, adding that he has been unable to efficiently contact his parents after school, even in emergency situations. Kim’s school is one of the three educational institutions the NHRCK officially advised on Wednesday to ease their ban on cellphone use among students. The human rights watchdog said such practices that prohibit cellphone use violate Article 18 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the “privacy of correspondence of no citizen shall be infringed,” as well as the students’ unalienable rights to pursue happiness. The watchdog stressed that in the case of Kim’s school, the majority of its students and their parents did not agree with the ban. According to a survey organized by school authorities about a month after the ban was introduced, 73 percent of students said the ban should be lifted, while 54.9 percent of parents thought the same. Still, the school did not revise its regulations against cellphones.“There are other ways to prevent car accidents caused by cellphone use, such as safety education,” the agency said in a statement. “And it’s unfortunate that the practice was implemented without the majority of the students’ agreement. Such practice seems to violate the students’ rights to pursue happiness, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, by limiting their opportunities to communicate freely with their family and friends on top of infringing their rights to independence and freedom.”South Korea is one of the most wired countries it the world, with more than 80 percent of the entire population owning smartphones as of last year. A recent study by the nation’s Gender Ministry showed that nearly 14 percent of Korean students are addicted to either a smartphone or the Internet. Some of the government’s measures against smartphone addiction among teenagers include a rehab camp for young Internet or smartphone addicts, as well as therapy sessions with school counselors. Some schools, like Kim’s, ban smartphone use altogether in classrooms.“We acknowledge that many worry about smartphone addiction among teenagers, but at the same time, cellphones can be seen as an  medium that connects young people with one another, which prevents them from social isolation,” the NKRCK said in a statement.Aside from Kim, students from two other high schools also filed complaints to the human rights agency last year, claiming their schools’ ban on cellphone use is unfair. Both of the institutions are boarding schools that only allow students to use their cell phones on weekends. In one of the schools, 460 students currently have to share only four public phones, should they need to speak to someone outside the school on weekdays, and only with their teachers’ approval, the human rights agency said. The school’s authorities explained that allowing cell phone use may negatively affect student’s dorm life, on top of their academic performance. “Most students share their rooms with three other students, and when one of them plays with his or her phone at night when the light is turned off, it can decrease their roommates’ quality of sleep.” The authorities also claimed that students have “no time to spend with their cell phones,” due to their tight schedule. According to the report by the NKRCK, the students wake up at 6:30 a.m. every day, have breakfast at 7:30 and have classes from 8:30 a.m. until 9:30 p.m., before going to bed at 11 a.m. At the other school, students wake up at 6 a.m. and have classes from 7:30 a.m. until 8:50 p.m. They are required to study on their own from 9:30 p.m. until 1 a.m. before they go to sleep. The students only sleep five hours daily. Human rights violations in South Korea’s education system have been frequently reported, such as bans on dating, wearing earrings and dying or perming hair, according to the teenager rights organization Group for Youth Sexuality Rights. The NKRCK advised both of the schools to ease their bans on cell phones. “Students attending boarding schools inevitably live away from their family members, and it’s only natural for them to want to stay connected,” the agency said in a statement. “We conclude that it’s almost impossible for 460 students to freely communicate with their loved ones if they only have four public phones to share between everyone. Their privacy may also be violated as they are required to get their teachers’ approval should they want to use the public phones. We think this infringes on their right to pursue happiness.”By Claire Lee  Kim Ji-hoon is not his real name.

Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea at the Supreme Council meeting.The ministry, whose mission is to honor war veterans and patriots, recently came under fire for including the 11th Special Forces Airborne Brigade in the street march in Gwangju on June 25, the 65th anniversary of the Korean War breakout. Patriots and Veterans Affairs Minister Park Sung-choon The disputed military unit was that which former President Chun Doo-hwan dispatched to Gwangju to quell the democratization movement on May 18, 1980.The bloody suppression, commemorated as the most symbolic event in South Korea’s democratic history, left hundreds dead, a considerable number of which were civilians.“It is beyond comprehension that  should think of sending the airborne troops to Gwangju, a city still suffering from the scars ,” Rep. Woo said.The runner-up opposition People’s Party echoed the main opposition party, pointing out this was not the first time Park has triggered public indignation.“Park not only fell short of the public call for resignation, but also insulted the democratic spirit of the May 18 movement,” said party whip Rep. Park Jie-won.“Cheong Wa Dae should no longer side with the controversial official, who has clearly shown himself to be unqualified .”Earlier this year, the ministry had triggered backlash from opposition circles by refusing to designate the pro-democratic song “March for the Beloved” as the official anthem for the May 18 commemoration event. Most vocal on the issue was the People’s Party, which enjoys most of its political support from Gwangju and the surrounding Jeolla provinces.The more progressive minority Justice Party, too, pledged to take part in the tripartite resolution asking for Park’s dismissal.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition camp demands dismissal ,opposition parties said monday ,demands dismissal of veterans ,camp demands dismissal ,camp demands dismissal of","['Park Sung - choon', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Supreme Council']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34579629  0.2628406

Emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok, however, did not immediately say he would return to work after his meeting with whip Rep. Chung Jin-suk. This came three days after Kim boycotted party affairs over Chung pushing through a controversial vote on Thursday to accept any or all seven party defectors elected as independents.The public falling-out between the two had rekindled factional discord between those rallying around President Park Geun-hye and the non-Parks.Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk  bows to emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok during their meeting at a cafe in Nonhyeon-dong, Seoul, Sunday. Yonhap“I will accept  apology as it seems sincere,” Kim told the press after his meeting at a coffee shop near his residence in southern Seoul. Their meeting, captured on camera from outside of the glass-door cafe, lasted less than half an hour. Chung was seen bowing to Kim in a show of apology. The press were notified of the time and location of their rendezvous an hour before.“But I need to think more about other parts. I will let you know through the party spokesperson,” Kim said, referring to whether he would return to his post.Kim had reportedly been outraged over Chung’s remarks when he attempted to delay the vote by the emergency committee members. Chung had said it would be “equivalent to a grave violation of the law if the vote were delayed.”Kim, a former Constitutional Court judge, had reportedly been trying to put off the vote that would bring back some of the controversial members. Among them is Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who had a public falling-out with the president last summer over Assembly rules that Park eventually vetoed. Kim was named to head the emergency committee comprised of five Saenuri members and five external figures earlier this month, after a 50-day leadership vacuum that followed the party’s April 13 election defeat. Kim had previously been Government Public Ethics Committee chairman, a post appointed by the president.The ballot count of Thursday’s vote by Kim and the 10 members, was stopped midway after the majority of votes – six -- were cast in approval of the defectors’ return. With the Saenuri Party’s defeat to the Minjoo Party -- 122 seats in the Assembly to 123 seats -- the return of the defectors was widely considered inevitable. Upon the decision by the emergency committee, currently acting as the Supreme Council, Yoo, along with four others immediately submitted their applications to return. With this move, the Saenuri Party has regained the No. 1 status in the Assembly with 126 seats. “ that he was at a loss as to what he could do when there is no discipline at the party,” said Saenuri’s spokesman Rep. Ji Sang-wuk after the Kim-Chung meeting. Ji added that Kim was also contemplating whether his staying in the post would further cause the party to remain in disarray.During the meeting, Chung told Kim, “I sincerely apologize for having used excessively rough and unnecessary remarks in the process of solving the matter of defectors.” He also pleaded with Kim to return so that they would be able to “smoothly hold” the party’s national caucus to pick new leadership on Aug. 9.Kim had reportedly lambasted Chung for degrading his role and said, “This is not a democracy. It was not out of party loyalty or comradeship. There is no trust, ethics of discipline.”Yoo’s defection right before the election, after being dropped from the party’s nomination, displayed what the opposition described as the pro-Park members’ deep-running loyalty to the president with intolerance toward lawmakers who openly disagree with her policies.","after kim boycotted party ,feud quietens after leaders ,work after his meeting ,saenuri feud quietens after ,leaders meeting the feud","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Hee - ok', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Kim', 'Chung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67856556  0.32001466

Yoo Seong-min, Daegu’s fourth-termer and the party’s former floor leader, known for his deep rift with President Park Geun-hye. Whether or not he would make it back to the party has been considered a yardstick of Saenuri’s willingness to overcome the chronic strife between the pro-Park and the non-Park factions. Kim Hee-ok, chairman of the party’s emergency committee, disappeared from public view on Friday, boycotting not only party affairs but also a scheduled tripartite meeting with Cheong Wa Dae and the Cabinet.Kim, who has been steering the distressed ruling party for less than a month, is said to be pondering his resignation.His actions come after the interim leadership’s decision to accept seven independent lawmakers who had defected amid nomination feuds for the April 13 general election.Of these lawmakers, four including Yoo immediately retrieved their party membership, while the remaining three have yet to submit their applications to the central headquarters.If all seven return, the ruling party would recover its status as the largest party in the 300-seat National Assembly, with its number of lawmakers rising from 122 to 129. Pro-Park Saenuri Party members discuss countermeasures against the return of Rep. Yoo Seong-min to the party. “The decision was made to respond to the public sentiment as shown in the April 13 election, asking for unity and harmony,” said spokesperson Rep. Ji Sang-wuk after the reinstatement vote.Party mainstreamers, however, lashed back against the earlier-than-expected return of the defectors.“I was taken aback by the rash decision,” said pro-Park Rep. Hong Moon-jong in a radio interview Friday.“I expect floor leader Chung  to feel responsible for the consequences.”Rep. Kim Tae-heum, another pro-Park member, described the emergency committee’s decision as a “coup” led by the reformist floor leader and advocated by nonparty members of the committee.But such protests from the pro-Park clique further deepened infighting with the reformists, who claimed that the pro-Park lawmakers are still caught up in power games.“The result  was based on a democratic agreement,” said committee member and former party chief spokesperson Rep. Kim Young-woo.Cheong Wa Dae refrained from commenting on the reinstatement.“We do not comment on issues which happened within the  party,” said presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk, in response to reporters’ questions.As for the cancellation of the tripartite meeting, he cited “circumstances of the party,” denying direct causality with the party leadership’s decision to embrace the defectors.The feud between the presidential office, as well as those close to the president, and Rep. Yoo traces back to last year, when then-floor leader Yoo advocated an opposition-backed revision bill of the National Assembly law. President Park Geun-hye, upon vetoing the bill later, laid the blame on Yoo for being “untrue.”After being excluded from nomination for the April race in his Daegu electorate, where he would have been guaranteed an easy win, Yoo defected from the party to run as an independent candidate.Not only did the senior lawmaker score victory, but his image as a political martyr and an uncompromising reformer placed him in the list of potential bidders for the 2017 presidential election.According to local pollster Realmeter on Friday, Yoo’s approval rating stood at 15.7 percent, running second among conservative potential candidates, behind U.N.

The meeting with reporters comes as Hwang marks his first year in office on Saturday.Last week, President Park Geun-hye conducted a small-scale reshuffle of her senior secretaries and vice-ministerial officials amid calls for a personnel shift in the wake of the ruling Saenuri Party's defeat in April's parliamentary polls. Initially, political pundits earlier expected a Cabinet reshuffle.Looking back on the past year, Hwang said it was regrettable that the country was not able to make sufficient headway in the economic sector.Concerning the latest debate over construction of a new airport in the southeastern part of the country, Hwang said his office will ""stick to principle"" and continue to keep an eye on the progress.Daegu, Ulsan and the North Gyeongsang Province support Milyang as the candidate site for the new airport, while Busan, the country's largest sea port and No. 2 city, wants the airport to be built on Gadeok Island, not far from the existing Gimhae International Airport.The issue has become a major area of focus for local political and industrial groups.As for next year's presidential election, Hwang skirted the issue adding he is ""already busy enough .""Hwang also declined to provide details on his meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Turkey last month, adding their conversation was only limited to the World Humanitarian Summit.Ban is also cited as one of potential presidential candidate in South Korea, especially after the U.N. chief said he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing his two terms as U.N. helmsman at the end of this year.","pm says cabinet reshuffle ,an immediate cabinet reshuffle ,immediate cabinet reshuffle adding ,cabinet reshuffle not urgent ,said during press conference","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang', 'Hwang']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55789232  0.3873885

""Constitutional amendment is something that someone must tackle,"" Chung said during his speech marking the opening of the newly elected parliament.""This is not an issue that we can easily bring up, but it is not an issue either that we can continue to disregard,"" he added, underscoring that the goal of the constitutional revision should be national integration.His remarks coincided with a seminar on rewriting the basic law at the assembly where a series of heavyweight politicians such as former Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung and five-term Saenuri Rep. Lee Ju-young participated. Calls have been lingering for revising the constitution, which was last amended in 1987 following a massive pro-democracy movement to end the decades of rule by military-backed authoritarian governments. The proponents of the revision have argued that the current constitution does not reflect the social and political changes that have taken place since the last revision nearly three decades ago. Some of them, in particular, have called for a shift in the current governance structure, where power is concentrated too much on the chief executive, and asserted the need to adopt a four-year, double-term presidency to have a more stable, farsighted policy implementation.During the seminar, Rep. Lee expressed hopes that a constitutional amendment can happen before next year's presidential election.""We have one and a half years before the presidential election,"" he said during his congratulatory remarks. ""I have this expectation that if we push for the revision during this period of time and call for a national referendum, we can achieve a history of constitutional revision.""The seminar was arranged by an association of some six non-governmental organizations including the Hansun Foundation led by former Finance Minister Bahk Jae-wan.The government has so far held a cautious stance over the constitutional revision as it could trigger yet another partisan wrangling, which could derail its efforts to maintain political stability and focus on enhancing people's livelihoods. But some of the ruling party members, including Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, have raised the issue.","revision resurfaced on monday ,revitalizing the economy constitutional ,resurfaced on monday ,monday as national assembly ,of constitutional revision resurfaced","['National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56117702 -0.07563068

It was the shortest period to form the Assembly since the lawmakers set a legal deadline in 1994. The rival parties last week had reached a consensus on how to distribute key parliamentary positions, considered key in creating favorable conditions to endorse their bills and initiatives at each committee. The Assembly members elected Chung Sye-kyun of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea as the new speaker last week.As internal competition was high at the parties for the key committee chairpersons’ posts, the two largest parties had also allowed some of the positions to be rotated among their senior members by breaking the four-year positions up into several terms.New chairpersons belonging to the ruling Saenuri Party to head standing committees pose after their election during the party‘s general assembly on Monday. In the Saenuri Party, the head post for the House Steering Committee went to floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. It is customary for the ruling party’s whip to take the post, which supervises Cheong Wa Dae and the presidential office.The Saenuri Party’s third-term lawmaker Rep. Kweon Seong-dong was elected as the chief of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee. The committee is often considered to be the “upper chamber” of the Assembly because it can block pending bills from being put to a vote in a plenary session. After a heavy in-party contest, the former prosecutor is only expected to serve for the first year of the four-year term. After that, Rep. Yeo Sang-kyoo will take over the post the following year and Rep. Hong Il-pyo will serve the remaining two years. The same rule was to be applied to the management of other top posts of key committees. The standing committees of national policy, strategy and finance and security and public administration will rotate among the Saenuri Party’s senior lawmakers. The Minjoo Party allowed third-term lawmaker Rep. Kim Hyun-mee to assume the top post of the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts. Kim became the first female lawmaker to preside over the committee, which had, until this parliament, customarily been chaired by a lawmaker from the ruling party. Since the committee has the authority to review and endorse the government’s budget, the opposition lawmaker is expected to set a more critical tone in the process. Kim had served as a speaker for liberal parties and worked as a top aide to former Minjoo Party leader Moon Jae-in. Rep. Hong Young-pyo of the Minjooo Party was elected chairman of environment and labor, which deals with contentious bills related to the government’s plan to overhaul the labor market. The committee is also to deal with the opposition parties’ push to impose penalty on the manufactures of toxic humidifier disinfectants. Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Saenuri Party was chosen to serve as the chief of the Intelligence Committee. The opposition parties have vowed to abolish the counterterrorism law, which cleared the previous Assembly amid a partisan standoff. By Yeo Jun-suk","committees on monday finishing ,rival parties last week ,body after two weeks ,parties last week ,lawmakers set legal deadline","['National Assembly', 'Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64721978  0.23914285

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Lee, an independent seven-term lawmaker and former prime minister, is currently visiting the U.S. upon the invitation of the U.S. State Department as a representative of a foundation honoring the late President Roh Moo-hyun.Though he exited The Minjoo Party of Korea in the run-up to the April 13 general election, Lee is still considered a leading opposition figure, likely to return to his home party within the year.He reportedly played a key role in supporting Ban, who was foreign minister at the time, in becoming chief of the international organization in 2006.After his slated meeting with Ban was exposed to the media, Lee expressed his resentment over Ban’s rise as a presidential candidate. “I have seen many diplomats, but none of them made it so far as to the presidential candidacy,” Lee had said Monday.“ are skilled at diplomatic communication, but lack expertise in other areas such as economy, social affairs, policies, culture and education.”Also, the prudent character of diplomats does not fit with politics, which requires quick decisions and bold actions, Lee had added.His words directly pointed at Ban who, during his visit to Korea last month, repeatedly alluded to his bid in the 2017 presidential race. His second, five-year term as U.N. chief is to end at the end of this year.But Lee’s aides claim that the reason for the meeting’s cancellation was more because of the change in Ban’s stance, rather than Lee’s remarks. It was Ban’s side that had suggested the meeting with Lee.“The nature of the occasion, which was supposed to be a private, closed-door tea meeting, has changed,” said an official of the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation, who was accompanying Lee on his U.S. trip.According to local pollster R&Search;, Ban’s support rating as a potential presidential candidate stood at 25.2 percent, down 3.8 percent from the previous week, but still slightly ahead of Moon Jae-in, the top candidate for the Minjoo Party.By Bae Hyun-jung","political gesture triggers conflict ,potential presidential candidate ,in korean politics ,stir within domestic political ,party is causing stir","['United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Han - chan', 'U.N.', 'korean', 'U.N']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78573889  0.24148133

The deadlock on who will sit in the speaker's chair has stalled all parliamentary proceedings such as picking who will chair the 18 assembly committees. The ruling party, however, said it should take the chairmanships of the key steering and legislation committees in return.Saenuri also has been eying the intelligence committees within the National Assembly, while Minjoo wants to chair the steering and national policy committees.Rep. Suh Chung-won, an eight-term lawmaker from Saenuri who has been cited as a potential candidate for the National Assembly speaker, called on his party to look at the bigger picture and asked Saenuri's leadership to yield the speaker's seat to the opposition.Chung then brushed aside speculations raised by the opposition that the presidential office has been behind the ruling party's strategy on the parliamentary formation. The Saenuri whip added it also plans to yield the budget, policy, and finance committees' chairmanships to the opposition.Minjoo greeted the latest decision, adding that the move reflects the public's will as shown through April's poll. The main opposition added it will make effort to move forward on other issues related to the appointment of assembly committee chairs. The ruling Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party have been wrangling over the formation of the committees as the main opposition managed to take one more seat in the 300-seat unicameral parliament following the April 13 polls.The discussion had faced a deadlock as Saenuri claimed it should take the National Assembly speaker seat, in line with tradition, since the post has with very few exceptions been taken up by the ruling party in the past. The opposition countered that the No. 1 party in terms of the number of lawmakers has priority in picking the speaker.Political pundits earlier said if the parties do not agree on the issue soon, the 20th National Assembly will get off to a rocky start, which bodes ill for cooperation between the parties down the road.","saenuri party announced wednesday ,stalemate south korea ruling ,party announced wednesday ,new national assembly speaker ,party announced wednesday that","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'National Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67430395  0.53496623

Each represents the so-called non- and pro-Park Geun-hye factions within Saenuri. Kim stepped down from the party's chairman's post following the defeat, leaving the party's leadership vacant.The rift is cited as one reason why the party did so poorly in the April 13 polls when it won just 122 of the 300 seats up for grabs in the unicameral 300-seat National Assembly.Chung then said the party should overhaul itself by refraining from using such terms as factionism.Last week, Chung, Choi and Kim discussed ways to normalize the party's leadership, including giving more power to a single leader.In the past, the party employed a collective leadership system that has been cited for fueling internal discord and bickering.The party, meanwhile, nominated the former head of the Government Public Ethics Committee Kim Hee-ok as its interim leader. The former prosecutor and judge is expected to be officially instated on Thursday at a national gathering of party members.","saenuri party on tuesday ,tuesday said every effort ,factional infighting key officials ,month poll all members ,party on tuesday","['Chung Jin - suk', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75977933  0.13675636

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's potential bid for the presidency on Thursday, as his possible run in next year's election is raising fresh uncertainties in the fluid political landscape here.The ruling Saenuri Party apparently welcomes Ban as a potential standard-bearer, while opposition parties expressed wariness, nitpicking at his lack of experience in domestic politics beset by relentless factional rivalries and partisan backbiting.In the clearest indication yet of his presidential ambitions, Ban said Wednesday that he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after completing his two terms as U.N. helmsman at the end of this year.In a departure from his previously noncommittal stance over domestic politics, he even said that ""political leaders should strive harder for national unity.""Rep. Hong Moon-pyo, the Saenuri Party's acting secretary-general, said that the ""general sentiment"" in his party is in support of Ban as a potential presidential candidate. He also said that should Ban join the ruling party he could clinch a win in the presidential election."" is a figure that is popular at home and abroad, and has experience in various fields including the government and society at large,"" he said in an SBS radio interview. ""His character is more aligned with the Saenuri Party  as he has been seen prioritizing conservative values,"" he added.Rep. Na Kyung-won of the same party also welcomed the possibility of Ban running for the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae as she attended a forum on the southern resort island of Jeju along with Ban.""It couldn't be better should Secretary-General Ban use his experience and capabilities for the people of the Republic of Korea,"" the lawmaker said.Others in the ruling camp said Ban can invigorate the party that has been struggling to find a strong contender to face off against established and well-known opposition contenders.In stark contrast to reactions from the ruling party, opposition lawmakers voiced uneasiness over Ban's potential run in the 2017 election.Rep. Park Jie-won of the minority People's Party said that it is ""inappropriate"" for Ban to hint at the possibility of running for the presidency ""in a strong tone of voice.""""His remarks alluding to his potential presidential run are inappropriate and deserve denunciation,"" he said during his appearance on a YTN radio program.Park also raised doubts that Ban will be able to successfully weather the ""political typhoon"" during an election campaign.""He has lived as a bureaucrat and largely in diplomatic circles, meaning that it would be difficult for him to endure ,"" he said.Kim Boo-kyum, a leading member of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, also opposed Ban's potential presidential run, saying he wants Ban to remain a ""mediator for the settlement of international conflicts."" ""I hope that he would work as an international leader that goes beyond domestic politics,"" he said during a forum in Daegu.Other opposition officials belittled Ban's presidential prospects, casting him as ""one of the potential presidential contenders."" In recent opinion surveys, Rep. Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Minjoo Party, and Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, co-chair of the People's Party, were polling in first and second place, respectively, although the ranks could be upturned if Ban is factored into the polls. Meanwhile, the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae refused to comment on Ban's presidential ambitions in an apparent move to avoid getting mired in partisan politics and focus on its agenda for economic revitalization.","opposition parties expressed wariness ,potential bid for presidency ,korea ruling and opposition ,the presidency on thursday ,at odds over secretary","[""South Korea 's"", 'U.N.', ""Ban Ki - moon 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Ban']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59875119  0.39410755

The ceremony came days after the leaders had gathered to commemorate the May 18 democratic uprising and amid simmering political rivalry among parties entering the next parliamentary term.It was The Minjoo Party of Korea, the home camp of the deceased liberal president, which took a leading role in the day’s event, while the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and the runner-up opposition People’s Party paid their respects as guests.“Let us look back on whether we are abiding by the will of the two former presidents who fought their way till the end to defend democracy,” said the Minjoo’s senior advisor Kim Won-ki, in his memorial address.The former parliamentary speaker was referring to late Kim Dae-jung and Roh, the two presidents classified as being progressive in South Korea’s political history.Political leaders sing “March for Our Beloved” during a memorial ceremony for late President Roh Moo-hyun at Bongha Village in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, Monday. From right, Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk; The Minjoo Party’s interim chief Kim Chong-in; People’s Party co-chiefs Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo and Rep. Chun Jung-bae; and Justice Party chairwoman Rep. Sim Sang-jeung. Chung was seen not singling along to the controversial song that is opposed by conservatives. The memorial ceremony was held at Bongha Village in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province, where Roh was born in 1946 and where he ended his life in 2009.Roh, South Korea’s 16th president in 2003-2008, jumped off a mountain cliff on May 23 that year, amid an intensive prosecutorial probe on corruption charges involving his family members.Attending the event were key members of the main opposition Minjoo Party, including emergency council chief Kim Chong-in, former party chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in and key lawmakers including former Prime Minister Rep. Lee Hae-chan.The Saenuri was represented by its floor leader Chung Jin-suk and floor spokesperson Min Kyung-wook. The People’s Party co-chiefs Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo and Chun Jung-bae, along with floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won, attended as well.Cheong Wa Dae sent the senior presidential secretary for political affairs, Hyun Ki-hwan, to offer condolences, speaking for President Park Geun-hye.The appearance of ranking Saenuri officials has often triggered a backlash from the residents of Bongha, as well as loyalists to Roh, who hold the conservative political powers responsible for his suicide.“You abused your power to drive a former president to his death, yet you fail to regret it,” Roh’s son Kun-ho had blasted then-Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung at last year’s memorial event.But this year, junior Roh merely expressed his thanks to the attendees.This pacifist turn largely reflected the growing calls from within the much-divided opposition camp to achieve unity.“I expect that the Minjoo will greet the guests in a mature manner ,” said floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho in a radio interview earlier in the morning.Even after his abrupt death, Roh remained a contentious figure in the opposition bloc.His affiliation with the Gyeongsang region, together with his disapproval of regionalism, led to conflicts with the party’s conventional powers, most of them based in the Jeolla area.It was the non-Roh group that broke away late last year and established the new opposition People’s Party with Rep. Ahn. Their claim was that the then leadership of Moon Jae-in, still called a Roh loyalist, monopolized power and neglected the opposition party’s longtime stronghold of the Gwangju and Jeolla cluster, dubbed the Honam region.The Minjoo-turned-People’s Party members, especially party leader Ahn, faced bitter remarks from Roh supporters in Bongha as he arrived at the memorial, with them calling the divide a “betrayal.”While the Saenuri whip Chung and Blue House official Hyun refrained from speaking at the ceremony, the ruling party focused on the concept of unity.“We pay our respects to late President Roh who struggled to overcome regionalism and achieve unity in politics,” the party said through a statement earlier in the day.“The imminent 20th National Assembly should remember his deeds and work only for the sake of the people and nation.”By Bae Hyun-jung","political representatives gathered monday ,respect to late president ,anniversary of former president ,late president roh political ,gathered monday to commemorate","['Roh Moo - hyun', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57782745  0.64091462

The government's latest move to expand communications with the parties came as the ruling Saenuri Party suffered a defeat in the April 13 polls and failed to secure a majority in the 300-seat National Assembly. Administration critics have claimed that Park's reluctance to listen to various voices from the public led to the defeat in the elections. Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho is expected to participate in the meeting on Friday, sources said. Policy officials from the ruling Saenuri Party, as well as the opposition Minjoo Party and the People's Party, will also join the gathering.The kickoff of the first meeting between government-political party offices remained unclear following the clash over the status of the song ""March for the Beloved"" at the ceremony to commemorate the May 18 democracy movement.Since 1997, the uprising's signature song had been officially sung by attendees of the national ceremony every year, but the government of former President Lee Myung-bak decided in 2009 to have a choir perform the song. Parliamentary sources, meanwhile, said the government and parties agreed to hold the meeting as planned to discuss ways to prevent the slowing down of the national economy.The government and the ruling party are expected to focus on rolling out policies on adding flexibility to the local labor market, while the opposition parties are set to demand fundamental solutions to the sluggish economy.","meeting slated for friday ,friday came after president ,political sources said thursday ,this week political sources ,hold meeting on economy","['korean', 'Park Geun']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62839633  0.31409627

Lee is currently an advisor for LG International Corp.He only brings a limited background in sports, having served as an advisor for PyeongChang's Olympic bid committee in 2006 and as the head of the bidding committee for the Gwangju Summer Universaide in 2008.Lee's appointment is apparently aimed at bolstering sponsorships and marketing activities for PyeongChang.The POCOG said Lee offers ""administrative capacity, marketing expertise and a wide network among the business leaders and communication skills"" to act as an effective coordinator among the various levels of government and stakeholders.","country first winter olympics ,winter olympics on thursday ,first winter olympics on ,paralympic winter games pocog ,commerce minister formally elected","['Commerce', 'Lee Hee - beom', 'Lee', 'the PyeongChang Organizing Committee', 'Paralympic Winter Games ( POCOG', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Cultur']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57880014  0.69787818

Chung Jin-suk said Monday.Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk attends a meeting of first-time lawmakers-elect at the National Assembly on Tuesday.The newly elected whip also suggested that senior lawmakers be seated in the front rows to show active participation in parliamentary proceedings.The National Assembly Act states that the placement is to be decided upon the consensus of the parliamentary speaker and the representative of each bargaining unit.It has been customary, however, to place the largest party at the center of the fan-shaped floor, the runner-up party on its right, and the remaining minority parties on its left.Under this plan, it is the 123-seat main opposition party, The Minjoo Party of Korea -- which is to take the central position, shoving out the 122-seat ruling Saenuri.The Assembly secretariat’s Proceedings Bureau reported, in reply to the Saenuri whip’s inquiry, that seats may be rearranged upon consensus as long as they remain fixed for the sake of electronic voting. It also suggested the idea of placing lawmakers according to their committee affiliation.The Minjoo Party, however, is reluctant to revise the current rule that it sees as acting in its favor.“ may cause some disorder in the floor,” said the opposition whip Woo Sang-ho on Tuesday.“It would be more efficient to let parties group together so that they can discuss urgent issues right away.”Vice floor leader Rep. Park Wan-ju also added that a change of seats is not a solution to improving inter-party communications.Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party echoed the Minjoo’s remarks, calling the relocation “unnecessary.”Both opposition parties nevertheless promised to include the issue on the agendas of their floor meetings for further discussion.“In order to create a policy-focused legislature, it may be an idea to reallocate lawmakers according to their committees,” said Kim Hyung-joon, a professor of political science at Myongji University.Northern European states such as Sweden and Norway section their lawmakers based on elected regions, while the United Kingdom adopts a non-designated seat system with the ruling party members sat opposite the other parties. In the United States, senators and representatives sit in party clusters.

Moon Ja-in is also rebounding, recent polls showed.Realmeter said Sunday that in its survey on 1,517 adults nationwide from May 2-4, the Minjoo Party’s approval ratings rose 7.6 percentage points to 35.2 percent in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces, compared to the third-largest People’s Party, which saw its approval ratings decline by 14.8 percentage points to 35.8 percent.The turnaround was also apparent for Moon and People’s Party co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. Moon received an approval rating of 31.3 percent, up by 8 percentage points from the week before. Ahn dropped to the second place for the first time since the election at 25.5 percent, falling 10.4 percentage points.The Minjoo Party of Korea’s new floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho  introduces his team at the National Assembly on Sunday. In the April 13 general election, the region, also known as Honam, gave the People’s Party 23 seats out of 28. The Minjoo Party only landed three seats while another two went to the ruling Saenuri Party. The results were widely perceived as disgruntled constituents judging the main opposition for its factional feuds that allegedly undermined representatives hailing from the region. The People’s Party was launched just months before the election by Minjoo Party defectors that had turned against then-chairman Moon.Upon the election, however, the tide appears to be turning, as the People’s Party – with its policy stance still ambiguous – has hinted at cooperating with the ruling party in the upcoming National Assembly. The People’s Party has risen as the group with swaying power, with 38 seats. The Saenuri has 122 seats while the Minjoo Party has 123 seats.“If President Park Geun-hye apologizes for her maladministration and seeks for cooperation,  have the Saenuri Party  become the Assembly speaker,” a Jeolla native and the People’s Party’s new whip Rep. Park Jie-won had said last week. The party’s co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo suffered a setback recently for making controversial comments, such as by saying that education policies should become more autonomous and that there is no need for the Education Ministry.Prior to the election, Moon had visited the Honam region and pleaded for support, saying he would retire from politics should the constituents decide not to vote for the Minjoo Party. But despite the crushing defeat in the region, Moon has remained low key, with opposition supporters widely split on whether he should follow through with his promise.The two party’s new whips, meanwhile, are to meet for the first time since their endorsements on Monday. The Minjoo Party has elected former student-activist and moderate Woo Sang-ho, while the People’s Party picked Park, the veteran and former aide to President Kim Dae-jung. The Minjoo Party is counting on cooperation from the People’s Party in its legislative rivalry with the Saenuri Party.But so far, the Saenuri Party’s new floor leader and lawmaker-elect Chung Jin-suk seems to have beat the Minjoo Party to it, by visiting Park the day after his election accompanied by the press, hugging him and calling him “Hyeongnim,” an endearing term addressing a person of higher age and rank.Park and Woo have reportedly maintained a tense relationship, and they have locked horns in a factional power struggle, as Woo had countered Park’s accusations against the party’s mainstreamers supportive of Moon.“ is someone who could become the floor leader  with the help of chairman Ahn Cheol-soo,” Woo had said.","also rebounding recent polls ,last month parliamentary election ,rebounding recent polls ,presidential hopeful rep moon ,rebounding recent polls showed","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'the Minjoo Party ’s', 'Moon Ja -']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4966028   0.88712394

The follow-up measures will be taken care of by the Prime Minister’s Office, instead of the current Environment Ministry, the officials said.Families of the victims, and the members of the opposition parties, have been calling for parliamentary action to uncover those responsible and ensure compensation.“The National Assembly will launch a parliamentary probe and hearing, and speed up its efforts to revise necessary regulations,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.“The government should also report  how products which were unauthorized in other countries could be sold in the local market, and check if any other hygiene products in sale are chemically safe,” he added. The prosecutorial probe, meanwhile, is expected to widen to foreign officials of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser amid escalating public uproar over the massive number of deaths, sources said Sunday. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office is reportedly setting up schedules over when to summon several foreign executive board members of Oxy, who are knowledgeable about the company’s operation. These include two former CEOs -- John Lee, a 48-year-old Korean national with American citizenship, and a 47-year-old. Lee served as the CEO from June 2005 to May 2010, succeeding Shin Hyun-woo who was summoned late last month. Sales of the problematic product surged while Lee was holding the post, the prosecution said. Lee is suspected of pushing ahead with the product sales despite continuous health complaints from users. The second man, who worked from May 2010 for two years, is suspected to have been a key person who directed to conceal key evidence.Prosecutors said that it was around the time he was holding a post in the company, that Oxy changed its corporation type and allegedly sought to manipulate Seoul National University’s experiment report over the product toxicity test. The prosecution will also look into whether these former leaders served as a link between the Korean branch and the U.K. headquarters by sharing information and reports over the toxic product case, they added. A Seoul National University professor surnamed Cho was arrested Saturday on charges of manipulating evidence in favor of Oxy. Cho, 57, is suspecting of making up an experiment report that is allegedly advantageous to Oxy’s stance over the product toxicity. In an alleged attempt to refute the government’s health probe that pointed out humidifier disinfectant as the culprit behind more than a hundred deaths in 2011, the company had requested that Cho conduct a toxicity test of PHMG, the main ingredient of the humidifier disinfectant. Oxy allegedly handed over 250 million won  to Cho for the experiment cost. Toxicity was found in the initial reproduction-toxicity test but Oxy allegedly bribed Cho to release an inhalation-toxicity test report in favor of the company. Prosecutors found that the company had sent a total of 12 million won to Cho’s personal account on three occasions, separate from the experiment fee. In the following year, Cho released a health report that causality between the product use and the lung damage was not clear. Cho denied the allegations and said the company had not asked him for such a favor. Meanwhile, it was revealed that a 2013 report by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that use of the humidifier disinfectant could increase lung risk by 116 times. Based on a comparison between PHMG-exposed people and others under the same condition, the health agency confirmed that longer exposure to PHMG could lead to higher lung risks. The report was not released to the public, citing that the result was similar to the government’s health probe result already released in 2011, the health authorities said. The report was published in international science journal PLOS ONE in March this year.Meanwhile, Kim Deok-jong, 40, a father who claims to have lost his son to Oxy’s humidifier sterilizer said Saturday he will file a compensation suit against the British company later this month. Kim had gone to the U.K. headquarters last week to urge CEO Rakesh Kapoor to visit Seoul and officially apologizeHe said he decided to file the damage suit after the CEO refused his demand to visit South Korea to make an apology in front of the sterilizer’s victims. His 5-year-old son died in 2009 due to a respiratory disease.The company, however, said in its press release that the CEO had sincerely apologized to them.“Mr. Kapoor repeated his heartfelt apology to all those victims who used Oxy HS products in Korea and extends his apology to all victims. He confirmed his commitment to a full resolution announced by Ata Safdar in Korea last week,” the company said.By Lee Hyun-jeong","saenuri party decided sunday ,after the prosecutorial probe ,party decided sunday ,party decided sunday to ,sunday to push for",['Saenuri Party'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63119817  0.42095527

A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than 100 people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.""I offer my heartfelt apology on behalf of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser... I also represent headquarters in the UK,"" Ata Safdar, CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, said during a press conference in Seoul, bowing in front of cameras. ""We will make every effort to assure the victims have necessary support and fair compensation.""It is the first time since the release of Oxy's sterilizer 15 years ago that the company has made an apology.The CEO's admittance of responsibility in public came after its April 21 email apology denying its culpability in the case sparked a strong backlash from victims of the families.Following the creation of a 5 billion won  ""humanitarian fund"" in 2014, Oxy Reckitt Benckiser said it will additionally spend 5 billion won to help compensate the victims.The Oxy official also proposed other makers of questionable disinfectant put concerted efforts to compensate victims. Lotte Mart and Homeplus, two of South Korea's biggest discount chains, also made and sold similar products.The problematic products were withdrawn from the local market in 2011. Prosecutors have expanded their investigation into the Korean unit, summoning former Korean CEO Shin Hyun-woo and two other senior officials last week. The focus of the investigation will be on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Safdar said his company will fully cooperate with South Korean authorities and conduct its own investigation to ""get to the bottom of the case and hold those accountable.""The latest move comes as the boycott of the British firm's products has gained steam among retailers, pharmacists and consumers. Hundreds of victims also plan to lodge a collective suit against the company later this month.The snowballing case has also come under the radar of President Park Geun-hye, who urged prosecutors to thoroughly investigate the case. The repeated apology, however, was not enough to solace those who have long suffered from unidentified diseases.Jung Mi-ae accompanied her 14-year-old son, who is undersized, wheelchair-bound and wore a nasal cannula connected to a green oxygen tank to aid his breathing. ""Do you think you can compensate my son's pain and suffering?,""the 40-year-old from Yongin, south of Seoul, said. ""My son has never been able to attend school because of his health condition.""""Why didn't you apologize in the first place? You are too late!,"" an angry father shouted, pointing his finger at him. Safdar begged the victims' families to accept his apology. ""I'm so sorry. I'm a father of three sons and I understand how you feel."" Another mother, full of tears, responded, ""No, you don't understand. My son died.""Later on Monday, the representatives for the victims filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office seeking an investigation into eight board members of the British firm Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, including its chief executive officer Rakesh Kapoor.The headquarters in Britain is responsible for not conducting due safety checks since the product was first sold in 2001, they said in a press conference held in front of the prosecutors' office in southern Seoul.","ceo offers formal apology ,four pregnant women died ,worst scandals involving consumer ,pregnant women died ,the worst scandals involving","['Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'korean', 'british']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48481727  0.46621034

Park Joon-young of the People’s Party, who served as governor of South Jeolla Province, denied the charges before entering the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office in southwestern Seoul. “I did not receive the money. There must be a misunderstanding,” the 69-year-old told reporters at the scene. “It is a shame that the situation turned out this way. I apologize to my supporters.” Park Joon-young appears for questioning at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul on Monday. Park said, adding that he would cooperate with the investigation. Park is suspected of accepting hundreds of thousands of won in illicit campaign funds on multiple occasions from a secretary-general of a small political party, identified only by his surname Kim. Park had formerly headed the party composed of followers of the late president Kim Dae-jung before joining the People’s Party in March. Prosecutors suspect Kim of offering the funds to Park in exchange for favors in the nomination process for the People’s Party. Kim, however, was not included on the list of the party’s proportional representation candidates. Prosecutors arrested Kim and Park’s accounting manager and searched Park’s residence and office in South Jeolla Province last month. Prosecutors said they would decide whether to indict the lawmaker-elect before the 20th National Assembly opens later this month.Later in the day, Ahn Cheol-soo, cochairman of the People’s Party said that he would respond to Park’s case in accordance with the party’s principles and rules.

149,149,Suspicions grow over ultraconservative rallies,"Amid snowballing suspicions over the government’s alleged involvement in pro-government rallies by a right-wing organization, President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday loosely denied her office’s ties with the group. “I was briefed that it was not true that (a Cheong Wa Dae official was behind the right-wing group’s rallies),” she said in a meeting with editors in chief held at the presidential office.Questions have be...","Amid snowballing suspicions over the government’s alleged involvement in pro-government rallies by a right-wing organization, President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday loosely denied her office’s ties with the group. “I was briefed that it was not true that ,” she said in a meeting with editors in chief held at the presidential office.Questions have been thrown around in recent days upon news reports that Cheong Wa Dae and a business lobby group were allegedly behind the ultraconservative group the Korea Parent Federation, with progressive civic groups demanding prosecutors investigate the case.Asked what she thought about the right-wing group’s pro-government activities, Park said that it was “inappropriate” for the president to publicly offer opinions on civic groups’ activities, as they all pursued their own values.The Korea Parent Federation -- a nongovernmental group of conservative senior citizens -- has been actively holding rallies since 2014 in favor of controversial government policies. They include the reinstatement of state-authored history textbooks for secondary school students, the comfort women deal struck between South Korea and Japan and passage of labor market reform bills and an antiterrorism bill. The radically conservative group has also stirred the pot by staging rallies against the families of victims of the Sewol ferry disaster, blasting them for politicizing the Sewol ferry issue and being North Korean sympathizers.According to local news reports and legal industry sources, the group had received about 520 million won  from the Federation of Korean Industries to orchestrate pro-government rallies between 2012 and 2014.Members of the Korea Parent Federation collide with activists participating in a regular rally held in front of the comfort women statue in Seoul on Jan. 6. The FKI -- a private interest group representing the nation’s big businesses like Samsung and LG -- wired the money to the parents’ group through a bank account under the name of the now-defunct Bethel Missionary Foundation, the report claimed. The missionary group is thought to be a “paper company” to funnel the money. The FKI has remained silent, refusing to confirm whether it provided funds to the parents’ group. Part of the money was allegedly spent on giving 1,259 North Korean defectors 20,000 won each to participate in some 39 rallies held by the group, weekly magazine Sisa Journal reported last week.It also suggested that Heo Hyun-joon, a low-ranking official at Cheong Wa Dae, had asked the secretary general of the KPF to hold a demonstration in support of President Park’s settlement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the wartime sexual enslavement last year. Cheong Wa Dae repeatedly denied its alleged meddling in hosting such pro-government rallies by the parents’ group. Heo sought a court injunction Friday to ban the sale of the weekly magazine and filed a complaint against Sisa Journal and its reporter demanding compensation. He also asked the Press Arbitration Commission correct the reports.   The National Intelligence Service is also suspected of influencing the right-wing group to sway public opinion in favor of President Park during the 2012 presidential election. Prosecutors on Monday argued at the trial of the former chief of the spy agency that an NIS official gave instructions to the parents’ group. Choo Sun-hee, secretary-general of the KRP, recently made comments indicating a potential link to the government, saying he had exchanged text messages and phone calls with the Cheong Wa Dae official in regards to the demonstration. He also said the group had received funds “indirectly” from the FKI through the missionary foundation. He claimed money was mostly used to feed the elderly and North Korean refugees. But he denied their activities had any political ambition or motivation.“What we have done was for this country. We will not sit back and bear any acts denouncing our motive. We have fought hard to protect the nation’s identity and freedom,” Choo said in a press briefing Friday in its office in central Seoul. “We will take stern action against the press trying to annihilate us. ... We don’t take orders from anyone and we do only the things we would like to do.” Since the press conference, Choo has stayed out of the public eye. The KPF planned to hold a rally in front of local broadcaster JTBC’s building in Seoul on Monday, but that was canceled without prior notice. The Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice and an association of seven students’ groups recently stepped up calls for the prosecution to investigate the suspicions surrounding the alleged state and conglomerate-sponsored rallies, filing a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. “The public is outraged by ugly connections among Cheong Wa Dae’s order, the FKI’s funds and the KPF’s demonstration,” the students’ group said Friday in front of the prosecutors’ office. “The government has a duty to investigate the case and the FKI should reveal its bank statements on funding the parents’ group.” By Ock Hyun-ju","in pro government rallies ,ultraconservative rallies amid snowballing ,denied her office ties ,rallies amid snowballing suspicions ,pro government rallies",['Park Geun'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38587579  0.35693806

By law, she cannot seek re-election. ""I once again want to thank the people of Nowon,"" Ahn said, saying that he will pay back by improving livelihoods and seeing better politics.The party also grabbed a total of 38 seats, far more than 20 which allows the party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc.Meanwhile, it was a total defeat for Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, although he managed to obtain his sixth parliamentary seat by beating Kim Bi-oh of the Minjoo Party in the southern port city of Busan.The Saenuri Party vowed to win a parliamentary majority, but it has to settle for just 122 seats, after it has suffered a blow due to an internal feud over the candidate nomination process.The party's victory would have been a boon for Kim's presidential chances, but its defeat has raised doubts about his leadership and appeal as a presidential contender. The lawmaker, who had been at the center of controversy offered to step down as chairman on Thursday following the polls.Moreover, the latest poll showed that 12.9 percent of people supported Kim in a potential presidential race, even behind former Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon of the Saenuri Party, according to the NEC.The poll also showed 20.7 percent of people supported Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the Minjoo Party, in a potential presidential. Ahn is trailing behind with only 10 percent of support in the poll, although this may change with the election results.In Jongno district in central Seoul, Oh lost to Chung Sye-kyun of the Minjoo Party, who garnered more than 50 percent of the vote, said the NEC.""I will take the time of self-reflection and deeply examine myself,"" said Oh, noting that the voters are still angry at him for giving up his mayorship years ago.Meanwhile, Chung, who will take his sixth parliamentary seat, newly emerged as a new potential presidential hopeful from the liberal bloc by defeating Oh in Jongno, which is considered one of the most crucial electorates in Seoul.As for Moon, it is neither a victory nor a failure.The party successfully grabbed 123 seats, much higher than its initial goal and even managed to take three districts of wealthy Gangnam in southern Seoul, a traditional stronghold for the ruling party.However, the party was able to take victory in only three out of 28 electorates in Honam, referring to the southwestern region that has traditionally been a bastion of support for liberal parties like Minjoo.The People's Party, on the other hand, took a sweeping victory in the region by taking 23 Honam seats.Moreover, Moon earlier promised that he will retire from politics and not participate in the presidential elections if the party losses support from its home turf of the Honam.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of Minjoo, secured his fifth parliamentary term by taking the second spot in the liberal party's 47-member proportional representative seat lineup.Of 300 lawmakers, with 253 of them to be selected through direct elections and the remaining 47 proportional representation seats to be allocated to parties according to the numbers of votes that they receive overall.Kim is the first lawmaker to be elected five times on a proportional ticket.Among the distinguishable winners is Suh Chung-won, who managed to obtain his eighth parliamentary seat after taking the victory in an electorate in Hwaseong, just south of Seoul.Suh is most likely to be elected a new parliamentary speaker, succeeding National Assembly Speaker Chung Eui-hwa.Meanwhile, a number of political heavyweights from both the ruling and opposition parties failed to enter the 20th National Assembly.Rep. Rhee In-je, a senior member of the Saenuri party and a six-term lawmaker, lost to Kim Jong-min of the Minjoo Party in a closely contested race in the Nonsan electorate in the central region of South Chungcheong Province. Veteran lawmaker Rep.

It also immediately blocked entrances at the basement floor of the Seoul Government Complex in central Seoul that are connected to subway line No. 3 Gyeongbokgung Station, and will increase nighttime patrols.Public officials line up to enter the Seoul Government Complex in downtown Seoul on Thursday as security checks were fortified upon the recent break-in case. Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald The move followed a break-in by a 26-year-old candidate for civil service exam, identified by his surname Song, who sneaked into the Seoul Government Complex to change his test results that had been saved on a computer in the Ministry of Personnel Management office. Song appears to have sneaked into the building four more times at night from March 5 to 26, according to authorities. He was arrested on Wednesday. He was reportedly desperate to get a job of public servant’s Grade 7 position.According to the police, Song stole three public official’s ID cards from gym lockers on the first floor of the government complex. He then went up to the 16th floor where the Ministry of Personnel Management is located, entered the office using a password, hacked into the computer of the official who manages test results and added his name on the list to make him eligible for the next round of tests. Song reportedly said passwords to open the office door were written on a wall -- apparently used by cleaners and security guards.The National Police Agency is investigating, as software for computer hacking and password removal were found in Song’s personal computer at home in Jejudo, where he studies at a university. Police said they are not sure whether he had an inside accomplice.“We feel grave responsibility that the government complex was breached during a terror alert period,” said Kim Sung-lyul, deputy minister of the Ministry of the Interior, in a statement.“The ministry will roll out and implement renovated security regulations at all government complexes by May, from steps to strengthen discipline to giving out security education to all officials,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","vowed thursday to overhaul ,the government vowed thursday ,government vowed thursday ,thursday to overhaul the ,government vowed thursday to",['the Interior Ministry'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40176117  0.45207241

That makes me feel a sense of responsibility about my decision on whether to leave the office,” he said.  The leader pledged to overhaul the party that has been marred by factional strife. He warned against party dissenters who he viewed as an obstacle to the party winning the parliamentary and presidential elections. Kim’s decision came after the party’s former leader and other key figures pleaded with Kim to stay in the feud-ridden party and bring it to election victory. The party leadership apologized to the interim leader for “angering” him. Kim had contended that he had taken the helm to “salvage” the beleaguered party. The Minjoo Party of Korea chairman Kim Chong-in receives questions from reporters at the National Assembly. YonhapThe feud left Kim with enhanced authority to steer the party into the post elections. The party leadership endorsed the nomination list that assigns him the No.2 slot for the seats elected through proportional representation. “The designation  shows the strong determination that Kim will spearhead the election campaign as the face of our party and bring us to the victory,” said Minjoo Party’s spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-soo. The leader described the nomination of himself as an “an inevitable choice” to lead the party after the elections. Although Kim’s recommendation for the first spot -- math professor Park Kyung-mi -- made it into the final version, most of his other choices for the proportional candidates were either excluded or placed down the list. Instead, figures recommended by the former leader Rep. Moon Jae-in managed to be included near the top of the list.The Minjoo Party had suffered days of tug of war between the interim leader and the hawkish wing of the party, which had protested his decision to exclude them from the nomination and place his choices near the top of the party’s choices for proportional representations. The leader had responded by threatening to resign, prompting former party chairman Moon Jae-in to visit his home to persuade him to stay. Other members of the party’s leadership had offered to resign in exchange.By Yeo Jun-suk","april elections allowing the ,opposition chief quells dissenters ,left before the elections ,april elections allowing ,the april elections allowing","['Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim', 'the National Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38000005  0.29918292

YonhapWhile Kim refused to attend the day’s scheduled party meetings, the party decided to push Kim back to No. 14.The issue also rekindled the underlying conflict between the high-handed Kim and conventional party members.  While the majority of the leadership described the “self-nomination” as a selfish and inappropriate abuse of authority, Kim lashed back at what he saw as the party’s persisting factional exclusivism and slandering against him.“I will not tolerate their insults, the way they make it look as if I had applied for the proportional representative seat for personal greed,” an infuriated Kim told reporters while leaving his home for his private office downtown instead of heading to the party’s headquarters.“I have no intention of working for a party which treats me in such a  manner.”In protest against the growing criticism, Kim refused to show up at the party’s emergency committee and central committee meetings. As interim chief, Kim had the exclusive right to name up to three proportional nominees and it was based on this that he announced his own name.Under the proportional representation system, which allocates non-regional parliamentary seats to each party depending on its total approval rate, the No. 2 position was sure to guarantee Kim a seat in the 20th National Assembly.The leadership, however, readjusted his ranking to No. 14, meaning that his spot in the National Assembly depends on the party’s performance in the April general elections.The system is often used to provide parliamentary status to a party leader or potential presidential candidate ahead of elections, but high-priority numbers are usually allocated to the party’s underdogs.The mainstream response within the party was that Kim should either step back and yield the position to political rookies or symbolic figures, or at least slide down to a lower number -- both of which Kim refused to accept.“I do not cling , but in order to pull the party together, it is crucial that I hold a representative seat ,” he said.“Why does it matter that I was listed as No. 2 or any other number on the list?”The interim chief, however, did not offer a detailed explanation as to why he should be listed above other candidates.“Kim is not the kind of man to refrain from exercising his power,” Cho Kuk, professor at Seoul National University Law School, wrote on his social media account Sunday.“He was invited in as administrator, but has now positioned himself as an unchallenged monarch.”In addition, there were other complaints over the rest of the proportional representative list. Among the disputed members were a professor who allegedly plagiarized a paper and a former Air Force chief suspected of influence peddling over his son’s military service.“The list is totally in discord with our political identity,” said Rep. Kim Hyun-mee, a former top aide to the late President Roh Moo-hyun.“Where are the socially disadvantaged, agricultural representatives, and all those we are set to speak out for?”The Minjoo Party’s platform states that youth and labor representatives, as well as those who have worked in disadvantageous regions, should be listed as priority when selecting proportional representation nominees.Former party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, who resigned from his post earlier this year to give way to Kim, has refrained from commenting on the issue.By Bae Hyun-jung","election sparked backlash against ,general election sparked backlash ,opposition chief boycotts post ,backlash against the party ,election sparked backlash","['the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59420544 -0.10808457

Lee Hahn-koo, head of the party's nomination committee, for abusing the power to make unilateral choices in favor of the pro-Park faction. Lee and his supporters shot back and said the party's chairman is over-stepping his authority and fueling factional infighting.A number of lawmakers opposed to the pro-Park faction, including heavyweight Lee Jae-oh and Yim Tae-hee, a former two-term lawmaker, have failed to receive the party ticket.","health minister announced thursday ,minister quits ruling party ,next month parliamentary elections ,health minister quits ruling ,ex health minister quits","['Chin Young', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chin', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Chin']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.90447479  0.25485346

YonhapIt is the opposition’s complaint that the president’s moves may constitute a breach of Clause 9 of the Public Election Act, which forbids all public officials from exerting influence on elections.Cheong Wa Dae, in response to rising criticism, repeatedly asserted that the president’s regional city trips were to encourage the creative economy, short of any political implication.This was the third of such visits, following her earlier trip to the Daegu center last Thursday and to the Daejeon center on Feb. 25, marking three years in the presidential office for Park.While in Busan, the president attended the first anniversary celebration of the Busan Center for Creative Economy and Innovation, one of the 17 branches nationwide.Park also stopped by a marine product processing complex to look into the value-adding project of the local fisheries industry and a senior welfare center to check on the efficacy of government policies for senior citizens.Park’s earlier presence in her home city Daegu coincided with the Saenuri Party’s feud-ridden candidate nomination for the April race.Earlier this week, following Park’s Daegu schedule, the party announced its choice of candidates for the Daegu and North Gyeongsang regions.The results, which mostly turned out to be unfavorable for those in conflict with President Park, led to mumblings that each candidate’s electoral luck depended entirely on his or her intimacy with Cheong Wa Dae.Conspicuous among the dropouts were those considered close aides to Rep. Yoo Seong-min, the third-termer in Daegu who stepped down from his post as party floor leader last July amid outright clashes with the president.Rep. Yoo, who was once considered a key pro-Park aide, lost the president’s favor over recent years after he stood against her welfare policies and led negotiations with the main opposition party to pass a parliamentary revision bill.“This most undemocratic candidate nomination clearly carries a tone of retaliation,” said Rep. Cho Hae-jin, who has been denied the chance to run in his incumbent constituency in South Gyeongsang Province.In contrast, former high-ranking government officials managed to survive the nomination battle with relative ease.Former Interior Minister Chong Jong-sup and former chief for government policy coordination Choo Kyung-ho, with whom the president exchanged a friendly greeting during her Daegu trip, won their unrivaled candidacy to run in the city.Meanwhile, the ruling party has yet to make its final decision on Rep. Yoo himself.“Rep. Yoo’s issue requires much political consideration,” said the party’s nomination chief Rep. Lee Hahn-koo on Wednesday, suggesting the putting off of judgment.It wasn’t just Rep. Yoo’s group that cried foul at the party’s nomination.Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who has long stood at odds with the pro-Park group, blamed the nomination committee for its arbitrary selection of candidates.“It is a serious problem that competent current lawmakers should be ruled out without a decent reason,” Kim said.He thus called for a reappraisal for Reps. Joo Ho-young and Lee Jae-oh, both non-Park figures who were denied candidacy.By Bae Hyun-jung","pre election visits president ,election visits president park ,controversy over the president ,election visits president ,controversy with pre election","['Park Geun - hye', 'Busan']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.498759    0.3957476

Seoul's spy agency said the party event is expected to be held on May 7.""The North is likely to make provocations between late April and early May,"" Chung said, adding that it is more likely to conduct the fifth nuke test.Others like Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that the North may launch an intermediate-range missile right before the party congress, rather than choose another nuclear test.""It won't be easy for the North to carry out another nuke test as I think that Pyongyang would want to reserve it as a bargaining chip for possible talks with a new U.S. government,"" Yang said.But experts also said that if the North does not make high-profile provocations before the party event, it may try to utilize its nuclear weapons as a card for dialogue.The North detonated three nuclear devices in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and followed with a fourth test in January.","conduct another nuclear test ,party event in may ,provocations experts said wednesday ,party congress in may ,may conduct another nuclear","['North Korea', 'North Korea', 'United Nations Security Council']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38512573  0.80203372

Current military rules stipulate that soldiers insulting a superior can be punished by up to three years in jail. This is heavier than similar charges for civilians, which can be punished by up to one year in jail or a fine of 2 million won .He had claimed that the concept of “superior” was ambiguous and too broad, and that it excessively breaches the freedom of speech.The court, however, ruled that the president is his superior with the right to command.“The Constitution clearly stipulates that the president is the commander-in-chief, and the military commanding law also specifies that the president and soldiers are in a relationship of command and obedience,” the verdict said. The court also recognized the necessity of a separate penalty rule for soldiers, noting: “In criminal cases, the punishment is impossible once the complaint is withdrawn.  this can lead to indiscipline risk for the military command system, thereby putting national safety at risk.”The two dissenting judges said the regulation breaches the freedom of speech, as the scope of “insulting” in the rule is too comprehensive and, therefore, limits the chances to fairly settle community problems.

The National Election Commission has been pressed for time to revise the map for electoral districts as April 13, the day of the general elections, is approaching.After wrangling over the issue for months, the rival parties reached a deal on the remapping last week. The election agency then ironed out the details and sent the new map to the National Assembly for approval earlier in the day.Under the remapping, Seoul has one more parliamentary seat and the increasingly populous Gyeonggi Province has eight more slots.Incheon and two other regional cities each have one additional seat.Five seats were withdrawn from the Gangwon, Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces. The total number of parliamentary seats will remain unchanged at 300 after the rival parties agreed to replace five proportional representation seats with elected ones.The previous electoral map became invalid at the end of 2015 after the Constitutional Court said the former map does not properly represent the distribution of local populations.The delay has crippled pre-election campaigns and candidate registry with the parliamentary elections only 45 days away as of Sunday.The National Assembly plans to pass the bill through a subcommittee that deals with administrative affairs and also through a plenary assembly on Monday.But the prospect of the bill's early passage is murky because the main opposition Minjoo Party is filibustering against the ruling Saenuri Party's one-sided attempt to pass the anti-terrorism bill, which the opposition bloc denounces as detrimental to citizens' privacy rights.","election body sends new ,submitted redrawn electoral map ,the parliament approval sunday ,sends new electoral map ,election agency submitted redrawn",['the National Election Commission'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73659939  0.00423176

Under the bill, provision two of the article nine, the NIS will be capable of tapping into phone conversations as well.   The opposition has demanded that the article be taken out of the law, citing possible power abuse by the NIS to suppress political dissidents.   To persuade the opposition, the Saenuri made some changes in the bill, requiring the NIS to report to the Prime Minister's Office before or after it exercises its power of pursuit.    The revision also stipulates that the anti-terrorism center have one human rights official to monitor for possible breach of such rights during the process of pursuit.    The Minjoo Party, however, disapproves of the revised bill and insists that Article 9 be discarded while the Saenuri says taking out Article 9 neutralizes the anti-terror capabilities intended by the law.  Technically, the opposition lawmakers can continue the delaying tactics until March 22, when the session is scheduled to wrap up.   Political analysts, however, say that the filibuster is likely to end on Friday when the rival parties agree to put an electoral map for April's general elections to a vote.   If the anti-terrorism bill were put to a vote following the end of filibuster, it is most likely to pass as the Saenuri controls 157 seats in the 293-member National Assembly.","opposition lawmakers staged marathon ,vote late tuesday ,for vote late tuesday ,lawmakers staged marathon filibuster ,floor for vote late",['Minjoo Party'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33507818  0.0499728

Rep. Eun Soo-mi of the Minjoo Party began giving her address before a largely empty National Assembly at 2:30 a.m. and got off the podium at 12:48 p.m., replacing the record set more than 40 years ago. The previous record was set by Park Han-sang in 1969, a then-opposition lawmaker, who gave a 10 hour and 15 minute address against the constitutional amendment drive by the Park Chung-hee government.On the podium Eun reiterated the opposition's concerns over a potential abuse of power by the National Intelligence Service , South Korea's top spy agency.""I feel pain in many parts of my body including the back and legs,"" Eun told reporters after her filibuster. The first-term lawmaker said she tried to make her points clear why the anti-terrorism law entailed problems during her address.The filibuster rule allows a lawmaker to speak endlessly in order to delay a bill.The filibuster session by the Minjoo Party followed National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa's decision a day before to take the bill to the floor for a vote by invoking his authority. The anti-terrorism law has been stalled for more than a decade. Since the first draft was filed with the National Assembly following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 to effectively combat terrorism, no major progress has been made. The bill's passage has gained urgency following North Korea's nuclear test and long-range rocket launch early this year. Under the bill, an anti-terrorism center will be set up under the Prime Minister's Office, but the NIS will have the power to gather the relevant information on possible terrorists and attacks. President Park Geun-hye criticized the Minjoo's attempt to derail the pending bill and asked whether the opposition will pass it only after people suffer through terrorist attacks.  ""I think we are witnessing a nonsense situation not seen in any other countries,"" lamented Park of the ongoing gridlock. The ruling Saenuri Party slammed the Minjoo Party for its filibuster to thwart the bill's passage and urged it to end the ongoing discussion on the floor. ""The opposition's filibuster to block the anti-terrorism law at a time of heightened tensions is an act of terror against the safety of the people,"" said Saenuri floor leader Won Yoo-chul during a party meeting. Won also called on the opposition to act in a bipartisan manner to ensure national security by voting on the long-stalled law.Calls among ruling party lawmakers for the bill's swift passage have become more acute after North Korea threatened to strike Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office, on Tuesday night in its usual harsh rhetoric. While the rival parties continue to lock horns over the contentious bill, police arrested two civic activists on charges of violating the law on assembly and demonstration Wednesday. The police said the two, identified only by their surnames Kim and Yoon, picketed and chanted in protest of the law in front of the National Assembly at around 3:15 a.m. The two were released hours later after questioning.","opposition lawmaker breaks record ,korean history wednesday delivering ,longest filibuster in korean ,in korean history wednesday ,record for longest filibuster","['korean', 'Eun Soo - mi', 'the Minjoo Party', 'National Assembly']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20037422  0.65474033

Kim Kwang-jin of The Minjoo Party of Korea stole the limelight, cracking the record for the longest filibuster, going five hours and 32 minutes. At 34, the 19th National Assembly’s youngest member took the podium at around 7:07 p.m., criticizing the bill at length before stepping down at 12:39 a.m. Until then, the title had been held by late President Kim Dae-jung, who laid out a speech for five hours and 19 minutes in 1964.Though Rep. Kim’s mark was soon topped by lawmaker Rep. Eun Soo-mi, also of the main opposition party, who managed to speak for 10 hours and 18 minutes until 12:48 p.m., Kim Kwang-jin was credited as the first microphone holder and for his calm and poised manner.  Rep. Kim Kwang-jin filibusters at the National Assembly on Tuesday. He spent a great deal of time highlighting the public’s widespread mistrust of the bill that the opposition believes is aimed at enforcing the surveillance power of the National Intelligence Service, while reading the entire 15-page text of the state antiterrorism activity guidance. The bill is designed to enable the NIS to collect private communications and financial transactions of potential terrorists.When his pace quickened at times, some Minjoo Party colleagues chanted, “Take it slow, take it slow!” But Kim insisted on carrying on. When deputy speaker Rep. Lee Seok-hyun asked after four hours if he was okay and wanted to turn over to the next speaker. “Many Koreans still harbor distrust of the NIS,” Kim said. “Though its director and his predecessor who is now the presidential chief of staff argue that they have forgotten the word “political intervention,” the agency had not shown any self-examination nor taken internal or legal steps at all to punish those responsible for past wrongdoings and prevent a relapse.” The NIS has frequently been embroiled in political scandals, most recently last year over suspicion of using illegal surveillance software. Its former director Won Sei-hoon was indicted for involvement in an online smear campaign in favor of then-candidate President Park Geun-hye during the presidential race. He was found guilty, but the Supreme Court has sent the case back to the high court.A spate of bills have been proposed since the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. in 2001 involving measures to ward off physical and cyberterrorist acts and trail the potential perpetrators’ money trail and network. But they have never been put to a floor vote in the face of resistance by the opposition camp, which has voiced concerns that it would make way for the scandal-ridden NIS to ramp up its spying activities on civilians and political maneuvering in particular during election seasons. The currently pending bill calls for the launch of an antiterrorism center under the Prime Minister’s Office. But the NIS will be given the authority to gather information on potential terrorists and attacks.Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party have accelerated the legislative push since the surge of the Islamic State group and especially the jihadists’ brazen attacks in Paris last November and more recently Jakarta, Istanbul and elsewhere, as well as North Korea’s latest nuclear and missile tests. While most Saenuri lawmakers exited the session shortly after Kim began his speech, speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa, who invoked his authority to put the bill to a vote, listened with his eyes closed for about one hour. As of 6 p.m., Rep. Park Won-suk of the minor opposition Justice Party was continuing to filibuster after taking over for Eun, with several others awaiting their turns. The protracted debate, however, also poses risks to the opposition, giving the impression that it tends to overlook security concerns due to partisan backbiting despite growing terrorist threats. President Park Geun-hye expressed frustration at a meeting with an economic advisory panel, accusing the opposition of attempting to compromise public safety and “demand the people’s sacrifice.” By Shin Hyon-hee","vote late tuesday rep ,youngest lawmaker rises ,longest filibuster going five ,tuesday rep kim kwang ,late tuesday rep kim","['the National Assembly', 'Kim Kwang - jin', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'National Assembly ’s', 'until']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00864612  0.52024144

175,175,Partisan standoff peaks over antiterrorism bills,"A partisan standoff over the controversial counterterrorism bill continued to surge on Wednesday as opposition lawmakers scrambled to filibuster the government-led legislation that they say will undermine civil liberty by expanding intelligence agencies’ surveillance power. 　In a plenary session in which a filibuster rule was first applied since its abolishment in 1973 and reinstatement in 2012, liberal lawmakers f...","A partisan standoff over the controversial counterterrorism bill continued to surge on Wednesday as opposition lawmakers scrambled to filibuster the government-led legislation that they say will undermine civil liberty by expanding intelligence agencies’ surveillance power. In a plenary session in which a filibuster rule was first applied since its abolishment in 1973 and reinstatement in 2012, liberal lawmakers from The Minjoo Party of Korea and other minor opposition parties have taken to the podium since Tuesday evening to block the bill from reaching the floor for a vote.The move came after National Assembly speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa decided to invoke his authority to bring up the bill to a plenary vote without sending it for parliamentary committees’ approval. The speaker noted that failure to pass the bill constitutes a national crisis in which he can use his power.  Teary-eyed Rep. Eun Soo-mi of The Minjoo Party of Korea is embraced by fellow lawmakers after setting the record of delivering a speech for over 10 hours at the National Assembly on Wednesday. While the Saenuri Party asserted that the bill is crucial to prevent potential terrorism, the main opposition countered that it would grant the National Intelligence Service greater authority to collect financial statements and phone records of those who the agency views as terror suspects, without a warrant signed by the court.“The filibuster is our last card in fighting the tyranny of majority by the ruling party,” said the Minjoo Party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul, indicating the fact that the majority Saenuri Party, who holds 157 seats in the 293-strong Assembly, fall 19 seats short of the 176 threshold to break a filibuster. According to the Assembly law, a filibuster can be shut off only when there is approval from three-fifths of the lawmakers attending the session, when there are no lawmakers applying for the filibuster, or when the plenary session ends on March 11 – after which the bill is required to be put to a vote in the next session. With all of Minjoo Party’s lawmakers, totaling 108, having pledged to join the filibuster, the standoff is likely to continue until at least this Friday when the Saenuri and the Minjoo party hold a plenary session to pass a bill aimed at finalizing electoral rules for the April general election. “Both the ruling party and the main opposition need to pass the election bill on Friday. I think they will end the filibuster and finalize the bill,” said the Saenuri Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. “ my hands are tied. There is nothing we can do,” Kim said. Some Saenuri lawmakers dismissed their counterparts’ participation in filibustering as a political gimmick to gain an upper hand over the nomination battle in the upcoming elections. The Saenuri whip Rep. Won Yu-chul claimed the vocal lawmakers were campaigning for their next election through their filibusters. Most of the ruling party members‘ seats remain vacant as Rep. Park Won-suk of the minor Justice Party sets out as the fourth opposition member to deliver the marathon speech at the National Assembly on Wednesday. President Park Geun-hye weighed in on the legislative showdown, criticizing the opposition for delaying the bill that she said would prevent the nation from terrorism, such as those from Islamic States and North Korea, amid heightened cross-border tension following Pyongyang’s nuclear test and rocket launch.“ are unprecedented ones that no other countries have ever witnessed,” Park said on Wednesday at a meeting with economic policy makers. “ how the economy would prosper when people live in a society where terror attacks could happen,” she said. By Yeo Jun-suk","wednesday as opposition lawmakers ,lawmakers scrambled to filibuster ,controversial counterterrorism bill continued ,antiterrorism bills partisan standoff ,bills partisan standoff over",[],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55600542  0.31071284

Lee Hahn-koo, insisted on a public survey system that has been said to favor rookie politicians.The “non-Park” members led by party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, saw this rule not only as an unfair swipe at incumbent lawmakers, but also as an attempt of the “pro-Park” faction to corner key constituencies.“As a party leader, I have the duty to deter the nomination committee from deviating from basic regulations of the party,” said Rep. Kim at the Supreme Council meeting Thursday.“I will not tolerate a nomination system that favors some and cuts off others.”Rep. Suh Chung-won, speaking for the pro-president group, immediately rebuked Kim for making “inappropriate” comments in public.“Such comments  are precisely what we should not tolerate,” he said.While the meeting turned into a verbal duel, Rep. Kim Tae-ho blamed both sides for losing dignity in front of people and left the room.The Saenuri bigwigs have been playing tug-of-war with the nomination process, most recently shaken up by the nomination committee chief Lee’s recent nomination system. Saenuri chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung attends a plenary session at the National Assembly on Thursday. Lee had said Tuesday that the committee would designate one to three priority constituencies in each of the 17 metropolitan cities and provinces.According to the plan, should multiple aspirants in the given district fail to reach an agreement, there would be a public survey, short of a vote by party members.This open survey system is seen to favor rookie candidates, especially those with a high media profile, such as former Interior Minister Chong Jong-sup and former chief presidential press secretary Yoon Doo-hyun.Incumbent lawmakers have been favoring a mixed system, combining 70 percent of the public survey with a 30 percent party members’ vote.“ is not about a factional dispute, but a conflict between those who wish to implement reforms and those who prefer to defend vested interests,” Lee said at the committee meeting held after the Supreme Council.As of Wednesday, a total of 822 party members had filed for the party’s nomination.

184,184,Seoul sets out to revamp veterans group,The Seoul government is seeking to overhaul the country’s largest veterans group by strengthening its control and authority over the leadership and the management following a series of corruption scandals involving its former chief.The Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs on Tuesday unveiled measures to reform the Korean Veterans Association that has been foundering since the arrest of then-chairman Cho Nam-poon...,"The Seoul government is seeking to overhaul the country’s largest veterans group by strengthening its control and authority over the leadership and the management following a series of corruption scandals involving its former chief.The Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs on Tuesday unveiled measures to reform the Korean Veterans Association that has been foundering since the arrest of then-chairman Cho Nam-poong last November. The 78-year-old retired four-star Army general has been indicted on charges of taking more than 500 million won  in bribes for peddling influence in appointing heads of affiliates and facilitating exchange programs with a Chinese vet group, among other charges. The association held an extraordinary general meeting on Jan. 13 to approve his dismissal. Under the plan, the ministry will push for legislation that allows it to sack or suspend the organization’s future heads, separate revenue-making projects from its operations and revise the existing election customs that require chairperson candidates to deposit 50 million won and let them bribe voters. Cho was also found to have doled out some 1 billion won to around 200 electors during his campaign.To that end, the ministry is set to launch an emergency planning committee on Thursday, which will be led by the vice minister and some 15 internal and external legal, accounting, management and military experts and advisors. “Our task going forward is to craft steps to address the controversy over the profit activities and personnel management and establish an election scheme that could tackle the issues that were brought up in the run up to and after Cho’s win. We will also reinforce our supervisory authority with which we had until now been unable to do anything, even if there was a problem with the association,” Vice Minister Choi Wan-geun said at a news conference. “Though some people have been calling for an early vote for the next chairman, we think that in order to put the organization back on track, reform measures must come first.”  Members of the Korean Veterans Association attend a general assembly on Jan. 13 during which they voted in favor of ousting corruption-ridden chairman Cho Nam-poong, the first such case in the organization's history. YonhapAfter a string of irregularity allegations surfaced over Cho, the ministry sought last year to stop his term and urged his resignation. Besides the formal charges, he is accused of causing the entity’s debt to snowball to nearly 600 billion won. Yet the unfazed chairman defied the demands, continuing to flaunt his power and undertake lavish, unfocused overseas business trips even as a parliamentary audit was just around the corner in September.Though the chairman post is unpaid and largely honorary, it has enticed many retired generals and other military and defense industry officials who set their sights on the dozen affiliates running funeral services and other revenue earning businesses under its command. As a result, the race often triggers overheated campaigns overrun with unqualified nominees, and a host of officials have been embroiled in corruption scandals. Since Cho's removal, the fraternity of veterans has formed a group tasked with its “normalization” and vowed to formulate measures to improve the election system for its part, but continues to be reeling from in-house power struggles. “The envisaged plan is primarily aimed at blocking the leadership from abusing power,” a ministry official said. “As a supervisory institution, we think that the association cannot be normalized without fundamental refurbishment.” By Shin Hyon-hee","reform the korean veterans ,veteran affairs on tuesday ,to revamp veterans group ,series of corruption scandals ,foundering since the arrest","['Seoul', 'the Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs', 'the Korean Veterans Association', 'Cho Nam']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47739741  0.23168227

FKTU chairman Kim Dong-man speaks at a news conference on Tuesday. Yonhap“The government and the ruling party have trampled on the Sept. 15 trilateral agreement, making it null,” FKTU chairman Kim Dong-man said in a press conference.“We will henceforth renounce all efforts of negotiation and boycott the tripartite committee meeting.”With the FKTU’s declaration, the confrontation surrounding the labor-related bills is expected to escalate as the presidential office and the ruling party brace for an all-out war against the labor unions and the opposition camp.The Sept. 15 deal, or the “grand compromise,” refers to the trilateral deal signed last year by the labor, management and government representatives to come up with long-term measures to improve the nation’s labor market. They include allowing companies to change employment guidelines and adopting a “peak wage” system upon further consultation. Despite the epochal agreement, follow-up consultations have not run smoothly, with the labor side delaying discussion and the government unilaterally releasing measures.The union chairman pledged to file an injunction or an unconstitutionality suit against the government’s labor guidelines and to conduct campaigns against ruling party candidates in the upcoming April parliamentary elections.The union will thus join the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a more progressive labor organization which has all along been protesting against the disputed labor bills.“The FKTU, by announcing its withdrawal from the trilateral deal, has declared to fight back the government’s retrogressive labor policies,” said KCTU spokesperson Park Seong-sik.“It seems that the two unions may possibly join forces and form a solidarity.”At the face of the disintegration of the three-way agreement, President Park Geun-hye reiterated her calls for the passage of the controversial labor bills.“Companies, whether conglomerates or small and medium-sized enterprises, have repeatedly appealed for the passage of the pending bills, but the National Assembly has neglected their needs,” Park said at the Cabinet meeting.She thereby urged the nation to participate in a petition campaign led by economic organizations, which she referred to as a last resort to save the economy and boost employment.“Would these businessmen and people have rushed out to the streets on this severe winter day  if not for these pressing situations?”The president joined the petition campaign Monday after receiving the annual business reports and before delivering her New Year’s greeting to the Korea Federation of SMEs. The Minjoo Party of Korea denounced the president for detouring due legislative procedure and siding with the conglomerates by joining their initiative.“The president is entitled to extensive legal power, yet Park decided to sign a petition instead of communicating and debating the issue,” said the main opposition party’s policy committee chief Rep. Rhee Mok-hee.“We hope that such a bewildering situation will not happen again during Park’s remaining two years in office.”The ruling Saenuri Party echoed the president’s comments.“The petition would never have been necessary if the National Assembly performed its role in the first place,” floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul told reporters Tuesday.“Our party, too, is to be held responsible just as much as the opposition party.”The presidential office shrugged off the opposition camp’s criticism.“Signing the petition was a gesture of participating in the people’s initiative, not an act of disregard toward the legislature,” Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk told reporters.Meanwhile, the government, the presidential house and the ruling party agreed Tuesday to make utmost efforts to pass the pending labor bills through parliament within January.“The opposition camp is deterring key economic and labor reform bills by adding unessential requests,” said Saenuri floor leader Won at the policy adjustment meeting held at the prime minister’s office.By Bae Hyun-jung","union rejects trilateral deal ,government trilateral deal ending ,trade unions said tuesday ,tuesday declared its withdrawal ,umbrella union rejects trilateral",['the Federation of Korean Trade Unions'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18135935  0.32405853

Moon Jae-in.Kim Min-young, former secretary-general of liberal civic group People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, and Oh Sung-kyu, former director of Seoul Facilities Management Corporation, both worked in Park’s camp in the 2011 by-election.  Yang Hyang-jaThe entrance of the two Park allies alluded to a mutual understanding between party chief Moon and the Seoul Mayor that the opposition camp should stand united ahead of the April parliamentary elections. Kim Min-young and Oh Sung-kyu“I hope that more good-hearted people join the party to lead reform from the inside,” Kim quoted the Seoul mayor as having said, when he conveyed in advance his upcoming party entry.So far, the Minjoo Party’s attempts to turn the game around by reshuffling have personnel has largely gained positive responses.Forensic psychologist and political debater Pyo Chang-won was the first to come to the party's rescue. The crime expert immediately caught the public’s attention with righteous image and shrewd arguments, especially over disputed issues such as the government's much-critisized deal with Japan on wartime sex slavery. Pyo Chang-wonSelf-made business figures such as video game company Webzen chairman Kim Byung-kwan and former Samsung Electronics executive Yang Hyang-ja fit in with the party’s policy to create employment opportunities. These compatible new figures not only contributed to expanding the party’s human resource pool but also brought compliments upon party chairman Moon for his good judgment and swift action.A survey by local pollster Realmeter showed Monday that the approval rating for the Minjoo Party stood at 22.5 percent in the second week of January, up 2.2 percent from the previous week.With the party’s polls on a rebounding trend, Moon is said to announce his resignation within the week, as early as Tuesday, and to hand over all power to the election committee led by economic strategist Kim Jong-in.Ahn's camp, in contrast, has remained low key over recruitment after a series of moral controversies. The People’s Party had recently announced that it will recruit five new figures including a former senior prosecutor but called off the decision within hours due to allegations that some of them were invovled in bribery charges. “We will in the future focus on thorough verification, instead of rushing into decisions,” Ahn said in apology.But as the newborn party is also pressed to mark its presence before the elections, it is also working to induce big shot figures -- such as the Minjoo Party’s former floor leader and emergency committee chief Rep. Park Young-sun.By Bae Hyun-jung","minjoo party turns crisis ,its worst ever crisis ,party turns crisis into ,main opposition minjoo party ,party turns crisis","['Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60829031 -0.01069077

Chung Sye-kyun and Noh Woong-rae, respectively.    Ahn Dae-hee “I stand here, reminding myself of how I felt as a young middle school student from Busan who had just moved to Seoul,” Ahn said at a press briefing. “Mapo was the stepping-stone for my life and will now be the new beginning for me.” Having considered running in his hometown Busan, Ahn decided to run from Mapo being persuaded by party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung. The former prime minister-designate noted Mapo was a “special place” as he attended middle school there. Oh, on the other hand, said he decided to stick to his original plan of running in Jongno with sturdy conservative votes, despite chairman Kim’s repeated offer for him to run in a constituency unpopular among conservative voters to compete with liberal bigwigs such as former main opposition leader Rep. Kim Han-gil.  Oh Se-hoon “When I returned to politics in April, I set up three principles -- contributing to the party’s election victory, refusing to seek an easy win and running for a significant place. I think Jongno is the place that best serves my principles,” said the former mayor in a press conference.Ahn’s potential rival Chung is a veteran fifth-term lawmaker and had served as chairman of the Minjoo Party’s forerunner Uri Party. Oh's prospective contender Noh is the second-term lawmaker and incumbent representative of his constituency.The election bids, meanwhile, caused a backlash from other prospective candidates Park Jin and Kang Seung-kyu, the former lawmakers who had previously been elected from Jongno and Mapo, respectively. Park and Kang are expected to challenge the two bigwigs during the in-house nomination contest. Kang’s supporters attended Ahn’s press conference, shouting protests against his decision. Kang also held his own press briefing, accusing Ahn of choosing the easy way out by running on his turf and demanding the party leadership hold a strict internal primary to pick the candidate. Park, who has been elected from Jongno three times, dismissed the former mayor’s bid as a scheme to reinforce his status as a presidential hopeful and denounced Oh for making zero contribution to the constituents. Mindful of escalating tit-for-tat among the party’s election candidates, the party leader Kim reiterated his rule on the nomination. He promised to forgo his authority to nominate the election candidates and allow voters themselves to determine the candidates.“I respect each candidate’s decision. The Saenuri Party will nominate candidates for the elections in accordance with the nomination rule and a fair and transparent competition among candidates,” said Kim in a text message sent to reporters.By Yeo Jun-suk","bigwigs announce election bids ,two political heavyweights sunday ,saenuri bigwigs announce election ,political heavyweights sunday announced ,bigwigs announce election","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'Supreme Court', 'Ahn Dae - hee', 'Seoul', 'Se - hoon', 'Seoul', 'Jongno', 'mapo', 'Minjoo Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5154947   0.485203

The size, type and location of outdoor ads had been strictly restricted prior. The revised rules have been promulgated Wednesday and will start going into effect from July, the officials said.In the ad zone, buildings will be able to be covered in wrapping ads or digital screens. The eased rules will also allow digital signage -- a new ad form that allows interaction between ads and viewers through digital technology. For example, one of the Times Square ads in New York had a perfume commercial on billboards that sprayed the perfume whenever pedestrians approached and touched the screen. While the digital technology for ads has developed for years, no digital signage has been introduced in Seoul due mainly to regulations. Pillar-shape video billboards called “Medial Poll” were once installed around Gangnam Station in 2009, but it was allowed as a type of “video installment,” not as an “outdoor digital ad.” The exact locations for the upcoming ad zone have not yet been determined. The ministry will receive applications from municipalities and screen them in the second half of the year. “Considering the light pollution, the new ad zones will likely be opened in commercial districts such as Myeong-dong or the Coex area,” the Seoul Metropolitan Government officials said. While easing billboard regulations, the government has strengthened the crackdown on illegal ads, the authorities said. Any illegal ads, such as placards or balloons placed without permission and that pose a risk of dislocating or dropping, will be removed without prior notice. Each district office will be given the authority to be in charge of the crackdown.The penalty against obscene ads will also be toughened to a sentence of two years in prison or fine of up to 20 million won . Those distributing or posting lewd ads had previously faced either a one-year jail term or a fine up to 1 million won.By Lee Hyun-jeong","week lifted ad regulations ,eased rules allow seoul ,regulations to create korean ,york city times square ,boost the ad industry","['korean', 'New York City ’s', 'the Interior Ministry']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.94187486  0.22293156

Ahn Cheol-soo reiterated Monday that his new party proposed to be launched next month would distance itself from the main opposition party, vowing to transform the decades-old two-party political system into a multiparty system.“It is an outdated mentality that the opposition must align to do well in the general elections. It seems to suggest that we should maintain the vested interests of the main two parties,” Ahn said in a radio interview with local station CBS. “We must prepare to fight squarely in a three-way format.” Ahn Cheon-sooHis remarks echoed that of former cochairman and latest Minjoo Party of Korea defector Rep. Kim Han-gil, who said Sunday, “We must tear down the hostile yet symbiotic relationship between the two parties, a political system that has run its course.”Kim is the ninth former Minjoo Party lawmaker to bolt, and he is widely expected to be followed by at least 10 more, including the party’s veteran Rep. Park Jie-won sometime this week.If at least 20 Assembly members join under Ahn before the party’s slated launch Feb. 2, the party will gain floor negotiation power ― legally wedging the party into the bipartisan landscape occupied by the conservative and progressive forces originating from Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province.This of course, is premised on the assumption that Ahn’s party will succeed in maintaining the momentum, given that in Korea’s modern political history a third force has often became an auxiliary force of the major party with a limited support base.One of the imminent challenges is approaching in the parliamentary race, where the new party must cast its lineup of candidates ― a process that has often been the pitfall of factional competition.Ahn’s provisional party, meanwhile, received mixed approval ratings in polls released Monday.A survey by pollster Realmeter of 2,135 adults nationwide on Dec. 28-31 showed that 23.6 percent were in support of the Minjoo Party, 1.2 percentage points higher than the week before. Ahn’s party received 17.3 percent, marking a decline of 1.7 percentage points. The ruling Saenuri Party scored 35.2 percent, a drop of 2 percentage points.“The so-called ‘convention effect’ that persisted for about two weeks after Ahn’s defection is slowing down. ... It also appears to reflect a lower level of attention paid toward  due to the newly created conflict between the ruling and opposition parties following the government’s Dec. 28 deal with Japan over sexual slavery,” Realmeter said in its report.The ratings for Ahn’s party are still likely to rebound when more Minjoo Party lawmakers leave this week, it said.Of the potential presidential candidates, Minjoo Party’s chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in has maintained the top spot for two consecutive weeks at 19.6 percent, followed by Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung with 18.6 percent. Ahn came in at third with 15.2 percent. Others included Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon , former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon  and former Saenuri floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min .In another survey conducted by Hankook Research on 1,000 voters nationwide on Dec. 28-29, 15.1 percent said they would vote for candidates coming from Ahn’s party in the April election, more than those who picked the Minjoo Party at 12.4 percent. Another 23.4 percent said they would vote for a Saenuri Party candidate.The Saenuri Party seized the top spots in all regions except for the Jeolla provinces, as well as among those aged 50 and over.The Minjoo Party came in after both the Saenuri Party and Ahn’s new party in all categories except for among those in their 20s and those that identified as progressives.In the survey, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the most popular presidential candidate with 21.9 percent, followed by Moon Jae-in , Kim Moo-sung , Ahn Cheol-soo  and Park Won-soon .From news reports","monday that his new ,main opposition party vowing ,his new party ,cheol soo reiterated monday ,party vowing to transform",['Ahn Cheol'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46719018  0.50675851

The Constitution has often been at the center of political discourse, especially near the end of a presidential term, since South Korea last changed it in 1987.While Cheong Wa Dae has yet to announce that it will seek to change the law anytime soon, some senior lawmakers began to float the idea that the 20-year-old law should be replaced with a new one that reflects the postdemocratization political landscape.“We could not reform politics unless we address the power structure. And the only way to change the power structure is to revise the Constitution. Through this, we should make up for the shortcomings and flaws that the current Constitution has,” said National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa last Wednesday. Lawmakers attend the last plenary session of the National Assembly of 2015 on Dec. 31. Historically, the idea of revising the Constitution to change the single five-year presidency term has been broached by opposition figures seeking to seize the next administration. Former President Kim Dae-jung, while head of the Democratic Peace Party, suggested amending the law to introduce a system similar to a run-off vote. Another political heavyweight Kim Jong-pil, the former chairman of the United Liberal Democrats, pushed for a presidential system to be amended to a cabinet system. The “DJP  union” between then-President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil from the 1997 election was also based on the premise of revising the Constitution. Each time, however, the debate was toppled by radically changing political interests.The same occurred when then-President Roh Moo-hyun proposed the “one-point revision” during his tenure of 2003-2008. He proposed to allow presidents to seek reelection, while limiting theirs terms to four years, mirroring the U.S.’ presidential terms. However, he was turned down by the opposition Grand National Party, the predecessor to the Saenuri Party.The debate was rekindled by the Lee Myung-bak administration, which also called for changes on other items such as inter-Korean relations and climate change.But his efforts fizzled and they faced backlash from opposition lawmakers who criticized the move as a political gimmick to prevent a lame duck presidency and consolidate his post-presidency power. To rule out any such political calculations, it was perceived to be most appropriate to start the talks at the beginning of an administration.Rival parties had likewise pledged to change the Constitution during the 2012 presidential election, and the parties had even agreed to set up a parliamentary body to discuss the revision, the first of its kind at the National Assembly. The pledge has yet to materialize, as politicians weigh the pros and cons.President Park Geun-hye, after having pledged on the campaign trail to pursue a constitutional amendment, dismissed the idea of constitutional reform and even rebuked ruling Saenuri party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung for suggesting the idea in 2014. Since then, the debate has been phased out.But observers forecast that 2016 will play out differently for those seeking a revision. They highlighted that the move would gain momentum, signaled by how close aides to President Park began to speak out about the need for change and outlined specified alternatives to the current single five-term presidency recently.“ found it extremely hard to stay consistent in their policy during their single five-term presidency,” said Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan in November when he served as deputy prime minister. Choi’s remark was seen as an endorsement for two-term four-year presidential limits.Rep. Hong Moon-jong, a vocal pro-Park member of the Saenuri Party, said in November that the nation should seek to change the current presidential structure into a semipresidential system, a power-sharing structure where a president manages foreign affairs and a prime minister oversees internal issues at home.Notching up the level of contention, Hong said it was “feasible” that the president and the ruling party would seek to place a politician close to President Park as the new prime minister and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as the next president when his term ends in December 2016.Cheong Wa Dae and the Saenuri Party’s mainstream lawmakers dismissed the plan as an individual opinion that came out of nowhere. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea denounced it, saying it revealed their “ulterior motive.”“I don’t think that we can change the Constitution before the 2016 general elections. If the Saenuri Party wants to amend the Constitution, it should propose the plan as part of its election pledges. Given this, I cannot help but question the intention of Hong’s remarks,” The Minjoo Party chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in said at the time.The Minjoo Party suspects that the scheme is being devised to sustain President Park’s political dominance even after her term. The party argues that Hong’s version of a semipresidential system might create a political landscape in favor of the ruling conservative party.Demographically speaking, a system where the prime minister is picked through an election who would then form the Cabinet under semipresidential rule is more likely to land a victory to the conservative party, because voters residing in the conservative southeastern constituencies outnumber those living in the opposition stronghold in the southwest.Analysts have said that the 2016 April election would determine the fate of the amendment talks. They noted that the presidential office and the ruling party would seek to change the law if they secured more than 200 seats, a mark required for the ruling party to push through the move despite the opposition of rival parties. It would only be a matter of time before Park toys with the idea as well, although she remains hesitant as a full-fledged debate on the Constitution would most likely dwarf all other pending policies and agenda items.By law, a constitutional amendment requires proposal from a president or half of lawmakers in the 300-strong National Assembly. Then, the motion needs to be approved by more than two-thirds of lawmakers. Lastly, the people must cast a vote on the amendment in a special referendum.“The only impediment to the amendment is President Park’s opposition. It means that the amendment plan will become viable when Park agrees to the constitutional change. I believe that the president would OK the plan after the elections,” Lee Cheol-hee, director of the Dumun Political Strategy Institute, wrote in a media column.The Constitution has been revised nine times since it was first promulgated in 1948. The first revision came in 1952. The revisions have often taken place when authoritarian leaders sought to extend their tenure, or the people wanted to overthrow a despotic president.By Yeo Jun-suk","soon some senior lawmakers ,presidential term since south ,constitutional reform debate resurfaces ,some senior lawmakers began ,debate over constitutional amendment","['South Korea', 'Dae']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77600712  0.27280632

The departure lowers the number of seats held by Minjoo in the 300-member parliament to 118. Eight lawmakers have left since Ahn's departure.Ahn announced his departure about a month ago following internal strife with incumbent Chairman Moon Jae-in.Ahn had called for Moon's resignation and party reform following the NPAD's crushing defeat in the parliamentary by-elections in April 2015. He left the party when negotiations with Moon over a leadership change fell through.A stream of similar desertions from the Minjoo Party is expected with some assuming more lawmakers may follow suit by the end of January.Ahn, the founder of the nation's largest anti-virus software firm Ahnlab Co., co-founded the NPAD after merging Kim's main opposition Democratic Party and his supporters.
