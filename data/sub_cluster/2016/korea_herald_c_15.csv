Chinese cities are limiting the number of cars on roads and have temporarily shut down factories to cut down pollution during a national ""red alert"" for smog. This might have been possible, as in winter, strong winds usually blow from the northwest, bringing airborne particles from mainland China. However, a respite from this seasonal phenomenon is keeping the air in South Korea clean, despite the ongoing smog problem in China, the Korea Meteorological Administration said Wednesday. “The air in most parts of the Korean Peninsula is to be clear Wednesday, with pollution levels of either ‘normal’ or ‘good,’” the weather agency said in its daily forecast. This was possible due to the absence of the typical northwesterly wind over the past few of days, it said. With rain in the forecast for the entire country later in the afternoon, the air condition, in terms of microscopic particles, will get even better Thursday, it added. “After the rain, winds will likely blow from the north, making the chance of China’s smog reaching South Korea very small,” the KMA said. By Korea Herald staff","polluted day in beijing ,korea despite worst smog ,smog in neighboring china ,china suffocating in thick ,park during heavily polluted","['China', 'South Koreans', 'Beijing', 'chinese']",15,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.34345967  0.18817055

The amount of petroleum hydrocarbons near Camp Kim close to Namyeong Station averaged 20.4 mg/L and reached up to 768.7, some 587 times higher than the government standard of 1.5 mg/L.Noksapyeong Station , Camp Kim  The readings mean the level of toxic pollutants in the groundwater has decreased by 70 percent near Noksapyeong Station and by 92 percent near Camp Kim since 2015, but it is still a lot higher than sewage laws allow.As the relocation of key military bases in central Seoul to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, is set to be completed by the end of 2017, the Seoul government has been clearing the contaminated soil since 2001. However, the source and full extent of the toxic contamination of the soil and ground water near the Yongsan base is not known, with the US military refusing to disclose the details of its cleanup efforts.The Environment Ministry carried out on-site inspections on soil and ground water in the Yongsan base on three occasions from May to August, but has declined to release its results, citing “possible diplomatic clashes.”The refusal is in line with the Status of Forces Agreement signed between Korea and the US, which defines areas of legal responsibility for the US soldiers here. According to the SOFA, the US military is only responsible for the contamination within its camp. A high court ordered on Dec. 14 that the Environment Ministry disclose its inspection result about the level of pollution inside the US military base, ruling in favor of environmental groups. The environmental civic groups have criticized the US military for dodging responsibility for the pollution and the Korean government for overlooking its citizens’ health and safety. The activists have urged the Korean government to figure out the source of the pollutants and effectively remove it to prevent the spread of the contamination. As the Korean government is covering the costs of tackling the pollution, they also have demanded the US Army pay a share of the cleanup costs.Since 1988, there have been 14 reported cases of environmental contamination involving US bases here.In 2000, the US 8th Army Command was found to have dumped untreated toxic waste into the Han River, a major source of drinking water for Seoul residents. In 2001 and 2006, oil was spilled from the US Army Garrison and Camp Kim in Yongsan, contaminating underground water systems in the neighborhood.

Kim Han-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party said Park is suspected of receiving injections, unveiling photos before and after the ferry tragedy. One photo taken in May 2014 showed Park had bruises on her face.Another lawmaker from the party claimed such injections were given even on the day of the sinking.Medical doctors close to the president and her confidante Choi Soon-sil, a key suspect in the scandal, denied they carried out such operations on the day.The witnesses present at the session included Kim Young-jae andCha Kwang-yul, who run hospitals regularly visited by Choi. Kim said the bruises seemed to be made from shots, but that hewas not responsible for them. He said he was tending to his ownprivate matter during the so-called missing seven hours, ruling outthe possibility that he provided treatments to the president onthat day.Kim Young-jae, however, said he did visit the presidentialoffice on several occasions to provide Park with skin treatments.He added former presidential doctor Lee Byung-seok introduced himto Choi.Shin Bo-ra, who formerly served as a nurse officer at thePresidential Security Service, told the committee that she was notaware of the bruises. Shin also said she only delivered mouthwashand eye drops to the president on the day of the sinking.Park was impeached last week by the National Assembly. Theopposition parties cited her failure to fulfill her constitutionalduty as president to protect the lives of the people as a majorreason for the impeachment.Of the 16 summoned figures who are presumed to hold keys to thetruth about ""the missing seven hours,"" 13 appeared before thespecial committee. Three key figures, including nurse officer ChoYeo-ok, did not show up, citing personal reasons. Cho, who currently resides in the United States, is likely toappear at the National Assembly next week, the defense ministrysaid. The panel issued orders of accompaniment for the remaining twowitnesses, both presidential officials, who are believed to be wellaware of the schedules of both Park and Choi. The order is issuedto force a suspect or witness to appear at a hearing when he or sherefuses to attend without a justifiable reason. One of the major targets during the session was Kim Sang-man,who worked as the medical advisor to the president. He was earlier investigated by the prosecutors for prescribingplacenta injections for Park under Choi's name. The former advisoralso admitted to giving medical treatments to Park even beforebeing designated as the medical advisor.The former medical advisor, however, said he did not go to thepresidential office on the day of the sinking.Kim Sang-man added Choi asked him to issue her a prescriptionto counter panic disorders before the confidante returned home fromGermany for investigation. The committee said the request was madein an apparent bid to avoid the prosecutors' probe.The committee said it will conduct an on-site investigationinto the presidential security office on Friday.The presidential office, however, rejected the plan, citingconcerns about the possible leak of confidential information.During the two previous sessions last week, the parliamentcommittee questioned business tycoons and Park's confidante ChoiSoon-sil's key acquaintances.The committee will hold a fourth inquiry session on Thursdayfocusing on Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra. The former member of thenational equestrian team was accused of receiving unlawful favorsfrom her high school and university under her mother's influence. Chung Yun-hoi, Park's former secretary and ex-husband of Choi,was also summoned for questioning, although he did not yet expressan intention to show up for the session.","disaster south korean lawmakers ,ferry disaster in 2014 ,lawmakers grilled former presidential ,day of parliamentary corruption ,sewol ferry sunk killing","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23610602  0.25066051

After an inspection into Sunhwa Art School and Chungdam High School, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education said it would ask the prosecution to launch an investigation into Chung, her mother and 10 faculty members involved in the scandal.Chung Yoo-ra “We are facing an unprecedented level of shameful irregularities in the education sector by Choi Soon-sil,” said Cho Hee-yeon, chief of the education office. “We will do our best to improve the system to correct the irregularities and prevent a recurrence of such wrongdoings.”The 19-year-old dressage rider Chung is currently in Germany. It is not yet known when she will be brought in for questioning. According to the ministry’s findings, Chung was absent from the school for 141 days of her senior year, but was still marked present, with the excuse that she was engaged in training or competition, upon official documents issued by the Korea Equestrian Federation. However, of the 141 days she was absent, for 105 of them she attended neither training nor competition. Under the current school act, a student is required to attend at least 129 of 193 days to graduate from middle and high school. The education office said it would also revise her attendance and academic records and rescind awards she won during her school years. The move came after Ewha Womans University announced Friday that it would expel Chung and ban her re-admission to the school permanently over a series of special treatment given to her, from the admission procedure to academic records.With her admission into Ewha Womans University and high school graduation canceled, she would end up with just a middle school diploma. Despite irregularities found during her middle school years, her graduation from Sunhwa Art School cannot be revoked because it is mandatory in South Korea for the government to offer middle school education, the education office said. Authorities also plan to tighten monitoring on attendance and academic records of student athletes and strengthen restrictions on the absences of student athletes. From now on, student athletes will not be allowed to be absent from more than a third of classes. When they participate in long-term training, they should notify not only their school, but also the education office, in advance.Chung’s mother Choi, who holds no government post, is accused of meddling in state affairs, coercing donations from conglomerates and peddling influence in the education and sports sectors to get her daughter special treatment through her ties to the embattled president.The inspection found she had offered kickbacks to teachers, verbally abused Chung’s teachers and threatened to have them fired. At the time, she was the wife of Jeong Yoon-hoe, who was then a presidential aide.By Ock Hyun-ju","school diploma cancelled seoul ,diploma cancelled seoul education ,high school diploma cancelled ,cancelled seoul education office ,cancelled seoul education","['Seoul', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Park Geun', 'Sunhwa Art School', 'Chungdam High School', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34581834  0.03017593

Cutting the inflow of money will make it harder for Pyongyang to pursue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.In an apparent protest against the U.N. move, the North's leader said that ""nobody and nothing"" could survive the North Korean military's strikes.""If a war breaks out, such a deadly strike should be inflicted upon the South Korean forces to completely break their will of counteraction at the start and make a clean sweep of them,"" Kim was quoted as saying by the KCNA.The report said that the artillery drill was carried out on the first day of North Korea's combat and political training for 2017.It is part of the military's winter training program, which usually runs from early December until April in the following year.Kim said that the year 2017 is ""of significance"" as it marks the 105th birth anniversary of late founder Kim Il-sung and the 75th birth anniversary of former leader Kim Jong-il, late father of Kim Jong-un. The year also marks the 85th founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army.Seoul's unification ministry has said that North Korea is fully prepared to carry out more nuclear and missile provocations at any time.Pyongyang is taking a wait-and-see mode to assess policy directions under way in the United States after Donald Trump won last month's presidential race. But experts said that the North could make provocative acts around its key anniversaries in December to boost its internal solidarity.Dec. 17 marked the fifth anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-il, and the country's incumbent leader will also mark the fifth anniversary of him assuming the supreme commandership of the military on Dec. 30.","artillery drill targeting korea ,pyongyang media said friday ,drill targeting korea north ,drill targeting korea ,south korea pyongyang media","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'the UN Security Council', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'the Korean Central News']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5715189   0.6849075

Typhoon Lionrock smashed the province in early September, which North Korean news outlets earlier said left nearly 70,000 residents homeless. More than 130 North Koreans were also reportedly dead and about 400 missing in the North's worst-ever flood. North Korea had presented an empty lot in flood-stricken Yonsa County in the province as a place for the clinic, and a Caritas delegation recently inspected it, the broadcaster said.

Ham brokered the import of the AW159 Wildcat, which the Navy adopted in 2013, when Choi held the post of Navy chief of staff.The money was actually given to Choi's son, but the court said it can be deemed as a bribe given to Choi, considering he was aware of the transaction and that the son lived with Choi without any income or property.The court ordered the defendant to pay a fine of 40 million won and forfeit another 5 million won.Still, the court freed Choi of allegations that he ordered his subordinates to write a favorable performance evaluation of the Wildcat, citing a lack of evidence.The bribe giver Ham was also sentenced to two years in jail and ordered to forfeit 15 million won.Corruption has been a nagging problem in South Korea's defense industry.

So far, 189 deaths -- mostly of lung failure -- have been formally recognized as being linked to the products, while damage claims -- from miscarriages to deaths -- filed this year have reached over 3,400.  “The disinfectant manufacturer needs to provide each victim with 10-100 million won  in compensation, as there appears to be an obvious connection between the lung-related deaths and illness and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants,” the Seoul Central District Court said in a ruling. The case was brought against Cefu, a local manufacturer of humidifier disinfectants, by 10 victims and the bereaved families of the dead ones in 2014. Cefu is blamed for the loss of 14 lives and 27 others suffering mostly from lung failure. It can contest the court ruling by appealing. But if the ruling is confirmed, parents of victims who lost their lives can receive up to 100 million won, while victims who suffered non-fatal damage can receive up to 30 million won. Bereaved families can each receive up to 10 million won.In a separate case seeking compensation from the government for its alleged negligence in product monitoring, the same court ruled against the victims. Earlier, another court had cleared the government of its legal responsibility, saying there is no evidence to believe that the authorities had any knowledge of the harmfulness of the problematic products. Other manufacturers -- RB Korea, a Korean unit of the UK-based Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, Lotte Mart and Homeplus -- have settled with victims in September. A criminal trial is also pending, as the state prosecutors have indicted in June some 20 people from the manufacturers. An association of victims and their families welcomed Tuesday’s court decision in a statement, while vowing to continue to fight on. So far, most of the victims’ families have not received compensation, either from the government or the company, except for government subsidies covering the medical costs already incurred. A state-led investigation confirmed a connection between at least 698 lung-related deaths and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants. But civic groups have said that the total number of victims is well above 200,000, due to the delayed response and insufficient action by the government.By Kim Da-sol","seoul court ruled tuesday ,killer disinfectant debacle four ,disinfectant debacle four years ,the killer disinfectant debacle ,died of lung disease",['Seoul'],15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34198439  0.50904411

The ministry suggested giving state-owned land near Seoul to Lotte in exchange for the golf course, a military official told Yonhap News Agency.""Lotte is now giving final consideration to our suggestion. We expect Lotte to come up with a decision today or tomorrow,"" the military official said, asking not to be named.In a text message sent Tuesday afternoon, the defense ministry said it will deliver a briefing on the consultations process on Wednesday to acquire the final site for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  system and other follow-up measures.The ministry has been in talks with Lotte since early October after selecting the Lotte golf club as the final site for THAAD a month earlier, instead of the controversial Seongsan anti-aircraft missile base in the same county 296 kilometers southeast of Seoul.Once the agreement is reached, an appraisal of the value of the two sites will be conducted. If the results show any considerable gap between the two, additional steps will be taken, the official said. ""If the value of the Lotte golf course turns out to be higher than that of the state territory in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, the defense ministry is planning to provide cash or further real estate to fill the gap. If the state territory is higher than the golf course in value, the ministry plans to deliver less land to Lotte,"" he said. The ministry plans to deliver the golf course to US Forces Korea following the closure of the swap deal under the Status of Forces Agreement  signed between Seoul and Washington. The construction planning and evaluation of the THAAD battery's environmental impact will then be carried out, he added.Through close consultations with the new US government, the Seoul government aims to deploy THAAD next year as scheduled. In a seminar held early this month, USFK Commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks said, ""You're gonna see the deployment of a THAAD battery. This is an alliance decision. It will come in the next eight to 10 months. That is an Army unit and ... a larger configuration than the one in Guam.""In July, the South and the US announced a decision to deploy the THAAD system in South Korea to better defend against the North's nuclear and missile threats. The rogue regime conducted two nuclear tests and launched about 20 missiles this year alone. The initial decision to pick the Seongsan missile base as the site of the anti-missile system fell through due to strong objections by local residents living near the base. They claimed the system's powerful X-band radar would pose serious health risks despite government-led test results showing that the radar doesn't pose any health problems to nearby residents. THAAD, a core part of America's multilayered missile defense program, is designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the terminal phase of flight after detecting the missiles with a land-based radar system.A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors , a fire control and communications unit, and an AN/TPY-2 radar.","near seoul to lotte ,military source said tuesday ,lotte skyhill country club ,seoul to lotte ,fifth largest conglomerate","[""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'Lotte Group', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'the Lotte Skyhill Country Club', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59772688  0.49926367

The court also ordered it to pay compensation ranging from 10 million to 30 million won to other victims.Other companies, except for Cefu, were not subject to the ruling as they had reached settlements with the victims in advance. Still, the court freed the government from liability to compensate, citing lack of evidence. Plaintiffs originally claimed the government also had to be held responsible as it failed to properly monitor the firms.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving consumer products using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems for unknown reason in 2011. A government-led investigation later confirmed a connection between scores of people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.A separate criminal trial is under way for the product makers, including Cefu and local unit of British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser.","100 mln won seoul ,april 2011 filed suit ,seoul court on tuesday ,100 million won 85 ,mln won seoul court",['Seoul'],15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36046702  0.09646828

The two governments already met last Tuesday in Tokyo. The GSOMIA is designed to enable information sharing between the two countries’ military assets, particularly concerning North Korea issues.Seoul and Tokyo came close to signing a deal in 2012, but the talks were grounded amid a public backlash in Seoul over what was perceived as “secretive negotiations” as well as the public’s negative perception of Japan due to the history of its colonial occupation of the country.  Mindful of such criticism, Moon vowed that the negotiation process would be carried out in a “fair and transparent” manner.There has been speculation that the agreement will be signed by early December, however the ministry has neither confirmed nor denied this. Defense Minister Han Min-koo The South Korean military, including the Defense Minister Han Min-koo, has stressed the necessity of a GSOMIA with Japan in light of growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea.Over the past year, Pyongyang has conducted two nuclear tests and test-fired over 20 ballistic missiles ranging from intermediate-range Musudan to submarine-launched KN-11, both of which were successfully launched for the first time this year.Japan’s intelligence assets far outstrip South Korea’s, with six destroyers equipped with Aegis combat systems, advanced radar and technology; four land-based radars with ranges of over 1,000 kilometers; 17 early warning aircraft and 77 patrol planes crucial to anti-submarine operations. The Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement inked by South Korea, the US and Japan in December 2014 allows Seoul and Tokyo to share military secrets via Washington, which has a bilateral military intelligence pact with both countries. But military officials have called for a faster exchange of information with Japan.“For example, SLBM is operated on a submarine and there are limits to information we can get on  submarines from TISA alone. ... If we acquire more information on Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, we would be able to come up with more timely countermeasures,” said a high-ranking official from the Defense Ministry.Kim Soung-chul, a diplomatic strategy researcher from the local think tank Sejong Institute, said that a Seoul-Tokyo GSOMIA is essential in order to set up a three-legged defense strategy against the North.“In case of crisis on the peninsula, Japan can provide back-up for the UN Command and US military based in Japan. It can possibly send its troops to peninsula with the US, for which it requires consent from the South Korean government,” he wrote in his report. South Korea currently has a GSOMIA with 19 countries including the US, Russia, Australia and Ukraine, as well as related arrangements with 13 other countries. The South Korean military recently suggested negotiating a GSOMIA with China, with whom relations have been soured over Seoul and Washington’s decision to dispatch a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on the peninsula.Kim pointed out that due to the shared history and ongoing territorial dispute, mutual trust between South Korea and Japan is limited. And if Japan takes on a more prominent role in regional security, it could agitate the “security dilemma” between the two countries. Also enhanced military cooperation between the three countries could lead to a factional dispute with China, Russia and possibly North Korea, which some experts have called the “new Cold War.”Apart from the military aspects, there has been accusations that the South Korean Defense Ministry is hurrying to clinch the much-disputed deal while the public is focused on the influence peddling scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s confidante Choi Soon-sil.The ministry has vowed to wait on signing the agreement until public sentiment is favorable, however there are no polls or data which show public support.“Minister  has always said that a  is necessary, but said the situation has to be favorable. ... He must explain why he believes now is the best time to restart the negotiations, when polls clearly show that the public is against it,” said Rep. Rhee Cheol-hee of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea during a session of the parliamentary defense committee.Han did not directly address Rhee’s question but reiterated the need to use Japan’s intelligence assets. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Cho June-hyuck denied suspicion that the government has been pressured to conclude the negotiations by outside parties like Japan. He added that the government is carrying out the process of collecting public opinion, without elaborating on the process.South Korean government has said that the basic principle for the military is to separate the issue of security from history or policy, indicating that it believes GSOMIA to be beneficial to national security regardless of public sentiment.By Yoon Min-sik","officials said tuesday seoul ,in seoul on wednesday ,seoul officials said tuesday ,tuesday seoul and tokyo ,seoul on wednesday for","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Moon Sang - kyun', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Seoul', 'the General Security of Military Informati']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47507063  0.96175379

21,21,What’s behind S.

But figuring out exactly who’s involved, what’s happening and why can be difficult.  Here’s a breakdown of the scandal:  A KOREAN RASPUTIN  Choi Soon-sil in front of the District Public Prosecutors Office in Seoul on Nov. 2 At the center of the tempest is Choi Soon-sil, also known as Choi Seo-won, who some on the internet have compared to Rasputin, the Russian mystic who gained power in the early 20th century through his influence over the tsar.  Park and Choi met in the 1970s, around the time Park was acting as first lady. Her mother had been killed during a 1974 assassination attempt on her father, military strongman Park Chung-hee. Choi’s father, a shadowy figure named Choi Tae-min who was a Buddhist monk, a religious cult leader and a Christian pastor at different times, emerged as the younger Park’s mentor. Park became president of New Spirit, a patriotic group set up by Choi’s father, and Choi Soon-sil was reportedly head of the group’s college unit _ the two women are seen talking at a New Spirit event in a 1979 government video. Rumors swirled that New Spirit allowed the Choi clan to build a fortune by using their connection to the Park family to collect bribes.  In 1990, Park resigned as chairman of a separate foundation over suspicions that she allowed the Choi family to manipulate it for personal gain.  Choi Soon-sil, whose ex-husband is a former close aide of Park’s, reportedly built a fortune during the 1980s and 1990s through real estate investments in affluent neighborhoods in southern Seoul.  STACKS OF PRESIDENTIAL REPORTS  -- AND A YELLOW EXCAVATOR After weeks of speculation, Park acknowledged last week that Choi had edited some presidential speeches and helped with “public relations,’’ without elaborating. A raft of media stories, however, portrays a much deeper involvement.  The liberal Hankyoreh newspaper, for instance, citing a former Choi associate, reported that a senior presidential aide gave thick stacks of government draft reports to Choi on a daily basis. Choi then allegedly discussed the issues with her friends and sent back recommendations to the president.  The newspaper reported that Choi made recommendations about the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, the jointly run Kaesong factory park in North Korea that was eventually shut down. Choi is also said to have used her relationship with Park to win special favor for Choi’s daughter and to pressure businesses to contribute money to two nonprofit foundations that Choi helped create and that she then looted for her own use.  Thousands have marched in protest, calling for Park’s resignation or impeachment, and the president’s approval ratings are near single digits.  On Monday, as Choi, 60, tried to enter the Seoul prosecutors’ office, she lost her Prada shoe as a swarm of 300 journalists, and an unknown number of protesters, nearly knocked her to the ground several times. Social media erupted with images of the abandoned black footwear and the word “Soonderella,” a play on Choi’s first name and the fairy tale heroine who left behind her glass slipper at a ball.  Police reportedly stopped a protester from confronting Choi with a bucket filled with animal feces, and the next day police said a 45-year-old man surnamed Jeong rammed his yellow excavator into a gate near where Choi, who had earlier said she “deserves to die,” was questioned. “I came here to help her die,” Jeong, said, according to police. LINKS TO A DICTATOR The scandal strikes a deep chord in a country that has only recently emerged into a vibrant, rich democracy after decades of colonization, war, poverty, dictatorship and deep-seated corruption.  There is outrage that someone with Choi’s allegedly murky past might have not only exploited her ties to Park for massive financial gain and favor but also made important state decisions. Part of the anger is linked to the legacy of Park’s dictator father. Revered by many for rebuilding from the rubble of war, critics say Park Chung-hee engineered his economic turn-around while committing massive human rights abuses and allowing widespread corruption by his friends. To try to ease public fury, Park Geun-hye has nominated a new prime minister and fired senior secretaries, but it has so far done little. “If we don’t want to be blinded by politics based on shamanism again, we need to conduct an autopsy on power that has become devoid of justice,” said an editorial column Monday in the conservative JoongAng Ilbo.","korea biggest political scandal ,biggest political scandal ,biggest political scandal in ,surreal scandal seoul ,south korea biggest political","['AP', 'South Korea ’s', 'Prada', 'a Korean Rasputin', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49559799  0.50626677

22,22,Will Han River water taxis take off?,"Three days before the Han River water taxi service resumed last month, a group of reporters boarded one at the dock located inside Banpo Han River Park in Seoul.Eight water taxis were anchored at the water taxi stand, while workers were busy putting the finishing touches to the boulevard that led to the dock.“We will get to your destination as soon as possible in the safest way,” said Kim In-geun, a water taxi driv...","Three days before the Han River water taxi service resumed last month, a group of reporters boarded one at the dock located inside Banpo Han River Park in Seoul.Eight water taxis were anchored at the water taxi stand, while workers were busy putting the finishing touches to the boulevard that led to the dock.“We will get to your destination as soon as possible in the safest way,” said Kim In-geun, a water taxi driver with 30 years of experience at sea, welcoming passengers with a friendly smile. A Han River water taxi is anchored at taxi stand inside Banpo Han River park. The interior of the boat was luxurious and the seats were soft. Apart from a few bumps, the ride was surprisingly comfortable.It took about eight minutes for the water taxi to depart “Seoraenaru” ferry dock at Banpo Han River Park and arrive at Yeouido. “Unless Han River freezes during winter, water taxis will be able to provide a quick and safe ride for commuters,” Kim proudly said.  Akin to a chauffeur-driven limousine on the road, the water taxis were first introduced in Seoul in 2007. After years of slow business, with an average number of seven daily passengers, the service came to halt in April 2014, when it was revealed that the service’s operator was Cheonghaejin Marine Co., a shipping company linked to the sinking of the Sewol ferry. Resuming the operation after a 2 1/2 year hiatus with a new operator, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has also changed the target customer group. Of the eight water taxes in service, five will be mainly used by tourists for sightseeing, offering onboard programs such as feeding migratory birds and watching the sunset.  The rest -- three taxis that can fit up to seven passengers -- will shuttle commuters. Traveling at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour, a water taxi can get from Jamsil to Yeouido in 40 minutes. A single trip costs 5,000 won  -- 20 minutes faster and 13,000 won cheaper than a road taxi. “We are going to provide season tickets or T-money service for commuters in order to provide convenience to passengers and actively promote the water taxi as a form of transportation,” said Kim Jung-ho, the manager of Han River water taxi operation in Seoul City.Despite the ambitious plans, hurdles seem to remain for the business to take off. “Water taxis may be faster on the water, but it takes at least 15 minutes to walk from the water taxi stand to my office located at Jamsil Station. I think I would rather take the subway, despite it being super packed in the morning, since I would not have to walk so much,” a 34-year-old office worker who commutes to Jamsil every morning told The Korea Herald. An American lawyer who frequently visits Seoul said she does not see the difference between a water taxi and the ferry cruise that started running on the Han River in July. “When I visit the Han River, I normally opt for  sightseeing ferry because it is cheaper for a longer ride. I think maybe I could try a water taxi once, although the price is twice as much, for private use such as partying,” she said.The multipurpose cruise ship Araho, a city-run sightseeing ferry cruise on the Han River, has been gaining popularity among citizens and foreigners for its onboard activities such as watching a traditional Samulnori show and buffet dining. Seoul City said the cruise attracted at least a thousand visitors over the summer this year. Kim, the manager of Han River water taxi operations at Seoul City said that water taxis can cater to a small group of passengers’ needs as it operates eight different sightseeing courses. According to him, water taxis used for sightseeing will cost 25,000 won per person for the first 30 minutes of each ride, with 8,000 won charged for every additional 10 minutes. The price is far lower than the previous price of 70,000 won for a 30-minute trip. On the accessibility issue, Seoul Metropolitan Government said it would install more bicycle stands and run a public bicycle rental service around the water taxi stands so passengers can easily travel to nearby destinations or bus and subway stations. Environmentalists also take issue with water taxies. According to the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement, programs on the water taxis could negatively influence the ecosystem of animals that live at the Han River.“Migratory birds are very sensitive when they visit  to rest. Programs such as feeding migratory birds on water taxis is an absolutely ridiculous idea,” said Shin Jae-un from the KFEM.Bamseom, one of the uninhabited islets on the part of the Han River near Yeouido, is frequently visited by migratory birds such as mallards, great egrets, mandarins, common kestrels and spotbills throughout the year.While it offers no access to humans, Bamseom was officially designated as a habitat for migratory birds in 2012. It has been left as a natural sanctuary for its characteristic Ramsar wetlands. Some experts visit it for bird watching or observation of the unique ecosystem located in the heart of the city. Environmental activists also argued that the sound or waves that water taxis make could have an impact on animals such as migratory birds. “Some civic groups are trying to reserve part of the Han River as a habitat for endangered animals such as porpoises,” said an official from the KFEM.“If Seoul City decides to run water taxis without noticing the effects it has on the ecosystem of the Han River as well as its low economic benefits, it is making the same mistake as a previous mayor did a decade ago,” an official added.

Covering her face with her hands, the tearful Choi uttered, “I’m sorry, please forgive me,” before hurrying inside the building. Choi Soon-sil is surrounded by the press as she arrives at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office in Seoul on Monday. “ will fully cooperate with the prosecutors to ensure a thorough investigation,” said her attorney Lee Kyung-jae. Choi, a 60-year-old civilian, faces a range of allegations, from bribery, blackmail and illegal use of public funds to a violation of law on presidential documents. In an interview last week, she denied most of the allegations, except that she had edited presidential speeches out of pure intentions. Lee said Choi’s apology Monday should not be seen as her admitting the accusations.Choi has been receiving medication for a panic disorder and appears to have heart problems, he said while adding that her daughter Chung Yoo-ra -- a horseback rider embroiled in a favoritism scandal at her university -- will be staying abroad “for a while.” Local channel JTBC broke the story last week after finding over 200 presidential documents on a tablet PC purportedly used by Choi. The revelation was followed by a shower of media reports and testimonies by Choi’s former and current associates all indicating that Choi had used her four-decade relationship with the president to meddle in state affairs. According to reports, Choi received, and made modifications to, drafts of Park’s speeches and had access to presidential documents on classified military and diplomatic information. This included receiving detailed documents beforehand on what Park discussed in a private meeting with her predecessor Lee Myung-bak in December of 2012, days after she was elected president. Another leg of the Choi scandal is the allegation that the presidential staff -- in cooperation with the Federation of Korean Industries -- raised some 80 billion won  for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation, which was then channeled to Choi.Amid the snowballing scandal, Park conducted a sweeping reshuffle of the presidential staff by replacing five senior secretaries on Sunday, including Chief of Staff Lee Wong-jong, Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo and Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination Ahn Chong-bum. Woo and Ahn have been barred from leaving the country by prosecutors.It has also been alleged Choi’s daughter Chung had received unlawful favors and advantages in being admitted to and while attending Ewha Womans University. A media report claimed Choi verbally abused a professor at the university who gave her daughter poor grades and attempted to bribe Chung’s high school teacher.President Park last week issued a public apology and admitted to letting Choi edit her speeches during an early part of her tenure as president.But Choi has flatly denied she had daily access to Cheong Wa Dae’s reports on the president. She claimed the tablet PC in which the documents were found did not belong to her, even though it contained her personal photos.“ said that it was ‘strange anyway.’ ... She said that she does not use tablet PCs,” said Choi’s lawyer Lee in a radio interview early Monday.Local TV network JTBC, who acquired the tablet PC in question, refuted Choi‘s claims, saying Choi’s photos were found in a folder that automatically saves photos taken by the device, a strong indicator the photos were directly taken with the tablet PC.While Choi is swimming in a sea of allegations, it remains unclear how many can be proved by prosecutors. Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday refused the prosecution’s request to search the presidential office, and instead submitted seven boxes of what it said were relevant documents.Related officials have consistently refused accusations that the Mir and K-Sports foundations were a cover to raise money for Choi. Choi’s associate Ko Young-tae, who went home Sunday after nearly two days of questioning, told reporters the tablet PC in question does not belong to him and he never saw her use the device. Her ex-husband Jeong also told local media he had never seen the tablet, but refused to comment further on the matter.By Yoon Min-sik","scandal rocking south korea ,angry protestors covering her ,shadow president grilling choi ,before prosecutors monday afternoon ,president grilling choi soon","['Choi Soon - sil', 'South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Cho']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.15069413  0.33855212

Police and politicians have been casting watchful eyes on the rally as it was the first mass movement after the president apologized in a nationally televised address over allegations raised against her confidante, Choi Soon-sil. In the apology delivered Tuesday, Park admitted to the leak of dozens of presidential speeches to Choi before they were made public, acknowledging her ties.Still, the scandal has only been snowballing as a series of media reports claimed Choi's possible intervention in other state affairs, including some related to sensitive policy issues. Choi holds no governmental post. A 24-year-old college student, who asked not to be named, said he joined a demonstration as he was ""so frustrated and disappointed"" about the latest scandal.Others like Chris from Australia who works as an English teacher here said it seemed very meaningful that the public came out to send a message to the government. He asked for his last name not to be used for privacy reasons.Lee Jae-myung, the mayor of Seongnam, located just south of Seoul, and a longtime critic of the administration, joined the demonstration and criticized the president, saying she is ""making fun of this democratic country."" He, however, was one of the very few politicians who took part in the event, as many oppose talk of resignation or impeachment, citing possible political confusion and the need to see what the ongoing investigation will unearth. Political leaders have been cautious since an official probe has just started, and it will take time to sort out all the accusations being raised at present. Choi, in the center of the uproar, has so far denied all charges of wrongdoing, other than helping the president write speeches, and expressed a wish to cooperate with the investigation.

Prosecutors here are currently looking into the case, summoning a number of officials from the government and private companies related to the matter. On Saturday, they attempted to raid the offices of presidential aides who are involved in the scandal, but Cheong Wa Dae refused them entry, citing the need to protect state secrets that may be compromised. The latest scandal, involving what critics call the ""shadow president,"" has sent Park's approval rating to 17 percent, the lowest point since her inauguration in February 2013, according to local pollster Gallup Korea.Faced with the scandal, Cheong Wa Dae is widely expected to replace some of her closest aides in a reshuffle early next week.","seoul demanding park resignation ,saturday demanding president ,resignation over scandal thousands ,park resignation over scandal ,on saturday demanding president","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'group', 'the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Cheonggy']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38775656  0.18993166

Last month, Willy Fautre from Human Rights Without Borders estimated around 50,000 North Koreans work in 16 countries that annually send $1.2-2.3 billion back home.

Calling the crime a felony committed against the whole of society, the Seoul Central District Court also ordered the 34-year-old, identified by his surname Kim, to wear an electronic anklet and receive medical treatment in custody for 20 years.  Kim was arrested in May on charges of murdering a 22-year-old woman with a kitchen knife at a public bathroom near Gangnam Station on May 17. “His crime was cruel and random, taking away the life of a person he did not even know. It was a serious contempt of life,” the court said in the ruling. “The defendant is also not showing any remorse at all for the victim and her family.”The prosecution had demanded a life sentence for Kim. But his symptoms of schizophrenia and persecution complex should be taken into account, the court said.“The crime seems to have been planned in advance,” the court said. “But, given that the defendant did not hide the knife used to murder the victim and went to work with it with bloodstain on his clothes the next morning, it is difficult to deny that Kim committed the murder under feeble-minded conditions.” Kim had been hospitalized for schizophrenia six times since 2009. But he had not taken medication since he was discharged from hospital in January. His doctor testified during earlier hearings that Kim could have been gripped by a persecution complex when he committed the murder.The court dismissed the misogynous nature of the crime.“It seems that Kim’s crime against women resulted from his fears toward men in general and women’s more socially marginalized status, rather than his hatred toward women,” the court said. Kim allegedly waited for about 50 minutes, during which six men came and went, and killed the first woman who entered, according to CCTV footage.Kim, who had no prior contact with the victim, said during earlier hearings he had decided to commit the crime upon anger toward women who he said constantly ignored him.“I just wanted to solve a problem because women have done harm to me, but it was not a crime driven by hatred against women,” he said. “I have seriously thought about it and was under stable conditions when I committed the crime.”Kim looked pale and nervous in the light green prison uniform as he walked into the courtroom with nearly 60 spectators and reporters in attendance Friday. The victim’s mother was seen weeping at the back of the courtroom as the judge read out the ruling. While the prosecution defined the crime as an offense by a mentally ill person, not a hate crime, the murder of the young woman had earlier prompted nationwide mourning as well as debate over misogyny and safety for women in the country. Kim can file an appeal within seven days with the Seoul High Court.

It said that Kim visited the flood-hit border city of Rason last year after rehabilitation work was completed, a move seen as him taking full credit for the recovery.On Thursday, North Korea's state-run broadcaster aired footage of North Korean residents praising Kim's 2015 visit to Rason where flood-damage restoration work was carried out.Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that the report may signal the North Korean leader's imminent plan to visit the flood-ravaged northeastern areas.Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told lawmakers on Friday that Seoul is not considering providing assistance to the North over the flood damage, given high tensions following Pyongyang's September nuclear test.","officials over flood damage ,over flood damage activist ,flood damage activist north ,arrested scores of officials ,damage activist north korea","['North Korea', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'north korean', 'Kim Yong - hwa', 'the NK Refugees H']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49184796 -0.08562575

The matter has been settled with the Philippines national police” an official at the Korean National Police Agency said. The investigation team includes three police detectives and a forensic expert for gun analysis, the official added.Two man and one woman, confirmed by the Foreign Ministry as Korean nationals, were found dead in a remote sugar field in Bacolor, some 75 kilometers northwest of Manila, early Monday morning. The victims who were in their 40s and 50s, were shot in the head. Two were tied up and the local police suspect murder. The police revealed that the two men departed for the country on Aug. 16 through Hong Kong. The woman left Korea three days after the two. While the police were careful not to say anything about the rumor that the victims had fled after being involved in a crime back in Korea, it admitted that the three did not interact much with other local Korean residents. “Further investigation is needed on the matter, but the case looks different from typical contract killings according to the local police,” a police authority said. The Korean Embassy is working closely with local police to come up with an account of the incident, the Korean ministry said.  The number of Koreans killed in the Philippines has been on the rise. After six deaths in 2012, the number doubled in 2013 and has stayed in two-digit figures, with 10 deaths in 2014 and 11 in 2015. So far this year, there have already been three victims. The latest deaths, if confirmed as homicides, would raise the tally to six. As the number of violent crimes targeting Koreans in the Asian country has increased, the Korean government created a special investigative team, “Korean Desk,” to work and cooperate with the police in the Philippines in 2010. Currently six policemen work in the country. In September, the task force caught a suspect who fled to the Southeast Asian country after killing a married couple 16 years ago in Korea. Between last December and May, Korea also dispatched four additional teams of investigators to work on Korean murder cases, prompting the operation process. “We will cooperate with the Philippines police and conduct a swift and thorough investigation,” the police said. Over 90,000 Koreans reside in the Philippines, mostly in Manila and its surrounding areas. The Asian country is also a popular vacation destination among Koreans, with over 1.2 million Koreans traveling to the country each year.  By Jo He-rim","dispatch four police investigators ,deaths of three koreans ,to dispatch four police ,south korea decided thursday ,dispatch four police","['South Korea', 'Philippines', 'Koreans', 'Philippines', 'the Korean National Police Agency']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.39821553  0.72202986

The announcer said she is ""giving review work in metal engineering to No. 21 expedition agents.""Since June 24, North Korea sent out a total of eight encrypted numbers broadcasts, with the last one broadcast on Sept. 25.Broadcasts of mysterious numbers are a kind of book cipher that was often used by North Korea to give missions to spies operating in South Korea during the Cold War era. Spies could decode numbers to get orders by using a reference book, although many intelligence agents believe this form of sending orders to be outdated.Pyongyang had initially suspended such broadcasts in 2000 when the two Koreas held their first historic summit.Tensions are already running high on the divided peninsula after North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9 and warned it could launch preemptive strikes against Seoul and Washington.

On Jeju, a ship crew member fell into the water and went missing in the Jeju port on Wednesday morning, while in Ulsan, an emergency rescuer on duty was swept away by a flood. The toll is likely to rise, the safety ministry said. Damages caused by the Typhoon Chaba More than 120 flights were grounded due to the typhoon, stranding thousands of passengers. Jeju International Airport was shut down from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., and all morning flights in and out of Gimhae airport, located on the side line of Busan, were canceled. The operation of high-speed KTX trains in the southern regions came to a temporary suspension at noon, as powers were cut due to the rainstorm. Typhoon Chaba knocked out power in more than 210,000 households around the affected region, according to Korea Electric Power Corp.Businesses based in the affected areas also saw damages. Hyundai Motor’s auto assembly line in Ulsan was halted temporarily due to flooding, while Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. on Geoje Island also faced suspension.

Hong Chul-ho.According to the ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker, the 3.7 billion won  water taxi project was a money-losing disaster before the service was suspended in April 2014, with daily average passengers of just seven.  Seoul spent the 3.7 billion won on installing 17 taxi stands and operating 10 water taxis from 11 ferry points on the Han River from its launch in October 2007. It also spent an additional 260 million won over the last five years of the service for repair and maintenance costs.Water taxi services were suspended after it was found that Cheonghaejin Marine Co. -- a shipping company linked to the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014 -- was its operator. As each water taxi can carry up to eight passengers at an approximately 5,000 won cost for a one-way trip, water taxis were introduced as a means of transportation to get away from smoggy traffic jams, while also providing a scenic and efficient way of traveling through Seoul’s greater metropolitan area.By Kim Da-sol","hugely unpopular water taxi ,34 million water taxi ,money losing disaster before ,unpopular water taxi services ,resume seoul city seoul","['Seoul', 'Hong Chul - ho', 'Saenuri Party']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73044747 -0.22230686

Three officers were onboard when the aircraft lost communication and disappeared from radars, about 48 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line and 52 kilometers east of Yangyang, Gangwon Province.The pilot had sent out distress signals four times before crashing, according to a Navy official. He added that the military was able to recover parts of the chopper along with the pilot’s helmet at around midnight.Lynx chopper The Navy said it recovered the body of the 33-year-old pilot surnamed Kim around 6:00 p.m. Bodies of the two other crew members -- 33-year-old co-pilot Park and 29-year-old airman Hwang -- were found Wednesday morning.A Navy investigation committee headed by Vice Adm. Jung Jin-sup is conducting an investigation to determine the exact cause of the crash. Officials said that the weather conditions had met the criteria required for a military drill. They added that the chopper in question had been acquired by the Navy in 1999 and underwent maintenance in August. The Lynx helicopters are conventionally operated for over 30 years. It marks the third time the Navy’s Lynx helicopters have crashed. A crash in 1993 left 10 killed, while four died when a Lynx plunged into waters off Jindo, South Jeolla Province. No distress signals were sent in either of the cases, and the Navy had assessed the pilot’s mistake caused the crashes.The helicopter was conducting a drill to trace and chase North Korean submarines. North Korea in July conducted what was evaluated as its first successful test firing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.Officials said that there is no evidence to believe the chopper was shot down by a North Korean missile, or that Pyongyang’s radars had been operated to spot the aircraft.By Yoon Min-sik","lynx choppers after crash ,korean navy on tuesday ,navy the helicopter crashed ,choppers after crash the ,choppers after crash","['the south korean Navy', 'Navy', 'Seoul', 'Washington']",15,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.16602734 0.26765257 0.15446015],Yoon Min-sik,Defense,9,2016,"navy lynx helicopters have crashed ,south korean navy on tuesday ,lynx helicopters have crashed crash ,four died when lynx plunged ,the navy the helicopter crashed","['the south korean Navy', 'Navy', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'Yangyang', 'Gangwon Province', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Kim', 'Hwang', 'Navy', 'Jung Jin - sup', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Lynx', 'Jindo', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Navy', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'Yoon Min - sik']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.16602734 0.26765257 0.15446015]

Seoul Jungbu Police said a man surnamed Lee, 33, and three others were booked without detention on charges of violation of the Trademarks Law. Between April and September, the four had sold fake Louis Vuitton bags and Rolex watches, along with counterfeits of 39 other brand names, making profits worth 40 million won .  The police discovered 374 fake goods in a warehouse attached to the group’s shop. If these goods had been authentic, they would have been worth roughly 8.3 billion won, the police said. The suspects had been eluding the police by displaying the fake products with incomplete brand logos. Selling counterfeit products with complete brand logos is a violation of the Trademarks Law and is grounds for immediate arrest. The suspects had completed the logos of the goods in a separate work space only when the customer was sure to make a purchase. The police vowed to continue to keep an eye on the area and prevent activities that might tarnish Myeong-dong’s tourist friendly image.

The police report submitted to Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party showed that there have been 1,597 criminal incidents reported until July this year on Seoul’s subway line numbers 1 to 9. Of the reported crimes, sexual offenses including sexually harassment, taking photographs secretly and illicit video recordings of passengers accounted for 60 percent of the total incidents, with 897 cases. This was followed by thefts with 429 cases, and violence, with 271 cases. Passengers waiting and entering a Seoul subway train Subway Line No. 2 had the highest number of reported crimes, with 299. Seoul’s most heavily used line connects the city center to Gangnam, Teheran Valley and other metropolitan complexes. Subway Line No. 9 had the second highest number of crimes at 217 cases, followed by Line No. 1 with 121, Line No. 4 with 84, Line No. 7 with 68, Line No. 3 with 47, Line No. 5 with 41 and Line No. 6 with 18.The least number of crimes were reported on Subway Line No. 8 with two cases. Different lines tended to show different types of most rampant crimes, the report showed. Sexual offenses on Subway Line No. 9 accounted for 86 percent of crimes, while those on Line No. 2 made up 61 percent. Theft was the most common crime on Subway Line No. 6 with 33 cases, double the figure of sexual offenses on the same line. The number of arrests made on the subway rose to 2,624 in 2015 from 1,447 in 2012. An official of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway told reporters that it has no judicial power to punish offenders on subways, a seemingly weak spot for the authorities to take action. Seoul Metro currently employs the subway’s patrol officers, also known as the “Subway Sheriff,” to fight on-train crime. No judicial power is granted to these officers.

It was the strongest ever recorded by the KMA in the Korean Peninsula. Among a total of 423 aftershocks recorded as of Wednesday afternoon since the Sept. 12 quake, most were assessed to be weaker than magnitude 3. Only two aftershocks recorded a magnitude of between 4 and 5, while 15 tremors have ranged from 3 to 4. The historic city of Gyeongju in North Gyeongsang Province is set to be designated as a special disaster zone, which will grant the city state funds to help restore the area. Its residents will receive tax benefits and cuts in utility bills. A 3.5 magnitude earthquake struck Gyeongju on Wednesday morning, two days after a magnitude 4.5 quake shook the nation Monday night. The KMA added that the epicenter of the foreshock in Gyeongju was 0.7 to 0.8 kilometers away from that of the main quake. “We found out that foreshocks, major quakes and aftershocks were seen as moving in southwestern direction,” said the KMA.  Members of a civic environmental group hold a press conference condemning the government‘s countermeasures against earthquakes, calling for suspension of the country’s nuclear power plants in front of the Sejong Center for Performing Arts in downtown Seoul on Thursday. Nearly 90 percent of the aftershocks, including the most powerful ones with a magnitude of 4.0 and over took place with 2.5 kilometers from where the major 5.8 magnitude quake occurred, the KMA said. Nearly 70 percent of the aftershocks took place within two days after the quake rattled the country, with the quakes hitting a depth of 15.2 kilometers on average. “Currently, it takes 50 seconds to detect earthquakes stronger than 5.0 magnitude and notify relevant agencies and areas of the tremors, but we will reduce it to 7 to 25 seconds,” said the KMA. “In order to do so, we will increase the number of seismic monitoring facilities from the current 206 to 314 by 2018.”“Starting in November, the KMA will directly notify the public of the occurrence of natural disasters in association with Cell Broadcasting System,” the agency said. “We believe we can measure the seismic activity within 10 seconds and notify the public within 2 minutes through text messages by 2017.”The current system of sending alert messages to the public has been criticized for failing to inform them in time. The weather agency sends mobile alert messages in times of natural disasters after going through the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. When the 3.5 magnitude aftershock jolted the country Wednesday, warning messages were sent to the public some 10 minutes after residents felt the shaking. On Monday night, the website of the Public Safety Ministry as well as the weather agency, which provide information on how to evacuate in cases of quakes, also crashed due to heavy traffic. The KMA also said that a team of eight relevant officials will be dispatched to Gyeongju to conduct an on-site investigation from Sept. 20 to March 31 in 2017 to investigate causes and impact of the series of quakes. In regard to the latest earthquakes, President Park Geun-hye ordered a comprehensive overhaul of the country‘s national quake response system at a meeting with top aides in the presidential office on Thursday. “It has been confirmed that the country had several problems in the process of responding to quakes because we have perceived our country as safe from such natural disasters,” she said.“As it is possible that aftershocks continue to take place, the government should have more prompt and accurate readiness to promote the public safety,” she said. Relevant ministries and state-run agencies are scrambling to assess, prevent and minimize the damage of quakes. According to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, it will revise relevant acts so that special subsidy tax of the interior ministry, the education ministry and the public safety ministry can be used to reinforce public facilities to make them more earthquake-resistant. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced Thursday that it will inspect all major social infrastructure including bridges, tunnels and airports in the quake-stricken southeastern region. A team of more than 420 officials from relevant state-run agencies will be put on the field to inspect the safety of nearly 6,000 public facilities in the region by the end of this year. It also aims to make express trains, expressways and bridges earthquake-resistant by 2018, ordinary trains by 2019 and intake towers by 2020. The ministry has already announced plans to revise construction codes to require all new structures that are two-stories high or higher to be earthquake-proof. The Korea electric Power Corporation will also raise the level of safety of electric facilities as well as nuclear reactors by evaluating its ability to endure quakes in the face of the series of quakes.

The decision came as South Korea’s presidential office, the prime minister, and ruling Saenuri Party held high-level talks Wednesday to discuss measures to deal with the string of quakes that have rattled the southeastern part of the country. The KMA plans to hold a news briefing on the interim results of analysis on the nation’s natural disaster warning system and what could have caused the string of earthquakes. On Sept. 12, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake jolted Gyeongju, located some 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul, making it the strongest ever recorded by the Korea Meteorological Administration for the Korean Peninsula. A 3.5 magnitude earthquake struck Gyeongju on Wednesday morning, two days after a magnitude 4.5 quake shook the nation Monday night. The tremor was detected at 11:53 a.m., with the epicenter some 10 kilometers southwest of Gyeongju, according to the KMA. Fire departments in Daegu, Ulsan and North Gyeongsang Province said that they had received hundreds of emergency calls reporting tremors when the quake took place. Students at Bulguksa primary school in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, have lunch on the playground outside their school as a 3.5 magnitude quake hit the region on Wednesday. YonhapNo major fatalities or damage was reported, authorities said.Among a total of 412 aftershocks recorded as of Wednesday afternoon since the Sept. 12 quake, most were assessed to be weaker than magnitude 3. Only two aftershocks recorded a magnitude of between 4 and 5, while 15 tremors have ranged from 3 to 4. A city is designated as a special disaster zone after receiving approval from the president when its public facilities are damaged due to large-scale natural disasters or accidents and when municipalities are in need of financial support from the central government. If Gyeongju is declared a special disaster zone, it will receive most of the financial support needed to restore the area and its residents will receive tax benefits and cuts in utility bills. The government and the ruling party also agreed to improve an alert message system in the case of natural disaster so that warning messages can be sent to the public within 10 seconds of a disaster striking the country. Currently, the weather agency sends mobile alert messages in times of natural disasters after going through the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. The officials also decided to conduct a comprehensive review of the nation’s plan to deal with earthquakes and assign greater budget to revise relevant acts and install more seismic monitors in the upcoming regular session at the parliament. They will also form a task force -- consisting of mental therapists, counsellors and doctors -- to help residents from the quake-hit city overcome post-traumatic stress disorder, authorities said. The Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs said Wednesday that it would provide Gyeongju with 2 billion won  in special subsidies. The money will be used to conduct projects to restore damaged roads, public facilities and pavements.The seismic activity this year seems to be much greater than in past years. Last year, the country saw 44 quakes. There were 49 in 2014, 93 in 2013 and 56 in 2012. The second-biggest quake on the Korean Peninsula took place in 1980, when a 5.3 magnitude tremor hit North Korea. The KMA said it would be difficult to confirm when the aftershocks would end, warning the public to keep up with news updates. It did not rule out the possibility of more aftershocks in the coming weeks. Rival parties continued to blast the government for what they saw as its inability to cope with quakes during the parliamentary meeting on Wednesday. They criticized the Public Safety Ministry and Ministry of the Interior for failing to lay out comprehensive measures to handle natural disasters and for failing to properly notify the public of how to respond in cases of emergencies.“The most fundamental problem is that the public have fears about the government’s handling of safety-related issues,” said Rep. Park Sun-ja of the ruling Saenuri Party. “The Interior Ministry and the Public Safety Ministry should have distributed manuals on how to respond to quakes and advertised them to the public, but nothing has been done. The public don’t feel protected by the government.”Rep. Lee Je-jeong of The Minjoo Party of Korea also echoed similar concerns. “Even though quakes cannot be accurately predicted, the government’s inability to confirm facts is making the public nervous. What is more fearful is not quakes, but the attitudes of the ministers of the relevant ministries,” Lee said. When the 3.5 magnitude aftershock jolted the country Wednesday, warning messages were sent to the public some 10 minutes after residents felt the shaking. on Monday night, the website of the Public Safety Ministry as well as the weather agency, which provide information on how to evacuate in cases of quakes, also crashed due to heavy traffic. By Ock Hyun-ju","wednesday to designate quake ,quake stricken gyeongju north ,strongest quake on record ,designate quake stricken gyeongju ,quake stricken gyeongju","['Saenuri Party', 'Gyeongju', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4023954   0.43672663

The wall of an elementary school in Ulsan, southeast South Korea, is cracked on Sept. 19, following a powerful 5.8-magnitude earthquake that hit the region on Sept. 12. ""The government decided to further expand the regulation to include buildings that are two stories or higher, considering recent indications that the country's geological characteristics make such structures especially vulnerable to earthquakes,"" it added.Currently, only buildings that are three stories or higher are required to be earthquake-resistant.Starting next year, buildings that are 16 stories or higher must have their designs verified and show how strong a quake they can withstand, the ministry said.Those with 50 stories or more will be subject to an additional safety evaluation that will also check the possible effect on the surrounding structures and environment in case of a quake.The ministry said a public notice of the proposed revision will be announced Thursday with the government seeking to legislate the revision early next year.Meanwhile, a local researcher noted problems with existing structures.Lee Young-hwan, a senior researcher at the Construction Economy Research Institute, said the government earlier planned to reinforce a total of 127,306 existing public facilities to make them more earthquake-resistant, but only 42.4 percent, or 51,088 of them, had actually been reinforced by the end of 2014.Such a problem was more serious for schools as 78 percent of, or 15,653 out of a total 20,131, school buildings in the country failed to meet safety requirements in terms of earthquake-resistance, the researcher said while speaking at a seminar in Seoul.Also, about 40 percent of the all railways on Seoul metropolitan subways lines 1 through 4 are not currently earthquake-proof.""Subway lines 1 through 4 have a combined total of 7.3 million daily users and 1.5 billion users per year, which means a strong enough earthquake could lead to heavy casualties,"" Lee said.

45,45,[NEWS FOCUS] Debate simmers over NK flood aid,"With North Korea reeling from the worst floods in decades, debate is heating up here as to whether Seoul should provide humanitarian relief despite heightened tension following Pyongyang’s latest nuclear test.

The North’s state media has said the floods caused by recent torrential rains in the country’s north had forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, calling it the “worst disaster” since its 1945 liberation. A UN agency tallied the casualties as at least 138 deaths and 400 vanishings. To help alleviate the calamity, a growing number of South Korean politicians, experts and activists are raising the need to offer food, medical and other aids.  The Korea NGO Council for Cooperation with North Korea, an association of 59 relief groups here, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Unification to approve their plans to meet and deliver supplies to North Koreans. North Koreans are seen working on repairing damages caused by the flood in Musan, North Hamgyeong Province, in this photo released by Rodong Shinmun on Saturday. Seoul remains skeptical, however, given the grave political situation after Pyongyang’s fifth atomic experiment on Sept. 9. It is currently pushing for a fresh round of crippling sanctions at the UN Security Council. “We have not received any request  from North Korea so far, and it is unlikely for them to make one in the future,” ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a news briefing Monday. “Even if they do, I think the chances are quite low it will take place under the current circumstances.” He blasted the Kim Jong-un regime for pressing ahead with provocations even as the country suffers from the natural disaster. “Such an enormous amount of money and efforts were supposed to have been spent for the people’s livelihoods and recovery from the flood damage, not the nuclear test,” Jeong added, referencing the maxim “God helps those who help themselves” to stress the regime’s culpability. South Korean individuals and entities are required to seek the ministry’s approval to visit North Korea or make contact with its nationals. But the government has not given the green light, as it has virtually severed all formal and civilian exchanges and aid programs since the communist state’s fourth underground blast on Jan. 6. Seoul’s stance also reflects soured public sentiment following the latest explosion, as well as concerns the regime may siphon off any outside handouts for military and other undesirable uses. Military tension aside, critics say the across-the-board halt further confuses the Park Geun-hye administration’s about-face in its own principle that humanitarian assistance should carry on regardless of political ups and downs. The president reaffirmed that notion through a speech in the former East German city of Dresden in March 2014, vowing to expand humanitarian assistance as a key component of her vision of a “trust-building process.” “The fundamental basis regarding humanitarian support largely remains unchanged, but in carrying out such a program we also need to take into account the North’s continuous provocations and defiance of the international community’s denuclearization demands,” a Seoul official said. But another diplomatic source voiced the need for flood relief in a display of engagement with the North Korean people. “While intensifying pressure on the leadership, it’s imperative to deliver a different message to the ordinary citizens that we will embrace and help them now and after unification as well.” Opposition lawmakers also relayed calls for a two-track approach in dealing with the regime and rank-and-file citizens, warning of further damage with Typhoon Malakas inching closer to the peninsula after devastating Taiwan. “We can no longer delay government and civilian support from the humanitarian standpoint,” Rep. Woo sang-ho, the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s floor leader, said at a meeting of senior party members earlier in the day. “We should separately handle the North Korean authorities and the suffering people.”Rep. Joo Seung-yong of the minor opposition People’s Party echoed the view. “We need to explore the path for dialogue through humanitarian aid like flood relief,” he said while presiding over a separate party conference in place of interim chief Rep. Park Jie-won, who was visiting the US, calling for a “stick-and-carrot strategy.”  By Shin Hyon-hee","worst floods in decades ,the worst floods in ,from the worst floods ,pyongyang latest nuclear test ,the worst floods","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64776123  0.52185619

There has been a rise in the number of people calling for greater protection against the North's nuclear and missile threats.Besides detonating five nuclear devices since 2006, the North has launched intermediate-range and submarine-launched ballistic missiles that all sparked calls here for better countermeasures.Although the minor party has not yet announced it is abandoning its previous position on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense issue, observers said a rising number of party members are suggesting it should change strategy in the face of North Korean provocations.The People's Party has been protesting strongly against the deployment of the THAAD battery, claiming the issue must win parliament's approval. The government, on the other hand, says the case does not call for such a procedure.Political watchers said the change also comes as the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea decided to maintain a relatively neutral stance on THAAD, even after the inauguration of progressive-leaning head Choo Mi-ae.""We need to think about effective ways to impose sanctions against North Korea after the fifth nuclear test,"" Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, former head of the party, said, adding that the THAAD system can also be useful when inducing China to take stronger actions with Pyongyang.""The only bargaining chip we have when it comes to our relationship with China is the THAAD system,"" Ahn added.","pyongyang fifth nuclear test ,fifth nuclear test conducted ,political pundits said monday ,fifth nuclear test ,nuclear test conducted earlier","[""South Korea 's"", ""People 's Party"", 'US', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5109874   0.63635373

The Korea Meteorological Administration said the quake was the strongest recorded since 1978.Related to the move, Saenuri chief Lee Jung-hyun stressed that relief funds must be made available as soon as possible so that Gyeongju residents can make repairs to facilities and go back to their regular lives.Other party policymakers said that the government needs to take into account lost revenue caused by people postponing visits and schools canceling field trips to the city and surrounding areas that are rich in cultural sites.","earthquake last week official ,strongest earthquake last week ,designating quake hit gyeongju ,earthquake last week ,korea strongest earthquake last","['Saenuri Party', 'Gyeongju', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Office of Government Policy Coordination']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50196362  0.48215866

But they also warned the Korean Peninsula may henceforth experience severe earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater, calling for strengthened safety measures.Meanwhile, a number of industrial facilities in the southeastern part of the country, including a power plant, temporarily halted operations for safety inspections. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-an discusses measures to prevent earthquake with governemnt officials on Tuesday. Yonhap“It is highly likely that this earthquake is over, but there is the possibility that magnitude 5.8 or more may occur any time in the future,” Korea Meteorological Administration chief Ko Yun-hwa reported at a parliament-government earthquake countermeasure meeting.But chances are slim the magnitude will rise above 6.5, the KMA administrator added, citing the topographic features of the Korean Peninsula.“Considering the past earthquake records and the relatively short lengths of the faults, fatal earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 or more are not likely to occur here,” he said.A record magnitude 5.8 earthquake was detected at 8:32 p.m. on Monday, marking the strongest turbulence reported on the peninsula to date, according to the agency. The epicenter was reportedly some 8 kilometers south of Gyeongju, a tourist city known for its relics from the Silla Kingdom and located some 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul.This quake was preceded by a 5.1-magnitude tremor earlier at 7:44 p.m. which occurred some 9 kilometers south of the city.The second impact spread out to most parts of the country, resulting in 213 aftershocks across the country as of 1 p.m. Tuesday and delivering a tremor equivalent to magnitude 2 in the metropolitan region late Monday.No serious damages or fatal injuries were immediately reported, but two were killed after being hit by a KTX train that was moving on a delayed schedule due to the quake. A total of 23 were reported to be lightly injured in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, and 8,070 report calls were made in the region, according to the local government.In the southeastern part of the country, a number of businesses temporarily halted their operations for safety checks. Among them was a thermal power plant and local industry leader Hyundai Motor in Ulsan, the southern neighbor city to Gyeongju. The hours-long shutdown reportedly dropped the carmaker’s production output by some 65,000 cars.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, several textile plants also suspended production, causing some 40 million won  in losses. Chemical plants, too, followed suit in halting operations, but soon restarted as their facilities are designed to withstand a quakes up to 7.0 magnitude.Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., which operates the country’s nuclear plants, said none of its reactors, including those at the Wolsong, Hanul and Gori plants are close to the epicenter, were affected by the earthquake, adding they are still producing electricity. A combined cycle power plant in Ulsan, not far from Gyeongju, reported one of its thermal power generation units going offline.While the industrial circles moved to make up for the losses, the government set to administrative countermeasures, bracing itself for future disasters.The Ministry of Public Safety and Security, which came under fire for the lack of a proper response manual and for failing to send out disaster warning messages, pledged to expand its budget and facilities.“So far, we had to rely on civil communications networks instead of the government ones, which is why we faced a supply shortage in situations such as yesterday,” said the disaster management chief of the ministry at an emergency meeting at the National Assembly on Tuesday.The ministry is currently attempting to secure an exclusive network for disaster-related communications and to increase the government budget for earthquake-resistant facilities, he added.Also, President Park Geun-hye vowed in the Cabinet meeting to better equip key facilities, including the nation’s nuclear reactors, to withstand earthquakes in the future.“Taking this quake as an important lesson, we should fundamentally review our disaster measures,” she told government officials, urging them to dispatch investigation teams to the disaster scenes.By Bae Hyun-jung and news reports","south korea overnight seismic ,quake and its aftershocks ,said tuesday the quake ,experience severe earthquakes ,korea overnight seismic",['South Korea'],15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.44245443  0.45047703

The hearing opened at Kim Jae-jung Presidential Library and Museum in Mapo-gu, with most of the key government-related witnesses absent.The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has said the committee does not have legal grounds to hold any type of hearing, as its tenure was completed as of June 30 based on the special act on the Sewol disaster.Most of the key witnesses called in by the committee were absent, including officials of the maritime police and the Navy that had been in charge of the rescue operation.A total of 304 people, many of whom were high school students on a field trip, perished in South Korea’s worst maritime disaster in April 2014. Although some officials have been convicted, questions remain over the systematic fallout that led to the tragedy. They include the alleged negligence of the government in managing overloaded vessels and failed rescue operations.Members of the Sewol Special Committee hold its third hearing at the Kim Jae-jung Presidential Library and Museum in Mapo-gu, Seoul, Thursday. The committee has been seeking to investigate officials of the ship’s then operator Chonghaejin Marine Co., other high-ranking officials of the Korean Coast Guard and ship-inspecting organization Korean Register of Shipping, among others.It has also requested the appearance of ruling Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who is accused of attempting to censor a news report on the tragedy while he was serving as the senior presidential secretary at the time of the accident. He did not attend.On the first day of the hearing, witnesses, including survivors and employees of the ferry, gave their testimonies, suggesting rescue missions had been insufficient.Ryu Hee-in, a member of the committee, raised questions over some discrepancies found between the survivors’ testimonies and records of a digital video recorder that keeps track of the CCTV footage that had been handled by the authorities.The committee also raised allegations that Chonghaejin Marine Co. may have attempted to maximize its target sales by adding on the amount of transported construction materials.The Sewol committee found that the 6,835-ton ferry carried 2,215 tons of cargo, more than double its cargo limit of 987 tons at the time of its sinking.The hearing was held amid an ongoing hunger strike by family members of the victims that began last month in protest against the government’s decision to dissolve the committee.The government disbanded the Sewol Special Committee, citing the Sewol Special Act that took effect on Jan. 1, 2015. The act allowed the committee to conduct a probe for 18 months with another three months to report on their findings. The committee comprised members recommended by the rival parties, the bereaved families, the Supreme Court and the Korean Bar Association.Families of the victims and civic groups claim the committee was prematurely disbanded as its official launch date should be considered to be when the organization was allocated budget and manpower. They argue the committee has eight months more to operate.Despite the government refusing to cooperate, the committee has said it will bring in government officials from Cheong Wa Dae, the prosecution and the Maritime Ministry to question alleged peddling of influence in local media and the government’s lukewarm efforts to save lives.","2014 sewol ferry sinking ,in seoul on thursday ,government boycott the special ,thursday despite the government ,seoul on thursday despite","['Seoul', 'Kim Jae - jung', 'the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43044615  0.22111556

The building’s structure was too weak use heavy machinery in the rescue operation, and the number of workers assigned to the rescue had to be limited to 20 at a time to avoid a secondary collapse. Two of the workers were found to have been crushed to death by the debris.  A third was found to have survived, having stepped outside to smoke against a wall minutes before the sudden cave-in, avoiding the direct impact of the fallen roof.The authorities suspect that the workers had unwittingly knocked down a wall that supported the roof, mistaking it for a non-supporting partition wall to separate motel rooms. The mistake may have arisen partly because the building differed from typical Korean structures as it was built entirely of unreinforced brickwork, and blueprints of the original construction were missing, authorities said. The authorities plan to question whether there were any legal breaches in the reconstruction work. The first floor of the building is being used as a Chinese restaurant and the second floor is a hospital office area. The renovation had been intended to expand the hospital’s premises.

Since late July, Seoul and the South Korean Embassy in China have issued a multitude of safety and travel advisories for those who live or plan to visit regions near the North Korea-Chinese border. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is believed to have issued instructions for terror on the South, especially after the defection of 13 workers from a North Korean restaurant in China in April.The latest warning was delivered to the associations of South Koreans in China, calling for their members to pay attention to their safety and refrain from meeting with perceived North Koreans in the border regions. “There appears to be the possibility for a potential terror and kidnapping targeting our visiting or residing citizens given the recent defection of a senior North Korean official and the country’s threats of provocations,” the warning says, referring to the defection of Thae Yong-ho, a diplomat, from the North Korean Embassy in London.  “As we’ve said, North Korea continuously threatens provocations through official media, and unofficially there have been signs of threats, and the warning is a follow-up step to that,” Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said at a news briefing.

This is a 30 percent rise from last year.The surge is caused by the sweltering heat, during which the mites, named Haemaphysalis longicornis, become more active.The SFTS virus infection was first reported in the country in 2013, leading to 17 deaths among 36 patients. The number increased from 55 infected patients with 16 dead in 2014 to 79 infected cases with 21 dead in 2015. There is currently no vaccine or cure to treat the virus contracted from the mites. According to experts, humid and hot weather makes it easy for the mites to reproduce. The recent heat wave has led to at least 1 1/2 times more mites found outdoors, they added.Haemaphysalis longicornis Ten of the infected cases occurred in Daegu, where the daytime temperature soared to 36 degrees Celsius over the weekend.“The government should speed up the process to develop plans to curb the increasing number of mites, along with research in vaccine and treatment to prevent the rise in the number of health damages each year,” said Lee Hoi-sun, a professor of bioenvironmental chemistry at Chonbuk National University.Main symptoms of SFTS include high fever, nausea, diarrhea and stomach cramps.Since the symptoms are similar to those of flu, it is important to visit a hospital as soon as possible if there is persistent high fever, experts said. As mites mainly inhabit places along the riverside and near barns of livestock, experts encouraged people to stay away from such areas. For those who cannot avoid visiting such places, such as those who work on farms, they advised wearing long sleeves and taking a shower immediately afterward.By Kim Da-sol","30 percent fatality rate ,the heat wave nationwide ,increased number of virus ,health authorities said tuesday ,lethal mites south korean","['south korean', 'SFTS']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4077704   0.60672992

More than 160 similar reports of a gas odor were received within two hours on the same day, mainly from Jung-dong in Haeundae-gu and Yongho-dong and Daeyeon-dong in Nam-gu.Although Busan City immediately dispatched employees to check the gas pipes of the city, it found no gas leak. An official from the Busan City’s public health and environment research center collects samples from gas cargo trucks for analysis in Busan on Sunday. City authorities on Sunday collected samples from four gas cargo trucks and shipping vessels that passed by Gwangan Bridge for analysis. But Busan’s metropolitan public health and environment research center said it found no evidence of a leak there.Residents in Ulsan also complained about a suspicious gas odor shortly afterward.The Ulsan Fire Department said Monday that it received 25 calls complaining of severe gas odors from Saturday afternoon.Calls were mainly made from Sinjeong-dong, Yaeum-dong and Seonam-dong in Nam-gu, all within 5 kilometers of the Ulsan Petrochemical Complex.The fire department dispatched on Saturday nine fire trucks and firefighters to the plants to find gas leaks and check for gas levels in the air, but still found nothing extraordinary.With reports on the unidentified gas odor continuing, citizens raised concern that it may be early signs of earthquakes or malfunctions at a nuclear power plant in Gori near Busan.Experts, however, said no signs of earthquakes or malfunctions at the nuclear plant had been detected in Busan or Ulsan. “It is likely that a mass gas leak in Haeundae-gu in Busan or some other area could have wafted across the city via the wind,” said professor Oh Jae-hoh of Environmental Sciences and Technology from Pukyong National University.On Sunday, a photo of an aerial shot of Haeundae beach went viral on social media. The picture showed a swarm of ants moving in a line on the beach. Some netizens raised suspicions that such a swarm of ants might correlate with the spread of the gas odor, but experts said that the ants might just be moving in that manner to look for food.By Kim Da-sol","ulsan over the weekend ,gas odor plague busan ,ulsan over 200 reports ,around 30 on thursday ,suspected gas leak came","['Busan', 'Ulsan', 'the Busan Metropolitan Government', 'Haeundae']",15,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -4.10331041e-01

A suicide note next to his body indicated that he had suffered extreme stress at work. During the investigation into the death of Kim Hong-yeong, his father and colleagues highlighted the severe verbal abuse and mistreatment by his boss as the reasons why he took his own life. Text messages exchanged between Kim and his colleagues before his death were later made public, revealing that he had often complained about his boss’s unreasonable demands. For instance, Kim had said that when his work superior was heavily drunk, he would order him to come pick him up and take him home at night. Kim had also said that he wanted to commit suicide at least once a day whenever he heard his superior swearing at him. “He scolded me throughout the entire office dinner. I smiled while he swore at me, to help myself withstand it, but he then swore at me more, saying I was too confident. I just can’t stand it anymore. I want to die,” one of the messages read. 123rf.The tragic incident sheds light on South Korea’s prosecution, which is known for its strict top-down system. It is often described as “militaristic,” resembling an army division, and often involves punishing working hours, demanding workloads and humiliation. But this is not necessarily confined to the prosecution, as many South Korean workers can identify with the challenges Kim faced: a militaristic corporate culture and rigid hierarchy at work, to which they are expected to be obedient.While there have been efforts to change this culture, the top-down approach largely remains in many areas ranging from private corporations to academia.According to a survey on 889 Koreans released by the job portal Incruit in April, 71 percent of respondents said that they had experienced a militaristic culture at school and work, with 21 percent of them describing it as “rampant.” As examples of a militaristic company culture, they cited the authoritative manner of superiors, patriarchic owner-focused structures, superiors’ exercise of absolute power and an oppressive atmosphere in which they cannot speak up. In another survey of 2,819 employees by the job search engine Saramin, 15.3 percent of Koreans said that they had suffered physical abuse at their workplaces. Among them, 72.9 percent said it was their superiors who had inflicted such abuse. Kim Min-soo, 32, who has worked as a journalist for five years, said he was constantly told to do things without asking questions. “I was assigned to work that I was not in charge of, but I was still forced to do it without talking back because I would have been scolded otherwise,” he said. “I was even asked to throw away trash from my superior’s desk, basically running personal errands for him. Many people know it is unreasonable, but they adjust to the atmosphere so as not to be isolated or bullied.”A U.S. citizen, who wanted to be identified as Nicole, said that the business culture here is still rigid in that low-ranking employees are forced not to challenge the status quo.  “In the U.S., I was asked for input and ideas. They were valued even though I was a new and young worker. But here, people told me to keep quiet and do what I was told,” she said. “It led to a lot of unproductiveness.”When faced with the army-style corporate ladder, many young workers give up tolerating what they see as unreasonable treatment. As the cause, pundits have pointed to the growing gap between the baby boom generation born and raised under the military-backed governments and those younger, who are more educated and influenced by democratic and globalized values.According to a recent survey of 306 firms by the Korea Employer’s Federation, 27.7 percent of newly hired employees quit within a year in 2016, up 2.5 percent from 2014. The poll showed that 49.1 percent of them quit due to a failure to adjust to organizations. Some 20 percent of them did so because they were discontented with the pay and welfare at the company, and another 15.9 percent had complaints about their work environment. Mike Cha, who was mostly brought up abroad, is one of them. He left his job as a product and business development manager and started his own company a year ago.  “ if I had a voice , it would have at least helped me feel like I was contributing to the greater good,” he said. “But the biggest problem of Korean top-down business culture is that there are numerous cases where leaders make executive decisions and don’t take the fall for their consequences,” added Cha. Kim Bit-na, 25, who quit her job at a law firm last year, said that she could not stand being treated like a “plaything” at work, not as a member of the company.  123rf“I was forced to sing or dance in front of seniors only to entertain them at office dinners. When such a thing is already the culture entrenched in the organization, it is difficult to resist,” Kim said. “I think such a militaristic work culture is probably linked to corporate governance dominated by males.”“But women tend to assimilate themselves into such a culture to professionally advance in the competition,” she said. “My former female superiors would ask new employees to follow their ways, saying what they had been through was even worse.”As of June 2015, women account for only 2.3 percent of executive positions at the 500 largest companies, according to data compiled by CEO Score. “The authoritative company culture is directly related to bullying in the workplace,” said Gu Mi-young, a researcher at the Korea Women’s Development Institute, citing her research on 1,000 workers in the service industry. “Those at the bottom of the power game like women and irregular workers are most vulnerable to the system.” Jeong Ki-hoon, a 29-year-old engineering student in a doctorate course of a prominent university in Seoul, said that the top-down culture also exists in academia where creative ideas are encouraged. “My team runs based on a sense of brotherhood, father-son like relationships and taking care of each other, but it inevitably leads to a rigid to-down culture,” Jeong said. “Seniors often ignore juniors’ opinions, citing their lack of experience, but take all the credit when the results are good.”Jeong doubts whether a generational shift can bring a change to the hierarchical culture. “When I was a junior, I promised myself that I would not do the same to my juniors,” he said. “But thinking of what I have been through, I sometimes see myself behaving like my superiors  asking juniors personal favors and justifying myself.” But Kim Woong-ki, a 29-year-old working for one of the biggest family-run companies here, noted that the top-down corporate structure is not always bad. “I think it is a highly effective structure that juniors follow orders from experienced, skilled leaders. Making a decision that can satisfy everyone would take too much time and money,” Kim said. “With desirable leaders in place, subordinates can feel fulfilled and rewarded under the top-down system.” “But problems occur when superiors oppress juniors with power and force rather than their expertise and experience.” What also distresses him are the levels of hierarchies that require numerous approval processes and extensive steps of reporting to superiors. His ideas are often lost in the middle, he said.  Park Su-jin, a 28-year-old primary school teacher, said the Korean education system that focuses on rote-learning might have contributed to creating the top-down culture in Korean society. “I thought being a good student was doing as I was told when I grew up,” Park said.“But now I realize that the educational system oppresses students who stand out, or are outspoken and critical in class, pushing many of them to become more passive.”“The education system doesn’t really allow students to freely speak up and discuss things, especially due to tight schedules to prepare them for exams,” she said. “Teachers including myself are used to it because we have been taught that way our whole lives.”Experts point to the nation’s rapid industrialization under the authoritarian governments in the 1960s and 1970s, and also all able-bodied men’s collective experience of serving in the military, as the reasons for the military-driven culture in society.“I think that the primary basis for the corporate culture can be traced to Koreans’ mandatory military experience, coupled with strong patriarchy they have learned at home, school and work,” Lee Byung-hoon, a sociology professor at Chungang University said. “As they climb up the social ladder taking top positions, the militaristic culture lives on.”“Such a culture will only slowly change, if at all, when institutions are revamped according to growing awareness on human rights and democratic values,” he said. “Harsher punishments for those abusing their authority and education are needed.”Jeon Sang-gil, a professor teaching business administration at Hanyang University, stated that the top-down corporate system was once a useful strategy to rapidly develop the economy from the 1960s to 1990s. “Taking orders and getting things done to achieve goals was a driving force behind Korea’s rapid economic growth,” he said. The industries behind Korea’s economic development, such as manufacturing, steel, shipbuilding and construction, tend to have a more military-style leadership, he said, while the entertainment, tech and game industries usually have a more flexible work culture. He pointed out that Korean companies need to rethink their once-effective top-down management model in the face of growing global competition and the fast-changing business environment. “Korea is now in the position to become a first mover rather than follower. So companies should have more innovative, flexible and flatter company cultures to encourage freer communication,” he said. “It is a matter of survival for the country that has nothing but human capital.” To revamp the top-down working culture, companies’ wage and reward system as well as evaluation system should all be performance-based rather than based on time, he noted.As part of efforts to find new growth engines, some companies like SK Telecom and CJ Group have started simplifying job titles to promote the flow of innovative, creative ideas. In Korea, most employees address each other by their titles, not their names, which experts see as further consolidating the top-down system. South Korea’s largest tech company Samsung Electronics also recently announced measures to reform its personnel system, becoming the latest to join the move to restructure chains of command. It decided to reduce seven job titles to four. It also plans to minimize unnecessary reporting and meetings. Its plans did meet some skepticism, with critics questioning whether removing titles would be enough to shake up the seniority-centric atmosphere.“Many companies drop job titles to nurture flatter corporate culture, but the policy still focuses on changing the followers, not the leaders,” said Kwon Sang-jib, a business administration professor at Dongguk University. “Without leaders putting down their authority and setting an example, it is difficult to truly reform the corporate culture.”He noted that the changing expectations among the younger workforce are challenging companies to reform their top-down model, citing how an increasing number of young Korean workers are attracted to foreign companies. “As long as conglomerates hold on to the old-fashioned company culture, talented young individuals will look away and find opportunities elsewhere,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju Some interviewees featured in the article wished to use pseudonyms. -- Ed.","in southwestern seoul suicide ,33 year old prosecutor ,mistreatment by his boss ,old prosecutor hung himself ,southwestern seoul suicide note","['Seoul', 'Kim Hong - yeong', 'Kim']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38050571 -0.3378531

It is the first time that an incumbent top prosecutor has been placed behind bars since 1948 when South Korea’s prosecution system was established. Jin Kyung-joon, the 49-year-old prosecutor, is accused of taking 425 million won  from the online game maker Nexon Co. in 2005. He eventually used the funds to make some 12 billion won in profits through stock transactions as of last year. He is also accused of receiving a vehicle worth 30 million won -- a Genesis by Hyundai Motors – from Nexon under the name of his sister’s husband in 2008.Jin is also facing a separate corruption charge for a case in which he allegedly intentionally closed an internal investigation of tax evasion by the owners of the Hanjin Group, without making any charges against them, in 2010. Jin Kyung-joon appears for questioning at the prosecutors’ office on Thursday. YonhapIn return for Jin’s “favor,” Korean Air, which is owned by the Hanjin Group, is accused of signing massive business deals with Jin’s brother-in-law’s cleaning firm since 2010. The deals were worth 13 billion won, according to the prosecution. Following Jin’s arrest on Sunday, Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong offered a public apology. “I feel both embarrassed and terrible that a senior prosecutor, whose job requires integrity and exemplary behavior, has committed such an unimaginable corruption crime,” he said. “I will make sure the ongoing independent counsel probe into the case reveals the truth on all of the allegations, and ensure those responsible face justice.”Opposition party members belonging to the parliamentary judiciary committee have demanded Kim resign to take responsibility for the unprecedented scandal involving the incumbent top prosecutor.Jin, who passed his bar exam in 1988 and his civil service examination in 1989, started his career as a prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office in Seoul in 1995. He holds a Ph.D. and law bachelor’s degree from Seoul National University and also a master’s degree in law from Harvard University in the U.S. He briefly worked as a licensed attorney in New York from 1999-2002. In 2012, he received an award from the U.S. Department of Homeland and Security, for his collaboration with the DHS, especially the successful cases of recovery of the proceeds of crime. One of the mentioned achievements for the award included a case in which Jin and the DHS tracked down a criminal who made some 100 billion won in profits through fraud in Korea and used the funds to purchase real-estate assets in the U.S. The funds were reportedly recovered by the DHS and Jin at the time. The corruption allegations against Jin were made earlier this year after he reported a significant increase in his personal assets and wealth in 2015. All lawmakers and high-ranking government officials are required to share their personal wealth and assets every year. Following the allegations he offered to resign from his post in April, but the Justice Ministry did not accept his resignation.

""There has been suspicious movement in the area since the THAAD announcement and Seoul is examining all angles of the change, including the possibility of Pyongyang moving to detonate another nuclear device,"" he said, without going into too much detail.After the announcement of the decision to deploy the anti-ballistic missile system was made, the North's General Staff of the Korean People's Army warned that Pyongyang will take ""physical action"" to respond to what it called provocations by hostile forces.Related to the latest movement, another official said that while the pick-up in traffic may be related to the North conducting routine maintenance work, it could be a sign that the reclusive country may be moving to carry out another nuclear test, the second this year.On Jan. 6, the North conducted it fourth nuclear test, despite warnings from the international community. It detonated its first device in 2006, followed by two others in 2009 and 2013.South Korean policymakers, meanwhile, said they believe the North could detonate another nuclear device whenever North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gives the order to do so.","korean nuclear test site ,north korean nuclear test ,korean nuclear test ,intelligence sources on sunday ,at korea nuke test","['south korean', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'South Korea']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.32844388  0.51640534

It was the property’s bathroom sign -- it showed a stick figure animation of a male peeping tom looking into a female restroom. “I told the cashier -- who looked like the owner of the restaurant -- that the sign made me feel very uncomfortable and he should remove it,” the 23-year-old university student told The Korea Herald. “And his response was even more shocking. He was rather nonchalant about it, and said, ‘Oh, it was designed by the interior design firm . It’s just supposed to be funny.’ But it was not funny at all.”Voyeuristic public bathroom signs in restaurants in Seoul. About three months after this incident, Lee was distressed again to spot a similar public bathroom sign in another restaurant -- this time near Gangnam Station. “I was furious because the signs were being viewed as something comical, when what it’s portraying – voyeurism in public bathrooms -- is actually a crime,” said Lee. The discomfort was more acute as it was located in a district where a mass anti-misogynist campaign was held in May, in tribute to a woman who was murdered by a stranger that month in a public bathroom. The suspect had said he hated woman.While voyeurism has received relatively little attention as a sex crime in South Korea, there has recently been a rising number of cases that addressed the issue as a serious violation. Earlier this week, a group of male students at Seoul National University were accused of sharing photographs of fellow female classmates they secretly took in a private mobile chat room. The students also allegedly shared sexually abusive, and often misogynistic comments against the photographed women. The Seoul National University Human Rights Center has launched an investigation into the case. Voyeuristic public bathroom signs in restaurants in Seoul. In April, the government announced that it will close down Sora.net, a highly popular adult community site where users shared secretly taken pictures of women’s body parts, many of which were captured in public bathrooms using hidden cameras. The decision was made 10 years after it was first established as concerns and protests surged. The number of reports of sex crimes involving intrusive pictures of women increased dramatically here from 341 to 6,735 from 2005-2014.Lee said she could see a connection between the voyeuristic signs and the recent case at Seoul National University. “I read that one of the accused guys said that he didn’t have any ‘ill intentions’ against the women, and he and his friends were just having fun by making jokes,” she said. “Neither the conversation the male students shared nor the voyeuristic bathroom signs are funny. It’s almost like the general public became so used to the blurred lines of what should be considered as criminal activities and what are harmless jokes.”Min Soo-ji, a graduate student at Seoul National University, also had a disturbing experience while hanging out at a bar in Seoul’s Sinchon area. The women’s bathroom in the bar had two toilets beside one another and there was a poster stuck on the wall showing a drawing of a naked man holding a bottle of alcohol and a naked woman. The poster read, “Don’t be shy and pee and  together.”A vulgar poster put up at a women`s bathroom in a bar in Seoul's Sinchon district. Disturbed and furious, Min asked her male companion to check the men’s bathroom to see if it also had the same poster. It turned out the poster was only put up in the women’s bathroom. “The Public bathroom is a private space ,” the 25-year-old told The Korea Herald. “I think putting up posters like this -- both sexually explicit and vulgar -- only in women’s bathroom can be seen as a product of sexism and misogyny. It almost felt like the poster had a connotation that women’s public bathrooms are where sexual activities take place.”Kim Young-ran, a researcher at the Korean Women’s Development Institute, said the “joke” should be taken more seriously as they can be considered a criminal act. “If such signs were put up in a private space, that’s one thing. But to allow such signs in the public space gives the wrong idea that it is okay to spy on women,” she said. There is a need for a government-led initiative and regulation against such loose perception and tolerance toward voyeurism, she added.Inside a public women`s bathroom in a bar in Seoul`s Sinchon area, with a vulgar poster put up on the wall. The men's bathroom in the same property had no such poster inside, according Min Soo-ji. The owner of the restaurant in Gangnam, who refused to be named, said the sign had been up for nearly seven years and no one has ever complained about it until The Korea Herald contacted him. He said although he’s willing to remove the sign, he personally does not understand why it is problematic. “So we are now living in a society where even this -- which was created to be funny -- can’t be tolerated as a joke?” he said. Both the Women‘s Policy Bureau and Women’s Rights Promotion Bureau at the Gender Ministry declined to comment on the issue, saying the Ministry of the Interior is in charge of policies on public bathrooms. “We might need a new legislation to tackle this issue,” said an official from the Ministry of Interior. “At the same time, regional governments, not the central government, are responsible for coming up with their own detailed policies and regulations on public restrooms.”Lee Da-kyung said the incidents reminded her of her childhood when male classmates would often pick on her and even hit her on her private parts. When confronted by her parents, the boy’s parents said it was because the boy was showing her affection.“I think they all share the same narrative and patterns -- framing the victims as ‘too sensitive’ and perpetuators as ‘those just trying to be funny.'""By Claire Lee","her boyfriend at restaurant ,toilet signs in seoul ,in seoul stir controversy ,boyfriend at restaurant near ,boyfriend at restaurant","['Lee Da - kyung', 'Seoul National University', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74080342 -0.15966986

At 9:24 p.m., a magnitude-2.6 aftershock was detected in nearby cities, including Busan and Daegu, according to the state weather agency. The Ministry of Public Safety and Security said there had been no reports of casualties or damages from the shock waves as of Wednesday afternoon. The Ulsan Fire Department said Wednesday it has fully mobilized its workforce overnight and are continuing to watch out for reports of casualties or property damages. An official from the Korea Meteorological Agency points to the screen while observing data on a magnitude 5.0 earthquake detected near waters off the southeastern Ulsan city on Tuesday evening. Yonhap“I felt the ground vibrating while I was sitting in a restaurant. The building was shaky as if we were inside a makeshift building,” said Kim Hyung-zip, a 39-year-old office worker in Seoul, who was visiting Ulsan at the time.“But most of the people in the building stayed nonchalant without bothering to evacuate. It made me think whether we are a little bit ignorant about safety when it comes to earthquakes,” he added.The Korean Peninsula has long been considered safe from earthquakes, located away from the Pacific seismic belt “Ring of Fire.”According to the Korea Meteorological Agency, however, small and mid-sized earthquakes have continued to occur over the past three decades. A total of 1,212 earthquakes have been detected since 1978, and six of them have been earthquakes with a magnitude exceeding 5.0.The scale of earthquakes goes from a magnitude of 1 to 10, with higher numbers being the strongest and accompanied by ground vibrations, tidal waves and storms.“We have been recently detecting frequent occurrences of small-scale earthquakes, although the peninsula is located at the fault zone, which normally leads to brittle shock waves,” said an official from KMA. Experts warned that without ample preparations and disaster prevention measures, there could be a greater risk of damages when tremors of a magnitude of 7 or higher occur.“When strong shock waves are detected in nearby countries such as Japan, it may add on to shock waves felt by the Korean Peninsula,” Hong tae-kyung a professor of earth system science at Yonsei University told The Korea Herald. “Earthquakes of magnitude over 7.0 can create more secondary shocks in neighboring areas, which last from five to a maximum eight years,” he added.Lack of earthquake-proof facilities and measures across the nation is also problematic.According to Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport data, in 2015, just 26.7 percent of three-story or over-13-meter-high buildings in Seoul were built based on earthquake-proof designs. The total figure across the country was slightly above 34 percent.The current enforcement decree of the Building Act, which took effect in 1988, states that buildings over 13 meters high with a total floor area of 500 square meters must be built with earthquake-proof designs.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security came under fire for causing confusion among the public when issuing a warning for Tuesday’s earthquake near Ulsan.The ministry was criticized after it sent disaster warnings via text message to residents in just eight districts in Ulsan city and counties in South Gyeongsang Province. The date of the earthquake occurrence was also mistyped. Those without LTE smartphones or using phones released before 2013 could not receive the ministry’s warnings. The ministry later explained it had followed due regulations in sending the warnings to residents in areas with over magnitude-4.0 earthquakes.Meanwhile, the Hanbit nuclear power plant -- the only power station located on the western coast in South Jeolla Province -- was reported to have detected shock waves Tuesday evening, according to Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. Tuesday’s earthquake was 325 kilometers away from the Habit nuclear power plant.The KHNP said that the 0.0004g seismic value -- “g” is used to express peak ground acceleration -- detected was far below the plant’s level of constructed earthquake-proof value at 0.2g. Korean nuclear power plants are required to be built with earthquake-proof designs so that they will automatically stop operating when a seismic value is detected over 0.18g.The KHNP added that the plant’s No. 2 unit had been suspended for a “planned accident-prevention checkup.” Its other five units were still in operation as of Wednesday afternoon.By Kim Da-sol","experts following magnitude earthquake ,tuesday the shock wave ,following magnitude earthquake ,ulsan on tuesday evening ,following magnitude earthquake detected","['Ulsan', 'the Busan Regional Office of Meteorology']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35142264  0.50156957

The research, conducted by DWFF to mark the Gender Equality Week between July 1 and 7 found that only 51 percent of the Daegu female population held a job or earned money, which was 22 percent less than their male counterparts, whose financially active population reached 72 percent. The biggest obstacle to women’s financial activity was child care, which took up 48 percent of the reason for staying at home, and social prejudice and discrimination against working women, which took up 20 percent. Among the women who worked, the level of those who held a non-permanent job was 44 percent, higher than the male percentage of 30 percent.Average monthly income for women was 1.43 million won, 59 percent of the male wage of 2.44 million won. In a double-income family, Daegu women typically spent an average of 2 1/2 hours on daily household chores while in comparison men spent 40 minutes. The average marriage age in Daegu was 32.5 years-old for men and 30.2 years-old for women.The DWFF said 6 percent of Daegu women felt they were safe, while 54 percent thought they lacked security.

The heavy downpour also caused floods, traffic jams and the collapse of some facilities.The Korea Meteorological Administration said 119 millimeters of rain poured down in Seoul as of 2:20 p.m. Tuesday. A heavy rain warning has been issued for Seoul and the central regions with the daily precipitation of the capital expected to be 180mm or more within 12 hours.A citizen watches Paldang Dam dumping around 3,409 tons of water per second after being hit by torrential rain in Hanam, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. As of Tuesday afternoon, the KMA issued heavy rain warnings for cities in Gyeonggi, Gangwon and North Chungcheong provinces. A heavy rain warning is issued when at least 110mm of rain is predicted to pour down for six hours or at least 180mm of rain is predicted to fall for 12 hours. The KMA said up to 300mm of rain is predicted to pour down in the central region until Wednesday, as tropical storm Nepartak makes its way into a stretch of the western Pacific Ocean, influencing skies of East Asian countries.About 200 residents have evacuated a town in Uljin County in North Gyeongsang Province, due to a possible landslide from nearby mountains.Authorities said they are looking for four residents aged 60 to 70 in a small town in Jeongseon County in Gangwon Province, who went missing at 3 a.m. on Tuesday after a car capsized by the stream due to floodwaters.More than a dozen of flights heading to Gimhae in South Gyeongsang Province, Ulsan and Jejudo Island were cancelled on Tuesday morning due to adverse weather conditions, according to the Korea Airport Corporation. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry said Hwanggang Dam of North Korea appears to have reached its full water level and that they are watching closely for a possible discharge of water without prior notice.“We are maintaining communication with the relevant organizations for a possible discharge,” said ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun. He added that it would be inappropriate to currently determine whether or not the North’s discharge without notification would be an attack through intentional flooding.Hwanggang Dam is located on the mainstream of Imjin River, some 42.3 kilometers north of the Military Demarcation Line. It is estimated to hold between 300 million to 400 million tons of water. A sudden discharge from the dam can inflict damage in the areas near Yeoncheon County in Gyeonggi Province. North Korea has previously discharged water without notifying the South twice in May, causing damages to fishermen operating in the river.Meanwhile, damages from the rain were reported throughout the day in Seoul, including some 11 districts that suffered from sewage reflux and at least 2,000 families in Gangseo-gu reported experiencing power outages. The Seoul Metropolitan Government said the restoration was completed on Tuesday afternoon.The embankment of some houses collapsed in Jung-gu, while a 1-meter-wide and 1 meter-high sinkage was created in a street near the Mapo Bridge over the Hangang River, causing nearby roads to close for several hours.The SMG closed off traffic to Cheonggyecheon Stream, Jamsu Bridge and some parts of Dongbu Expressway, due to the increasing level of the Hangang River.Weather forecasters encouraged people to be aware of accidents amid torrential rains accompanied by thunder. Contrary to the heavy rain that pounded most of the cities in the central regions of the peninsula, the southern provinces and Jeju Island have been experiencing a heat wave. Jeju Island witnessed an overnight low of 26.2 degrees Celsius on Monday night and has issued a heat wave warning.Cities like Gwangju, Jeongeup and Gochang in North Jeolla Province and Mokpo in South Jeolla Province also witnessed the tropical night phenomenon for the first time this year, which has arrived earlier than previous years.The earliest was in Mokpo on July 10, last year. A tropical night phenomenon is observed when the overnight low hits over 25 degrees Celsius, from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m.The KMA said that the peninsula is under the influence of a seasonal rain front, accompanied by heavy rain clouds which are moving northward. It added that southern regions will see sporadic rainfall due to this.The KMA predicted that torrential rain would start again in the third week of July in all regions.By Kim Da-sol","heavy rainfall pounded seoul ,tuesday heavy rain warning ,heavy monsoon rain pounds ,20 tuesday heavy rain ,tuesday heavy rain","['Seoul', 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34668708 -0.1193035

The case came to light as the student reported what had happend to the school nurse, who then alerted a female officer who was managing students at another school, who then passed the case to Busan Saha Police Station. The Saha Police Station’s section chief verified and confirmed the facts with Kim and the school, however, closed the case without reporting to higher authorities by advising Kim to resign. Kim handed in his notice the next day, on June 9, saying he had “decided to continue his parents’ business.” He received no punishment and received his severance pay.  When the case belatedly erupted over social media on Friday, the section chief denied having had any knowledge of the incident prior to Kim’s resignation.A 31-year-old police officer at Busan Yeonje Police Station also had a sexual relationship with a high school student he was supervising. The teenager reportedly contemplated taking her life after the incident. Whether the two had sex more than once is yet to be confirmed. The case was discovered by a teenagers’ welfare organization that had had a consultation session with the student. When the organization attempted to verify the case with Jeong, he filed for resignation from his post on May 17, claiming that being a police officer did not “fit his aptitude.”Yeonje Police Station said it had completely been in the dark until the nonprofit organization contacted the Station regarding the matter on May 23. Busan Metropolitan Police Agency will probe the case to determine when the Yeonje Police Station knew about Jeong’s misconduct and why they chose not to alert the BMPA.The Agency is also investigating whether coercion had been involved in the two policemen’s sexual relationship with teenage students, which would give legal grounds to punish the men through the courts. In South Korean law, punishment for having sex with minors is stipulated as applicable only when the victims are below 14 years old, unless the sexual act was forced. To prevent a reoccurrence, the BMPA will appoint more female officers to school monitoring. Female officers will be assigned to girls high schools, and male officers to boys schools. A pair of male and female officers will be allotted to co-eds.

Critics said President Park Geun-hye will face opposition from the public as she earlier vowed to build a fresh new airport in the southeastern part of the country for balanced growth with the capital.The government has been claiming that Park never broke her promise, as the scope of the renovation of Gimhae International Airport is as big as building a new airport. ""As there will be a the construction of an independent control tower, the project should be dubbed New Gimhae International Airport,"" Kang argued.The expansion project calls for not only a new control tower, but also a new 3,200 meter runway to augment the two already in operation, a new terminal, and expanded transportation infrastructure to make it easier for people to access the airport.After construction is completed, the airport will be able to handle upwards of 40 million people annually. Currently, it is only equipped for 17 million.Despite such explanations, the latest polls showed that residents in North Gyeongsang Province, who had wanted a new airport in Miryang, expressed their frustration. According to data compiled by Gallup, 52 percent of the respondents in Daegu and North Geyongsang had negative views on Park's performance as president this week, up a sharp 15 percentage points from a week earlier. Only 37 percent said they still supported the chief executive.The drop is noteworthy since the region staunchly supported the president in the past.","korea transportation minister apologized ,transport minister expresses apologies ,transportation minister apologized to ,transportation minister apologized ,minister apologized to the","['Korea', 'Milyang', 'Busan', 'Kang Ho - in']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50723612  0.16008241

The ruling by the Seoul Administrative Court comes nearly a year after civic groups, including Green Korea United and the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, filed a suit against the Environment Ministry to demand the result of the inspection be revealed to the public.The Environment Ministry conducted on-site investigations of the alleged contamination at U.S. military bases across the country in May 2015, prior to the scheduled relocation of key military bases to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, by 2017. Civic groups demand the government release information about the level of pollution at the U.S. military base in central Seoul at press conference held near the camp Thursday. YonhapThe ministry rejected the civic groups’ request for the disclosure of the inspection results on underground water systems and land at the bases, citing “diplomatic issues.” Earlier in the day, the nongovernmental groups held a press conference in Itaewon near the Yongsan-based U.S. Eighth Army Command in central Seoul, criticizing the Korean government for overlooking the health and safety of its people.“The U.S. military and Korean government decide how much the U.S. military should be responsible for contamination at its former bases ahead of relocation. Our lands in Busan and Dongducheon  were returned to us contaminated,” said Shin Soo-yeon, an activist for Green Korea United. They urged the government to reveal sufficient information on contamination at the bases to reopen the negotiation and make “fair” agreements in terms of costs the U.S. Army should cover to clean up the sites. Since 1988, there have been 14 reported cases of environmental contamination involving U.S. bases here.In 2000, the U.S. Eighth Army Command was found to have dumped untreated toxic waste into the Hangang River, a major source of drinking water for Seoul residents. In 2001 and 2006, oil was spilled from the U.S. Army Garrison and Camp Kim in Yongsan, contaminating underground water systems in the neighborhood.

92,92, Lotte probe may have political implications,"Prosecutors signaled a full-fledged crackdown on South Korea’s fifth-largest conglomerate and retail giant Lotte Group last week with extensive raids, in an apparent move to trace the financial malpractices of its current top executives.The intense probe, coming in the penultimate year of the incumbent presidency, has widely kindled speculation of eventually targeting the previous administration and its links to the...","Prosecutors signaled a full-fledged crackdown on South Korea’s fifth-largest conglomerate and retail giant Lotte Group last week with extensive raids, in an apparent move to trace the financial malpractices of its current top executives.The intense probe, coming in the penultimate year of the incumbent presidency, has widely kindled speculation of eventually targeting the previous administration and its links to the feud-ridden conglomerate.Last Friday, Lotte Group was turned upside down as some 240 investigators from the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office raided its key business locations, including the group’s headquarters in central Seoul and the personal residence of its chairman Shin Dong-bin.The notable raids were rooted in the allegations that group founder Shin Kyuk-ho and his two sons Dong-joo and Dong-bin were accountable for amassing some 300 billion won  in slush funds through embezzlement.Lotte Group`s headquarters in central Seoul Prosecutors also gestured at looking into the group’s overseas monetary transactions, focusing on the accusation that it has been paying out most of its profits to shareholding Japanese entities -- a phenomenon often described by the local media as “outflow of national wealth.”According to the Fair Trade Commission, the group’s de facto holding company Lotte Hotel paid 121.3 billion won in 2011-2015 in dividends to its Japanese entity stakeholders, which account for 99.28 percent of total shares.Soon, the focus stretched to whether the ultimate target of the probe was to dig into the possibilities of influence-peddling over the permission for construction by the President Lee Myung-bak administration of the group’s much-disputed landmark building in southern Seoul, although officials have denied the notion thus far.“We are aware that people take a keen interest in the issue, but for various circumstances, Lotte World Tower is not subject to immediate prosecutorial probe,” said an official of the central prosecutor’s office Monday.Despite such denial, however, observers point out that it may be likely for the incumbent Park Geun-hye administration to level gunpoint at the former Lee administration by using Lotte Group as the connecting factor.The 123-story skyscraper in Jamsil has been at the heart of public dispute, partly for a number of fatal safety accidents during construction and also for the extent of the former administration allegedly having bent the rules to greenlight the construction of East Asia’s tallest building.The construction project, said to be the lifelong ambition of group founder Shin, had been dismissed under the three administrations preceding Lee’s, mainly due to concerns on Air Force planes’ safety.But as soon as Lee, formerly chief of Hyundai Engineering & Construction, took office in 2008, the long-thwarted plan suddenly picked up momentum, finally breaking ground in 2010.In order to avoid risks of air clashes, the Air Force’s Seoul Air Base in Seongnam, located 5.5 kilometers south of the disputed high-rise, had to shift its runways slightly.On Tuesday, investigators reportedly uncovered a money trail leading from Lotte Group to a retired Air Force lieutenant general who served as the deputy chief of staff, with suspicion of the conglomerate having handed 1.2 billion won to a construction firm headed by the retired general in 2008. The fact that Lotte Group marked exponential growth during Lee’s five-year term further boosted suspicions on under-the-table contacts. The conglomerate not only inked 26 cases of mergers and acquisitions during that time, but also stepped into the beverage market and won a monopolistic status in the duty-free shop sector. Its total assets more than doubled, from 40 trillion won in 2007 to 84 trillion in 2012.Adding fuel to the political scenario is the prosecution’s previous practices of kicking off irregularity charges against former powers and their aides, especially when the incumbent president is in trouble.The most conspicuous and tragic example was a corruption probe in 2009, Lee’s second year in office, on his predecessor President Roh Moo-hyun.The issue was raised while Lee‘s approval ratings had crashed to a record low in the aftermath of the U.S. beef import dispute the previous year. The pressing investigation included the first-ever summoning of a former president for prosecutorial questioning. Roh committed suicide on May 23, 2009 in the midst of the escalating investigation.Defensive of public criticism, some prosecutors claimed that such charges against faded powers should be seen as justice delayed, rather than a back-scratching alliance with the current power.“It is highly difficult to obtain information on crimes involving incumbent powers,” Kim Hong-il, former chief prosecutor in Busan and currently senior lawyer at Shin & Kim, said in an academic forum held at Lotte Hotel Busan in April.But once the administration changes, evidence of past crimes tends to make an appearance, which is when authorities gear up for investigation, he explained.“Because of the time gap , the prosecution is often blamed for chasing after ‘dead powers’ like hyenas, but one should accept the reality to a certain extent.”Observers thus predicted that Lotte’s alleged affiliation with the former Lee government will eventually rise to the surface.“The  Lotte World Tower is quite likely to rise as a probe agenda, sometime or another,” said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebol.com, a local research company on South Korea’s conglomerates.“If so, the issue will deliver a considerable impact on the political circles.”Some, especially those in opposition political parties, suggested that the prosecution’s full-fledged probe on Lotte may be a diversion from the recent set of scandals involving high-ranking former prosecutors.Among them is former chief prosecutor Choi Yoo-jeong, who was arrested last month on charges of taking kickbacks and influencing the rulings of clients, including cosmetics firm CEO Jung Woon-ho. Hong Man-pyo, a former star prosecutor, was charged with intervening for the court verdicts of his clients in exchange for astronomical fees.“The probe should be implemented thoroughly, but an attempt to turn public attention away from legal scandals may never be tolerated,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea in a written statement.By Bae Hyun-jung","korea fifth largest conglomerate ,crackdown on south korea ,week with extensive raids ,lotte group last week ,giant lotte group last","['South Korea ’s', 'Lotte Group']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50122738  0.4620854

This has tempted Chinese fishing boats to illegally intrude into these areas. Related to the South Korean operations that continued into Monday, North Korea did not respond or react in any way, the military said.The North's pronounced silence, meanwhile, caused local media to raise the possibility that the cash-strapped country might have sold fishing rights in the neutral waters to China.""I think there is a possibility,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun said when asked to verify the speculation.

The nation's law on atomic power safety calls for an immediate report of any trouble associated with radiation to the commission.The incident was disclosed belatedly after a tip-off to the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety under the commission.The company was also found to have breached the rule requiring at least two workers to work together in a team for such radiation test work.The NSSC held a meeting on the matter on May 26 and decided to bring it to prosecutors. The head of the company and three other senior officials will face a formal investigation.Many South Koreans are already upset by the death of a 19-year-old worker in a May accident attributable to poor safety measures by a subcontractor with Seoul Metro, a subway operator here. He was killed while working by himself to repair a screen door at a Seoul subway station.","violating law on nuclear ,south korean presidential panel ,punish local radiographic inspection ,presidential panel said monday ,nuclear safety an employee","['south korean', 'Anseong , Gyeonggi Province']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05219225  0.4837977

The Xinmin Evening News said there were two explosions within five seconds. They originated from two pieces of luggage placed about 15 metres  apart, the local newspaper said.Online video clips showed dense grey smoke rising to the ceiling of the cavernous terminal, and paramilitary security forces rushing into the building immediately after the incident. Photos posted online by those claiming to be witnesses showed police keeping people back from the scene and abandoned luggage littering the floor.The incident came as people returned home after a public holiday and just days before Thursday's opening of a Disney theme park in Shanghai.There have been several cases in China of disgruntled individuals setting off explosions or starting fires in revenge for perceived wrongs.In 2013 a wheelchair-bound man from southern China detonated a homemade bomb at Beijing international airport in a protest at alleged police brutality.The man, Ji Zhongxing, was later sentenced to six years in jail. Last year an unemployed man set off an explosion at a public park in the eastern province of Shandong, killing himself and another person and wounding 24.","airport shanghai blast caused ,made explosives injured four ,injures four at shanghai ,shanghai airport shanghai blast ,blast at pudong airport","['China', 'Shanghai', 'Terminal two', 'the Shanghai Airport Authority']",15,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.19858889  0.18183254

The ACT decided to cancel the test soon after it received “credible evidence” that the test materials had been leaked, Colby said. “We are extremely concerned about any activities that could impact the fairness and integrity of the test. When individuals attempt to profit by stealing test materials and selling them, it can hurt thousands of students who did nothing wrong, as it has in this case,” Colby said in an email conversation. Colby said he couldn't comment on when and how the test materials might have been leaked because the incident is still under investigation. He said the ACT exams will be administered in South Korea and Hong Kong again in September. The sudden cancellation of the exam caused confusion in South Korea, where many students didn't know of the decision until they arrived at the test sites, according to teachers from private “cram schools” in affluent southern Seoul that specialize in preparing students for the tests. ACT emails notifying students of the cancellations didn't reach inboxes until nearly 7 a.m., an hour before students were to arrive at test sites, they said.“It's frustrating for students, including those who had been planning to use the scores for early decision admissions at U.S. schools,” said a cram school teacher who had prepared four students to take the test. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear she might anger her clients if she allowed her name to be used.“Parents have asked whether they should prepare their kids to take the exams in other countries like Japan in the future, because they are worried that the cheating problems could reoccur here, as it had with the SATs,” she said. South Korea has struggled to clamp down on cheating on standardized English and college admission tests and similar problems have been reported in other Asian countries. The College Board, the New York-based testing firm that oversees the SAT college entrance exams, canceled tests in China and Macau in January over concerns that some students had seen copies of the tests in advance. The College Board was forced to cancel SATs in South Korea in 2013 for similar reasons.","exam on saturday canceled ,saturday canceled the tests ,exams canceled in south ,act exams canceled in ,canceled in south korea","['SEOUL', 'South Korea', 'AP', 'ACT', 'South Korea', 'Hong Kong', 'ACT', 'Edward Colby']",15,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.33349922  0.48356837

In late May, Kim was hit by a train while fixing screen doors on the station platform in Seoul. Public outrage followed as the junior employee was found to have been working alone when he should have had a partner.Safety regulations are sometimes overlooked due to manpower shortages, said industry sources.","police raid seoul subway ,worker death police raided ,police raid seoul ,police raided the headquarters ,seoul subway operator thursday","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Seoul', 'PSD']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29258069  0.14879794

(Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)On Saturday, a week after a 19-year-old irregular worker died while repairing a screen door on a subway platform at Guui Station, hundreds of people took to the streets calling f...","Citizens pay tribue to 19-year-old worker, surnamed Kim, who was killed by an arriving train while repairing a safety door on subway platform, at the memorial site inside Guui Station in eastern Seoul, Saturday. On Saturday, a week after a 19-year-old irregular worker died while repairing a screen door on a subway platform at Guui Station, hundreds of people took to the streets calling for a fundamental change to a “money-focused” society. Since the worker’s death on May 28, platform 9-4 at Guui Station has turned into a massive memorial site, drawing thousands of sympathetic mourners who left flowers, food items and post-it notes on the screen door.  Post-it memos attached to a screendoor on subway platform inside Guui Station. The majority of the post-it notes lamented businesses attempting to slash costs at the expense of workers’ safety and welfare. Some of them said: “How many more people should die in the name of efficiency?” “His death was not a mere unfortunate accident” and “I am here thanks to you who have worked in dangerous conditions.”The subway mechanic, surnamed Kim, was killed after being trapped between the screen door and an arriving train while fixing a malfunctioning safety door on the platform by himself at Guui Station in eastern Seoul. The death of Kim, who was hired in a temporary position through subway operator Seoul Metro’s subcontractor Eunseong PSD, shed light on a myriad of structural problems including companies’ cost-saving practices, negligence of safety guidelines and poor working conditions. “I came because I realized that I could not sit back any longer. I felt that my husband could die like Kim someday,” said a 29-year-old freelance designer Lee So-young whose husband also does a maintenance job on subway platforms. “What I am sorry about the most is that I could not take action earlier, though I knew about the situation facing irregular subway workers,” she said while shedding tears. She is now one of scores of volunteers taking it in turns to watch over the memorial site at Guui Station. It was later known that the young contracted worker was paid 1.44 million won  per month, little more than the minimum wage, and was expected to fix the screen door within an hour to avoid penalties.  Flowers, food items and birthday cake on a subway platform at Guui Station. At the memorial site, there was a birthday cake to celebrate Kim’s birthday on May 29, hot meals, bread, snacks and instant noodles. The teenage mechanic’s bag had contained cup instant noodles presumably because he had no time to have a proper meal.“Dear Kim, I am sorry that I cannot do anything for you. I prepared a meal, spoon and chopsticks for you for your birthday. Enjoy it and hope you rest in peace in heaven. This wasn’t your fault,” wrote a mother of two girls, who left a plate of hot rice and bulgogi on the platform for Kim. Hong Eun-jeon, a 38-year-old teacher, said that Kim’s death has highlighted the obsession with efficiency and money that prevails in society. “I came here because I am angry about the government and companies putting workers in danger only to save costs. I feel that I cannot be safe anymore in the society.”  Citiznes pay a silent tribute for the deceased 19-year-old worker at Guui Station. When the deadly accident took place, Kim was not accompanied by a supervisor or a walkie-talkie to warn him of an arriving train as required by formal regulation. Kim was required to work in a team of two, but such rules are seldom kept to save time and cost, according to testimonies by Kim’s colleagues and other maintenance workers at Seoul Metro.Seoul Metro initially blamed the subcontractor for failing to abide by safety guidelines. According to the contract, the subcontractor is required to take charge of any accidents.As public criticism surged, the subway operator later offered an apology and pledged to create a subsidiary in charge of maintenance operations at subway stations to directly manage the platform doors. The outsourcing of safety-related jobs is what labor unions and civic groups see as a reason behind the continued occurrence of fatal accidents. In 2013, another screen door maintenance worker was killed after being hit by a train while fixing a screen door at Seongsu Station. An employee from the same company died from a similar accident at Gangnam Station in 2014. The subway workers’ union and civic groups called on Seoul Metro to stop outsourcing safety-related workers and hire irregular safety workers as full-time employees.  Citizens march in a rally on Saturday in tribute to a subway worker who was killed while repairing a screen door at Guui Station on May 28, sparking heated debate over the unfair treatment of irregular workers. At around 6:30 p.m., some 200 mourners gathered outside exit 1 at Guui Station to hold a rally demanding safer working conditions for irregular workers after paying a silent tribute on platform 9-4. Park Beom-jin, 21, who works as a subway mechanic for one of the subcontractors under Seoul Metro, argued that Kim would have not died if he was a regular employee. “He had hoped to become a regular worker one day. It could have happened to me or to my friends. At this very moment, young irregular workers are being injured or killed because of dangerous working conditions,” he said.  Mourners hold up posters reading ""Human lives should come first before money"" and ""Stop outsourcing safety-related work"" outside Guui Station, Saturday. As dusk gathered, they silently marched about 2 kilometers toward Konkuk University Hospital where an altar to Kim has been set up. The participants held up placards that read: “Human lives before money,” “Death of Kim is not accidental” and “We have responsibility to change the society.”Many of the participants were in their 20s and 30s. “I agree that this is murder by the flawed structure of the society,” said a 22-year-old university student Lee Young-seon while marching. “I now know that we cannot improve our lives simply by working hard. We  are crushed by life. As it is difficult to get a regular job, I could be the next one holding an irregular job and suffering from poor conditions,” she said. “I thought that raising my voice was a first step to improve the situation.”As the mourners arrived in front of Konkuk University Hospital, the deceased Kim’s mother greeted them and expressed her gratitude.  Mourners vow to mother of the deceased 19-year-old worker in front of the altar at Konkuk University Hospital, Saturday. “Thank you for coming despite your busy schedule. My son’s honor was restored by citizens here,” she told the unexpectedly large crowd, weeping. “I hope my boy doesn’t get hungry anymore up there thanks to you.” The crowd holding flowers and candles in response said, “Cheer up! We will stand by your side until the end.”By Ock Hyun-ju","death of subway worker ,worker died while repairing ,scene death of subway ,in eastern seoul saturday ,death of subway","['citizen', 'Kim', 'Guui Station', 'Seoul', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28051394 -0.13582781

The amount is to be determined based on the level of actual physical injury, officials said.The government also plans to provide a daily average of 70,000 won to help underprivileged victims hire caretakers. Along with the financial support, the government plans to provide the victims and their families with psychological treatment or counseling so that they can better handle mental suffering.The government also decided to expand the number of hospitals designated to determine if a person has been affected by humidifier disinfectants.The Asan Medical Center in Seoul has been the only hospital designated to confirm victims. But five additional hospitals in Seoul and the surrounding areas, including the National Medical Center, and three more hospitals in provincial regions will also carry out screening processes.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between the people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.South Korea has confirmed 221 victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products.

Sources said they are likely to have arrived on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning. A North Korean restaurant in Shanghai is seen in this file photo. The three workers are believed to have deserted their workplace, a Pyongyang-run restaurant in China’s northwestern province of Shanxi, on around May 16, and they have been staying at a shelter in Thailand. They reportedly used a land route without passports. North Korea operates restaurants overseas -- mostly in Asia -- for the purpose of acquiring foreign currency. But the number of customers at such places are believed to have dwindled considerably since the U.N. Security Council slapped economic sanctions on the North in March.It marks the second defection of North Korea’s overseas restaurant workers since 13 employees at a China-based restaurant arrived in Seoul in April. The Unification Ministry said then that the sanctions have affected the mass defection.The ministry confirmed the mass defection later in the day, but refused to verify the routes taken by the defectors.In response to the recent mass defection, North Korea claimed that the South kidnapped the defectors in April. In an interview with CNN, arranged by North Korean authorities, the defectors’ families claimed that the 13 workers had been kidnapped and are being starved by the South Korean government.The South Korean government denied such allegations.By Yoon Min-sik","three north koreans restaurant ,workers defect to korea ,wednesday morning north korean ,report three north koreans ,north koreans restaurant workers","['North Koreans', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Shanghai']",15,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.50143272  0.70284176

Seoul Mapo Police Station said it booked two Hongik University students and one public service worker for destroying an outdoor sculpture early Wednesday. Titled “It is Anywhere but Nowhere,” the artwork showed a hand gesture that symbolizes the ultra-right online community Ilbe. It was displayed from Tuesday as a graduation project of a 22-year-old arts major student surnamed Hong. A sculpture symbolizing ultra-right online community Ilbe is destroyed at Hongik University, Seoul, Wednesday. The three students claimed that they wanted to express their objection to what the sculpture symbolized.The online community Ilbe is notorious for its extreme right-wing views and favoring male dominance and female objectification. A few people had objected to the installation of the sculpture, with some even throwing eggs at it and demanding it be dismantled. Hong, however, defended his work by saying that his piece does not intend to support or criticize Ilbe. “My intention was to open up a debate on Ilbe by showing that  is prevalent in the society but actually intangible,” Hong said. “We are at a point where we need to consider whether a witch-hunt against the  intention, false information and action that damages an art work is any different from the way Ilbe works.” He said that while destroying his work could be considered a freedom of expression, those behind the action should also be held accountable for damaging the property.The school’s sculpture department also expressed regret over the destroyed work. “The intention of this sculpture was not to express an opinion about Ilbe but to raise a fundamental question about the Ilbe controversy over confusing social values, extreme confrontation and violence. Please consider the work as a student’s interest in society,” said department head Lee Soo-hong.

104,104,Debate persists over redevelopment of Okbaraji Golmok,"An old, narrow alley located in central Seoul’s Muhak-dong, Jongno-gu, known as Okbaraji Golmok or Inn Alley, is now 80 percent demolished, with very few buildings left to be knocked down in the area designated as a redevelopment zone in 2006.As is often the case with redevelopment plans, residents are split on its urban renewal.

The alley was approved for redevelopment by Seoul Metropolitan Government in July 2015, citing it as “suitable for redevelopment considering the area’s poor infrastructure and the age of the buildings.” Four buildings of 16-story apartment complex Lotte Castle will be built on the redevelopment site spanning some 1,000 square meters when the demolition is completed by this summer.Most of the buildings at Okbaraji Golmok in Jongno, Seoul, have been demolished as part of a redevelopment project. Residents and civic groups who oppose its redevelopment cite the historical significance of the alley.Located across Seodaemun Prison History Hall, which was built in 1907 to detain and execute independence fighters and activists such as Ryu Gwan-soon and Kim Koo during the Japanese occupation, there are traces of Korea’s history that go back a century in the back of the alley. Cheap, shabby inns located here were frequented by families who came to visit and provide support for their detained loved ones, because inmates were poorly fed and ill-treated by the prison staff. The name Okbaraji literally translates into “prison support.”“There is no country like South Korea which tries to destroy its historical sites,” said Lee Gil-ja, the owner of five-story Gubonjang, one of the remaining inns.“I have been sleeping outside since I was kicked out 14 days ago  I lost my home, have no income and I’m especially sorry to my unmarried daughter for letting this happen,” Lee told The Korea Herald. She had run the business for 41 years. On May 4, the Seoul Central District Court ordered the compulsory evacuation of her building. She refused to move until the court’s order to execute the evacuation process on May 17.Historian Fuji Takeshi, who studied modern history and is a member of Okbaraji Preservation Committee, argued that “not many are aware of the historical significance of the area.”“Not many citizens, public officials, or even historians, knew that Okbaraji itself was a living symbol of Korea’s turbulent history, simply because they did not know the presence of the alley,” said Takeshi at a press conference in front of Seoul City Hall on Monday. “History is not just about special people. Without ordinary people who supported inmates at the Seodaemun Prison, fighting for independence would not have been possible,” added Takeshi, underlining that normal people’s lives and their homes should be remembered by preserving the alley.Civic group members protest against demolition of the alley. Jongno-gu, responsible for construction in the area, told The Korea Herald that “there is no turning back ” as demolition is already in progress. An official from the district’s City Housing Development department explained that “the redevelopment association foresees a lot of financial damage if the construction is delayed.” Adding that a lack of documentation to prove the area’s historical significance was another reason for permitting the project. The redevelopment association of the area -- mostly formed of native landlords who decided to raze the entire area with the consent of majority of the residents -- was established in 2010, four years after Seoul City designated the area for renewal. They argue that the snowballing interest on loans for the project will be a burden if the project is stalled. Association members say they took a loan of about 26.5 billion won  and pay at least 200 million won in interest each month. The money was used to support association members to relocate.In the process of demolition amid resistance by some of the old residents, there are allegations that the redevelopment association wielded excessive power to raze buildings. Old residents say they were forced to evacuate by yongyeok ggangpae -- criminal gangs who disguise themselves as legitimate business and are often mobilized to forcibly remove residents for demolition.Old residents block yongyeok ggangpae -- criminal gangs who disguise themselves as legitimate business and are often mobilized to forcibly remove residents for demolition -- when the court ordered to execute the evacuation process on May 17. Two weeks ago, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon visited the site after a physical altercation on May 17 between the resisting residents and the gang trying to vacate Gobongjang.“Even if it costs me a compensation suit, I will block  by all means,” Park said at the office of redevelopment association. He also proposed to have marathon talks with those involved to seek a solution but the discussion has not been held yet due to protesters opposing participation of the builder and the redevelopment association. The demolition of the remaining houses has halted since then.However, as of now, there are no laws to protect residents who are evacuated from their own homes in the course of redevelopment, nor can the mayor stop the demolition. Seoul City had vowed to eradicate forced evacuations in the city’s development projects in 2013. The city government said that insufficient discussions among residents was the main reason for the crisis. Although it had recommended residents to have at least five meetings before demolition begins, the association members and opposing residents had only three so far. The city’s recommendation for talks has no legal binding force. Experts say that the approval of the redevelopment project in Okbaraji Golmok was the result of a flawed law.Kim Il-jung, economics professor at Sungkyunkwan University, said in a recent interview that the Environment Renewal Development Act should be revised.“The current law just deepens social complications, since there is no concrete regulation that verifies the public benefit of urban renewal plans in the area,” Kim was quoted as saying.“If the redevelopment plan had been fully reviewed regarding the public benefit as well as compensation scheme for long-term residents, such an indiscriminate renewal project would have not happened,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","redevelopment by seoul metropolitan ,now 80 percent demolished ,for redevelopment by seoul ,redevelopment by seoul ,80 percent demolished","['Seoul', 'Jongno - gu', 'Okbaraji Golmok', 'Inn Alley', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15316555  0.2539584

The blast took place in the city of Namyangju, east of Seoul, at 7:20 a.m. while 17 workers were welding iron bars to drill a hole through the ground, police and fire department officials said. One worker died from the explosion, while three others were found dead after being trapped under the debris 15 meters underground.The 10 injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment and three of them remain in critical condition, the officials said. Firefighters work on a site where an explosion and a collapse killed four and injured 10 workers on Wednesday in the city of Namyangju, east of Seoul. All of the victims, who are in their 40s and 50s, were hired by subcontractor Maeil ENC to construct subway rails for POSCO Engineering & Construction. The exact cause of the accident was not immediately known, but authorities cited a gas explosion behind the collapse. “It seems that  a gas explosion from an unknown reason during the welding which caused the accident,” said an official from the fire department. The Gyeonggi Northern District Police Agency said that it would open a joint investigation to find the cause and whether there was any misconduct, in partnership with the National Forensic Service and Korea Gas Safety Corporation. POSCOE E&C; expressed regret and apologized to the families of the deceased and wounded, vowing measures to prevent a reoccurrence. “We feel responsibility for the accident,” POSCO E&C; said. “The company will do everything in its power to deal with the aftermath of the accident, carry out a safety review and come up with due measures.” Public Safety and Security Minister Park In-yong also visited the scene at around 10:30 a.m.“Recently, minor and major accidents such as derailment and being jammed between machines continue to take place,” Park said. “We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with relevant ministries and map out measures.” The accident comes three days after a 19-year-old worker died after being hit by a subway on Saturday while doing maintenance work on a screen door on a platform at Guui Station.The case has raised questions about lax safety standards and the dangerous working conditions of workers hired through subcontractors. In 2014, irregular workers, who accounted for 20 percent of the workers at conglomerates with more than 300 staff members, made up nearly 40 percent of those who died of fatal work accidents, according to the Labor Ministry. A 2014 survey on 791 irregular workers by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea showed that irregular workers are more vulnerable to work accidents because they tend to be assigned heavier workload and more dangerous jobs. By Ock Hyun-ju","near seoul collapsed wednesday ,died from the explosion ,injured after subway construction ,kills workers injures 10 ,subway construction site kills","['Seoul', 'Namyangju', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46558389  0.23635338

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said it is determining the date to call in two or three executives from Reckitt Benckiser who are suspected to have been involved in or aware of the manipulation of the chemical toxicity test result. The officials are reportedly the ones who visited Seoul when the Seoul National University professor surnamed Cho released the reproduction-toxicity test result for PHMG in November 2011 and the inhalation-toxicity test result for the chemical in February 2012. A research head  at Oxy Reckitt Benckiser leaves the Seoul Central District Court on May 27 after attending a hearing for his arrest. He was arrested the next day. Cho was indicted Tuesday for manipulating the PHMG toxicity test result in return for money from Oxy Reckitt Benckiser.Upon Oxy’s request, Cho had conducted the PHMG toxicity test from October 2011 to April 2012. While the reproduction-toxicity test proved the chemical’s harmfulness, Cho allegedly concealed the test result, manipulated the inhalation-toxicity test and announced that there was no causality between the disinfectant use and health damage, the prosecution said. Cho allegedly received 12 million from  Oxy through a behind contract, it added. Speculation has grown over the headquarters’ involvement in the test manipulation as it was found that Reckitt Benckiser officials had attended the test result event along with officials from law firm Kim & Chang. Meanwhile, the prosecution said it would soon question former Oxy CEO Gaurav Jain through a document later this week. Jain, who currently lives in Singapore, refused Thursday to appear to the Korean prosecution for questioning. Oxy was formally renamed to Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014.The 47-year-old, who served as the firm’s CEO from May 2010 for two years, is suspected of making the final decision to hand over 12 million won to Cho.

It was the third fatal accident of its kind to occur since 2013. According to Gwangjin Police Station, the 19-year-old Kim, an employee of a company that Seoul Metro had subcontracted for door maintenance, had been repairing the platform screen door at Guui Station on Saturday evening.He was working by himself, with neither supervisor nor any signboard to notify approaching train operators. The authorities have examined surveillance camera recordings and are set to summon related officials for questioning. The probe will be jointly handled by the Ministry of Employment and Labor’s special judicial police and the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency.Clear screen doors were first set up in 2007 at subway stations in Seoul to prevent people from jumping onto the tracks in suicide attempts. The doors, however, have often caused casualties as they frequently malfunction. In January 2013, a 38-year-old screen door maintenance worker surnamed Shim, was fatally hit by a train while he was on the tracks to fix a screen door at Seongsu Station. In August 2014, another employee surnamed Cho from the same company died from a similar accident at Gangnam Station. Both employees were carrying out the task alone when the accidents happened. Last year, Seoul Metro established a safety manual for subway maintenance subcontractors, instructing workers to work in pairs and forbidding them from going on the tracks during subway operation hours. However, such requirements are often overlooked by workers due to the limited number of workers as well as urgent calls by subway operators to quickly fix screen doors for passengers’ convenience. “We deeply regret lax safety management over screen door maintenance involving our subcontracted companies. We apologize to the bereaved families and citizens who use Seoul Metro,” said Jeong Su-young, head of Seoul Metro’s infrastructure management department, on Saturday.He added that Seoul Metro will change its screen door maintenance company from the current subcontractor to a city-run subsidiary company, starting from August, citing “workforce efficiency and strengthened safety.” It also said it would establish new requirements for screen door repair.By Kim Da-sol","worker died on saturday ,continued accidents on subway ,the third fatal accident ,accidents on subway tracks ,seoul metro under fire","['Seoul Metro', 'Gwangjin Police Station', 'Kim', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17732635 -0.04115711

Overturning the appeals court's initial decision against the company, the top court sent the case to the appellate court for retrial.In Friday's ruling, the court highlighted the financial predicament Ssangyong suffered at the time of the layoffs, saying the crisis was a ""continuous and structural"" one.The court also noted that the automaker did take the due steps to avoid the layoffs, such as freezing wages, recommending employees take turns going on leave, accepting voluntary retirements and downsizing its subcontractors.Ssangyong cut 2,646 jobs, approximately 37 percent of the total workforce, in April 2009 after it was put under court receivership in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Since then, some of the workers have been waging a legal battle to return to work.Meanwhile, Ssangyong Motor Co., the local unit of Indian auto conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., decided late last year to ""gradually"" reinstate those, who had to leave in the wake of the 2009 restructuring efforts. The decision came in accordance with a deal reached between the carmaker, the head of the dismissed workers and the leader of the company's labor union. The agreement put an end to the years-long labor dispute that plagued the country's smallest carmaker.","supreme court 2014 ruling ,friday ruled against group ,motor workers seoul appeals ,court on friday ruled ,appeals court on friday","['Seoul', 'Ssangyong Motor Co.', ""the Seoul High Court 's"", ""the Supreme Court 's""]",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37635934  0.05523574

The reports claimed the North Koreans may have escaped from a restaurant in either Xian or Shanghai.The case is the second escape by North Korean restaurant staff working in China after the mass defection that took place in April.Last month, a group of 13 North Koreans who had worked at a restaurant in the Chinese eastern port city of Ningbo defected to Seoul en masse amid tougher international sanctions.""It is a fact that North Koreans have recently fled an overseas restaurant,"" said a ministry official, asking not to be named. ""But we cannot confirm anything about their current situation.""The official said that the April defection case may have affected the latest one, adding that the government is seeking to verify relevant information.A source familiar with North Korean affairs said the North Korean restaurant staff seemed to have fled their workplace at some point after May 9, when the ruling Workers' Party of Korea concluded the four-day run of its first congress in 36 years.Overseas restaurants operated by North Korea have served as one of the main sources of hard currency for North Korea, with which the North is suspected of bankrolling its nuclear and missile programs.Such restaurants are known to be facing financial difficulty after the U.N. Security Council slapped tougher sanctions on Pyongyang for its January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February.South Korea estimates that North Korea is running approximately130 restaurants in around 12 countries, including China, Vietnam and Cambodia, earning $10 million annually, according to government sources.North Koreans in overseas restaurants are among some 50,000 workers sent abroad by the regime to earn much-needed dollars to help it tackle economic hardships amid the U.N. sanctions regime.North Korea handpicks workers who are loyal to the regime and sends them overseas to work at restaurants. South Korea said that those who defected en masse last month are known to have good social status in the North.Pyongyang, meanwhile, has claimed that South Korea kidnapped the group of North Koreans who defected to Seoul last month. It has called for Seoul to permit their North Korean family members to have a face-to-face meeting with them.","staff in china escape ,fleeing pyongyang run restaurant ,run restaurant in china ,recently escaped their workplace ,restaurant staff in china","[""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'China', 'North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'the North Koreans']",15,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.73365873  0.19449537

While a few men stood in crowd of sympathizers, many others displayed discomfort at being grouped as potential criminals. Kim, now known as the “Pink Elephant,” expressed his opinion Sunday with a sign inspired by the recent pro-diversity Disney movie “Zootopia,” where predators and prey of the animal kingdom live in harmony. The full contents of Kim’s sign read: “It is not the predators who are bad but the animals who commit crimes. Korea is currently the safest country in the world, but let us strive to create a prejudice-free and bias-free safer ‘Zootopia Korea,' both men and women hand-in-hand.”Although what he came out to say was not meant to incite angered responses in itself, to those who did not know “Zootopia,” Kim’s pink elephant costume seemed outlandish and disrespectful at the site of mourning. Some recognized the costume he was wearing to be related to the extreme-right online community Ilbe, whose members typically favor male dominance and female objectification, and demanded he remove his mask. In a video on YouTube, Kim can be heard asking, “What have I done wrong?” with the surrounding crowd retorting, “If you have nothing to hide, come out from behind the mask.”The heat escalated to physical contact as the mob tried to peel off Kim’s pink costume. Some allegedly punched and kicked him, prompting Kim to report them to police. The Seoul Seocho Police said Monday they are investigating the case now categorized as a case of violence.Another case of a middle school girl, who was violently pushed in the chest by a fellow woman while she protested in front of the memorial with a picket reading “I oppose both hatred against men and hatred against women” is also under investigation.Byron Howard, codirector of “Zootopia,” tweeted in response to alerts from Koreans that misogyny is the opposite of what the movie is about and that “Disney will investigate.” Apart from the case of Pink Elephant Kim, a number of scenes from the animated movie have been taken to mock the extreme feminist arguments with added-in Korean subtitles. Meanwhile, the memorial made out of post-it notes has been voluntarily removed by the mourners for the purpose of preservation ahead of the rain forecast for Tuesday. The removal began around midnight on Sunday and finished around 6 a.m. on Monday morning. Those considered to hold symbolic worth will be displayed at Seoul City Hall, while the rest will be permanently stored at Seoul Foundation of Women and Family located in Daebang-dong, where other mourning notes from provincial towns will also be gathered. Police made an official statement Sunday that the suspect of the Gangnam murder case suffered from mental illness for a long time and that his murder could not be categorized as a hate crime due to his unstable mental state. Opponents of the police decision have vowed to hold public rallies. Many women rights activists here have taken the matter further from the case itself, rather focusing more on individual women’s personal experiences of feeling threatened and oppressed.

Their mission is to help secure safety of people and keep peace.Policemen? No, they are Subway Guards helping prevent crimes and incidents and establish order at more than 300 subway stations in Seoul. A Subway Guard patrols inside a train. As Seoul’s metro system transports more than 7.5 million commuters a day, more and more security-related violations are taking place at subway stations or inside rolling stocks.It is against this backdrop that the Seoul Metropolitan Government introduced the subway guard system in 2011 to deal with security problems.“We take preventive actions to protect people from possible threats from drunken passengers and homeless people, and to prevent sexual crimes,” Subway Guard Lee Kun-young told The Korea Herald. Lee, 43, became a guard five years ago and is responsible for Line No. 4.In Seoul, nine subway lines are run by three operators -- Seoul Metro, Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit and Metro9.Seoul Metro has deployed 133 guards on its five lines while Rapid Transit has sent out 164, including 74 senior guards over age 60, on its four lines.The most frequent tasks for Subway Guards is banning illegal acts of selling products by peddlers, controlling violent drunk people on trains and moving homeless people out of train platforms.  Subway Guards talk to a homeless person sitting in a station near a subway track on Line No. 4 in Seoul Station on Wednesday. Although guards do not have the power to arrest, unlike police officers, most of them are well-trained professionals, each mastering several martial arts. “I majored in security science. I am a third-degree black belt in Taekwondo and fourth in Hapkido. Many guards here have similar backgrounds,” Han Ji-yong, Lee’s partner, said.The number of guards for Seoul Metro has increased from 40 in 2011 to 133 this year. According to Seoul Metro’s data, the guards were involved in 53,448 cases of violations in 2015, up 20 percent from three years earlier. The daytime shift workers take on the job from early morning -- 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. -- and from then come nighttime shifters to work until the last train arrives at 1 a.m. Ten guards work each shift per line.The work becomes tough when they have to face violent drunken passengers. “They are usually typical patriarchal men in their 50s and 60s,” Lee said. As an example, he said, “Yesterday was tough. A drunk man in his 50s started being rude and choked one of the guards. We had to pull his arm on each side and take him to the police station nearby, but on the way he ran into a wall corner, injuring his head.” They usually take video for evidence of a violent scene since they may be accused themselves. They carry iron batons and capsaicin guns, but they rarely use them. “When these people throw their phones and turn violent, we cannot do much but control them bare-handed. We do not have power to arrest them,” Lee added. Han, who started his job last year, said he wonders if he would be able to keep the job when he becomes older. Seoul City policymakers have tried to grant Subway Guards legal power since 2011, but their efforts have made little progress in the face of claims that such power cannot be given to civilians.Despite relatively lower paychecks, unstable employment and physically and mentally demanding duties, the guards said they are happy and feel what they do is worthwhile.“The job is worthwhile as people compliment us on the changed environment since our presence,” Lee said.

Intense black fumes rose to the sky and spread to the apartment complex next to the expressway. Two people, including the truck driver, were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation. It was initially feared the flaming diesel would spill over to neighboring farmhouses and the subway train depot, but the fire was fortunately contained before greater damage could be done.   By Lim Jeong-yeo","emergency firefighting causing massive ,diesel truck crash section ,expressway blocked for hours ,fire from diesel truck ,halted amid emergency firefighting","['Gyeongbu Expressway', 'Daegu']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17708716 -0.15055898

They said such actions are in line with the country's past practice of making its leader into a glorified being. Kim was named the new chairman of the WPK at the congress.Pyongyang already completed a 70-day campaign of loyalty, a scheme to mobilize its people to work harder on state construction and other projects. According to the KCNA report, a lot of literary works related to the North Korean leader were produced by young people.For example, the news agency claimed a youth group called the Paektusan Hero Youth Stormers released a literary production named ""We are the heroes of youth powerful country"" in which many literary works praised the North Korean leader with ""great honor and deep trust from the people.""In the literary works, university students across the country pledged to become heroes of the country to create miracles on their way to constructing a powerful socialist state by uniting around leader Kim Jong-un.Another North Korean media outlet, Airang-Meari, claimed on May 5 that a theatrical play was produced glorifying Kim Jong-un. The play was titled ""Hyolmaek,"" or blood vessel, and was produced by the North's state theatrical troupe. It showed the ""honorable Marshal Kim Jong-un's sublime will for the construction of a great prosperous country on the ground.""In addition, the North's Central TV Station introduced an epic poem idolizing Kim Jong-un as well as his grandfather Kim Il-sung and his late father Kim Jong-il.The poetry was introduced on the opening day of the WPK congress on May 6 in a move to elevate Kim Jong-un to the level of his two predecessors.In his report to the party congress, Kim Jong-un urged the nation to create literary and artistic works to glorify the great revolutionary history and immortal achievements of the deceased leaders.","media reports showed tuesday ,north korean media reports ,tuesday in media reports ,reports released last week ,showed tuesday in media","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', ""the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'north korean', 'Korean Central News Agency']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61262679  0.49197179

The court instead treated the case as illegal prostitution.The teen, who had run away from home in 2014 two months after her 13th birthday, met the men through an online chatting application, by writing a post saying she was a runaway teen and was looking for a shelter. According to the teen’s lawyers, the first man, surnamed Yang, took her to a motel and had sex with her forcibly.The age of consent in South Korea is 13, and the court ruled that the case cannot be defined as a statutory rape case.“The ruling does not take into account that the teenager had intellectual disabilities, that she had the mental ability of a 7-year-old,” said Jeong Mi-rye, the director of a nongovernmental organization against sexual violence. “As both her disability and age prevented her from making sensible decisions, the court should have acknowledged this case as one of sexual violence, not an illegal sex trade case.”The activists appealed against the court’s decision shortly after holding a press conference in front of the Seoul Western District Court building.Cho Jin-kyung , the director of an women‘s advocacy group, speaks during a press conference criticizing the court‘s recent decision to dismiss a compensation suit filed by a legal guardian of a 13-year-old minor with intellectual disabilities, in front of the Seoul Western District Court in Seoul, Monday. The court defined the incident as prostitution, as Yang treated the teen with tteokbokki, a Korean snack made of rice cakes, in exchange for sex. The teenager had similar sexual encounters with five other adult men until she was discovered by the police and returned to her home six days later. Since returning home in 2014, the teen has been suffering from severe depression and other mental health conditions, which required her to be hospitalized at a medical institution for about four months, according to the groups and lawyers. Among the six men, Yang was initially the only one to be indicted by the prosecutors, in 2014. He was sentenced to a fine of 4 million won  and a mandatory 40-hour sex education program last year for engagement in the sex trade. After Stand Up Against Sex-Trafficking of Minors, an advocacy group against sexual violence, protested the non-prosecution, four of the others were also charged and convicted -- though for sex trade offenses, rather than abuse -- with the most severe punishment being a year’s jail term, suspended for two years. Prosecutors have been unable to locate the sixth man. SASTM in 2014 also filed separate, follow-up compensation suits against the men for medical expenses caused by the abuse. But the one filed against Yang was dismissed last month. Bae Bok-ju, the head of an organization supporting women with disabilities, contended that the court does not seem to be aware of the existence of the Act on the Protection of Children against Sexual Abuse. “Article 8 of the specific act says, ‘if a person aged 19 or older commits an indecent act against a disabled child, he or she shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or by a fine not exceeding 15 million won,’” she said. “The rulings make us think that the court is not aware of the nation’s own laws.”By Claire Lee","children on monday condemned ,disability accusing six adult ,ruling on disabled teenager ,ngos condemn court for ,sexual assault the seoul",['the Seoul Western District Court'],15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49330902  0.1345201

Why would the ECBC make such an announcement if  is not pursuing Zika-related studies?” the groups said in a joint statement.They said conducting an experiment on the little-known Zika virus without consent from the South Korean government and its people would be an infringement of the country’s sovereignty. The groups urged the USFK to reveal details of the study, its purposes and its content.Last year, the USFK came under fire for accidently shipping anthrax samples into the country on several occasions since 2009.However, the Zika virus has already entered the country in isolated cases through tourism unrelated to the U.S. military. South Korea’s health authorities on Tuesday confirmed the nation’s fifth case of Zika infection.The ECBC, subordinate command of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, is an organization for non-medical chemical and biological defense. According to the article in question, its researchers and technicians are “dramatically increasing the ability of USFK to analyze samples of suspected biological warfare agents.” It claimed to have done so by increasing sample throughput at Korea-based labs from two to three samples of suspected biological warfare agents per day to dozens per day.Woo Hee-jong, a professor of veterinary medicine at Seoul National University, said the article implied that tests related to Zika virus would be conducted at the Seoul-based labs. He said establishing a system for Zika virus detection requires a sample of the virus. By Yoon Min-sik","virus in the yongsan ,holding protest demanding explanations ,testing the zika virus ,forces korea local media ,virus at its laboratory","['U.S.', 'South Koreans', 'U.S. Forces Korea', 'the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center', 'Yongsan']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17051099  0.09512053

The North Korean flight normally conducts a transit and re-fueling stop in Islamabad, Pakistan, on the Pyongyang-Kuwait route. The route is now also absent from the North Korean airline company's online flight timetable, according to NK News which specializes in North Korean affairs.Absence of flights on national airline's schedule may indicate impact of U.N. Security Council's resolution passed in early March, NK News said, adding the Air Koryo's long-distance international flight has become difficult after stricter sanctions imposed on the communist country by the United Nations Security Council . The U.N. slapped the reclusive country with its most stringent sanctions yet after Pyongyang conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and followed this up by firing a long-range missile a month later. The route was operated by North Korea's Tu-204 and P-632 Russian-made jets.The North Korea watchdog site also said the Air Koryo has recently terminated its once-a-week flight between Pyongyang and Bangkok as a result of the Thai government's endorsement of the UNSC sanctions resolution.","flights halted since february ,scheduled kuwait flights halted ,kuwait flights halted since ,halted since february nk ,kuwait flights halted","[""North Korea 's"", 'Air Koryo', 'Pyongyang', 'Kuwait', 'NK News', 'north korean']",15,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00957666 0.69321346 0.30202129],KH디지털2,North Korea,5,2016,"terminated its once week flight ,internet media report said wednesday ,north korean airline company online ,once week flight between pyongyang ,fourth nuclear test in january","[""North Korea 's"", 'Air Koryo', 'Pyongyang', 'Kuwait', 'NK News', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Islamabad', 'Pakistan', 'Pyongyang', 'Kuwait', 'north korean', 'NK News', 'north korean', ""U.N.

Families of the victims and activists returned to Seoul after a six-day visit to the U.K. that included a visit to the firm’s headquarters to ask it to take responsibility for the massive number of deaths and health damages.Kim Deok-jong, whose son is suspected to have died from the toxic humidifier disinfectant, talks to reporters during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. They said RB headquarters CEO Rakesh Kapoor only used words such as “profoundly regret” and “personally very sorry” in referring to the disinfectant tragedy that has left more than 200 dead. “Although the company’s press release said he had apologized to us, he did not use any expression of ‘apology’ to us nor did he have sincerity,” said Choi Ye-yong, the head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, during a press conference upon his arrival back to Korea. When asked to visit Seoul to sincerely apologize to the victims, the CEO did not give a response, added Choi. Families of the victims said they would continue the boycott movement until the company is expelled from the global market. “We have seen the same stance of Oxy for five years. There is no longer a reason to talk to the company anymore. The citizens-driven boycott movement is the only solution,” said 40-year-old Kim Deok-jong who lost his five-year-old son in 2009, allegedly from using the disinfectant. “ appreciate all the support from the public. Participating in the boycott is great support to us. Until the RB CEO and others kneel down in front of the victims and offer a sincere apology,  will continue and expand the boycott to the international market.” They will file a suit against the company to the U.K. prosecution after the local prosecutorial probe wraps up, they added. They also requested the heads of the political parties to meet with them to discuss enacting a special law for victims’ compensation, holding a parliamentary hearing and investigation, and setting up a special committee to introduce relevant regulations. Meanwhile, more retailers and consumers have been seen participating in the boycott. Following distributors like Lotte Mart that joined the move last week, online commerce services Tmon and Coupang, convenient store chains GS25, CU and 7-Eleven, and large department stores Shinsegye, Hyundai and AK Department Store have decided to participate in the boycott movement, according to civic consumers’ group Korea National Council of Consumer Organization.

122,122,Seoul struggles to cope with fine dust from emissions,"YonhapGiven mounting concerns over fine dust in Seoul, 29-year-old Kim Yoon, a valet parking agent in Seorae French Village in Banpo-dong, does not forget to wear a mask when heading outside. “I can see dust-ridden cars as I work outside all day long, which makes me feel like I’m in a defenseless state,” said Kim. “I think people in Seoul, not just me, are already too exposed to fine dust,” he said, adding that ...","YonhapGiven mounting concerns over fine dust in Seoul, 29-year-old Kim Yoon, a valet parking agent in Seorae French Village in Banpo-dong, does not forget to wear a mask when heading outside. “I can see dust-ridden cars as I work outside all day long, which makes me feel like I’m in a defenseless state,” said Kim. “I think people in Seoul, not just me, are already too exposed to fine dust,” he said, adding that he is worried, as there is not much he can do about it.Over the recent decades, Korea’s air quality has drastically declined due to emissions from industrialized cities, pollution and dust from China as well as biomass burning from Southeast Asian countries.Fine dust can be divided into two categories according to size. A dust particle smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter is classified as fine dust, while a particle smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter is classified as ultrafine dust. Ultrafine dusts are about one-twentieth the width of a human hair. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye and are difficult to filter. Trapped in the atmosphere, fine dust can easily enter the human body through the respiratory system and cause health damage, especially to the lungs and blood vessels.Global health institutes have also highlighted the health dangers of fine dust. The World Health Organization established an air quality guideline in 1987 to create better awareness. In 2013, the WHO-run institute International Agency for Research on Cancer declared that fine dust is classified as a carcinogenic substance.While some of the fine dust comes from China, it is also emitted by vehicles in the city.  According to Seoul City, an experiment conducted in April showed that in Seoul, 59 percent of fine dust came from China and Mongolia’s sand storms, while 20 percent were from city emissions. The rest came from adjacent towns such as Incheon and Gyeonggi Province. The Seoul Metropolitan Government said that old trucks and some 1,800 public buses that pass through Seoul are the main culprits that create fine dust in the city. “In order to dramatically reduce the inflow of fine dust from different cities, we need long-term cooperation from local governments and related departments,” said an official from Seoul Metropolitan Government.According to Seoul city’s data, there are about 18,000 public buses running across the country, with more than one third of them, or 7,000 buses, operating in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province. In 2002, Seoul City vowed to replace all its public buses with more environmentally friendly compressed natural gas buses and to completely replace all of them in 2014. Seoul City highlighted the urgency of the issue and asked municipalities and the Environment Ministry to join the campaign of replacing buses with eco-friendly ones. But whether all buses across the nation can be completely replaced is questionable due to a budget crunch, according to local governments.Other than replacing buses, municipalities have come up with the idea of attaching a fine dust sensor to buses’ emission pipes, considering it more practical and an easier way to detect the amount of emissions.This year, Seoul City allocated about 43 billion won to support cars with low pollutant emissions by installing sensors on the emission pipes of buses and vehicles that run in Seoul.Meanwhile, citizens are increasingly calling for accurate weather forecasts by the Korea Meteorological Administration.“The weather forecast said yesterday that I could enjoy outdoor activities, but later it was revealed that  in fact ‘highly dangerous’ to engage in outdoor activity over the weekend,” said a mother of a 4-year-old son who took him to the Han River Park last weekend.According to the government, fine dust alerts are issued by the Environment Ministry while yellow dust alerts are sent by the KMA. Advisory alarms for fine dust are sent by local governments.Due to several different institutes involved in the fine dust and yellow dust alert system, the government is considering assigning all three roles to one institute.In order to issue timely fine dust alerts and set prediction methods to deter fine dust inflow, the National Institute of Environmental Research joined hands with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to launch the Korea U.S.-Air Quality study on Monday.Through this first-ever NASA joint field experiment, researchers and scientists will collect air quality data over the peninsula through air crafts, ground sites and ships over 6 weeks. The U.S. and South Korean aircraft will conduct coordinated flights from Osan Air Base.A NASA researcher operates a chemical sampling machine inside NASA’s aircraft DC-8 which is being used for the Korea-U.S. Air Quality field study in Osan Air Base on Friday. Yonhap“KORUS-AQ will integrate observations from satellites, aircraft and ground sites with air quality models to understand the factors controlling air quality across urban, rural and costal boundaries in East Asia,” said James Crawford, a lead U.S. scientist for KORUS-AQ study.During the press conference at Osan Air Base on Friday, NASA pointed out the advantage of Korea’s air space, describing it as “an ideal research setting.”“The country is impacted by a unique mix of emissions including pollution from mainland China as well as seasonal pollution such as long-range transport of wind-blown dust,” said Crawford.In order to capture details about air quality, a total of three airplanes with 37 instruments and 400 scientists from 93 research teams came to Korea to conduct experiments in the South Korean skies and its coastal waters.Scientists hoped that by collecting data from more than 300 air-quality ground sites, the study will help in the future creation of an air quality observation system.“When the mission is completed in June, we will be able to analyze air pollution status, cause of fine dust formation, final ozone status and more,” said Hong You-deog, a director from the ministry’s Climate and Air Quality Research Department’s Air Quality Research Division.“This study will deepen our understanding of the processes controlling air quality and improve the ability of models to forecast and assess air quality conditions,” Hong added.By Kim Da-sol","dust in seoul 29 ,yoon valet parking agent ,seoul struggles to cope ,dust in seoul ,dust ridden cars as","['Seoul', 'Kim Yoon', 'Banpo - dong', 'Kim', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49624324  0.66117382

""There is slim possibility that he caught the virus through a mosquito bite given his negative blood test result.""The man, who joined the Army on Tuesday to serve his two-year mandatory military service, has been admitted to a military hospital near Seoul for further medical treatment, according to the KCDC. He traveled in the Philippines with his 20-year-old brother from April 10-14, when the younger man was infected with the virus.On Wednesday, the younger brother was confirmed to be the country's second Zika patient after showing flu-like symptoms upon his return from the Philippines. He said he was bitten by a mosquito during his vacation.The latest case raises the number of confirmed infections in South Korea to three. Last month, a 43-year-old man was confirmed as the first case of the virus in the country. The man reported being bitten by a mosquito while traveling in Brazil.The latest Zika cases have raised concerns over a widespread epidemic in South Korea just a year after an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome .The respiratory disease, that was first confirmed in May last year, claimed 38 lives before the government officially declared the country free of MERS in December last year.Fears of a full-scale inland epidemic had weighed heavily on the economy, dragging down domestic consumption and reducing foreign visitors. Months ahead of the Brazil Summer Olympics, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus outbreak a global emergency.Zika was first discovered in Africa, and has spread to parts of Asia and Latin America, including many Caribbean countries and Brazil.

He was asymptomatic until April 20, when he developed mild, cold-like symptoms including fever. He visited a local clinic in Seoul that day, but his doctor did not see him as a potential Zika virus patient. YonhapHe visited a general hospital on April 23, as he started experiencing skin rashes. Medical staff at the hospital reported him as a suspected Zika virus patient the same day. His test results, which became available Wednesday, turned out to be positive. He is currently in a stable condition and has been hospitalized for more examinations. State epidemiologists are also investigating the case. South Korea reported its first Zika virus case last month -- a 43-year-old man who was bitten by infected mosquitoes during his visit to Brazil from Feb.17-March 9.

Currently, all doctors nationwide have been asked by the Health Ministry to report any patient who has visited a Zika virus-affected country and has any of the following symptoms: fever, muscle pain, headache or conjunctivitis. Health authorities plan to include skin rashes to the list as both reported patients suffered this symptom, the ministry said.The World Health Organization in February issued a worldwide warning that the Zika virus is a global public health emergency that requires a united response.

We refuse to accept such an insincere apology,” the victims’ families said in a statement made in front of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office on Thursday.They also voiced concerns over the purpose of Oxy’s fund. According to the Environment Ministry, a 5 billion-won fund donated by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser back in March 2014 still remains in the ministry-related institute’s bank account.The supervising bureau responsible for the fund said the mediation committee was abolished nine months after its establishment.“We could not handle the fund since the victims and their families refused to receive the money,” an official from the Korea Environmental Preservation Association told The Korea Herald. “Oxy Reckitt Benckiser provided the fund under condition that it should be dealt between Oxy, the ministry and the KEPA,” he added. Despite the lack of an acting body, the KEPA has been paying corporate tax every year for the remaining amount of funds.

According to the city government Wednesday, during its inspection of 48-kilometer section of arterial roads previously connected to cave-in accidents, 105 potential sinkholes were detected.  A sinkhole that opened up at an apartment complex in Sindorim-dong, Guro-gu, last year. With an additional 246-kilometer section to be scanned this year, an estimated 195 more cavities are expected be found.The latest investigation began in the wake of February 2015’s sinkhole accident in front of Yongsan train station in Seoul. Last year, 56 sinkholes were detected in the city.In the safety inspection that ensued, Ground Penetration Radar-mounted vehicles scanned the surface, then a portable GPR identified the exact location of the cavity and then the ground was drilled open to check the size of the hollow space beneath. Using this method, On March 28, the bustling road in front of Chungjeongno Subway Station’s exit four was restored just in time before it sank. The special vehicle equipped with Ground Penetration Radar gears. Seoul City said that among the 105 detected cavities, 61 that appear to be in a critical condition will be restored by end-April. Another 35 less-severe cases will be restored by end-May. The rest that do not pose an immediate threat will be studied by urban developers to learn the cause behind the phenomenon. According to the city government, the cavities discovered so far were around decrepit sewer pipes. The city plans to undertake their maintenance before the monsoon season. By 2018, more than 200 billion won  will be spent to refurbish the 437-kilometer section of the worn-out 932 kilometer pipes. Seoul City had borrowed help from a Japanese tech firm with the GPR technology for this round’s safety check. It is currently trying to develop its own GPR gadgets in collaboration with Seoul’s Sejong University and the U.S.’ University of Central Florida.The city plans to repeat the GPR test every three years.By Lim Jeong-yeo","sinkholes in seoul seoul ,accidents 105 potential sinkholes ,cave in accidents 105 ,discovered 105 underground cavities ,sinkholes in seoul","['Seoul City', 'Sindorim - dong', 'Guro']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44652233 -0.01207436

That day, the Rhee government proclaimed martial law in order to suppress demonstrations. The movement led to the resignation of Rhee and the transition to the Second Republic of Korea.On Monday, a day prior to the anniversary of the April Movement, a group of foreign students visited the April 19 National Cemetery to learn about Korea’s past with the help of the Gangbuk-gu District Office in northwestern Seoul.A group of foreign students pay tribute Monday in front of the tombstone of patriot Yi Jun at the April 19 National Cemetery. Kim Da-sol/The Korea Herald“I cannot believe that this young boy was sacrificed,” said Wella L. Hoyle, a Hanshin University study abroad student from the Philippines, standing in front of the tombstone of Lim Dong-sung, who died at just 10 years old. Candy and chocolate were laid at his grave. Upon hearing the interpreter’s explanation of one of Korea’s fiercest moments yearning for democracy, Hoyle said she was reminded of a political figure in her own country.“Philippines also had a similar time when the country was ruled by one ruler for 21 years,” said Hoyle.“Ferdinand Marcos placed the country under martial law, revamped the constitution, silenced the media and many were killed during his reign,” she added. But in 1986, public outrage led to the Philippines’ People Power Revolution, which removed him from power.Victor Saidi Phiri, a student from Malawi, said protest for democracy has different definitions by time and country. “There are some countries undergoing war in the African continent, whether it is physical or not,” said him.“Since I am in Korea, I think it is integral to join the opportunity to know about the history  you’re staying. Before coming here, I thought South Korea was just as dangerous as in North Korea,” said Phiri.A cultural tourism interpreter who volunteered to work with Gangbuk-gu Office said that she was glad to see foreign visitors learning to understand Korea’s spirit and historical moments.“I tried to give them an easy and short explanation, to help them learn about the background in Korean history,” said Choi Gwang-young.There are a total of 17 cultural tourism interpreters who voluntarily joined to be part of Gangbuk-gu Office’s regional cultural tourism program. They speak English, Chinese and Japanese to help visitors from abroad learn about the region’s historical monuments and cultural places.“Although the interpretation service was launched just last year, we are seeing a growing number of people who are interested in the area, as well as the history behind it,” said Hwang Hyun-joon from Gangbuk-gu Office. The walking trail of Mount Bukhansan and the April 19 National Cemetery are among the sites where the interpretation services are available.

I just thought that he would be busy having fun with his friends,” Kim said, wiping tears from her cheek.“I should have called him to hear his voice one last time. … That’s what I regret every day.”Visitors pay tribute to the victims of the Sewol accident at a joint memorial in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. The April is once again marked with apologies and promises not to forget the 304 people who died in the Sewol ferry tragedy. Most of them were students from Danwon High School in Ansan on a school trip to Jejudo Island.The captain and crewmembers were the first to flee the sinking ferry without giving an evacuation order, while other passengers onboard were asked to “stand still.” Only 172 were rescued, with nine people remaining missing in the sea.Over the past two years, however, little has been found out about what exactly caused the man-made disaster and why the government failed to save more lives. Only the ferry’s captain, CEO of the shipping operator and a maritime police officer on the rescue ship were punished.An overloaded cargo, illegal redesign of the ferry and a cozy relationship between ship operators and state regulators are loosely thought to be the causes. But unsolved questions remain, leading the victims’ families to demand “truth” in the deadly accident.“What would take so long to find out the truth about the accident and punish those responsible? Why is there so much to cover up?” the mother of Chan-ho lamented, lashing out at the government’s lukewarm efforts to investigate the accident.“I don’t need any financial compensation . All I need is the truth about why my son had to die.”A memorial event takes place in Jindo Island off the southweste coast on Saturday. To mark the second anniversary of the ferry sinking, scores of memorial events took place across the nation on Saturday, standing in solidarity with the victims’ bereaved families.In Jindo Island near the site of the accident, some 2,500 mourners gathered to support families of the nine victims that remain unaccounted for. Oceans Minister Kim Young-Suk promised to do his best to bring back the missing bodies to the families. The government has commissioned a Chinese firm to raise the ferry, which is 37 meters below the surface, by July.In Ansan, about 2,500 people, including the victims’ grieving families and lawmakers, gathered in the morning for a memorial event near the joint altar. They watched performances by choirs and documentaries in which the bereaved families recalled their loved ones.People participate in a memorial event held in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Saturday to mark the second anniversary of the Sewol ferry disaster. Government officials, including Education Minister Lee Joon-sik and Gyeonggi Province Governor, took to the stage and again pledged utmost efforts to find out the causes of the accident and salvage the ferry.Some 13,000 mourners, many of whom had tied yellow ribbons to their bags and cloths, flocked to the altar to lay flowers in front of the victims’ portraits in school uniforms.“These children would have entered university this year if they had not died in the sea,” said Lee Young-min, 40, with tears welling in her eyes, outside the altar. “Every single child is precious and deserves to live. I am sorry that we, adults, could not save them.”“I hope that the accident not only stays in our hearts but also fixes the country to make it more livable, safer.”The bereaved families of victims and their supporters march across Ansan, Saturday. Yoo Ja-young, an 18-year-old student, said that the Sewol ferry sinking changed her live forever. “Many people went to heaven due to the accident, but we still don’t know why. That made me participate more in social movement because I now know that this country cannot protect me.”A ""Memory Classroom"" Some five minutes away by car from the altar, hundreds of mourners visited “Memory Classrooms,” which have remained intact in honor of student victims, in Danwon High School. The visitors left flowers, gifts, snacks and letters on the desks, wishing the victims better lives in heaven.In the teachers’ room on the second floor, two former students of the deceased teacher Lee Ji-hye remembered their teacher by leaving a message on the guestbook and taking pictures together on Lee’s chair.Deceased teacher Lee Ji-hye's desk “I could not believe that my teacher was on the sinking ferry, but I started to feel that it was real as she never picked up my call,” Byun Jin-kyung, 24, said. “She was tough outside, but very warm inside. I still remember that she was so happy to see me enter a university.”While groups of friends and families continued to browse the classrooms, a 40-something man, who wanted to be identified only by his surname Song, cracked a smile while revisiting memories he had with his former student Lee Hye-kyung.“Hye-kyung’s dream was to become a makeup artist. She was a very cute and popular girl around the town,” he said, pointing to letters piled up on her desk. “This classroom is where Hye-kyung’s friends come to share their memories and stories.”Student victim Lee Hye-kyung's desk  One of the letters left in November 2014 by Lee’s closest friend read: “How are you? I hope it is not so cold up there. It is already winter here. You know what? I cut my hair today. Please see me and let me know how it is. I think I look okay. Have a very good weekend. I will see you very soon. Always love you.”Song said that he was afraid of having the classroom removed. “Nothing has been solved for the past years. No one took responsibility. How can be the government so irresponsible and incompetent? Why does it keep trying to remove all the traces of the kids?”The “Memory Classrooms” have been a source of contention between education ministry and victims’ families. School officials cited shortage of classrooms and a negative impact on attending students, but families demanded preservation of the shrine so as not to forget the tragedy.A blackboard in a ""Memory Classroom"" in Danwon High School. Rain started to pour in the afternoon, but it did not stop Koreans from gathering in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul for the day’s biggest and last memorial event.Some 12,000 people pack Gwanghwamun Square to participate in a memorial event on Saturday. At dusk, an estimated 12,000 people packed into the square to join the event, with hundreds of people waiting in a 1 kilometer-long queue to pay tribute to the victims at the joint altar.“I came here because I felt guilty not coming here last year,” said Park Eun-ah, a 30-year-old office worker. “Frankly, I never thought that the cause of the ferry sinking would not be found by now.”The memorial altar for victims of the Sewol ferry sinking in Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul “I might have intentionally avoided the bereaved families and their supporters because it was too much painful,” she said, stepping out of the memorial altar established in Gwanghwamun Square. “But this is not the issue that I can just put aside just because I feel uncomfortable.”During the two-hour event, participants and hundreds of civic groups called for a more thorough investigation into the deadly accident, a revision to the Sewol Special Act and the prompt lifting of the ferry Sewol.People participate in a memorial event held in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Saturday to mark the second anniversary of the Sewol ferry disaster. They chanted “We will not forget” and “We will stand together with you” while sitting down on the cold and wet concrete floor in raincoats. Memorial songs were sung, poems were read and videos were played.Rep. Park Joo-min of the Minjoo Party of Korea, who has previously represented the victims’ families, took to the podium to vow his efforts to bring justice for the Sewol tragedy in the National Assembly.“Corrupt investigators, incompetent government and social ill in this society resulted in the disaster. This is not a special event that happens to special people. This is an event that can happen to any one of us as long as the problems are not fixed,” Park said.“I will amend the Special Sewol Act and help launch an independent probe into the case by prosecutors.”Participants watch a performance onstage at a memorial event held in Gwanghwamun Square on Saturday. Yoo kyung-geun, father of the deceased Ye-eun, asked the participants whether they were ready to get through the upcoming difficulties to fight for “truth.” The crowds shouted “Yes” in response.“Some 120 lawmakers entered the 20th National Assembly, promising to allow the special investigation into the Sewol ferry tragedy to continue,” Yoo said. “Please encourage and pressure lawmakers in your region to keep their promises.”People participate in a memorial event held in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Saturday to mark the second anniversary of the Sewol ferry disaster. The memorial event came to an end at around 9:30 with 10 citizens from Yongin pulling off a flash-mob performance to a song that had been heard all across the country that day.Part of the lyrics of the song said: “Darkness cannot beat light, lies cannot win truth, truth does not capsize, and we won’t give up.”By Ock Hyun-ju","ferry tragedy ansan seoul ,her youngest son jeon ,ferry sank off south ,since sewol ferry tragedy ,tragedy ansan seoul two","['South Korea ’s', 'Kim Jeong - hee', 'Jeon Chan - ho', 'Chan - ho', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08965126 -0.03112422

Since the government declared a formal end to the outbreak in December, some 310 individuals have been reported as suspected MERS patients. Of them, 76 were tested for possible infection, but all the results came out negative, according to the KCDC.

The government-led inspection regarding information and communications security has not yet taken place.

140,140,More large-scale defections possible from North Korea: Seoul,"In the wake of last week’s mass defection, additional exoduses may come about among North Koreans working overseas as the impact of U.N. resolutions and unilateral sanctions takes shape, top Seoul officials said Sunday. A group of a male manager in his 30s and 12 female employees in their early 20s who had served at a North Korean restaurant arrived in Seoul on Thursday, the Unification Ministry announced late Frida...","In the wake of last week’s mass defection, additional exoduses may come about among North Koreans working overseas as the impact of U.N. resolutions and unilateral sanctions takes shape, top Seoul officials said Sunday. A group of a male manager in his 30s and 12 female employees in their early 20s who had served at a North Korean restaurant arrived in Seoul on Thursday, the Unification Ministry announced late Friday. Officials declined to unveil the detailed time line of their journey or the location of the diner, citing diplomatic sensitivity, but they were believed to have departed from China on Wednesday or Thursday and flown via a Southeast Asian nation. This image shows the 13 North Koreans who defected to the South last week after having worked at a restaurant outside their homeland. Contrary to earlier news reports, the 13 were “a sizable portion” of the restaurant’s staff, but “not everyone,” a senior ministry official said, indicating that some others left there may be hoping to follow suit -- or already be on their way here. “There are some remaining people who could not come. ... Circumstantially they would seek to, but their precise whereabouts right now cannot be verified, in addition to safety concerns,” the official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. The rare case reflects the budding effects of global pressure and South Korea’s recent appeal to its citizens to refrain from using any profit-making North Korean facilities abroad, which it has labeled as cash-generating tools for the Kim Jong-un regime, officials said. According to the ministry, one female server said during questioning, “I’ve come to escape to Seoul where there is hope, as sanctions intensified recently and I lost hope for the North Korean system.” Another defector also said, “I’d developed a desire to live as a South Korean after gaining knowledge about South Korea’s democracy while watching TV shows and dramas overseas.” “Pyongyang’s demands for foreign currency despite strengthening sanctions, their overseas lives with relatively easier access to outside information, especially our broadcasts and the Internet that portray freedom and South Korean culture, and the factors alike, have apparently come together to compel them to defect, with the recent sanctions and consequent difficulties providing a more direct ,” the official said. Signs are growing that the sanctions have already started to hold sway, they said. All six flag-on-convenience ships blacklisted by the latest U.N. Security Council resolution have been deregistered from the International Maritime Organization, while the remaining 21 North Korean flag boats have returned home and remain grounded there since being denied entry to China, Russia, Hong Kong and other ports, vessel tracking websites show. About half of the approximately 130 North Korean restaurants, which would collectively deposit around $10 million a year in state coffers, are believed to be struggling to meet their quota, some resorting to illicit sex services and supplementary food sales to court more customers and boost revenues, the ministry official noted. More companies in China and elsewhere are seen shying away from dealing with their North Korean counterparts. In some regions bordering with China, the prices of rice and other staples have increased over the last month, he added, quoting intelligence sources. Given Seoul’s longstanding low-profile approach to the issue of bringing in defectors from a third country, the ministry’s unusual impromptu announcement sparked speculation over a potential policy shift toward a more open, proactive one. But another senior official at the Foreign Ministry reaffirmed the existing strategy, though he raised the need to reinforce collaboration with other countries such as China and those in Southeast Asia for future mass exoduses. “The government has decided to unwrap the latest case due to its rarity and implications on recent sanctions. Our stance toward quiet cooperation remains unchanged,” he said at a separate meeting with reporters. “We have made our position clear to relevant countries that the defectors must come to South Korea according to their free will, and not be repatriated to the North against their will. But there is a need for stronger cooperation with those countries, as we can’t rule out the possibility for further group defections as the sanctions and pressure drive kicks into high gear.”This photo carried Saturday by North Korea`s Rodong Sinmun appears to have been taken during what state media claimed was a test of a new engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. He also warned against an additional military provocation by Pyongyang, referring to the recent string of Kim’s threats to test more nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missOn Saturday, state media claimed the young ruler has supervised an experiment of a new higher-power engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland at the Sohae station in the western town of Dongchang. “As expressed through our recent summits with the U.S., China and Japan, the North would face evens greater sanctions pressure should it stage another provocation. There is consensus in particular between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo for stronger sanctions,” the diplomat added.

Yongsan Police Station published a post on its Facebook page in both Korean and English at around 2 p.m., expressing regret over the “unintended troubles” caused by its public letter. “We do apologize the fact that we caused some unintended troubles resulted from our answers on Facebook post on April 1, 2016, which was solely intended to solve misunderstandings of our investigation on the case,” said the post in English. The apology was made six days after the police came under fire for sending an open letter addressed to Mattner on April 1. The police said that they had posted the letter to “straighten misinformation” and refute Mattner’s statements. The open letter sparked fury on the Internet, with scores of commenters slamming the police for revealing Mattner’s personal information and making defamatory remarks. The Yongsan police deleted the public letter earlier in the day. Mattner’s case came into the spotlight after she began to raise funds on the GoFundMe page in March to pursue separate investigation in England. Mattner, who visited Korea last year, said she was drugged, abducted and raped in Seoul. She accused police of failing to collect evidence and inform her of the investigation process. Netizens left comments after the police posted the apology, with many of them lamenting that police did not directly apologize the victim. A comment by Choi Ji-yeon said, “I hope you have read all of the comments on the deleted ‘open letter’ and realized what was really wrong with how you handled the situation.”Another individual Linda Vwj said in a comment, “You are just sorry that your post resulted in unfavorable responses.

A police officer at Gwanak Police Station was attacked Monday with highly corrosive sulfuric acid by a women surnamed Jeon, who was at the station to file a complaint with the Cyber Investigation Team.A corridor of Gwanak Police Station where the attacker poured sulfuric acid on police officers. Jeon reportedly told the police that she had purchased the sulfuric acid online in November 2015. Police has sought for the arrest of Jeon and said further investigation is underway. She is presumed to be suffering from mental illness.Current law states that purchasing highly corrosive acids – such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid -- is only allowed for those who purchase large amounts of over 20kg. A buyer is also required to present one’s identification or go through a real name verification process before the purchase is made.Incidents involving acid throwing in public places have happened often here. In 2015, a man in Seoul poured sulfuric acid on his girlfriend on the street after she ended the relationship. In 2014, another man attacked a prosecutor with acid at a government complex building in Gyeonggi Province. To deter chemical-throwing attacks, the Environment Ministry joined hands with online retail giants last year to crackdown on the distribution of such harmful substances at online malls.“We also launched a cyber watchdog for real-time supervision of the distribution of harmful chemicals, to encourage the correct way of using harmful acids,” said an official from the Environment Ministry.Despite the ministry’s efforts, purchasing harmful acids remains easy and prevalent, mainly due to sellers who are lax with checking ID. Currently, buyers can purchase a bottle of solution with a concentration of acid that is below 10 percent from pharmacies in Seoul without having to present identification. According to the law, acids below 10 percent concentration are regarded “less harmful” and available at normal stores.Experts argued that even minimal traces of such acids can be harmful, calling for a stricter regulations on public use.“Like what Jeon purchased, less concentrated acid is still very dangerous on human skin, and it’s strong enough to cause at least second-degree bum immediately,” said Ryu Jae-hyun, a professor of Chemistry at Sungkyunkwan University.“Selling those acids at online malls and pharmacies are still dangerous, since they can be used for different purposes without legal restriction,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","attack against seoul police ,the attacker poured sulfuric ,acid attack against seoul ,police station was attacked ,station was attacked monday","['Seoul', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Gwanak Police Station', 'the Cyber Investigation Team', 'Gwanak Police Station']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35728329  0.38617206

Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms such as fever and headache. However, a small proportion of infected patients develop inflammation of the brain with serious symptoms such as coma, tremors and convulsions.  123RFIn order to prevent the mosquito-borne disease, the KCDC advised the public to wear long-sleeves, long pants and socks when going outdoors, starting from this month to October. As mosquitos may bite through thin clothing, the agency recommended treating clothes with repellent containing permethrin for extra protection. The agency also urged all Korean households to avoid the accumulation of stagnant water at private properties, as many mosquitoes breed in standing water. Keeping drains free from blockages, putting used cans and bottles into covered dustbins, and changing water for plants at least once a week, leaving no water in the saucers underneath flower pots were all recommended.Those with relatively weak immune systems, as well as all children aged 1-12, are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated against the disease.

The closure of the last symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation showed Seoul's determination to prevent money generated from the factory zone from bankrolling the North's nuclear and missile programs.Park Seong-taek, chief of the Federation of SMEs, said his association has been looking for ways to help local companies to continue to do business in safer regions where North Korean labor is available.Park said that among the potential candidates are Dandong, a Chinese border town across the Yalu River, and Yanji in the northeastern border area across the Tumen River. Both Chinese cities have a significant population of Korean diaspora and can serve as North Korea's gateway to the world. ""Rather than a direct investment platform like the Gaeseong Industrial Complex, we have been considering building an agricultural industrial complex for small and medium-size companies in Dandong and Yanji under the premise that the inter-Korean relations stand on a better footing,"" Park said during an interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""It would allow  to use cheap North Korean labor and secure investment stability because it is a third-party location.""China, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of North Korea's external trade, serves as an economic lifeline to the impoverished state. The proposal is aimed at taking advantage of the geographical proximity of the Chinese border, which is less prone to shut down even when military and political tensions flare up between two Koreas, he said.Park, however, remained cautious over the scheme considering the heightened tension between the two Koreas.""We just drew up the idea and plan to propose it to the government in the latter half of this year,"" he said. More than 120 South Korean firms had operated factories at the Gaeseong complex, employing more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.The complex opened in 2004 as a result of the first inter-Korean summit in 2000. It served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea benefited from cheap but skilled North Korean labor.South Korean firms last month claimed that they suffered more than 815 billion won  in losses from the shutdown, adding that their actual damage could be much larger.","south korean small businesses ,february shut down the ,said friday the park ,following the recent shutdown ,korean small businesses","['inter - korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'Gaeseong', 'south korean', 'chinese']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4947603   0.7432223

The memories are still vivid for Mattner on the night of Sept. 25, 2015, when she was drugged, abducted and raped in Hongdae, a popular nightlife spot in western Seoul. What followed the brutal attack was the slipshod and careless response of the police and hospital in helping foreign victims like herself, she said.“That night, I was taken in a taxi to a hotel in the middle of nowhere by the man who later raped me,” Mattner, who now works as an English teacher in Japan, told The Korea Herald. “I pleaded with the taxi driver to take me to my hostel. He ignored me and the next thing I recall is being on a bed in a hotel room.” She struggled and tried to push him away but was too heavily drugged to fight him, she said. She said the next morning, she woke up to find the assailant had left, with her clothes and belongings torn and strewn across the room. Airdre Mattner But it was only the beginning of her long nightmare. “When I reported the crime to the police, I was questioned in a very insulting and offensive manner,” Mattner said. “The language used by police made me feel like they blamed me for the rape as if I was lying.” A police official from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in charge of investigating the nation’s sexual crimes told The Korea Herald that they consider sexual offenses seriously and take necessary measures for Koreans and foreigners alike. The official said that victims receive medical emergency check-ups at 36 Sunflower Women and Children’s Center across the nation and make statements to the police when rape takes place. The medical records are sent to the National Scientific, Criminal & Investigation Laboratory for more in-depth investigation. “In case of foreign victims of sexual crimes, it is difficult because they think they were not informed enough due to language barrier and lack of sophisticated translation,” the police said. “Victims also can have reasonable doubt about investigation results, but investigators close the case only when it is impossible to trace suspects and evidence. We treat both foreign and Korean victims in the same way.” But that’s not how Mattner felt about the investigation process. She said that she had endured hours of waiting, “insulting” questioning by the police and painful tests at the hospital. Since she returned to Japan, she has not heard of any progress from the hospital or the authorities about her case.“To this day, they have done no investigation except for collecting CCTV footage from the hotel where the crime happened,” she said. Police decided to drop the case in January, citing lack of evidence, without explaining their decision to her. Mattner said the way the hospital handled things devastated her even further. “The hospital not only failed to collect my DNA evidence but also falsified my statements,” she said of her medical results that she was able to access only after pressuring the hospital through the Australian Embassy. “I was absolutely clear in telling them I was sure I had been drugged,” she said. “But a hospital staff wrote on official documents that I was too drunk and did not remember anything that had happened.”In her medical statement obtained by The Korea Herald, a doctor in charge of running the rape test for her did not collect DNA evidence from her body and clothes and did not take a picture of her damaged body, which is necessary to follow up with the investigation.  A doctor, who is aware of Mattner’s case and wished to remain anonymous, told the Korea Herald that she was also shocked at the hospital’s initial response toward the rape victim. “When rape victims arrive, doctors should run a rape kit to collect evidence as quickly as possible after explaining why such a measure is needed,” the doctor said. “Rape victims are especially traumatized and vulnerable, but in this case  initial check-up was not professionally done.” “I don’t understand why the hospital did not fill out some of the rape documentations without any explanation,” she said. “I don’t understand why they did not collect her underwear and failed to provide her with preventative medication for sex-related diseases.”Mattner is not alone in stepping up to tell stories of such an ordeal in Korea. After sharing her story online, 16 women approached her to share their experiences. Most of them said they had their cases dealt with in either similar or exactly the same way. A U.S. citizen, who was  then 17 years old, said she was raped by a Korean man in Seoul in 2014 when she was on an exchange program at a high school. Unlike Mattner, she decided to stay silent and not tell anyone of her “shameful” experience.“He was Korean and I am  foreigner, so I was scared that I might not win the case. I didn’t want to go through the pain of facing the Korean court system and exposing my rape to my friends and family, for the chance that he might go to jail,” she told The Korea Herald. “I learned that the hard way, but Korea needs to develop better resources when dealing with rape.” A 30-year-old woman from the U.S., who said she sought police help after being raped by a foreign suspect at an Internet Café in Hongdae in 2013, told The Korea Herald that she had to go through a long, horrible process of telling the police about what happened over and over again. “Police took my report and called me in to watch the CCTV video a few weeks later,” she said. “Then they had me retell my story and police officers started asking me questions about the incident in the hallway.”“I didn’t know why I had to keep telling them the story, even though they never gave me any updates on my case,” she said. “Every time I dealt with the police, they made me feel like I was lying.”She then left Korea and learned via email that the police dropped her case due to “lack of evidence. “They had evidence, but just did not use it,” she said.Kim Bo-hwa, a senior researcher from the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center, said that the ordeal is equally felt among Korean victims due to lack of awareness of sexual crimes here.“Rape victims here suffer from insensitivity toward them among government officials, lawyers, their families,” she told The Korea Herald.“During the investigation process from hospitals to the court, they are victimized again and again due to lack of awareness on sex crimes in the society,” she said, referring to a question like “Why did you even get drunk in the first place?” as an example. “There is a manual on how to deal with rape victims, but in most cases, those actions are not implemented,” she said. “The public awareness on sex crimes as well as its culture should change to improve the situation.”Six months after the horrible incident took place, Mattner took the matter into her own hands. She is currently raising funds on Go Fund Me page to take legal action in the U.K., wherethe man she believes raped her resides. She plans to return to Korea in May to collect the CCTV footage.She raised $12,320 as of Wednesday from 381 people since she launched the campaign on March 15.“Obviously I am not condemning the country whatsoever. I was treated very kindly by Korean people. But  hospital and police made the horrific experience so much more traumatizing because of their failure to take action,” she said. “There is absolutely no excuse for this.”Read more of Airdre Mattner’s story at www.gofundme.com/justiceforairdre.By Ock Hyun-ju","raped in hongdae popular ,foreign victims of rape ,raped in hongdae ,drugged abducted and raped ,and raped in hongdae","['Airdre Mattner', 'Seoul', 'Australian', 'Mattner', 'Hongdae', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56238818 -0.18215731

Additional photos were released following the first leak, in which students were shown standing in plastic buckets bound with tape while being splashed with the same tangy beverage.According to a Dong-a University spokesperson, the controversial event was administered by a soccer club within the Chemical Engineering department earlier in the month in an imitation of Korean folk ritual to ward off evil spirits and bad luck. “During the makgeolli ‘baptism,’ freshmen were taped up immobile. The liquid had cigarette butts, used tissues and phlegm mixed within,” a person who claimed knowledge of the incident said in a social media thread that exploded with criticism from enraged students.The soccer club’s student representative followed up with an official apology to the families of the freshmen, adding, “The event was not designed to intentionally haze the newcomers.”  He said that senior club members were also sprayed with the drink the week before the freshmen event, and that those who were “not feeling well” were exempted from participating. Dong-a University identified the case to be not only limited to the soccer club. Additionally reported photos revealed similar ceremonies as having taken place in lecture rooms other than that used by the sports club.The university will run an in-depth investigation targeting the entire Chemical Engineering department to find and punish those responsible. South Korean universities have become notorious for their oppressive and coercive drinking culture. Although school administrations have stepped up efforts to uphold integrity, similar cases of hazing and abuse continue to surface each year.

But the North has recently ratcheted up threats in a fit of anger against Seoul and Washington, vowing to carry out pre-emptive strikes.The communist country said Wednesday that it is ready to turn President Park Geun-hye and her office into ""a sea of flames and ashes,"" with its large-caliber multiple rocket launching system.The North also said that it has successfully conducted a solid-fuel rocket test and has acquired the re-entry technology that is a key to hitting a far away target with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile.South Korea and Washington rejected the North's claims, saying that based on their analysis, the North has yet to make nuclear warheads small enough to be amounted on ballistic missiles. They also raised doubts about the North's claims of the re-entry technology.Meanwhile, the North's leader has significantly reduced his public activity on the economic front despite the urgency to produce accomplishments ahead of the ruling party's congress slated for May, the ministry said.In the first quarter, Kim's on-site inspections of economy-related sectors accounted for 23 percent of the total, down about 20 percent from a year ago, it said.The Workers' Party of Korea is scheduled to hold its first party convention in more than three decades in May, pushing North Koreans to work hard in the ""70-day campaign of loyalty.""","this year seoul north ,seoul officials said thursday ,activity this year seoul ,seoul north korean leader ,year seoul north korean","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.N.', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67079985  0.58664876

A survey of long-term absentee students is separately underway. Of nearly 7,600 children who were found to not have enrolled in elementary and middle schools in time, some 5,400 of them were found to have moved abroad. Others were found to have enrolled in international schools or could not enter school due to illness, among other reasons.Elementary and middle school education is compulsory in Korea.The ministry then sent a list of 286 children whose whereabouts they could not immediately confirm to police. One of them was Shin Young-won, a 7-year-old who was found dead last month from starvation and abuse at the hands of his stepmother. The government and police were able to identify the safety of most of the children, but 19 remain missing. The ministry said most of them were multicultural children with dual citizenship. “In case of multicultural children with dual citizenship, confirming the whereabouts is difficult if they have left the country. There have been no signs of child abuse so far among those cases,” said a ministry official. The ministry has been releasing measures to prevent and crack down on child abuse, such as expanding monitoring of preschool operations and establishing child abuse report manuals for kindergarten and child care centers. It has also mandated schools report if a student is absent for unknown reasons for more than two consecutive days. Previously, the report was required upon absences of three consecutive days.The measures follow a series of brutal child abuse cases revealed this year that have led to the deaths of the children.A 22-year-old man accused of murdering his 3-month-old baby is taken by police in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, Thursday. Most recently on Friday, police referred a 22-year-old father in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, to prosecutors, requesting charges of murder resulting from the abuse of his 3-month-old daughter who would not stopping crying on March 9. Park is suspected of deliberately dropping the baby twice on the floor and leaving her to die. The police suspected that Park engaged in willful negligence, considering he did not provide proper medical care for the baby. His 22-year-old wife was charged with habitually neglecting the child, police said.

The KCNA dispatch did not give details about the date of his visit. He gave instructions to build the street into a ""monumental edifice strikingly displaying the Workers' Party of Korea's idea of attaching importance to science and talents and to highlight the might of socialist Korea.""Last November, North Korea completed the construction of the Mirae Scientists Street along the Taedong River in the North's capital which has a modern housing complex and service facilities for scientists. Noting that the construction of Ryomyong Street is a fierce battle with the U.S. imperialists and their followers, Kim called for the construction to be completed within this year to demonstrate the ""might of the DPRK fighting its way out with conviction in the rosy future and the traditions of ever-victorious Juche  Korea."" The DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. The street will have apartment buildings for scientists and researchers including those working at Kim Il Sung University. It will also have a nursery, kindergarten, laundry, post office and other public buildings and public service amenities, according to the news agency.""The intention is to turn Ryomyong Street into an energy-saving and green street of the 21st century,"" Kim said, adding that the design and construction should ensure the lighting and heating systems for the houses and public buildings are powered by solar panels, geothermal energy and natural lighting. Saying that he would dispatch the solider-builders who took part in the construction of Mirae Scientists Street to the construction of Ryomyong Street, Kim instructed that the entire ruling party, state and society should render all necessary assistance to the construction.""The construction of the street serves as a political occasion of clearly showing the spirit of the DPRK standing up and keeping up with the world, despite all sorts of sanctions and pressure by the U.S. imperialists and their followers,"" Kim said.","scientists street in pyongyang ,state media reported friday ,in pyongyang for scientists ,pyongyang north korean leader ,media reported friday kim","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Kim', 'Sun', 'Ryonghung', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA', 'KCNA']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57220191  0.62461883

Led by the emergency council of the Gaeseong-based factory owners and workers, some 1,000 people who lost their jobs overnight gathered at Imjingak Pavilion near the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone in the afternoon.At the rally, the participants, consisting of factory owners, subcontractors and workers, called on the government to offer them financial compensation rather than policies such as low-interest loans and tax cuts. Owners and workers of Gaeseong-based companies hold a rally in Imjingak on Wedesday. “Beyond this point is our Gaeseong complex, but we cannot go there now,” Jeong Gi-seob, cochairman of the emergency council and owner of the clothing company SNG, said. “Our wish is that the government resumes operation of Gaeseong complex.”“If it cannot happen for the country’s sake, we will not insist on reopening the factory zone,” he said. “But the government should at least financially compensate us to protect our property rights stipulated in the Constitution.” A public interest group of lawyers has claimed that the decision to shut down the factory had no legal basis and violated property rights. The group demanded the presidential office disclose the legal grounds for the action, but the government refused to reveal it, citing public security. The protest came amid growing frustration after Seoul shut down the jointly run Gaeseong industrial park on Feb. 10. No consultation was carried out with the firms. The decision was part of a “highly political strategy” in the wake of Pyongyang’s fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch, the government said. Since opening in 2004, the Gaeseong complex, some 60 kilometers northwest of Seoul, housed 123 South Korean firms, and employed around 54,000 North Korean workers in mostly labor-intensive sectors. All remaining South Koreans in the industrial park were expelled by the North early last month, a day after the shutdown. ""I was speechless when I heard about the government’s decision. I could not bring any of my stuff, such as clothes, cosmetics or money from Gaeseong,” said Kang Yong-ja, who has worked as a manger for a clothing factory for two years in the border city. “We are only workers. What did we do wrong? We had self-esteem as we were working not only to earn money but also contributing to improving inter-Korean relations,” the 52-year-old woman told The Korea Herald. “If the government got us fired, it should have some measures to help us.”“We need financial support. Without monthly income, I have no way to feed my children and pay for their education right now,” she said, while shedding tears. According to the council, the closure of the factories caused more than 815 billion won in financial losses, with the actual damage projected to be bigger. Up to 90 percent of workers were dismissed, it said. The government views the estimated losses as inflated. Last month, the government set up a joint task force team to lay out plans to assist the affected companies and workers. After the fifth round of discussion on Tuesday, the Unification Ministry said it would provide extra subsidies to local firms that ran factories at the industrial park, and welfare benefits for those dismissed.The measures include low-interest loans for the cash-strapped companies, a cut in interest rates on the South-North Korea Cooperation Fund, and suspension of loan payments. The government will also provide subsidies and consultation for factory owners to set up new facilities in South Korea.For dismissed workers, the government has said that it will dispatch 94 officials to help the unemployed apply for benefits schemes and find jobs. It will also slash health insurance fees for up to six months, and lend living expenses of up to 1 million won to those who lost jobs. “The measures are focused on business owners, not on workers,” said Hwang Won-sik, 58, who has been employed at a clothing factory for 10 years. “How do you think it is possible for me to get a job again? It is difficult even for young people to find employment, no?” The seemingly grim situation has hit subcontractors of Gaeseong-based factories even harder. While the government is busy rolling out plans to support the companies and their workers struck directly by the closure of the factory park, some 5,000 subcontractors and about 124,000 employees have been excluded from the state assistance scheme. “Our company received orders from one of the factories in Gaeseong, but the shutdown affected our business and I could not receive my wage this month,” said a 60-something man, who wished to remain anonymous. “The government said nothing about how to help us and that’s why I am here.” The council launched a petition to enact the special law to financially compensate them. Following the rally, the participants marched about 5.1 kilometers from the Imjingak Pavilion to the Unification Bridge in Paju. The council also plans to request for permission on March 21 to travel to their workplaces in the North, following Pyongyang’s announcement last week that it will liquidate all South Korean assets in the country and nullify all cross-border agreements on economic cooperation.The government vowed to launch an on-site inspection starting Monday to assess the exact financial damages sustained by local firms and present more detailed financial plans to support them.

Law enforcement officials did not elaborate on how the leaflets reached the school.In South Korea, all able-bodied men are required to serve about two years of mandatory military service, as the country is technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice agreement, not a peace treaty.On Monday, another 1,500 leaflets were found along the mountain side near the school, according to police.They said the North probably sent the leaflets in an apparent response to the joint military exercises between South Korean and the United States.Last week, the allies kicked off their largest-ever annual military exercises, amid escalating military tensions between South and North Korea following Pyongyang's nuclear and long-range missile tests earlier this year.","500 leaflets from seoul ,at local university tuesday ,north korean propaganda leaflets ,south korea police retrieved ,southern seoul the leaflets","['north korean', 'South Korea', ""Seoul National University 's"", 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27432477  0.14355043

The DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. Pyongyang views the latest allegations as a tool being used by Seoul to push forward stiffer antiterrorism measures.It said such actions are fueling resentment in the North.The party mouthpiece then said that if outsiders take any steps to tarnish the DPRK's integrity in any way, such actions will be mercilessly crushed.The paper then blasted South Korean President Park Geun-hye for instigating indiscriminate provocations, believing she has the backing of the United States, and warned that the North Korean military and the people will punish such actions.The latest attacks come as Seoul's spy agency said Friday that the North successfully hacked the smartphones of scores of senior South Korean officials."" sent malicious emails to  300 diplomats and military officials by impersonating the presidential office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Unification Ministry. Forty of them were successfully hacked,"" Lee Cheol-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party said after a closed-door parliamentary session of the National Intelligence Service  in Seoul.The NIS believes that North Korean hackers successfully infected the 40 phones between late February and early March, eventually gaining access to lists of phone calls made along with the contents of text messages and phone conversations.Rep. Joo Ho-young, who also attended the session, said that the North Korean cyberattacks against Seoul have doubled in the past month, citing the NIS briefing.Joo said the North had tried to hack into the control tower of South Korea's rail system as well as the computer networks of major financial institutions.These attempts, however, were interrupted by the NIS, the lawmaker said.North Korea -- which has thousands of cyberwarfare personnel -- has a track record of waging cyberattacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.North Korea launched a cyberattack against South Korea in July 2009, two months after its second nuclear test. It also hacked South Korean media organizations in March 2013, a month after its third nuclear test.","cyberattacks against seoul officials ,korea on sunday denied ,against south korean officials ,cyberattacks against south korean ,against seoul officials","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'Workers ’ Party of Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31650379  0.58804905

Once the ordinance revision passes the council, the city had planned to kick off the promotion measures starting this month. The Seoul Metropolitan Council, however, stopped all scheduled meetings over the ordinance in question, citing the post vacancy of a Seoul official who is in charge of the city’s branding. Although the city internally named a private branding expert to the post in January, the appointee needed time to sort out his private business, city officials said. Under the law, public officials are not allowed to have additional posts. Sources denied there being any other reason for the delay.The city said the official appointment will be announced soon.The capital’s new slogan had a bumpy start when it was chosen to replace “Hi Seoul” through public contest and voting last year, with critics pointing out the awkwardness of the phrase.

For Kim Eun-ji, a 26-year-old woman living in a Seoul suburb, checking if anyone approaches her at subway turnstiles has become a habit. “I’m worried if someone will again ask to bypass the turnstiles together. An old lady once asked if she could walk through the turnstile when I tagged my metro card. It was ridiculous, but it happened so quickly,” Kim said. Despite Seoul City’s efforts to curb illegal subway rides by charging a fine of 30 times the original fare, such rides are on the rise, the city said Tuesday. According to Subway Lines Nos. 1-4 operator Seoul Metro, more than 21,431 passengers illegally hopped on trains last year, paying 794 million won  in fines. In 2014, the number of illegal riders stood at 14,538. By routes, Subway Line No. 2 topped the list with 12,771 illegal rides, followed by No. 4 , No. 3 , and No. 1 . By stops, Hongik University Station saw the highest number of illegal rides with 1,533.As for methods used, passengers bypassed the turnstiles without tagging a metro card, illegally went through the special turnstile designed for the handicapped or tagged someone else’s metro card.“I know it is wrong, but it’s only a few bucks,” said a 62-year-old woman who admitted to having used her 66-year-old husband’s free metro card from time to time.Seoul Metro said the number of passengers using the metro card of a spouse or family member issued for elders, handicapped or students is on the rise, and the hardest to crack down on. “Senior passes, only distributed to citizens 65 years or older, are frequently used by elderly people at a younger age, or even by their grandchildren. But we can only identify the use of the senior pass when the red light turns on as the pass is tagged at the turnstile, while we cannot ask for the age of the pass holder every single time,” an official surnamed Lee at Seoul Metro told The Korea Herald.“Since we are neither the police nor have official right to interrogate passengers, clashes frequently break out between subway staff and illegal riders,” Lee added. Seoul commuters have also been critical of the high cost and congestion of the subway, saying focus should instead be placed on better preventing free riders.According to the report released Monday by city-run think tank the Seoul Institute, 724 billion won worth of extra burden is needed each year to manage Seoul’s subway operations during times of congestion.To reduce the burden, Seoul’s subway operators should consider adopting a differential fare system, charging passengers more during peak times, the report suggested.Ban Ah-hyun, 27, who travels to the crowded Gangnam area for work daily, objected to the measure.“Why should passengers who already pay the full subway fare embrace the burden? I already spend at least 150,000 won on my monthly transportation expenses. I think the city can make more money by collecting fines from illegal riders.” An official surnamed Seo at Seoul Metro said although adopting the different fare system is an option, they were aware of negative repercussions.“We agree that it is nonsense that frequent subway riders have to pay more . We will review the idea and its feasibility,” Seo said.By Kim Da-sol","in seoul on tuesday ,illegal subway rides rise ,seoul on tuesday yonhap ,woman living in seoul ,illegal subway rides","['Seoul', 'Kim Eun - ji', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5306465   0.21453351

Security Council Resolution 2094.In addition, only eight countries -- South Korea, Japan, Belgium, Brazil, Greece, Mexico, New Zealand and Qatar -- submitted reports on their plans to carry out the resolution in time before a 90-day deadline since the resolution's adoption.All five permanent members of the council missed the deadline. Russia turned in a report two days after the June 2013 deadline, and the United States and China four months later.Britain submitted the report in January 2014 and France in January 2015, the records showed.Last week's Resolution 2270 is the fifth Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on the North.The previous resolutions were adopted after the North's first nuclear test in 2006, its second nuclear test in 2009, its long-range rocket launch in late 2012 and its third nuclear test in early 2013.The latest resolution is considered the toughest ever as it requires mandatory inspections of all cargo going in and out of the North and bans its exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a key source of hard currency that accounts for nearly half of the country's total exports.","its third nuclear test ,council passed last week ,third nuclear test data ,third nuclear test ,2013 to punish pyongyang","['U.N.', 'Security Council', 'Pyongyang', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'the Security Council']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21536158  0.64915508

Kang, one of the survivors from the nation’s biggest maritime disaster, was found dead in an apparent suicide near a gym in the port city of Jindo, two days after the capsized ferry left 304 people missing or dead on April 16, 2014. Most of them were students on a school trip. In a suicide note, he said that he could not live with the knowledge that his students were still missing. “The field trip was my idea and death of the students was my fault. I will take all the responsibility.” After he died, his family tried to claim compensation given to the kin of those who have honorably sacrificed their lives on the job, but their application was refused.The Ministry of Personnel Management recognized seven teachers and two other temporary teachers as killed in the line of duty. The entitlements for the kin of the education officers who died on the job include benefits for their children, pension and tax cuts. Kang’s family then brought the case to court. The local district court ruled against the family, saying that his death is not subject to the Public Officials Pension Act. It stipulates that only those who died as a direct result of taking high-level risks to save the lives of others can be considered as having died honorable deaths. “It seems like Kang suffered from survivor’s syndrome and mental shock as a person in charge of the school trip and as a person who had survived alone,” the court said in a ruling. Doctors have pointed out that Kang’s suicide was a result of “survivor syndrome.” Posttraumatic stress disorder includes symptoms such as depression, anxiety and mood swings.

She and her family took him to the nearest general hospital, where he was admitted to its emergency facility, which was packed with patients. Her father soon awoke, but he had to wait more than five hours to get an x-ray done. “It was really frustrating,” she told The Korea Herald. “We were just repeatedly told that we needed to wait. No one explained to us anything.”More than three years have passed since Song’s experience, but the latest report released by the Health Ministry showed that not much has changed.  123RFThe report, written after inspecting a total of 414 general hospitals -- government-certified institutions with more than 500 patient beds -- last year, showed that at 27 hospitals a patient may need to wait at least 10 hours at emergency units to receive further treatment. The long waiting times and crowd at the nation’s emergency centers were pointed out as one of the biggest contributing factors to last year’s Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. About 50 percent of all confirmed MERS patients contracted the virus at Samsung Medical Center’s emergency unit. “It has always been a problem,” said Jeong Jae-su from the Korea Health and Medical Workers’ Union. “The biggest problem is that while general hospitals are supposed to focus on treating inpatients with serious conditions, they also rely on outpatients for their profit. They are not sending back the kind of patients who don’t need treatment at general hospitals. And this is why the emergency units are always crowded.”General hospitals not collaborating enough with smaller clinics is also cited as one of the causes, despite bigger facilities being advised to send patients with mild conditions to seek professional help from local and smaller services.“When a patient is new to the hospital -- which many of the emergency patients tend to be -- most of the time they are asked to receive examinations for the diagnosis. So the more new patients a hospital receives, the more medical examinations they can perform. And more money comes out of that,” Jeong said.Among the inspected hospitals, VHS Medical Center, a hospital for veterans and their families, had the longest waiting times for patients in critical conditions at its emergency unit -- an average of 23 hours. Busan Paik Hospital had the second longest waiting time, an average of 21.2 hours. Meanwhile, a patient would have to wait an average of 20 hours in order to receive further care after receiving urgent treatment at its emergency unit, the government report showed.“General hospitals are supposed to keep a certain amount of their beds empty for emergency patients who need to be hospitalized right away,” said Seo Min-soo from the ministry’s emergency healthcare division. “But a lot of the times the beds are occupied by outpatients.”Seo stressed that while only 6.6 percent of the patients who were admitted to the most crowded 20 emergency medical centers last year spent more than 24 hours at the facilities, they occupied 43.4 percent of all patient beds available. The Health Ministry plans to retract government certification from general hospitals if the institutions house too many patients for more than 24 hours at emergency units, instead of giving them the necessary medical treatment or procedure as soon as possible, he said. A nurse who works at one of the most crowded hospitals anonymously said there are also many cases in which emergency patients are released without receiving sufficient care as inpatients. Once, a patient who just underwent a surgical procedure was given a meal even before passing gas, so she can be released as soon as possible, the nurse said. “This was done in order to have as many new patients as possible,” she said “And a number of such inpatients returned to the emergency unit as they weren’t treated properly post-surgery.”  By Claire Lee","her father abruptly collapsed ,in seoul was devastated ,seoul was devastated when ,devastated when her father ,seoul was devastated","['Park Myeong - eun', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56871408  0.06822766

The police officers will take the lead in investigating violence against children, conducting on-site inspections and cooperating with child protection organizations to respond to child abuse cases.  They will be working with child welfare activists and teachers to visit the homes of students who have been absent from school for a long period of time.The authorities plan to increase the number of officers to 20,000 by 2019. “For now, there are limits for child activists and teachers to visit and investigate residences of long-term absentees, as they need permission from parents,” a police official said. “If police officers join the on-site inspections, such abuse cases can be more effectively detected.” Police said they also plan to carry out monitoring of runaway teenagers and the possible abuse of children who fail to enroll at schools.The Education Ministry has mandated that schools report whenever a student is absent for more than three days consecutively.But concerns exist over the ambiguous perception among law enforcement officers of what constitutes child abuse. According to a 2013 study by a team of social welfare professors at Ewha Womans University, police officers tend to be more lenient and insensitive to child abuse as they come across violence cases every day. In the survey, only 61.2 percent of the police officers saw swearing at kids as abuse and 46.9 percent considered parents intoxicated by drugs or alcohol as problematic. Less than half of the police recognized as child abuse parents beating a child’s face, head and ears. Only 62.4 percent of them viewed knocking down a kid as abuse and 67.9 percent acknowledged hitting children with hands or kicking them as abuse. The experts’ team conducted the survey on 190 police officers, judges and prosecutors specializing in cases involving women and child cases, at the request of the Justice Ministry. “There need to be education and training for police officers to teach them about the nature of child abuses and how to deal with child victims,” the scholars said in the report.By Ock Hyun-ju","children seoul metropolitan police ,wednesday that officers dedicated ,police stations in seoul ,seoul the police officers ,absentees police said wednesday","['Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Seoul']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42897248  0.2108904

Led by Kim Kyung-keun, a professor of education in Korea University, the team pointed out that the hierarchy established by educational institutions that operate as elite schools has run counter to the government’s attempts to standardize high school education. In Korea, foreign-language high schools, science high schools -- so-called “special-purpose schools” -- and autonomous private high schools are given leeway over school operations in exchange for government subsidies. Such schools sit atop the school pecking order.The report assessed that as these premium schools are perceived as above others in terms of the quality of their educational environment, many students from regular high schools face a sense of inferiority that ail their studies. The admissions process also penalizes regular schools, as elite schools are allowed to pick their students in the first half of the year while other schools hold their admissions in the second half of the year. “The gap in academic achievements between schools continues to grow, and many regular schools have trouble  conducting classes,” the report said. “Based on an analysis of parents and teachers, special purpose schools and autonomous schools showed high rates of satisfaction, but regular schools were shown to oppose the school hierarchy.”The report suggested getting rid of the separate admissions and abolishing the elite school system in the long run.Officials added that the report merely states the personal views of researchers who participated in the study and does not reflect the official views of the education office. However the left-leaning Seoul education chief Cho argued against elite schools even before taking office in 2014. The right-leaning Korea Federation of Teacher’s Associations opposed the idea, saying that the general trend among students and parents is to call for differentiated education for standouts, not a standardized program for all students.By Yoon Min-sik","seoul mulls abolishing elite ,seoul mulls abolishing ,abolishing elite high schools ,abolishing the high school ,mulls abolishing elite high","['the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'SMOE']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51548201  0.10032593

Lee No-geun of the ruling Saenuri Party, quoting National Health Insurance Service data, a total of 80,783 of some 1.07 million infants across the country did not receive their free health checkup as of 2013. This accounted for 7.5 percent of total babies.   Under the current health rule, babies must receive seven free health checkups from the age of 4 months to 6 years. The health examination includes development assessment, counseling and health education. YonhapIn the case of Seoul City, 10.7 percent of some 176,600 babies missed the checkup, recording the largest number in the country.Busan stood at second highest with 9.3 percent, followed by South Chuncheong Province and Gyeonggi Province, with 8 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. The Government has annually funded free health checkups for infants as part of its welfare projects.As of last year, the government covered about 220,000 won  per baby for the health checkup package. This led to the spending of 63.5 billion won in total, officials said. “Despite the huge budget spent, there is a large number of babies who missed the health checkup.  needs to thoroughly probe the causes and even consider checkup visits,” Lee said. “If suspected of child abuse,  must look into the cases with the police.” The NHIS, however, noted that other factors may have affected the figure, such as lack of awareness or schedule conflicts for double-income parents.

The nation’s spirit shattered and authorities were humiliated in their search for answers on why they were unable to save most of the passengers while the ship sank slowly for hours.The disaster revealed glaring problems in the Korean government’s risk and crisis management capabilities. There is the late response of the authorities, the blame games played by officials in the aftermath of the disaster and also the lack of clear instructions in such situations. One of the worst maritime disasters in the country’s history left Koreans questioning: Is Korea safe? Can our government protect us if disaster strikes?Last month, record snow left thousands of passengers stranded at Jeju International Airport for nearly three days as flights were grounded. It was later revealed that the emergency manual of the state-run Korea Airports Corporation lacked specific instructions on how to address the problem of passengers stuck in the airport.  Travelers wait for flights to resume at Jeju Airport in January Lee Jae-eun, a professor of Chungbuk National University and former president of the Korea Association for Crisis, pointed out the failure of the authorities to assess the severity or magnitude of the situation. “Having the passengers lay boxes and sleep on the floor is not a well-organized disaster management. The reactions  were spontaneous and inefficient,” he said.The situation did little for confidence in the Korean government. It already drew flak from the public after its questionable response to the Middle East respiratory syndrome last year made the country the stage for the second biggest MERS outbreak in the world, right behind the disease’s epicenter Saudi Arabia.Lee said that majority of Korea’s crisis management still relies on kneejerk reactions, rather than professionalism and well-established systems. He pointed out that officials cook up individual response plans whenever something crops up, whether it is the MERS outbreak, the Sewol disaster or preventing mosquito-borne Zika virus from entering the country.  Quarantine authorities disinfect a building in Seoul during the MERS outbreak in summer 2015. The government has made efforts to organize government reactions in disaster situations.In the aftermath of the Sewol tragedy, the government disbanded the Coast Guard and created the Ministry of Public Safety and Security to act as a control tower in crisis. But the efficiency of the new system was questioned in light of last year’s MERS outbreak.Lee Chung-min, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University, wrote in his column that the Korean government has structural limits in having different organizations work together in times of crisis. He cited the reasons for this as the authoritative top-down system of organizations, non-linear communication and secrecy between different groups. Lee of CNU said that the Korean government lacks what he calls a “core system” of risk management, a system which allows the institution to materialize the values, expertise, leadership and devotion that comes from understanding that it is for the people. “The ‘control tower’  was ineffective because it lacked authority and responsibility and also lacked leadership that can accurately assess the situation and take charge. In addition to coming short on expertise, officials were not sufficiently devoted, out of fear that they will shoulder all the blame in case something goes wrong.” Lee said. A rescue helicopter flies over the passenger ship Sewol while it sinks with 477 people on board, in waters off South Korea’s southwestern coast on April 16, 2014. He explained that the concept of security and risk management has changed to encompass not only military security and regional dispute, but elements of economics, environment, natural disasters as well as other factors such as cyber-attacks and meltdown of nuclear facilities. He suggested that the country’s risk management should be made into an academic discipline that does research to assess and anticipate risks and disasters that lie around the corner.“The paradigm of risk management has changed. Responding to each disaster as it comes along will no longer suffice,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","sea leaving 304 dead ,2014 ferry sewol plunged ,korea fails in crisis ,while the ship sank ,the ship sank",['korean'],15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39897203  0.29114175

They are showing no signs of compromising to ease rising military tensions on the peninsula. On Thursday, Pyongyang expelled all 280 South Korean workers from Gaeseong, effectively closing the complex that opened 12 years ago following the 2000 inter-Korean summit. It also froze all South Korean assets in the complex and declared it as a military off-limit zone.This move came a day after Seoul decided to pull out of the complex as part of punitive measures following Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests.Seoul’s Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo rebuked Pyongyang for freezing South Korean properties, expressing displeasure over the communist regime’s “wrongful” act.“The South Korean government thinks that it is very regrettable for North Korea to have done such a wrongful act, and we would like to make it clear that the North should take all responsibility for things to come in the future,” he told a press conference.He also issued a “grave warning” against Pyongyang’s decision to freeze South Korean assets in the Gaeseong complex and defended Seoul’s decision to pull out as a “difficult one  for national security and people’s safety.”“Our citizens’ precious properties should never be harmed,” Hong said.The South has made investments into the complex, estimated to be worth some 1.02 trillion won . A total of 124 South Korean companies hired some 55,000 North Koreans to produce some 60 billion won worth of products every month.  Cross-border transit gates in Dorasan, Paju, on Friday. As the North turned the factory park into a military zone, expectations have risen that the North might deploy more military assets to Gaeseong, a move that could sharply raise military tensions near the heavily fortified border.Before establishing the complex, areas in and around Gaeseong were militarized with four infantry regiments -- one artillery regiment, one armored battalion and one light infantry battalion -- among other military installations. Some observers have speculated that these units could be deployed again.Bilateral tensions have led to the suspension of inter-Korean civilian projects.Following Pyongyang’s Jan. 6 nuclear test, cross-border programs such as a joint excavation of Manwoldae, a palace of the Goryeo Kingdom  located in Gaesong, and a joint writing of a Korean dictionary, are to be suspended.The severance of all bilateral communication lines is also expected to deepen inter-Korean enmity. It is the first time since the early 2000s that all civilian and government communication channels have been cut.The Defense Ministry said that in case of a need to deliver a message to the North, the only possible way now will be through cross-border broadcasts. Some observers said that the two sides could also communicate through media outlets or via a third-party channel.With military tensions and the absence of a stable dialogue apparatus, the Park Geun-hye administration’s peninsular “trust-building” process has come to a halt. Seoul has long argued that it will leave the door open for dialogue with Pyongyang, while sternly dealing with the reclusive regime’s military threats.By Song Sang-ho","communication channels severed seoul ,channels severed seoul ,closure of the factory ,channels severed seoul and ,severed seoul and pyongyang","['Koreas', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Gaeseong']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58101481  0.14816828

The South Korean firms annually provide about US$100 million in total to North Korean workers as income.“Despite a series of provocations by the North in the past, the Gaesong Industrial Complex had served as a symbol of reconciliation and cooperation on the peninsula,” the Korea International Trade Association  said.“We hope that the jointly-run industrial park should resume its operations after soured inter-Korean relations ease, and urge the North to have in mind that any country would not invest in it unless it ceases provocations,” it said.The suspension of the complex is Seoul‘s toughest measure. It cuts off North Korea’s official remaining source of hard currency from the South.The complex had been recognized as an exception to Seoul‘s sanctions against Pyongyang designed to punish it for the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010.In April 2013, the North shut down the complex for about four months, citing what it called heightened tensions sparked by a military drill between Seoul and Washington. In February of that year, the North conducted its third nuclear test.The two Koreas agreed not to shut it down again “under any circumstances” when they decided to reopen it.Meanwhile, an association of South Korean firms operating in the Gaesong Industrial Complex urged the South Korean government to review its decision to shut down the jointly-run industrial complex.“We strongly urge the government to reconsider,” said Jung Ki-sup, the chief of the association. “We were abruptly informed of the decision... and we make it clear that recovering damages to be inflicted on our firms will not be possible in any way.”","korean government will map ,south announced complete shutdown ,city officials said wednesday ,korean border city officials ,fallout from the shutdown","['south korean', 'north korean', 'north‘s']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32930064  0.62667716

Police said they confiscated 1 kilogram of meth that was on his person at that time.Police said the suspect committed the crime under the instruction of a 56-year-old fugitive, identified only by his surname Kim, who fled to the Philippines in 2008 after being put on the wanted list for selling drugs in Busan. ""We will block the distribution of drugs in the country by arresting Kim as soon as possible in collaboration with Interpol and Filipino authorities,"" a SMPA official said.","arrested for trafficking meth ,trafficking meth 44 year ,man arrested for trafficking ,seoul police said wednesday ,smuggled kilograms of meth","['south Korean', 'Philippines', 'Seoul', 'song', 'southeast asian', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.2298272   0.47939894

The message, printed in Arabic on half an A4-size sheet of paper, read: ""This is the last warning to you. God will punish.""The warning was found inside a box in a men's bathroom in the airport, though no explosives or detonators were found, according to the police.Experts said there are some grammatical errors and the message is different from typical threatening messages, which either cite the Koran or are written in the name of Allah.The airport has also been hit by a series of security breaches in recent months.On Friday, a Vietnamese man illegally entered South Korea through the airport.Police have yet to find the 25-year-old transfer passenger, who forced his way through the gate at an unmanned automatic immigration checkpoint in the airport.Park also lashed out at lawmakers for their failure to pass an anti-terrorism bill, saying it showed they have no sense of urgency in protecting people's lives and security.The anti-terrorism bill has gained fresh momentum in South Korea following the deadly attacks in Paris last year that killed 130 people.Park also said the international community will call into question South Korea lawmakers if they fail to approve a bill meant to help improve North Korea's dismal human rights record.The rival parties have failed to narrow their differences over the wording of a clause in the bill.Similar bills were scrapped in recent years as liberal lawmakers have shied away from the issue of the North's human rights out of concern that it could harm inter-Korean relations.North Korea has long been accused of human rights abuses, ranging from holding political prisoners in concentration camps to torture and carrying out public executions.","cabinet officials on tuesday ,growing terror threat park ,korea main airport president ,on tuesday to beef ,the airport last week","['Park Geun', 'Cabinet', ""South Korea 's"", 'Cabinet']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.43916532  0.55293638

Questions surrounded the management of the overall passenger screening process and unmanned immigration service kiosks. The airport has been running without a CEO since its former head Park Wan-su quit last month to run for office in the general election slated for April. As concerns soared, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn convened an emergency meeting Sunday to call the incidents a “crisis” and ask for stronger security measures at the airport. “Protecting the airport that is the gateway into a country is to protect our nation. No action that threatens the safety can be tolerated,” Hwang hold attending ministers and called for an enactment of the pending antiterror bill. Police said Saturday they discovered a warning message written in Arabic inside a box that was discovered the day before in a men’s bathroom at the airport.  Police stand guard outside a restroom where a suspect package was found along with a threatening message at Incheon International Airport. YonhapThe message read: “This is the last warning being sent to you. God will punish.” According to police, the sentence had grammatical errors and might have been translated by using an automatic translating app or by somebody whose first language was not Arabic. The box had initially been suspected to contain an explosive device, but no explosives were found, the police said. The box had a number of random objects inside, including two butane canisters, a bottle of water, broccoli, banana peel, guitar strings and batteries, among other items.  A toilet where a box containing two butane gas canisters, a lighter, an oil can and a water bottle was discovered at Incheon International Airport on Friday. YonhapThe police said Sunday they were gathering more information about the origins of the box, which was from a local bakery chain.Clues will be gathered by finding out where the box in question was manufactured and distributed, the police said. They have also obtained 19 sets of fingerprints from the restroom and are processing them.Also on Friday, a Vietnamese man in his 20s entered South Korea by forcing his way through an automatic immigration service gate at the airport. A week before, a Chinese couple, transfer passengers en route to Beijing from Tokyo, illegally entered the country by slipping through a designated gate for airport staff located near the immigration desks. It took the airport officials 11 hours to discover the illegal entry by the couple, who had reportedly came in through a broker seeking jobs.By Claire Lee","international airport including illegal ,security breaches at incheon ,airport including illegal entry ,airport including illegal ,airport series of security",[],15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18192905  0.39434215

A cruise ship is being hauled after being stranded in the Hangang River on Tuesday. YonhapA salvage operation was underway after the 125-ton vessel run by Eland Cruise began to sink at about 2:30 p.m. near the Seongsu Bridge that links the Seongdong and Gangnam districts. The fire authorities said they rescued six passengers -- including three American and two Thai tourists -- and another five crewmen 15 minutes after the accident and transported them to medical facilities. They had departed from the Jamsil Quay in southeastern Seoul to cruise west and were returning to the origin from around the Dongho Bridge.  The exact cause of the incident will be known only after a review, but it appears to be a water leak from the engine room that prompted the power generator to halt, according to news reports. With a “considerable” part of the stern of the boat submerged, the engineers were draining out the water before hauling the ship back to Jamsil. “We’re having difficulties towing the cruise ship due to its big size and the frozen river,” a fire official was quoted as telling Yonhap News, adding that the authorities have sent a large tugboat to the scene.

YonhapMore than 1,200 inbound and outbound Jejudo Island flights have been canceled since Saturday, as the resort island was hit by the heaviest snowfall in 32 years with rough winds. The massive cancellations for nearly 90,000 passengers paralyzed the airport, with some 1,400 taking refuge at the passenger terminal overnight. Passengers rest on the floor at Jeju International Airport‘s passenger terminal early Monday. YonhapDespite the resumption of flights, passenger traffic was expected to persist for the time being due to the limited capacity of the airport. The Jejudo Island airport can currently handle 34 flights per hour. Operation of most ships to and from Jejudo Island also resumed in the afternoon as wind alerts were lifted. The passenger ships between Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, and the eastern island of Ulleungdo, however, were still restricted due to wave and wind advisories, leaving more than 1,000 island residents isolated for more than a week. Marine transportation officials said the advisory is expected to be cleared Tuesday. Soldiers clear the snow from greenhouses in Gwangju, Monday. Gwangju saw over 20 centimeters of snow. YonhapMeanwhile, a cold snap continued to grip the nation Monday with many regions recording around minus 20 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in Paju and Pocheon in Gyeonggi Province reached minus 21.7 degrees Celsius, and minus 19.5 degrees Celsius in Imsil, North Jeolla Province.

The ministry will also survey those who haven’t been vaccinated as scheduled to discover and prevent possible abuse cases. Chung vowed to collaborate with municipal governments and schools, as well as the National Health Insurance Service.“Child abuse is a crime that is not acceptable in any situation,” the minister said. “We plan to use government data, such as the National Health Insurance records, to make early intervention and prevention possible.” Among the 10,027 confirmed child abusers last year, 8,207 were the victims’ parents. The largest number of cases, 33 percent, were due to the parents’ “lack of knowledge and skills in child care,” such as not being able to differentiate between abuse and discipline, according to the National Child Protection Agency.

The fliers -- first retrieved last Wednesday -- continued to be found in the northern parts of Seoul, Goyang, Paju and other Gyeonggi Province regions, the military and police said. There are several editions but most of them call for a halt of the broadcasts, threaten a military strike, and condemn the Park Geun-hye government and the U.S.’ “hostile” policy toward Pyongyang. “They are being dispatched every day. So far about 1 million leaflets are presumed to have been dispersed, and we  have collected a considerable number of them,” ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok said at a news briefing. “But the locations are very limited, mostly around northern Gyeonggi localities and some Seoul areas.”  South Korean soldiers search an area in Tanhyeon, Paju, for anti-Seoul propaganda leaflets sent from the North on Jan. 14. YonhapThe North is believed to be packing the brochures in plastic balloons with a timer and detonator before sending them across the border. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that it has detected their launch operations, though it was difficult to tally precisely how many were dispatched and discovered.  The move appears to be designed to counter Seoul’s ongoing broadcast campaign that was reinitiated on Jan. 8 in a first penal step against Pyongyang’s fourth nuclear test two days prior.Though the North has also reactivated its own loudspeakers for anti-Seoul broadcasts, officials here argue its effect is “minimal” because of the outdated equipment. Pyongyang’s Foreign Ministry last Friday slammed the South’s campaign as an “offbeat provocation,” urging an immediate halt. “North Korea’s broadcasts can reach a mere 1 to 3 kilometers, compared to ours which can be heard more than 10 kilometers away,” the spokesman noted. “That means beyond the 10 kilometer radius, it’s only our loudspeakers that people from both sides can listen to.” By Shin Hyon-hee","million anti seoul leaflets ,korea sent million anti ,first retrieved last wednesday ,north korea sent million ,sent million anti seoul","['North Korea', 'anti - south', 'Seoul', 'the Defense Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Goyang', 'Gyeonggi Province']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3336302   0.14583495

Vice Health Minister Bang Moon-kyu  speaks during a meeting on standardizing Korean traditional herbal medicine at the Lotte Hotel in central Seoul on Wednesday. YonhapThe ministry made it clear that the latest proposal does not include any plans to let the doctors use medical devices. Some of the major proposals include publishing standardized guidelines for traditional doctors to use for a total of 30 most common health conditions among patients who choose to visit traditional clinics. They include: indigestion, obesity, depression, insomnia, infertility, dementia, cancer, failed back surgery syndrome and spinal stenosis. For the publication of the guidelines, the Health Ministry will launch a three-year clinical research for each of the 30 conditions. All university textbooks used for traditional medicine programs will be standardized as well.“We’ve been hearing a lot of comments from patients who said they have difficulty finding a good traditional clinic,” said Ko Deuk-Yung, director general of Traditional Medicine bureau of the Health Ministry.“We want to standardize the services and medicines so patients can be guaranteed quality treatment as long as they visit the clinics that have been approved by the government.”According to a 2011 government survey, 34 percent of Koreans who have been treated at traditional clinics said they were dissatisfied with the services because each clinic had different treatment methods for their conditions. Ko said while the government acknowledges that there are many advantages of “cheopyak,” a package of prepared medicinal herbs, it is hard to standardize the quality as clinics use different herbs for different conditions. Once made into tablets and syrup, it will be easier for the government to scientifically review their quality and safety, the director general said. “Tablets are also more accepted by the general public,” Ko added.The Association of Korean Medicine, the largest body of traditional doctors in country, however, said it’s questionable if standardization would be possible if they are not allowed to use nontraditional medical scanning equipment, such as ultrasound or X-ray machines, for more accurate diagnosis.Currently, the Korean law allows traditional medical professionals to use all nontraditional medical scanning equipment except for MRI and CT scanners. According to the latest government data, the medical bills of Koreans on traditional medical treatment increased from 2010-2014. Overall expenditure on traditional medical treatment, such as acupuncture, in 2014 was 2.4 trillion won . The spending has increased significantly since 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 7.7 percent per year, according to the state-run Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.One of the biggest factors behind this growth is the country’s growing elderly population, many of whom prefer traditional treatments over Western medicine, according to the government.The Health Ministry said it plans to come up with a system where the cost of herbal medicine for the 30 health conditions can be covered by the National Health Insurance. Currently, most of herbal medicines are not covered by the NHI, except herbs that have been powdered. . In 2014, payments for traditional medical treatments and herbal medicine only accounted for 4.17 percent of all national insurance payments that year.The ministry is also coming up with a system where patients can be treated by both physicians and traditional doctors at the same time, especially at state-run medical facilities such as the National Medical Center.  There have been a number of cases where the condition of those who suffered spinal cord injuries improved significantly after receiving both Western and Korean traditional treatments at the National Rehabilitation Center, said Kim Dae-wook, the director of division of Traditional Korean Medicine Policy at the Health Ministry. The government’s latest measure that sidestepped the contentious issue of medical equipment is likely to further stoke debate.A number of traditional doctors have faced lawsuits filed by doctors who practice Western medicine, who claimed it is dangerous for those who are not trained in medical science to use any conventional medical equipment. A number of cases have been won by nontraditional doctors in the past -- which eventually prohibited traditional doctors from using certain devices. As a part of its deregulation agenda, the Office of Government Policy Coordination and the Health Ministry together announced in January last year that they were considering a law that lets traditional doctors use nontraditional medical devices without having to worry about being sued by regular physicians. The ministry had promised to come up with the system by the end of 2015, but it never happened as there was fierce opposition from the Korean Medical Association, which represents 100,000 physicians. “We think it’s a great plan,” Kim Ji-ho from the Association of Korean Medicine told The Korea Herald. “But considering the way the Health Ministry has been treating us in the past year, we are not sure if any of this plan is going to actually materialize.”Kim said if the Health Ministry does not guarantee traditional doctors’ rights to use medical equipment by the end of January, AKOM would file an administrative litigation against the government. On Tuesday, the group’s representative Kim Pil-geon used a bone density scanner for a patient in front of reporters to show how an equipment can help a traditional doctor make a diagnosis. Right after the press meeting, he was reported to prosecutors by physicians who practice Western medicine.The KMA also released a statement reaffirming its stance against the traditional doctors’ use of medical equipment. “We are afraid that patients would be asked to take unnecessary medical examinations by those who have not been properly trained to use such equipment to make scientific diagnosis,” the organization said in a statement.Ko from the Health Ministry said the issue is a “sensitive matter” and it’s very important that the two organizations -- AKOM and KMA -- communicate with each other and make compromises. “We’ll do our best as a mediator,” he said.By Claire Lee","health ministry announced wednesday ,korea traditional herbal medicine ,ministry announced wednesday ,ministry announced wednesday the ,herbal medicine currently sold","['South Korea ’s', 'the Health Ministry']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23451787  0.7066716

190,190,Troops on high alert as Seoul starts anti-N.K. propaganda,"YEONCHEON/SEOUL ― Tension prevailed across the Demilitarized Zone after South Korea reactivated sets of loudspeakers for anti-Pyongyang broadcasts on Friday in a first punitive step against the North’s fourth nuclear test two days ago. At noon, the “Voice of Freedom” show began with the host calling for soldiers to quit smoking as a New Year’s resolution, followed by the 1980s rock band Gun Son’s popular song “...","YEONCHEON/SEOUL ― Tension prevailed across the Demilitarized Zone after South Korea reactivated sets of loudspeakers for anti-Pyongyang broadcasts on Friday in a first punitive step against the North’s fourth nuclear test two days ago. At noon, the “Voice of Freedom” show began with the host calling for soldiers to quit smoking as a New Year’s resolution, followed by the 1980s rock band Gun Son’s popular song “No Smoking” and Rimi and Potato’s “Baby I’m Cold.”Unfolding at 11 locations along the heavily fortified frontier, the broadcasts provide a rare source of outside news and music for North Korean frontline troops and residents of border towns in the reclusive society. It has four main themes, each aimed at promoting freedom and democracy, illustrating the South’s political and economic ascent, recovering national homogeneity and revealing the reality of the regime, according to Seoul’s Defense Ministry.  A solder is on the guard nearby a set of loudspeakers reactivated Friday in central Gyeonggi Province. Cheong Wa Dae announced the restart of the program late Thursday in an apparent display of Seoul’s resolve for stern reaction to the Kim Jong-un regime’s unchecked brinkmanship. It had been idle since a 15-day airing that ended on Aug. 25 with an inter-Korean agreement over Pyongyang’s land mine attack.For the reopening, the military upgraded the content to criticize the recent atomic test, while adding latest hit tunes such as Lee Ae-ran’s viral “A Centennial Life,” GFriend’s “Me Gustas Tu,” Apink’s “Let Us Just Love” and Big Bang’s “Bang Bang Bang.” In a radio drama aired around 6 p.m., a top aide of Kim’s deceased father and late strongman Kim Jong-il sexually harrassed a married woman who then was shot to death by him while trying to protect her disputing husband. “We plan to air the show for two to six hours every day on an irregular basis but in a way that prevents any damage from a possible attack across from the border and minimize the residents’ inconvenience,” a military official told reporters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “Most subjects are based on facts, and some are about human rights violations and others the nuclear test, saying the regime is worsening already difficult economic circumstances.” The apparatus is expected to evoke the rage of Pyongyang that deems it as a direct threat to the leadership. It also runs a similar propaganda broadcast program against the South, but had yet to switch it on again as of Friday evening. Many defectors who resettled in the South have testified that they had first come to know about the South and the outside world through the broadcasts, which can travel as far as 10 kilometers. This means that those walking down the streets of the North Korean border city of Gaeseong may hear the sounds seeping out of the speakers in Paju, Gyeonggi Province.Shortly after the South resumed the broadcasts last August in retaliation against the mine provocation, the North fired artillery shells near a loudspeaker erected in a western border town, declaring a “quasi-state of war” and forward-stationing offensive assets and troops in full combat readiness. A gunpost is open at a North Korean border island in the West Sea on Friday. To boost vigilance and better counter a possible strike, the South Korean military has moved forward some artilleries and other gear and elevated its readiness posture and Information Condition levels by one notch, though the Watch Condition remains intact.“The North appears to have also been deploying more frontline troops and strengthening monitoring,” a Defense Ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. On the diplomatic front, Seoul is stepping up diplomatic efforts with Washington, Beijing, Tokyo and other world powers as they are working on levying new sanctions against Pyongyang bilaterally and at the U.N. Security Council. Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se sought to rally China’s support from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during their phone conversation later day. Hwang Joon-kook, the South’s top nuclear negotiator, also spoke with his counterpart Wu Dawei on the phone. In a separate phone call, Defense Minister Han Min-koo discussed ways to boost cooperation with his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi  shakes hands with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond in Beijing on Tuesday. Beijing’s role is imperative in particular given its veto power at the council and influence over the recalcitrant regime as its top political and economic benefactor. Though it appears to have somewhat tightened the existing measures’ enforcement, it had been resistant to imposing much more powerful banking restrictions or “secondary boycott” steps, which call for penalties for third party companies and individuals engaged in transactions with the North. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also decried China’s shield and urged Wang to change course on Thursday. “Today in my conversation with the Chinese I made it clear: That has not worked, and we cannot continue business as usual,” he said after their phone talks, referring to China’s approach. Washington is writing a draft resolution to propose to the UNSC that would stifle North Korean trade and finance through a partial ban on its ships seeking to enter ports around the world and a cutoff of banking transactions similar to the ones previously levied against Iran, the New York Times reported. The House of the U.S. Congress, for its part, is expected to vote on legislation carrying new sanctions on North Korea as early as next week.

Lee Cheol-woo, on the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters that the nuclear test had no preceding signs, which differed from previous tests. “Usually a previous announcement and other actions herald the test, but this was not the case,” he said, adding that an analysis of Pyongyang’s post-test announcement is necessary.The committee, citing sources at the National Intelligence Service, added that Pyongyang did not alert the United States or China. This contrasted with previous cases, in which the communist country had warned China, the U.S. or Russia beforehand.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un publicly claimed in December that the country was capable of detonating a hydrogen bomb. Both Seoul and the White House had expressed skepticism about whether the country had completed development of a hydrogen bomb. Russia echoed their views, saying that the claims were likely a bluff, pointing out that Kim had made false claims before.Joel Wit, a visiting researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said last month that North Korea could deploy a hydrogen bomb by 2020, although he said that Kim’s claim was “technically unlikely.”An official from the Defense Ministry, who wished to remained anonymous, had said “there was low possibility” of a nuclear test in the near future for North Korea. But some experts in academic circles had raised the possibility of an upcoming hydrogen bomb test.Professor Kim Tae-woo of Konyang University, formerly the head of the Korea Institute for National Unification, said Monday that Pyongyang “may already have the technology to build an H-bomb.” He pointed out that it took most nuclear nations only five years to progress from a first-generation nuclear bomb to a second-generation hydrogen bomb, adding that Kim may be “biding his time” before ordering the test.But some military officials suspect that Pyongyang may not have used an actual hydrogen bomb in Wednesday’s test. They stressed that the test generated seismic activity of magnitude 4.9, which was actually smaller than in the North’s third nuclear test in 2013.Regardless of the hydrogen bomb’s legitimacy, experts have said the testing will have a resounding impact on the power dynamics of Northeast Asia. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute think tank, told local media that Pyongyang’s intent is to show off its military prowess by cementing its position, pressuring U.S. to engage in bilateral talks and gaining leverage in negotiations with South Korea.By Yoon Min-sik","test catches seoul off ,reporters that the nuclear ,hydrogen test on wednesday ,catches seoul off guard ,test catches seoul","['North Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Saenuri Party', 'Lee Cheol - woo']",15,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.5520038   0.65153563

President Barack Obama. AP-YonhapBut such a hardline stance has hitherto failed to lure Pyongyang for meaningful talks to at least freeze the regime’s nuclear activities, allowing it to continue upgrading its nuclear technology, critics said.“So far, Seoul and Washington have focused on applying sanctions and putting pressure on the North, believing that it is unlikely to abandon its nuclear program,” said Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University.“They have also persistently demanded that the North should take pre-steps for the reopening of the denuclearization talks, although Pyongyang has itself suggested talks and made many fence-mending gestures.” The U.S. has so far maintained a policy of what analysts called “strategic patience,” which some derided as “strategic ignorance” or even “strategic coma.” Washington has been increasingly reluctant to engage with the North amid the deterioration of bilateral ties.After the breakup of the 2012 “Leap Day” deal between Washington and Pyongyang, the bilateral relationship was caught in a downward spiral. The deal, under which Pyongyang agreed to put a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests in return for 240,000 tons of nutritional assistance, was breached after the North fired a long-range rocket less than two months later -- an incident that deepened mutual distrust. Bilateral friction further increased in late 2014 when the U.S. blamed the North for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, and imposed fresh sanctions against it in retaliation for the alleged hacking.U.S. President Barack Obama’s abrupt mention of the collapse of the North Korean regime early in January 2015 fueled bilateral animosities, which analysts said made Pyongyang further step up efforts to secure what it calls self-deterrence measures.Amid the deterioration of ties, Pyongyang was seen moving to restore its ties with the U.S. through a set of proposals. Last year, Pyongyang called on Washington to stop its military exercise with Seoul in return for its moratorium on a nuclear test. But it was spurned by Washington.Pyongyang has also called for talks over a peace treaty with the U.S. to replace the current Armistice Agreement. But Washington has dismissed it as insincere, apparently viewing the proposal with suspicion that the reclusive regime might take advantage of it to expel U.S. forces in the South.With the presidential election slated for November, the U.S. policymakers are unlikely to pay more attention to the North Korean issue, analysts say, highlighting the need for Seoul to make more efforts to engage with the North and prevent it from further developing its nuclear program.In line with the U.S., Seoul has also maintained a tough stance over the North, calling for more sincerity from Pyongyang instead of its verbosity about improving bilateral ties. It has continued to maintain economic sanctions against the North and ratcheted up pressure on the North to give up its nuclear ambitions in cooperation with the U.S., China and other major powers.Seoul has so far focused its energy on the unification policy, but critics argue that the policy has given an impression that the South seeks to forcibly absorb the North into its democratic system, rather than seeking coexistence with the North. Pyongyang has called the policy “ill-intended.”Experts say that Seoul should be more active in contriving more creative ways to bring the North out to the dialogue table and to resume the denuclearization process.“Seoul has not been active enough to tackle the nuclear issue so far. The centerpiece of the North Korean problem is the nuclear issue, but it has not been effectively addressing the issue,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“Seoul has long called for Pyongyang’s sincerity. But the North cannot be trusted and has to be managed or taken care of. It should exert more efforts to persuade China and the U.S. to work out a coordinated resolution to the North Korean conundrum.”Since early last year, Seoul has called for unconditional “exploratory dialogue” with Pyongyang, as the latter has rejected the offer for official multilateral denuclearization talks -- as Seoul and Washington have demanded that Pyongyang take sincere denuclearization steps.But the efforts have also failed due to bilateral distrust.By Song Sang-ho","hydrogen bomb test seoul ,of pyongyang nuclear weapons ,bomb test seoul and ,drew heavy criticism wednesday ,bomb test seoul","['Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang']",15,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26667756  0.60811919
