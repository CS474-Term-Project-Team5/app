Researchers collect bird flu-infected poultry at a farm located in Incheon on Monday. The 40-year-old employee of the Seongju County office, North Gyeongsang Province, was found dead Tuesday after working for more than 12 hours every day since last month to disinfect poultry facilities. “Fatigue is growing among the personnel due to protracted fumigation activities,” Hwang said during the session, requesting the related agencies to secure alternative labor force. “I want you to take an all-out approach with extraordinary resolve so that we can certainly contain the AI spread within one week.” As of midnight Tuesday, nearly 27 million chickens and ducks at 567 farms have been slaughtered across the country, which amounts to more than 15 percent of the country’s supply of chickens and 25 percent of the supply of ducks, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Some experts project the tally may shoot up to 50 million due to the cold weather and pervasiveness of the flu. Egg prices are shown above 10,000Won at some placesEgg prices skyrocketed in the wake of the AI outbreak, with a tray of 30 eggs exceeding 10,000 won  at some places, prompting the government to temporarily lift tariffs on imports. The nationwide average price stands at around 7,500 won, up almost 38 percent from a year ago. Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Minister Kim Jae-soo also said Tuesday that the agency will look into whether retailors and bakery groups unreasonably hike prices. “Currently some 2,100 tons of eggs and related products are imported annually, so they can still use them to make bread and other things. We should monitor if they raise the prices on the excuse of higher egg costs,” he said at an internal agency meeting.

If companies continue to resist, they face a jail term of up to five years or a fine of up to 50 million won .“With an increased levy scheme, we expect automobile makers to make extra effort to avoid breaching vehicle authentication measures,” said Na Jung-kyun, the ministry’s director general for climate and air quality management.“We are glad to see that the ministry can become more directly involved in protecting customers’ rights,” he added. The revision bill was introduced four months after the ministry cancelled the authentication for 32 types of Volkswagen vehicles -- 83,000 vehicles in total -- as the company had forged test results for its vehicles’ noise-level, fuel efficiency and emissions to receive authentication. Another 126,000 vehicles were decertified in November 2015 for using a defeat device to trick emissions test.In August, a penalty totaling 17.8 billion won was charged to the German carmaker’s local unit for falsifying authentication documents on the fuel efficiency and emissions of 24 models of VW vehicles, including the VW Golf and Audi A8.

Kim Hyun-kwon, adding the government should come up with stricter quarantine measures. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, at least 3,400 public officials and 19,000 civilians were put into work to cull and bury infected poultry at 42 sites across the nation, over the past 40 days since the virus was first detected in South Chungcheong Province. Researchers collect bird flu-infected poultry at a farm located in Incheon on Monday. There have been no reports of infections through people or livestock thus far.While local governments are mainly responsible for dispatching people to work at infected poultry farms, military officials said Tuesday they have been sending the Army’s Chemical Forces to affected areas in South Gyeongsang Province and North Jeolla Province since last week, due to a shortage of workers. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that the government classified some 13,000 workers at the disease-hit sites as a high-risk group to receive state monitoring, and helped them get vaccinations.Quarantine authorities added that they also provided workers antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and protective clothing to guard against the outbreak spreading to people.But the highly pathogenic bird flu is spreading at an unprecedented pace across the country, having already swept through neighboring countries earlier this year, killing over 20 people. In China, there have been 16 H5N6 human infections since 2014, resulting in the deaths of 10 of those infected.So far, authorities said 26 people among the high-risk group reported flu-like symptoms, but none of them have been confirmed to have the virus.The highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of bird flu is currently being examined at the National Institute of Environmental Research to find out if the outbreak can spread to people, authorities added.The current outbreak is already worse than that in 2014, when 13.96 million fowls were put down over six months. A record number of 10 million chickens, ducks and quails have been culled throughout the nation so far, with an additional 3.78 million in waiting.By Kim Da-sol","researchers collect bird flu infected ,flu infected poultry at farm ,poultry at bird flu hit ,collect bird flu infected poultry ,province researchers collect bird flu","['Democratic Party of Korea', 'Kim Hyun - kwon', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'South Chungcheong Province', 'Incheon', 'the Army ’s Chemical Forces', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'North Jeolla Province', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'China', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'Kim Da - sol']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48147082  0.10288851

It was of the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of bird flu, a new type of virus that was first detected in South Korea.According to the sources, South Korea's quarantine authorities set the AI big data system in motion soon after the first outbreak on Nov. 16, in an effort to stave off the spread of the crippling poultry disease.Co-developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and No. 2 mobile carrier KT Corp. in 2014, the system forecasts possible areas of infection with an accuracy rate of 90 percent by analyzing GPS information on vehicle movements among farms during the 21-day incubation period.Five days after the first reports, the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency singled out regions at risk of infection, informing local governments of the list and closing traffic to those areas.But it proved to be a belated move as the disease spread at a far faster pace than expected. Unlike the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain that hit the country in 2014-15, the H5N6 spread across the nation simultaneously through wild migratory birds almost without an incubation period.Experts said the big data system has been useless as it is designed to forecast areas of possible infection by considering vehicles as the main medium of spreading the virus.In order to overcome the limits of the current big data system, quarantine authorities should develop a response system based on new technologies such as Internet of Things, which will likely send farmers information on outbreaks as quickly as possible.South Korea had more than 156 million chickens and more than 9.5 million ducks as of the end of March, according to government data. South Korea culled 14 million birds in 2014.","worst ever bird flu outbreak ,its worst ever bird flu ,bird flu outbreak this winter ,worst ever bird flu ,country latest avian influenza outbreak","[""South Korea 's"", 'Haenam', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'AI', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'KT Corp.', 'Animal', 'Plant Quarantine Agency', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",19,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.46199048  0.5511871

But such precautions still seem inadequate in keeping her germ-free, especially when strangers near her start to cough without covering their mouth. “I saw a lady who clearly had a contagious cold, coughing, sneezing and wiping her nose with her hand in the subway. I immediately stood up and moved to a different part of the subway,” Kim said, expressing frustration at ignorance about etiquette in public places.In the face of the worst seasonal flu sweeping the nation, Kim’s complaint seems to be shared by an increasing number of South Koreans. A student is seen wearing a face mask during class at an elementary school in Masan, South Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. Doctors, too, stress that simple etiquette can be most effective in preventing the spread of the contagious seasonal flu virus. The failure to properly educate students and follow preventive steps may have been behind the worst flu outbreak in decades, they said. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a record high number of young patients were diagnosed with flu last week -- 152 flu cases per 1,000 students aged 7-18. The government began monitoring the flu in 1997.Dr. Kim Yang-hyun of the Anam Hospital of Korea University Medical Center said flu etiquette is relatively less known or followed by Koreans, compared to people in other countries. “Did you know that you should sneeze into your elbow, not your hand?” he asked. “Also, not many in South Korea can decide for themselves whether or not they should go to work or school when they sneeze and cough,” he added. Last year, South Korea had a major outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome that caused 38 deaths. The state-run KCDC, in response, came up with antiviral treatment guidelines that include educating children and adults to sneeze into their elbows.But such information is still not well known among the public or taught at schools, experts highlighted.Sneezing into one’s elbow can prevent some 3,000 infectious droplets from being sprayed onto hands, which could spread germs by holding or passing frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and tables. “Koreans tend to campaign or follow health care steps only when a serious disease outbreaks,” a medical resident at Seoul National University Hospital told the Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. “Simple but fundamental preventive steps can keep colds away. All we need to do is to follow simple manners on a daily basis, which takes on a whole new meaning when their intent is to protect your health and the health of those around you,” he added.In other developed countries like the US, health authorities have been campaigning since 2009 to teach elementary school students to properly cover their mouths when they cough through the distribution of flyers and posters about health care, under the slogan “Cough = Elbow.”South Korean health authorities said Tuesday that they had suggested schools start their winter vacation earlier than scheduled and immediately stop students from attending school. Doctors said the disease, the influenza A virus subtype H3N2, is unlikely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia, if patients receive timely treatment.“Although the flu virus this time is accompanied by symptoms such as headaches and muscle pain -- rare for other types of seasonal flu -- the disease can be cured when the patients visit the doctor immediately and take antiviral drugs like Tamiflu,” said Dr. Kim Gyu-yeon of The Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Health System.Getting a vaccination, either a flu shot or a nasal-spray type vaccination, is another simple method to reduce chances of catching cold. “Those who study or work in confined spaces are particularly susceptible to the highly contagious illness, since people with the flu can spread it to others up to about 2 meters away, mainly by droplets made when they cough, sneeze or talk,” said Kim.While vaccines show efficacy after two weeks, it is still not too late to get a vaccination now, as the cold weather is to continue until February next year, he added.

The park was temporarily closed since Saturday after it found two dead storks on consecutive days.Seoul City said it has also obtained 2,700 doses of antiviral drugs and 12,000 items of protective clothing in case the outbreak spreads to people. Currently there have been no reports of infections through people or livestock so far.“We are putting together every effort to secure citizens’ health with high-level quarantine measures,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-Soon in a statement.“While chicken, duck and eggs that are sold in the market in Seoul are safe to eat, I hope groundless worries about eating poultry do not hurt the poultry farms in the country,” Park added.Authorities said that it will strengthen quarantine measures at some 17 wintering sites for migratory birds located in Seoul, such as the Han River and Jungnang Stream, by sterilizing the area every day.An off-limits sign is held Monday at an ecological park by the Han River, following a series of bird flu cases detected in zoos and outdoor places around Seoul. The city government has already closed down four ecological parks in the capital and halted a migratory bird observation programs after the H5N6 bird flu virus was first reported in southern rural areas on Nov. 16.Some 55 city officials will be dispatched to monitor households which raise birds as pets.The current outbreak is already worse than that in 2014, when 13.96 million fowls were put down over six months.

The agreement came as part of the city’s project to remodel the traditional, open-air market.Dogs on sale to be slaughtered and consumed as food are seen inside a cage at Moran Market in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday. “Starting off with the removal of slaughtering facilities and cages in the market, we will ultimately stop the dog meat trade in Moran Market,” Seongnam city official Kang Won-gu told The Korea Herald. Moran Market, which opened in the 1960s and sells almost everything from live animals to antiques, has seen at least 80,000 dogs sold either dead or alive each year. It supplies one third of all dog meat consumed in the country. Live dogs are kept in cages for customers to choose. They are then slaughtered at the market in plain sight. “This may be the beginning of  solving issues surrounding dog meat consumption.  will hopefully eradicate the negative image of Moran Market,” Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung told a press conference, announcing the deal with vendors. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Lee also said, “Seongnam City will take the initiative to transform South Korea’s image since ‘the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.’”The Korean Animal Welfare Association welcomed the move.“Seongnam city took a big step toward changing the dog meat industry here,” Jang In-young, an official at the association said over the phone. “But we will have to constantly monitor dog meat shops in the market  if they really stop slaughtering dogs and change their business . The city government will also need to keep pushing the idea to ultimately ban the sales of dog meat here.” With no laws having been passed to completely illegalize the sales of dog meat so far, butchery, farming and the consumption of dog meat have continued to thrive in a legal gray area.The Livestock Product Sanitary Control Act, which governs the slaughter and disposal of livestock and the processing, distribution and inspection of livestock products, does not categorize dogs as livestock that can be processed as food. Moran Market’s dog meat vendors have been under attack from animal rights groups around the world for their use of brutal methods to slaughter dogs such as through electrocution, hanging, or beating. Noise and the odor caused by the slaughtering as well as animal carcasses have been a main source of complaints in adjacent residential areas. Residents often complained that the dog meat market tainted the town’s image. Seongnam City said its task force would assist vendors in looking for new businesses.It also plans to solicit opinions from residents, animal right groups, dog meat vendors and others through debate sessions. By Kim Da-sol","meat vendors will start removing ,stop the dog meat trade ,vendors will start removing slaughter ,they really stop slaughtering dogs ,will start removing slaughter facilities","['South Korea ’s', 'Seongnam City Government', 'Moran Market', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Moran', 'Kang Won - gu', 'the Korea Herald', 'Moran Market', 'Seongnam Mayor', 'Lee Jae - myung', 'Mahatma Gandhi', 'Lee', 'Seongnam City', 'South Korea ’s', '’”the Korean Animal Welfare Association', 'Control Act', 'Moran Market ’s', 'Seongnam City', 'Kim Da - sol']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66767514  0.32696322

The source told the RFA that the use of railway services for its residents will be discontinued until next February when its power shortages are improved.North Korea has reeled from what is being called the worst floods in its northeastern region since the country's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. The floods struck in September.""The General Department of Railway has so far mobilized all the trains to restoring floods-devastated areas.

The move came days after the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2321 on Wednesday condemning the North's fifth and most powerful nuclear test in September, with the main focus placed on significantly restricting the country's coal exports deemed to be a major source of its hard currency.""We have expanded the number of those subject to sanctions by adding to the list 35 entities and 36 individuals that are playing a critical role in developing weapons of mass destruction and contributing to the North Korean regime's efforts to secure foreign currency,"" Lee Suk-joon, the top official in charge of government policy coordination at the Prime Minister's Office, told reporters.Included in the blacklist were Choe Ryong-hae, a vice chairman of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party, and Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong-so, director of the military's general political bureau, both of whom are regarded as close aides for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The Workers' Party and the State Affairs Commission were also added along with other entities suspected of supporting the regime's efforts to export its coal and generate earnings. In particular, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development and four of its executives were included on the list, marking the first time that a Chinese firm is facing South Korea's unilateral sanctions. The company is under investigation on suspicions that it exported aluminum oxide -- a nuclear bomb ingredient -- to the North at least twice in recent years. In September, the U.S. blacklisted it along with its owner and other company officials.  Seoul's latest action targets 79 individuals and 69 entities in connection with the North's nuclear programs. In March, South Korea unveiled a blacklist as a follow-up move to the UNSC's Resolution 2270 adopted in the wake of the North's fourth nuclear test in January.Any financial transactions with them will be prohibited, while their assets in South Korea will be frozen. The blacklisted people will also be banned from entering the country, which is seen as a symbolic action given that there are no exchanges between the two Koreas.Other prohibitive measures include blacklisting the North's state-owned airline Air Koryo on suspicions that it helps its regime transfer workers abroad, and move cash and other embargoed materials into the isolated country. The Seoul government has also toughened its maritime sanctions by banning any ships that have traveled to the North within the past one year, an extension from the previous 180 days, from entering South Korean ports.In addition, a watch list ""tailored"" to enhance the monitoring on activities related to the North's submarine-launched ballistic missile capability will be prepared and shared with the international community, it said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un watchea the artillery's firing exercise at an unknown site after South Korea imposed independent sanctions against Yongyang on Friday. South Korea has been working closely with other countries to tighten its noose around the North Korean regime by blocking money flows that could be used in advancing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The U.S. and Japan are expected to unveil their own unilateral sanctions soon.The efforts came as a follow-up action after the UNSC adopted Resolution 2321 placing a cap on the annual amount of the North's coal exports to 7.5 million tons or $400 million, a more than 60 percent cut from its 2015 overseas shipments.The move, along with many other sanctions in areas ranging from trade to diplomacy, is part of the international community's efforts to cover the loophole found in the previous sanctions that have been suspected of being exploited by the North. The government estimated that such multinational and unilateral sanctions implemented since March have cost the North around $200 million in foreign currency income.""The constantly upgraded nuclear and missile capabilities of the North are posing a serious destabilizing factor not just to the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia but also to the whole international community,"" Lee said. ""If we fail to stop the threat from the North Korean regime right now, a sense of crisis is growing that nowhere in the world will be free from all of this. ...

Kim Hyun-kwon of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the quarantine authorities first detected the bird flu from feces of migratory birds on Oct. 28. On Nov. 10, the virus was confirmed to be H5N1, a highly contagious strain of avian influenza that also has a high mortality rate. But the government did not activate a quarantine program and emergency operation system until Nov. 16, when the virus struck two farms -- a chicken farm in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, and a duck farm in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province, Rep. Kwon said.Quarantine officials work Tuesday to cull ducks at a farm in Naju, South Jeolla Province, where an outbreak of bird flu is suspected. “The government should have immediately activated quarantine measures when the AI virus was first detected. Then the virus would have not penetrated into poultry farms along the west coast and spread to Gyeonggi Province, Chungcheong and Jeolla regions within just two weeks,” said Rep. Kim. So far, 41 bird flu cases have been confirmed in the country since the first outbreak. Some 1 million animals have been culled. As reports of suspected AI outbreaks continue, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs last week has raised the watch level to “alert” from “caution,” ordering every provincial government to run emergency operation centers and strengthen disinfection measures in all farming areas. It also banned stockbreeders at some 89,000 poultry farms from moving for 48 hours on Saturday to contain and eliminate the virus. Experts say that South Korea should have been more vigilant over the possibility of a bird flu outbreak, stepping up both monitoring and inspections for the seasonal ailment. Currently, bird flu inspections occur three to four times a year between December and April. Inspections are mostly led by local authorities. “When poultry farms report deaths of chickens or ducks to the authorities, it is already after the virus has spread, so authorities cannot rule out the possibility that the virus had spread to adjacent farms,” said professor Seo Sang-hee from Chungnam National University’s College of Veterinary Medicine.“The government should run inspections regularly at poultry farms as well, not just by collecting and analyzing feces of migratory birds,” Seo added.   Meanwhile, a duck farm in Naju, South Jeolla Province, the country’s largest duck production base, reported a possible outbreak with drastically fallen spawning rate. On Monday, the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency announced the result of a bird flu virogene analysis and said the detected H5N6 is similar to cases found in China, Vietnam, Laos and Hong Kong.In China, there have been 16 H5N6 cases of human infections since 2014.

The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that ducks at four farms were culled over the weekend in suspected AI outbreaks. The virus -- confirmed to be the highly contagious H5N1 -- appears to be traveling along the west coastline after two confirmed cases last week, putting authorities on high alert after just three months of no reported AI cases. The ministry confirmed Friday that the two AI cases occurred at a chicken farm in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, and a duck farm in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province, which resulted in about 40,000 chickens and 22,000 ducks being culled.A vehicle passes through the quarantine line in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday after a report of a possible AI outbreak in one of the city‘s chicken farms. New reported cases involve an egg farm in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, where over 240 chickens were found dead and another duck farm in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, where 40 ducks died. In confirmed cases, the animals were infected with the H5N6 AI virus, the same found in feces of migratory birds in the central region on Nov. 10, the ministry said.  Authorities said the virus seems to spread more quickly with a high mortality rate. AI viruses normally have seven to 21 days of incubation period before showing symptoms like sore throat, headache, chills and diarrhea. South Korea has reported H5N1 and H5N8 bird flus in the past, but this is the first time H5N6 has been confirmed here. It has been detected in China, Vietnam, Laos and Hong Kong. As for the outbreak of H5N6 cases in China, 15 people were infected and six have died since 2014.The government said it will beef up quarantine and disinfection measures, urging livestock raisers to refrain from contacting wild birds. The ministry put the farms under quarantine and banned stockbreeders from moving within a radius of 3 kilometers to prevent further spread of the virus. Around 250,000 chickens and ducks over 10 farms will be under quarantine.The last bird flu outbreak in the country was detected in March in southern Seoul, leading to the slaughter of at least 11,000 birds.

Such imports have been cited as a serious loophole that is hurting the integrity of the UNSC sanctions and making it easier for Pyongyang to brush aside pressure to halt its weapons of mass destruction program.

Diplomatic observers said it has taken the international body some time to reach an agreement on sanctions, because China has been weary of putting too much force on its neighbor out of fear it could cause the country to collapse. Beijing, while adhering to nonproliferation, does not want to see the Pyongyang regime fail.In particular, Chinese policymakers are opposed to the idea of seeing a pro-US South Korea right on their front doorstep in the event North Korea implodes.","korea tested its fifth nuclear ,fourth nuclear test in january ,new international sanctions being ironed ,the country to collapse beijing ,tested its fifth nuclear device","['North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'UNSC', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'UNSC', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'North Korea']",13,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5139243   0.45418596

The US citizen was reluctant, but complied with the rule, undergoing a blood test for HIV and submitting the results to local authorities in order to get a job at a public school.

When she found out that Korean and Korean-American teachers at the school were exempted from the test despite doing the same job, she was offended. 

“It perpetuates perceptions of foreigners as dirty, dangerous and impure. I think it is discriminatory and xenophobic,” said Christina, who first came to Korea in 2010 and now teaches in Gwangju.  

“It also perpetuates stereotypes about HIV and the people who have it,” she told The Korea Herald.

For nearly a decade, South Korea has made it mandatory for foreigners wishing to work here to undergo blood tests for HIV, rejecting those found to be HIV-positive. 

This policy, introduced in 2007 after complaints from locals over “dangerous law-breaking foreigners,” including English teachers, may come to an end soon, as the government is considering a recent recommendation by the country’s human rights panel to do away with it. 

“The Justice Ministry is collecting opinions from relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to decide whether to accept the recommendation,” it said in response to an inquiry by The Korea Herald.

A recommendation of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea is not legally binding, but the government must decide whether to accept it within 90 days. In this case, the deadline is Dec. 7.

Discrimination against English teachers?  

When the HIV screening for foreign language teachers was first introduced in Korea in 2007, migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries as well as those on the E-6 entertainment visa were also subject to the test. 

Those applying for other types of visas -- for example, the E-1 for teaching jobs at universities, F-4 for ethnic Koreans holding foreign nationalities and F-6 for marriage migrants -- are not required to prove they are HIV-free to live and work here. 

“We made health checks mandatory for some foreigners through a revision of the AIDS Prevention Act in 2007 after some crimes by foreign language instructors and illegal drug use led to social problems,” an official from the Justice Ministry said. 

The Justice Ministry said it has officially lifted its general entry ban on most HIV-positive foreign nationals and eliminated mandatory testing for most visa applicants, excluding those applying for E-2 visas. 

“Even if we scrap the mandatory HIV testing, many are still subject to the testing according to the AIDS Prevention Act by the health ministry or Private Institute Management Act by the Education Ministry,"" the official said. “And we don’t send back foreigners or don’t refuse to issue alien cards when they are proven HIV-positive.""

But that is not how foreign English teachers contacted by The Korea Herald saw the situation. Foreign language instructors are perceived to be the only group subject to the mandatory blood test for HIV. 

“I had to do the test in the hospital after I came to Korea. If we are checked positive for HIV, our visa is canceled and we have to leave,” said a 30-year-old Canadian, who works at an elementary school. “I have a friend who contracted HIV while in Korea and had to leave the country.”

He said that he wanted to remain anonymous over worries it would “affect” his job. 

In 2009, Lisa Griffin from New Zealand, who was then an English teacher at an Ulsan-based elementary school, filed a petition to the NHRCK as well as to the UN International Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination after her school refused to renew her contract over her refusal to submit an HIV test result. 

The UN committee ruled last year that HIV testing of teachers on E-2 visas is racial discrimination, saying the policy is not “justified on public health or any other grounds.” The committee urged the Korean government to compensate her for moral and material damages. 

In September, the NHRCK also backed the UN decision, calling it “stigmatizing” and “discriminatory.” 

Concern over students’ health and safety   

Proponents of the HIV test, including parents groups, cite concerns over the health and safety of students. 

“We want to protect human rights and prevent discrimination. But we cannot just ignore the public’s concerns over our students’ health and safety,” said Kim Kyoung-jin, an official in charge of managing foreign teachers at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. 

Many Korean parents, whose zeal for their children’s education is known to be exceptionally high, are worried that the elimination of the mandatory HIV test would pose a threat to their children’s health and safety, despite transmission being impossible through the kind of contact teachers have with children.

A 49-year-old officer worker, who wanted to be identified only by her surname Park, said her children’s safety comes before the human rights of foreign teachers.

“I don’t think it is discrimination to treat foreign teachers and Korean teachers differently,” the mother of two teenagers said. “Without the HIV testing, there is no way to screen teachers from abroad and keep our children safe.”  

But Lee Kyung-ja, who heads the parents’ rights group Student First, said that foreign teachers and Korean teachers alike should go through the HIV testing. 

“It is worrisome that more and more young people contract HIV-AIDS these days and we don’t know where they get it from,” Lee said. “To ensure children’s health, all teachers -- whether they are foreign or local -- should prove that they are HIV-free.” 

According to government data, the cumulative number of HIV and AIDS patients was 10,502 through last year, since the first case surfaced in 1985, with 92.7 percent of the patients being male. There were 1,152 newly registered cases last year, with 33.3 percent of them being in their 20s. Among them, 1,018 were Korean.

“Honestly, I would not have an issue with the HIV testing if it was universal for everyone applying for a work visa,” said Emily Young, who started to teach English at a Seoul-based high school in 2010. 

“But it is unfair that the government singles out the E-2 visa holders for the testing. It should test all visas, or no visas.” 

The Education Ministry is expected to wrap up reviewing the NHRCK’s recommendations this month. 

Wrong perception of HIV 

But experts think the mandatory HIV testing of certain groups is not only a violation of human rights, but also ineffective at combating the disease. 

“It is clear violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which Korea joined in 1979 and has the same legal effect as domestic law,” said Ryu Min-hee, a lawyer from a public interest lawyers group Hope & Law.

“Different treatment is not always seen as discrimination when there are just reasons for it. But there is no justification for selective HIV testing of foreigners,” she added. 

And the compulsory HIV testing of certain groups will only reinforce long-held stigmas and fear surrounding HIV and AIDS in the country, alienating and excluding people living with the disease, another expert said.  

Patients living with HIV and AIDS are often subject to discrimination and have trouble accessing health care facilities, traveling and seeking employment. 

“The government’s health polices for preventing HIV-AIDS come from ignorance,” said Son Moon-soo, who heads an association of HIV and AIDS patients called KNP+. “The outdated measures create the wrong perception that HIV-AIDS is a foreign disease which foreigners brought into the country.”

In 2011, Kurbanova, an Uzbekistani woman who became a Korean citizen, was denied entry into a public spa in Busan. The facility’s owner reportedly rejected her, saying she looked different from Koreans and she could have contracted AIDS. 

It has become known that HIV is unlikely to be transmitted in daily life, as it is transmitted mostly through sexual contact, needles or syringe use. But fears over HIV largely persist in South Korea, with many still associating the disease with death and individual morality.

The World Health Organization also opposes mandatory testing of individuals to “ensure sustained public health benefits” and “comply with human rights principles.”

“Rather than implementing discriminatory policies against foreigners, there should be more education on safe sex and how HIV-AIDS is transmitted and prevented to fight the disease,” Son said.

Hyperacute rejection usually results in the mortification of cells or organs within seconds or minutes.The institute said it will work with a bioengineering company in performing a transplant of pancreatic islets from pigs to monkeys in the hopes of finding methods to eventually treat human diabetes patients in the future.Pancreatic islets, also called islets of Langerhans, are located within the pancreas and secrete insulin, which controls blood sugar levels.Human patients can control diabetes by getting regular insulin shots, though this is not a cure.","korean scientists have successfully transplanted ,genetically modified pig to monkey ,transplants the cynomolgus monkey also ,scientists have successfully transplanted organs ,organ transplants the cynomolgus monkey","['south korean', 'the National Institute of Animal Science', 'the Rural Development Administration', 'Sung - jong', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Mideumi', 'Korean', 'Langerhans']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81236565  0.18852681

Mupirocin is used on small cuts, wounds and minor burns to prevent bacteria from multiplying. The officially permitted usage of the antibiotic is on bacterial skin diseases such as boils and folliculitis. 123rfThe report limited its analysis to uses of the ointment in hospitals based on 2012 data. It showed that only 33.84 percent of prescriptions were to treat bacterial infections, while the rest were for unrelated reasons such as in surgical procedures. The team said that doctors may have prescribed it to prevent infection after surgeries. As Mupirocin is an over-the-counter medication available for purchase without a doctor’s prescription, experts estimate usage around the nation to be much higher. “Proper guidelines should be set to prevent the abuse of the medication through further monitoring and research that includes sales from pharmacies,” Kim said. Frequent application of the antibiotic salve is discouraged, as it creates resistant germs, the research team said.

No medical student applied for the tuberculosis residency program and a urology program met 37.8 percent of its enrollment quota, according to the report by the National Assembly Budget Office.Four other less popular residency programs were cardiothoraic surgery , nuclear medicine , pathology  and radiation oncology . The report showed the prolonged difficulty in encouraging medical students to apply for the least popular residency programs, despite some financial incentives. Since 2002, the Ministry of Health and Welfare had offered financial benefits to residents in these programs. But, the financial incentives were scrapped this year as it proved ineffective. Instead, the ministry has offered 5 million won  to each resident of such programs since 2014 when he or she applies for a short-term training program at a foreign hospital. In the report, the National Assembly Budget Office said the financial benefit for a foreign training program could not be a fundamental remedy to woo medical students to the programs.  The report urged the ministry to make efforts to improve working environments and pay for these residency programs.","cardiothoraic surgery have failed ,medical students this year report ,other less popular residency programs ,six residency programs including urology ,and cardiothoraic surgery have failed","['the National Assembly Budget Office', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the National Assembly Budget Office']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0900314   0.41807139

On Friday, a local wire service released a story on the growing number of mothers who put their toddlers on a leash when they go outdoors or visit supermarkets, to prevent losing their children. One end of the leash is usually attached to the child’s backpack or wrist, while the mother holds on to the other end. Some people have commented that it looks humiliating and might even violate children’s rights. The report quoted a mother of a 5-year-old as saying, “If I’m worried about losing my kid I would hold her hand, not put her on a dog leash.” “Children have feelings and thoughts, too, and their wish to move around freely should be respected.”But there are others who are in favor of the usage of such leashes and harnesses.  A mother of a 3-year-old was also quoted in the report as saying, “Who knows what will happen in the second I take my eyes off my son.” Recently, more mothers have been searching on online communities for information on where to find the leash and opinions on it. When the harnesses and leashes for toddlers grew in popularity in the US, Japan and Hong Kong, similar debate on their usage had been sparked. Family welfare experts in Korea said there is so far no academic evidence confirming side effects of using such leashes and harnesses. However, they stressed the importance of letting children know that the restraint is for their own safety and that it comes from the desire to keep them safe. Forcing the leash on a child without gaining his or her agreement could cause the child to become nervous and lose confidence, according to the experts.By Lim Jeong-yeo","family welfare experts in korea ,her on dog leash children ,mothers who put their toddlers ,in korea sparking off debate ,their toddlers on leash when","['Korea', 'US', 'Japan', 'Hong Kong', 'Korea', 'Lim Jeong - yeo']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60124707  0.51702595

The announcement by the Seoul government came after a 4.5-ton Coast Guard speedboat was sunk Friday during an operation against illegal fishing in the Yellow Sea when a 100-ton Chinese boat intentionally rear-ended it.The Chinese ministry, however, said the Chinese boat was legitimately operating in a zone where fishing was allowed.South Korea should refrain from using excessive force that could harm the safety of Chinese nationals, the spokesman added. The Chinese foreign ministry has been trying to downplay the issue, even urging South Korea's restraint in dealing with the sinking.","with chinese boats illegally fishing ,guard speedboat was sunk friday ,chinese boats illegally fishing ,chinese boats illegally fishing in ,illegal fishing in the yellow","['China', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Seoul', ""South Korea 's"", 'chinese', 'Geng Shuang', ""South Korea 's"", 'Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's""]",17,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.62232864  0.08039849

The measures also involve the active usage of force and firearms such as cannons and crew-served weapons to deal with unauthorized vessels poaching in Korean waters, the government announced after an emergency meeting held at the government complex in Seoul earlier in the day. The move comes after a Chinese fishing vessel attacked and sank a Korean speed boat Friday, putting South Korean authorities under fire for their passive and ineffective response. A 100-plus ton Chinese fishing ship deliberately rear-ended a 4.5-ton Korean patrol boat as it was caught during the coastguard’s raid of illegal fishing, in waters off Incheon on the western side of the peninsula, the Korea Coast Guard said Sunday.While the marine guards are allowed to use personal weapons such as K-1 rifles and K-5 handguns, they only fired a couple of shots in the air for threat purposes during the incident. An official from the Ministry of Public Safety and Security speaks during press briefing on Tuesday. The Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador Tuesday to protest the ramming.    Assistant Foreign Minister Kim Hyeong-jin called in Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiu Guohong to his office in Seoul to denounce the incident and ask for efforts to prevent its recurrence, the Foreign Ministry said.The government condemned and showed regret over the incident Sunday, when the regional deputy director-general of the ministry asked the Chinese consul general to come to his office and showed him a video of the attack scene. “We expect Korea to deal the problem rationally with regional peace and bilateral relations in mind,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman said, adding its government is investigating the case.There have been calls within the nation for stronger action to be taken about illegal fishing boats which, at times, have sparked violent incidents. “There is no reason to refrain  the usage of weapons against these outlaw anglers,” Rep. Chung Jin-suk of the ruling Saenuri Party said Monday. “We will review organizing a new marine safety headquarters and reinforce facilities.”The Chinese boats that attacked South Korea’s authorities are currently on the wanted list in collaboration with the Chinese authorities.According to statistics, 50,022 Chinese fishing vessels have trespassed in South Korean waters, with only 43 of them arrested, the Central Regional Headquarters Korea Coast Guard said.

A 50-year-old marine officer fell into the water and was rescued by a nearby patrol boat. No others were injured. The Foreign Ministry in Seoul filed a formal complaint to Beijing’s consul-general after the Coast Guard condemned the incident earlier Sunday. “South Korea will keep a close eye on the matter as the root of the problem derives from illegal fishing by the Chinese,” the ministry said.  Lee Joo-seong, head of the Coast Guard’s central region, called the action “attempted murder.” He called in China’s deputy consul-general to Seoul and expressed deep regret, asking for the Chinese government’s self-regulation and arrest of the two culprit ships.  Ju Gi-chung, China’s deputy consul-general to Seoul, at the Central Regional Headquarters of Korea Coast Guard in Incheon on Sunday “China’s illegal fishing boats are crossing the line. We are considering using weapons against violent ships, which we have been refraining from, and will not allow such things to happen again,” he said. The two countries have been on edge regarding the issue of Chinese fishing vessels illegally entering Korea’s waters. In 2014, a Chinese boat captain was shot dead by a South Korean coast guardsman in one of the most violent crashes between Chinese fishermen and the Korean Coast Guard.

The ministry, together with experts, is currently verifying victims of the toxic substances widely used to sterilize humidifiers in Korea up until five years ago to provide them with due compensation and medical treatment. So far, 189 Koreans who died mostly of lung failure have been formally recognized as victims, while claims filed this year have reached over 3,400. Self-claimed victims, their families and civic groups have been demanding the government broaden the scope of the victim recognition and compensation process to include non-lung-related symptoms, arguing it “is failing to properly consider those who suffer from other long-term health illnesses and underlying diseases.”According to the government’s current victim verification process, set in 2014, the scale goes from 1-4. A rating of 1 indicates a high level of certainty that victims’ lung-related diseases were caused by the use of humidifier disinfectants.Based on personal clinical results, diagnostic images and the level of exposure, victims who suffered lung diseases are classified as category 1-2 victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories 3-4.  Meanwhile, the National Assembly’s ad-hoc committee came to an end as of Wednesday after a 90-day investigation and discussion on how to compensate the victims.The opposition party lawmakers’ demand to extend the period to continue investigations was refused by the ruling party lawmakers.“It is regrettable that the committee failed to extend the period to provide more complete compensation method for victims,” said Rep. Woo Won-sik of The Minjoo Party of Korea, the head of the special committee, Wednesday. The humidifier disinfectant case came to light after four pregnant women died of unidentified lung-related diseases in 2011. A state-led investigation later confirmed a connection between at least 698 lung-related deaths and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants. But civic groups have been claiming that the total number of victims is well above 200,000, due to the delayed response and insufficient action by the government.By Kim Da-sol","after four pregnant women died ,special committee wednesday the humidifier ,miscarriages stillbirths and preterm births ,the environment ministry told reporters ,wednesday after 90 day investigation","['korean', 'Seo Hong - won', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute', 'National Institute of Environmental Research', 'Korea', 'Koreans', 'the National Assembly ’s', 'Woo Won - sik', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Kim Da - sol']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25945204  0.6356256

The Mokpo Coast Guard is questioning Chinese fishermen in custody to figure out the exact circumstances before and after the fire engulfed the Chinese fishing boat. Fourteen Chinese fishermen were rescued Thursday, but three others were found dead later on the boat.Authorities are asking why some crew members locked themselves in a steering cabin and barred entry despite repeated commands from the Coast Guard to stop the boat and surrender.The Coast Guard said it was having difficulties contacting the families of the dead sailors to discuss autopsies to determine the exact causes of their deaths. It asked the Chinese authorities to track down the families. A Coast Guard official said, ""We plan to bring the families here so they can attend the autopsies."" A team of specialists from the National Forensic Service  board a Chinese fishing boat on Sept. 30. It was captured during a crackdown while illegally fishing in Korean waters on Sept. 29. After a team of experts finished examining the boat, the National Forensic Service  said it will probably take about three weeks to release the full results of its investigation.The probe will focus on whether the nonlethal stun grenades that were thrown into the locked cabin in order to get the crew members to come out were directly related to the fire.The Coast Guard doesn't rule out other potential reasons for the fire given that there is hardly any precedent of stun grenades starting fires. They also said it is strange that the fire started almost immediately after the grenades were used. The timing may indicate another cause for the fire.It will also look closely into whether or not the Chinese fishermen broke any Korean laws, while resisting the boarding party and arrest.Meanwhile, a court will decide Tuesday whether to grant an arrest warrant for the Chinese captain for poaching in South Korea's exclusive economic zone.","deaths of three chinese fishermen ,chinese fishermen were rescued thursday ,during crackdown while illegally fishing ,chinese fishermen broke any korean ,fishing boat fourteen chinese fishermen","['the Coast Guard', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Mokpo Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'the Coast Guard', 'the Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'Coast Guard', 'the National Forensic Service', 'chinese', 'korean', 'the National Forensic Service', 'the Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'korean', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's""]",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2437828   0.1517186

From July next year, sales of any products distributed in South Korea with microbeads will be prohibited altogether.Environmentalists have been campaigning for the awareness on the damage that microbeads bring to the environment, urging voluntary participation from the manufacturers.Greenpeace KoreaAs microbeads are too small to be filtered, they pass through water purification systems and flow into oceans. Marine life would eat them, mistaking them for food. The microbeads often includes polypropylene , polyethylene terephthalate , polymethlyl methacrylate  or nylon, none of which are degradable and all of which take at least several decades to dissolve.The Korea Women’s Environmental Network also showed that every 2.5 in 10 fish, such as plankton, here were found to contain plastic waste inside their stomachs. The microbeads are eaten by plankton, which are then eaten by small fish that are then eaten by bigger marine life, which in turn are caught and consumed by humans.Such fine plastic tends to absorb toxic chemicals as well as discharge them, polluting the surroundings. According to UN Environment Program data in 2014, at least 20 million tons of these plastic pieces end up in the ocean each year.Other countries such as the US, the UK, Canada and Taiwan have been moving to revise related laws to ban the inclusion of microbeads in consumer products.

On Monday, Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the minor Justice Party said that a total of 11 toothpaste products sold by the local cosmetics company AmorePacific contained from 0.0022 to 0.0044 parts per million of Chloromethyl-methylisothiazolone  and methylisothiazolinone . The two substances were also found in toxic humidifier disinfectants blamed for the loss of at least 200 lives here. Other than AmorePacific, 30 additional local companies and two foreign companies were found to have sold products containing CMIT and MIT.Piles of AmorePacific toothpastes that were found to have contained the toxic chemicals CMIT and MIT are stacked at the local retail store E-mart in Seoul on Wednesday, a day after the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ordered a recall of all concerned products. CMIT and MIT, chemicals easily found in household products for its strong antibiotics or sterilizing power, were permitted for use until they were designated as toxic materials in 2012.After the Environment Ministry tested the clinical consequences and found links to health risks such as allergic reactions, CMIT and MIT were banned from use in manufacturing toothpastes.According to the Act on Testing and Inspection in the Food and Drug Industry, the use of CMIT and MIT is only permitted for up to 15 ppm in manufacturing cosmetics for the purpose of preservatives. But the products have to be washable after use for the sake of users’ health.On Tuesday, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that the problematic toothpastes are still “safe to use,” citing US and Europe where the use of CMIT and MIT is not restricted at all or allows up to 14 ppm of CMIT and MIT for making toothpastes, based on the health risk assessment by the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety.In other countries such as the US and in Europe, toothpastes are considered cosmetics. CMIT and MIT are permitted as preservatives in toothpastes under law there.While toothpastes fall into the category of licensed drug items in Korea, the ministry said that the amount of CMIT and MIT used in toothpastes is not detrimental to human health as it can be rinsed away with water after brushing the teeth. However, public doubts remain over the government’s control of toxic substances in products for daily use, especially as some 900 victims from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant reported health issues to the government since 2008. Earlier this month, a total of 27 wet wipe products and 60 cosmetic products were banned from use after the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety conducted safety tests and found CMIT and MIT in these products. Experts voiced concerns that health risks still remain when exposed to the use of CMIT and MIT contained products.Leem Jong-han, a professor of occupational medicine at Inha University Hospital, stressed the possible danger of oral intake of CMIT and MIT.“When CMIT and MIT in toothpastes are consumed through the respiratory system, it can cause health related diseases in lungs, based on several clinical experiments conducted on animals,” said Leem to The Korea Herald. He also criticized the ministry’s legal loophole in controlling and supervising toxic chemicals used in products sold in markets. “Rather than focusing on controlling certain chemicals, the government should establish and run all-round health risk assessment system like in Europe which conducts separate safety tests for each and every chemical product,” added Leem.Earlier this year, lawyers’ group Minbyun said the current management of chemical ingredients posed grave dangers and called on the government to test all substances that have not had their safety proven. According to data provided by the National Institute of Environmental Research, the Environment Ministry conducted chemical toxicity tests on about 600 chemicals out of 37,000, as of 2015.The government has argued that it is impractical to test all 37,000 chemicals and categorize them by toxicity.

The UN estimates that 138 North Koreans were killed and 400 others are missing, with about 20,000 houses destroyed. Some voiced concerns, however, that the North is making ill use of flood damage in nullifying the UN sanctions after its nuclear test. Chance are high that if the North receives aid, it will make bombastic propaganda to its people that superpowers like the United States and the UN have offered support in fear of the North, Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the US-based non-governmental Committee for Human Rights in North Korea recently told US media outlet Radio Free Asia.","rehabilitate the north flood stricken ,to rehabilitate the north flood ,rehabilitate the north flood ,the north flood stricken northeast ,north flood stricken northeast region","['UN', 'North Korea', 'the UN Central Emergency Response Fund', 'US', 'North Hamkyong Province', 'Typhoon Lionrock', 'UN', 'North Korea', 'Christelle Loupforest', 'CERF', 'the Voice of America', 'Loupforest', ""the United Nations ' World Food Programme"", 'Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization', 'UN', 'North Hamkyong', 'UN', 'North Koreans', 'UN', 'the United States', 'UN', 'Greg Scarlatoiu', 'US', 'Committee for Human Rights', 'North Korea', 'US', 'Radio Free Asia']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83002126  0.07052286

""China has an obligation to implement fully the sanctions that have been passed at the UN Security Council, including preventing the export to North Korea of a variety of goods and technologies,"" White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said, though he said he's not familiar with the allegations involving the Chinese conglomerate.""When we see concerns about that we do raise them directly with China,"" he told reporters late Tuesday.On Wednesday, Jon Wolfsthal, senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the White House's National Security Council, also said that UN resolutions clearly ban the exports of any items that can be used for its nuclear and missile programs ""even if it's a pencil.""""It doesn't matter if it's a pencil or an ounce of gold or a boatload of coal,"" Wolfsthal said in response to a suggestion that the aluminum oxide that the Chinese conglomerate exported to the North is not enough to help build nuclear weapons.""Everything that North Korea does we believe is linked or supportive of their weapons of mass destruction program and that trade is to be prohibited unless it can be demonstrated conclusively that it is to support humanitarian purposes,"" he told reporters after a Wilson Center seminar.The official declined to discuss the specific case involving the Chinese firm, including whether or when the US Treasury Department provided related information to China and when the USis expected to take legal action against the firm.Rhodes said that the US hopes to see China fully implement UN sanctions and discuss with Beijing ""appropriate responses to this cycle of provocations, which could include additional sanctions.""""We want China to understand that in the long run it is going to be less secure if we see this pattern of provocation out of North Korea, both because of the instability of having a nation like North Korea pursuing a nuclear program and a ballistic missile program, but also, frankly, because there are things that China objects to like our deployment of the THAAD missile defense system,"" he said.Obama discussed these issues when he held talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang earlier this week, Rhodes said.""I think China has grown more serious, they've taken steps that they've never taken before in terms of the previous UN Security Council resolution and the nature of their condemnations of North Korea's actions. But we want to continue to see follow-up from them,"" he said.Wolfsthal said the US and China are working hard on a new UN sanctions resolution.""It's something that even through the UN General Assembly process, we're engaged in very concertedly very attentively. It's something that it's a top priority for the president and our entire administration because of the priority we view addressing the North Korean nuclear threat,"" he said.The official said, however, it's difficult to say when a draft resolution will be put together. He also said the US will not ""let the clock dictate whether or not we get a good or better resolution"" because the goal is to increase the pressure and improve the sanctions regime on the North.""China is in agreement with us that what we've tried in the past has not worked, that improved sanctions, implementation and expansion is the only way we will convince North Korea to return to negotiating table,"" the official said. ""If sanctions' aren't increased, North Korea will only become bolder and the United States and its allies will have to take increased military steps which China also views as a challenge and something that we think can be avoided if we can get firm implementation of sanctions in the near term,"" he said.","north korea of items banned ,china he told reporters late ,the north korean nuclear threat ,their condemnations of north korea ,resolutions clearly ban the exports","['China', 'North Korea', 'UN Security Council', 'White House', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Asan Institute', 'the US Center for Advanced Defense Studies', 'China', 'Liaoning Hongxiang Group', 'chinese', 'China', 'the UN Security Council', 'North Korea', 'White House', 'Ben Rhodes', 'chinese', 'China', 'Jon Wolfsthal', 'National Security Council', 'UN', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'the US Treasury Department', 'China', 'US', 'China', 'UN', 'Beijing', 'China', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Obama', 'chinese', 'Li Keqiang', 'Rhodes', 'China', 'UN Security Council', ""North Korea 's"", 'US', 'China', 'UN', 'the UN General Assembly', 'north korean', 'US', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'China']",3,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64889145  0.96355015

There is a plethora of choices -- soybean sprout soup and ox bone spicy soup, to name a few -- which all belong under the category of “haejangguk”: any soup that is eaten as a hangover cure in Korean cuisine.For Kim Ji-hwan, a 31-year-old office worker in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, his favorite haejangguk is a bowl of potato soup with Korean red pepper powder. “It’s hearty and spicy -- but not too spicy,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “The spicy taste helps with fatigue and nausea. But haejnagguk only works when I’m mildly hungover. I prefer to just sleep in and only drink water when the symptoms are severe.” But does haejangguk actually “cure” a hangover? The answer is both yes and no. Water helps rehydrate for those who are suffering from a hangover. An alcohol hangover is in fact a medical condition known as veisalgia, a group of unpleasant symptoms that can develop after heavy drinking -- such as dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headache and dry mouth.Scientifically, the condition is caused by a combination of dehydration and alcohol metabolism -- such as disruptions to the stomach lining, blood vessels and blood sugar. For example, alcohol irritates the stomach lining and this can cause an overproduction of stomach acid which can eventually lead to nausea and stomach pain. Lee Young-jong, a physician of Korean traditional medicine, said drinking fluids -- which can include haejangguk -- can help with dry mouth and dehydration. “The more alcohol you drink, the more water passes out of your body,” he told The Korea Herald. “Haejangguk provides water so it can help ease dehydration. And the specific dish is a comfort food for many Koreans -- it’s always better to eat something that you find soothing when you have an upset stomach.”Some Koreans love warm haejangguk for its spicy taste, which many believe helps them sweat alcohol out of their system. But Lee said sweating after eating haejangguk can be beneficial for only a certain group of individuals. In Korean traditional medicine, people are divided into four types: “Tae-yang,” “Tae-eum,” “So-yang” and “So-eum.” Among the four, those who are “Tae-eum” tend to feel refreshed, rather than tired, after sweating. Those who are “Tae-eum” therefore may feel better by drinking a bowl of warm, spicy soup, he added.  “But those who belong to other body types, such as ‘So-eum,’ tend to lose energy when they sweat a lot,” Lee said. “I don’t think the spicy taste really does anything to improve the condition . It can actually make one’s condition worse if he or she is not used to spicy food. Yet sweating can help some people, according to their body types.”In western medicine, it is said that only about 10 percent of the alcohol one drinks leaves the body through urine, breath and perspiration. Sweating only releases traces of toxins -- less than one percent of the body’s total content -- as its only and primary purpose is to prevent overheating. “There is no scientific proof that consuming warm, spicy soup helps ease symptoms of a hangover,” said a doctor from the Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul.According to the Samsung Medical Center’s clinical nutrition research team, plain, starchy foods -- such as toast, noodles, potatoes and even rice -- can be great hangover cures. Hangovers cause blood sugar levels to drop, which can lead to fatigue and shakiness. Plain carbs are known to increase blood sugar level.  Carbs help balance blood sugar level for those who are suffering from a hangover. On top of starchy foods, sports drinks such as Gatorade as well as fruit juice can help recover from a hangover, according to the team. Alcohol causes the depletion of vitamin C as well as B6 and folic acid, which are important nutrients needed to cope well with stress. Fruit juice contains plenty of vitamins, while sports drinks are known to rehydrate faster than most other fluids, the researchers explained. While expert opinions on the effectiveness of Korean haejangguk varies, science may have the answer why the specific dish has been working so well for many Koreans. The key word: sodium.Most Korean cuisine, especially its soup and broth including haejangguk, are known for its high sodium content. According to the World Action on Salt and Health, South Koreans consumed a daily average of 4.878 milligrams of sodium in 2010, which was 2.4 times higher than the WHO’s recommended daily sodium intake.While consuming too much sodium can cause a number of health risks, salty foods could help ease a hangover, according to experts. Heavy drinking depletes electrolytes -- which is primarily composed of sodium, along with calcium and magnesium. Electrolytes are important minerals that affect the amount of water in the body as well as acidity of the blood and muscle function. One can lose electrolytes after excessive exercise, heavy sweating, starvation and heavy drinking among other things. Many Korean soup broths, high in sodium, can help those hungover replenish their sodium intake. All sports drinks as well as fluids used in oral rehydration therapy also contain sodium and potassium salts, which help to replenish water and electrolyte levels after severe dehydration. In Vietnam, its signature noodle soup, best known as Pho, has long been considered as one of the best hangover cures. The dish, like haejangguk, also contains some of the most important substances that are needed to treat dehydration: fluids and sodium.By Claire Lee","korean soup broths high in ,its signature noodle soup best ,warm spicy soup he added ,bowl of hearty spicy soup ,ox bone spicy soup","['Koreans', 'korean', 'Kim Ji - hwan', 'Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'korean', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Lee Young - jong', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald', 'Haejangguk', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Lee', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the Samsung Medical Center ’s', 'Carbs', 'korean', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'the World Action on Salt and Health , South Koreans', 'korean', 'Vietnam', 'Pho', 'Claire Lee']",16,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.4554953   0.4606905

It is the first time since 1995 that such warning labels are being revised to emphasize the importance of avoiding alcohol during pregnancy. Previously, the government warning labels -- bottlers were able to choose among three versions -- warned about liver cancer and other liver diseases, as well as the danger of alcohol-related injuries, such as traffic accidents. Only one out of the three versions had a line on the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, which may lead to birth defects, premature birth and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  All alcoholic beverages available for sale in South Korea will have stronger warning labels on their containers starting Saturday. The revised warning labels now all contain a line about health risks that are involved with drinking during pregnancy, including birth defects. All bottlers are required to use one of the three versions of the labels on their products. The labels are being introduced as the National Health Promotion Act was revised in July to better inform the public on the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The Health Ministry made the decision after consulting with public health professionals, psychiatrists and consumer organizations. “Throughout this consulting process we learned that a lot of people are ill-informed about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy,” an official from the ministry said. “Many think a single glass won’t affect one’s pregnancy. We advise all pregnant women to abstain from the intake of alcohol.”The number of South Korean babies with birth defects increased significantly since the early 1990s. Between 1993 and 1994, 3.4 per every 100 newborns were born with birth defects in the nation’s seven metropolitan cities. From 2009-2010, however, 5.5 per every 100 babies were born with congenital anomalies.  While drinking during pregnancy may be one of the reasons behind the statistics, a recent study by Inha University showed that the increase of babies with birth defects is likely associated with traffic-related air pollutants and endocrine disruptors in Korea.A 2013 study by Stanford University School of Medicine also found an association between traffic-related air pollutants and malformations of the brain and spine of newborns in California.

His routine of convenience store noodles followed by vitamin pills from the pharmacy seems to do the trick every time. Haejangguk street in Nakwon-dong, Jongno, Seoul “After I drink a lot, I get a headache,” said Kim, who recently got a job at a Seoul-based company. “And for me, my methods have really worked.”As Asia’s heaviest drinkers, South Koreans have come up with various ways to fight the after-effects of alcohol consumption -- some go to public saunas for a steam and some even opt for the unorthodox remedy of drinking alcohol the next morning.Chasing away a hangover is called “Haejang” in Korean, derived from the word “Haejeong” which literally means to release oneself from a hangover. The word was used to describe a method of downing a glass of alcohol the next morning before breakfast “to ease the stomach.”One of the most popular methods of relieving a hangover, especially among older men, has been to pay a visit to a sauna, often during a lunch break, to sweat out the alcohol. Another popular cure is through food. Any soup that is hot and spicy with a bowl of rice -- called Haejangguk -- is a go-to dish. Haejangguk comes in diverse forms and ingredients vary, but it mainly consists of a meat broth with vegetables. Preferences also vary between those who seek soup spiced with hot chili such as gamjatang , and those who opt for a cleaner broth, such as kongnamulguk .Nowadays, the self-treatment of hangovers has become more diversified, with the younger generation soothing their aching stomachs with greasy carbs such as hamburgers or pizzas.According to a survey on 1,858 office workers by a job search engine Job Korea, 68 percent of the respondents said that they had their own ways to relieve painful hangovers. Of them, nearly 31 percent said they drink a lot of water and soft drinks.Among those in their 20s, cold water was the favorite cure , followed by bean sprout soup  and instant noodles . For those in their 30s, bean sprout soup was their first choice , followed by dried Pollack soup  and water . For those in their 40s and 50s, beansprout soup was their favorite dish to combat hangovers. The survey also showed that among the workers attending drinking sessions twice a week on average, 80 percent of them usually felt sick the next morning, with 61 percent saying the symptoms lasted for at least half of the day.The report released by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, which surveyed 2,000 Koreans aged 15 or over, found that Koreans on average drank 4.9 glasses of beer  and 6.1 shots of soju, a popular grain-based liquor, during a single drinking session in the first half of this year.Of the surveyed, 58.3 percent showed a pattern of high-risk alcohol consumption by downing more than 8.8 shots of soju for men and 5.9 shots for women.According to the World Health Organization, South Korea ranked as the heaviest drinking nation in Asia with an average annual alcohol consumption of 12.3 liters per person  as of 2014.Cashing in on Koreans’ love for alcohol consumption, businesses have rolled out a variety of products ranging from pills, ice cream and jelly to coffee which they claim can cure hangovers.One of the most popular hangover beverages is CJ Cheil Jedang’s Heotgae Condition, containing oriental raisin tree fruit juice, called Heotgae, known as a traditional hangover remedy. “I don’t drink often, but when I do, I always drink a hangover-curing beverage like Hutgae Condition,” said Lee Ji-hoon, a 31-year-old office worker. “I am not sure how well hangover beverages have worked for me, but it gives me a mental comfort.” In May, the convenience store chain Withme, run by Shinsegae, launched a hangover-curing ice cream bar called Gyeondyeo-bar, which translates as “hang in there.” The grapefruit-flavored dessert contains 0.7 percent Heotgae. Also in May JN Food introduced a “hangover coffee,” an Americano instant coffee, which includes Heotgae powder, Vitamin C and aspartic acid to help binge-drinkers recover from hangovers. HC Biotech, specializing in medicinal herbs, developed low-sodium instant noodles, called Hwakkaemyeon, which contains salicomia herbacea salt in late 2014. After a brief halt in production due to manufacturing difficulty, the product is expected to hit the shelves again this year.

Hwang died of acute leukemia in March 2007 after working at one of the production lines south of Seoul. In 2011, the court ruled in favor of two of the plaintiffs, including Hwang, recognizing their deaths as industrial accidents, but said there is a lack of evidence to prove the causal relation between the death and illnesses of the three others, and their workplaces.Ending the years-long legal dispute, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision Tuesday.""In order to acknowledge a case as a workplace disaster, the causal relation between the work and the illnesses should be clearly proved,"" the court said.Samsung's full-fledged efforts to settle the issue started in May 2014, when the tech giant officially promised compensation for the deaths and suffering of the victims for the first time.In January, Samsung delivered a letter of apology to the victims and their families, claiming that the dispute has come to an end.","three samsung employees who died ,employees who died of leukemia ,samsung employees who died of ,hwang died of acute leukemia ,samsung employees who died","[""South Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Samsung', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', ""the Korea Workers ' Compensation & Welfare Services '"", 'Samsung', 'Hwang Yu - mi', 'Hwang', 'Seoul', 'the Supreme Court', 'Samsung', 'Samsung']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.17799571  0.84211588

Hosted by the National Assembly Human Rights Forum, Advocates for Public Interest Law and International Organization for Migration’s Korea office, scores of human rights lawyers, activists and government officials came together for a regional conference in Seoul on ethical recruitment and policy coordination in the fishing industry. Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for APIL, pointed out that migrant fishing crews are more vulnerable to human rights abuses as existing laws focus on protecting Korean fishermen, citing his two-year-long investigation into Korean fishing companies’ alleged exploitation of foreign workers. Sponsored by the US Department of State, Kim and IOM’s Seoul Office interviewed nearly 100 people from South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines for the joint investigation. “Problems exist at all levels. During the recruitment process, it costs too much money for foreign workers to get a job as fishing crew and they rack up large debts, which makes it difficult for them to quit work even when they are exploited,” Kim said. “That’s why foreign workers are prone to become victims of human trafficking and forced labor.” The investigation also found that migrant fishing crews suffer from poor living conditions, long hours of work, discriminatory pay, confiscation of their documents, assault and verbal abuses, among other issues. “The problem is that there is a law to protect fishermen, but it centers on Korean workers, not foreign workers. Also, the law is often not implemented or monitored,” he said, adding that the legal limbo leaves foreign workers unprotected by either the Labor Standards Act or the Seafarers Act. In South Korea, migrant workers hired on ships which weigh 20 tons or over in coastal and high seas are subject to the Seafarers Act under the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Foreign workers on boats weighing less than 20 tons are under the Employment Permit System run by the Labor Ministry. The two-way system of managing foreign fishermen often leads to relevant ministries’ lack of monitoring on working conditions for foreign workers and relatively lenient punishment on Korean employers failing to abide by labor laws, the lawyer noted. Amid a rapidly aging population and young people’s reluctance to fill jobs in the agriculture, fishing and farming sectors, South Korea is increasingly relying on migrant workers. As of the end of the 2015, the number of migrant fishing crew accounted for 41 percent of the total fishing crew in South Korea, with the number having seen a gradual increase from 9,162 in 2010 to 11,815 in 2015. While Korean deckhands received nearly 4 million won  per month, migrant workers doing the same job earned $423 on average, according to government data. Migrant workers paid from 2,000 won to 15,000 won per person to recruitment agencies to find employment on Korean companies’ boats.Kim Hae-gi, Deputy Director at Seafarer Policy Division under the Fisheries Ministry, admitted that there had been human rights violations against migrant workers on Korean vessels and absence of rules to manage them.“But assaults and verbal abuses are not solely targeted at migrant workers. Such crimes happen to Korean crew on the boats as well,” he said. “The government conducted a joint investigation and has implemented measures to improve protection for migrant fishermen by setting up a call center, hiring more labor inspectors and toughening punishment.“The tripartite committee among management, labor and public officials has carried out a probe since 2013 every year to oversee whether measures are properly implemented,” he added. Max Pottler, Labor Mobility Project Officer at IOM’s Cambodia Office, underscored the importance of ethical and fair process in recruiting fishing workers. “It is challenging to regulate the fishing industry effectively especially when relationships between workers and employers get more and more complex,” he said. “But the unethical recruitment practices could lead to negative consequences not only for foreign workers but also for employers.”“ the workers could be easily linked to criminal smuggling, human trafficking networks. Companies can suffer severe reputational damages,” he said. ""It will cost companies additional money at first, but it will eventually translate into more productive workforce.” Pottler also addressed the need for the Korean government to understand international standards to enforce harmonizing policies and take a common approach to effectively regulate unethical hiring practices in the fishing industry. The International Labor Organization Private Employment Agencies Convention stipulates a ban on forced labor, child labor and recruitment fees, freedom of association and collective bargaining, adequate process to investigate workers’ complaints. As of 2016, 32 states out of 186 member states have ratified the Convention, with Japan being the only Asian country.Park Mi-hyung, a director at IOM’s Seoul Office, said in a welcoming speech that it is important for the South Korean government and the countries of migrant fishermen to prepare concrete measures through policy discussions. “Establishing ethical hiring standards has a positive impact on the protection of migrant workers, and also improves the overall transparency and sustainability of the industry,” she said.By Ock Hyun-ju","workers in south korea fishing ,investigation into korean fishing companies ,migrant fishing crews are more ,long investigation into korean fishing ,fishing crew in south korea","['South Korea ’s', 'the National Assembly Human Rights Forum', 'International Organization for Migration ’s Korea', 'Seoul', 'Kim Jong - chul', 'APIL', 'korean', 'korean', 'the US Department of State', 'Kim', 'IOM ’s Seoul Office', 'South Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Indonesia', 'Philippines', 'Kim', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries', 'the Employment Permit System', 'the Labor Ministry', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'Kim Hae - gi', 'Seafarer Policy Division', 'the Fisheries Ministry', 'korean', 'korean', 'Max Pottler', 'IOM ’s Cambodia Office', 'Pottler', 'korean', 'the International Labor Organization Private Employment Agencies Convention', 'Convention', 'Japan', 'asian', 'Park Mi - hyung', 'IOM ’s Seoul Office', 'south korean', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",1,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.59350592  0.27782696

It was stored in a freezer overnight.The 11 others who ate lunch with her did not show any symptoms, and further tests showed that they were not infected.She was sent home on Wednesday upon recovery, after being quarantined and treated for nine days. Kwak Sook-young, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delivers a press briefing on Thursday. The CDC said that that it was conducting Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis  analysis -- an analysis technique to produce a DNA fingerprint for a bacterial isolate -- to check if the infected woman has any connection to the first case confirmed on Tuesday. It will take 24 hours for the result to come out, authorities said.On Tuesday, a 58-year-old man was infected with cholera in the southern city of Gwangju. He was the first person in 15 years to have caught cholera without traveling abroad.Experts suggested that the infection could have been caused by food that was possibly carrying the cholera bacteria -- Vibrio cholera -- when it was imported from overseas.“Although both the infected man and woman had eaten seafood caught in Geoje region, we have not yet found any connection between these two cases,” said Kwak Sook-young, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during the press briefing on Thursday.Meanwhile, the CDC said that it installed an emergency situation room on Thursday to monitor the outbreak of cholera.“We are in contact with health supervisors at each city and province 24/7, in order to make sure that we can immediately report any additional cases,” said Kwak.“Although we cannot rule out possibility of additional cholera outbreak, we have found no  during assessments of groundwater here in the past 15 years,” she added.Cholera infections can come from contaminated groundwater or food, such as fish, shellfish or water. In rare cases, direct contact with an infected person’s excrement or vomit can also lead to infection.Cholera normally has an incubation period of 2-3 days. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, muscle cramps and dehydration, while severe cases can lead to death.South Korea saw the highest number of recent cholera cases in 2001, when there were 162 infected individuals, mostly in the in Gyeongsang region. The record was followed by 145 infected people in 1980, 113 in 1991 and 68 in 1995.By Kim Da-sol","korea first case of cholera ,woman had eaten seafood caught ,mackerel for lunch on aug ,years she added cholera infections ,raw spanish mackerel for lunch","['the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Geoje', 'South Gyeongsang', 'South Korea ’s', 'spanish', 'Kwak Sook - young', 'the Center for Infectious Disease Control', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'Vibrio', 'Kwak Sook - young', 'the Center for Infectious Disease Control', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'Kwak', 'South Korea', 'Gyeongsang', 'Kim Da - sol']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29610199  0.66751051

It is the first time that a local citizen has been infected with the disease without having traveled overseas.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that a 58-year-old man was infected with cholera in the southern city of Gwangju, after he started suffering from diarrhea on Aug. 10.Eight days after he was hospitalized at a regional medical center, he was reported to Gwangju’s public health center as a suspected case of cholera. Jung Ki-Suck, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leaves after a news briefing at its headquarters in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, Tuesday. On Monday, he was confirmed to have been infected with cholera. He has since been sent home upon recovery, after being quarantined and treated. While his wife, son and daughter do not show any symptoms, health authorities said that it will conduct an additional investigation to check if they have also been infected.Health authorities said that it is conducting an epidemiologic investigation into how the man caught cholera without travelling abroad since June last year. Experts suggested the infection could have been caused by food, which was possibly carrying the cholera bacteria -- Vibrio cholera -- when it was imported overseas. The infected man reportedly told health authorities that he ate seafood during his trip to the southern coast earlier this month.Since 2003, all reported cholera cases here were found to have been contracted from abroad.South Korea saw the highest number of cholera cases in 2001, when there were 162 infected individuals concentrated in Gyeongsang Province. The record was followed by 145 infected people in 1980, 113 in 1991 and 68 in 1995.Experts said it is not likely that the recent cholera case will develop into an epidemic.“Since the main route of infection is through contaminated food or water, it is very rare  to become an epidemic in developed countries with decent environment and social infrastructure,” said professor Choi Jun-yong of the infectious diseases division at Severance Hospital.During the 19th century Korea, some 400,000 people -- about 50 percent of the entire population at the time -- were killed by the disease, when it had a less developed groundwater pipe system compared to now.Cholera infection can come from drinking contaminated food or groundwater, such as cholera-contaminated fish, shellfish or water. In rare cases, direct contact with an infected person’s excrement or vomit can also lead to infection. Cholera normally has an incubation period of 2-3 days. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, muscle cramps and dehydration, while severe cases can lead to deaths. Health authorities encouraged citizens to take preventive measures such as consuming safe drinking water, avoiding raw food and washing their hands often for at least 30 seconds each time.To monitor the outbreak of infectious diseases, the CDC has activated an emergency quarantine control system from May.

The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act -- or the Kim Young-ran law, named after its initiator and the former chief of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission -- is poised to reshape the country’s culture in which generous hospitality and presents had been considered an inseparable part of business. GrapNam Kyung-don/The Korea Herald)Scheduled to take effect Sept. 28, the legislation rules that violators face a fine of up to 30 million won or imprisonment for a maximum of three years, whether or not there is a direct link between the gift and a favor. The reformative act is expected to help address the lingering dark sides of breakneck economic development and democracy, advocates say. Last year, Korea ranked 37th among 168 nations and 27th among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members in the annual corruption perceptions index released in January by Transparency International, a Berlin-headquartered antigraft group. “If Korea’s transparency improves toward the OECD average level, however, its per capita gross domestic product may further rise by an annual average of $138.50, and the overall growth rate by 0.65 percentage points, based on the 2010 level,” Hyundai Research Institute wrote in a report commissioned by the ACRC. Yet the law has kindled backlash, especially among cattle growers, fruit farmers and fishermen as well as small and mid-sized businesses. Their yearly heyday comes around the Chuseok and Lunar New Year’s holidays, during which many people give and receive expensive gift sets such as those consisting of high-quality beef, homegrown fruit and fish in a display of gratitude and respect. Critics say the forthcoming law’s amount ceilings fail to reflect current consumer prices, raising concerns the upcoming change in longstanding customs might take a heavy toll on already sluggish domestic spending. In a recent survey of 61 major companies by the HRI, nearly 58 percent of respondents said the legislation would have “some impact” on the economy, while around 34 percent predicted little or no effect. Almost 32 percent expected to cut their entertainment and gift expenses by as much as 10 percent, and saw 50,000 won as a reasonable threshold for meal costs. Efforts to amend the law have emerged as some lawmakers and officials, including President Park Geun-hye, have relayed worries about the law being too strict. But the atmosphere has shifted since the Constitutional Court’s ruling late last month in favor of the act, with supporters saying now is the time to enforce it as it is and any revisions, if necessary, should be explored later.“Any floating of the need for an adjustment, especially on fears of a negative economic effect even before the act takes effect, would only undermine its cause,” Transparency International Korea said. “The president and the government should stop their remarks and attempts to dent the legislation and work more for the implement of the related decree. If further discussions are needed, we can do that later and reach social consensus.” Signs of change are already emerging across the sectors. The central and local governments and industry associations have been holding sessions to brief their employees and members on the legal boundaries and discuss countermeasures. The Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association, for instance, is scheduled to have a similar seminar later this month, as the law would bring an inevitable change in the industry’s customary practices. In the past, they have picked top-class hotels for their new model releases and trial run ceremonies, which would often entail a two-day countryside tour with reporters. Restaurants are also striving to adapt to the change, recrafting their menus by simplifying table settings or changing the type of cuisine. The sentiment is apparent around Insa-dong and Gwanghwamun, which are dotted with traditional Korean restaurants frequented by government officials and lawyers. Some, including one that has long served top policymakers including former President Lee Myung-bak and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, have slightly lowered prices for their dinner packages, while others introduced new meal options at 29,000 won. “We’re concerned our regulars will turn away on worries they may break the law,” said the owner of a Korean restaurant who has cut costs of dinner meals. “As many of our packages are a little above the limit, we will focus on selling single-dish menus and less drinks.”Despite anticipated confusion and lingering controversy regarding the law’s interpretation, advocates argue its long-term benefits will outweigh the possible economic downside, which they say has to be tackled anyway for the economy to take a leap forward. “There must be some struggle in the initial stages,” an official at the ACRC told The Korea Herald, acknowledging the need for elucidation. “Those in public offices would do just fine given existing various regulations governing their behavior, while private schoolteachers are also subject to a code of conduct that could be even stricter than the latest law. But members of media, a wholly private domain, wouldn’t be familiar with such a rule.” By Shin Hyon-hee","korean restaurants frequented by government ,30 000 won presents worth ,countermeasures the korea automobile importers ,korean restaurant who has cut ,lowered prices for their dinner","['Korea', 'the Improper Solicitation', 'Kim Young - ran', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'GrapNam Kyung - don', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Transparency International', 'Berlin', 'Korea', 'OECD', 'Hyundai Research Institute', 'ACRC', 'HRI', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Transparency International Korea', 'the Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association', 'Gwanghwamun', 'korean', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'korean', 'ACRC', 'the Korea Herald', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6261633   0.08115841

His mother acquired the remedies from the Hamsoa Oriental Clinic in southern Seoul, which is one of the most firmly established traditional medical clinics in the country. The boy is now completely bald and has been told by nontraditional physicians that he only has a 10 percent chance of regrowing his hair. Image capture from SBS newsThe case was publicized just about five months after the Korean government announced its plan to standardize traditional herbal medicine’s quality to ensure safety -- making it into tablets and syrup -- in January. Currently sold in packs of prepared herbs or decocted herbs in drinkable pouches, the medicine is often considered difficult for health authorities to scientifically review for quality and safety. The Korea Medical Association, one of the largest bodies of nontraditional physicians in Korea, claimed the specific case shows how “dangerous” herbal medicine can be, especially under the current system lacking clinically testing before use. The organization has been feuding with the Association of Korean Medicine, the biggest group of traditional doctors here. Since last year, the group has been fiercely protesting the government’s proposal to allow traditional physicians to use modern-day medical equipment, such as ultrasound machines and X-rays, for diagnosis -- claiming it is extremely unsafe for the general public. “Right now the reason why herbal medicine is being exempt from clinical trials -- which are required for all nontraditional drugs -- is because they were proven to be safe by  ancient medical texts,” said a KMA official. “But we think this is a problem and is unsafe for patients. It is extremely important for all herbal medicine to be reviewed thoroughly through clinical trials before being approved for sale.”Following the diagnosis of the child’s hair loss, the Hamsoa Oriental Clinic requested an insurance company launch an investigation. The firm concluded the clinic is “partially responsible” for the child’s condition and asked them to pay his parents 3 million won  in compensation. Still, the clinic claimed the child’s hair loss may not have been caused by the herbal medicine they produced for him. “We believe his condition is alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, a type of hair loss that occurs when one’s immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles,” the clinic said in a statement it sent when approached by The Korea Herald. “As far as we know, spot baldness does not occur from taking herbal medicine.”The Association of Korean Medicine, on the other hand, claimed the child had taken antibiotics about 15 days prior to the herbal medicine. “We think it’s too early to conclude that the hair loss has been caused by the herbal medicine,” an official from the organization said. “A thorough examination and investigation is needed.”By Claire Lee","medicine in november his mother ,korean medicine the biggest group ,debate among traditional korean doctors ,dangerous herbal medicine ,of korean medicine the biggest","['korean', 'western', 'the Hamsoa Oriental Clinic', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the Korea Medical Association', 'Korea', 'the Association of Korean Medicine', 'KMA', 'the Hamsoa Oriental Clinic', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korean Medicine', 'Claire Lee']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.37776935  0.66513717

Such bacteria are just as dangerous as incurable infectious diseases. In order to tackle the issue, we need to stop the ongoing overuse of antibiotics.”As of 2014, 31.7 Koreans per every 1,000 were being prescribed antibiotics daily. The rate is significantly higher than the average for countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which was 23.7 per for every 1,000 individuals. In Sweden, only 14.1 individuals per every 1,000 were being prescribed to the medicine every day. Health Minister Chung Chun-youb announces a set of measures to reduce the use of antibiotics at the government complex in Sejong on Thursday. “Our goal is to reduce the current usage rate to 25.4 patients per every 1,000 by the year 2020,” the Health Ministry said. “There will be a smartphone app as well as a hard-copy guideline on antibiotics use. A campaign -- which educates on how misuse of the drug can put one at risk -- is also scheduled to be launched.”Contrary to popular belief among Koreans, antibiotics do not fight infections caused by viruses, such as colds, flu, most sore throats and many sinus and ear infections. According to the World Health Organization, symptom relief might be the best treatment option for such conditions. However, a government survey found that more than 50 percent of Koreans were misinformed, thinking antibiotics can treat colds and flu.The overuse of antibiotics, especially taking them when they are not the appropriate treatment, promotes antibiotic resistance. For individuals who are antibiotic resistant, drugs that used to be standard treatments for bacterial infections can become less effective or not work at all. In 2002, 73.3 percent of Koreans were wrongly prescribed to take antibiotics for flu or cold at least once. The prescription rate was significantly reduced to 44 percent last year, but the figure is still alarmingly high, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry also said that a significantly high proportion of a number of bacteria that have been detected here are resistant to antibiotics. For one, 67.7 percent of all Staphylococcus Aureus found here are resistant to Meticillin, an antibiotic which is known to kill most of the particular bacteria. The figure is much higher than that of other countries, including the U.K. , France  and Japan . According to the WHO, antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health today. In the European Union, drug-resistant bacteria are estimated to cause 25,000 deaths every year. “The world urgently needs to change the way we prescribe and use antibiotics,” the agency said in a statement. “Antibiotic resistance leads to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality.”By Claire Lee","koreans were misinformed thinking antibiotics ,flu the overuse of antibiotics ,korea health authorities on thursday ,antibiotic medicine south korea currently ,antibiotics for flu or cold","['South Korea ’s', 'South Korea', 'Chung Chin - youb', 'Koreans', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Sweden', 'Chung Chun - youb', 'Sejong', 'the Health Ministry', 'Koreans', 'the World Health Organization', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'the Health Ministry', 'Staphylococcus Aureus', 'Meticillin', 'U.K.', 'France', 'Japan', 'WHO', 'the European Union', 'Claire Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52008206  0.59733778

According to data released by the National Assembly’s Health and Welfare Committee, the number of reported unattended deaths increased from 719 in 2012 to 1,245 last year, and those who lived in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province accounted for 53.1 percent of cases in 2015. Among the unattended deaths, the largest proportion of them, 29.6 percent, were in their 50s, followed by those in their 60s  and those in their 70s . However, the report also found that those aged 49 or younger made up 17.8 percent of those who died without anyone by their side.Yonhap“The statistics show us that unnoticed death is not just a problem among the elderly,” the report said. “The numbers show us that those who have just retired from their jobs -- hence those in their 50s -- had the highest likelihood of dying alone without anyone knowing.”South Korea considers as unattended deaths cases of those who take their own lives and whose bodies are found months or years later. From 2011 to 2013, 2.6 percent of bodies found were so decomposed that it was impossible to even identify their gender. According to a 2014 report by the committee, which chronicled a total of 14 unattended deaths, many of the dead were socially isolated, financially unstable and did not have a support network. One of them, a 59-year-old woman found dead in 2013, had suffered two unhappy marriages before becoming a homeless person living at Daejeon train station. Her first husband had been physically abusive and addicted to gambling, while her second husband was an alcoholic. After her second divorce, she seriously injured her spine while working in a ginseng field. She was homeless until she managed to receive a state allowance that enabled her to stay in a motel room. But she took her life in the very room by drinking pesticides a few months later. She had no family member to arrange a funeral for her, even after her body was found.  “She would often say she wished she at least had children,” the owner of the motel told researchers. Also in 2013, a 65-year-old homeless man was found dead alone at a shelter. He had worked as a school teacher before starting his own business, which ended in bankruptcy and financial disaster. He had been married twice, with his second wife dying of cancer. Although he had three children with his first wife, he was not in touch with them.  Researchers wrote that those suffering from chronic illness or disability and those who have experienced family separation, divorce or longtime unemployment are especially vulnerable to unattended deaths. They also said that there should be legislation related to the personal belongings and assets of those who die with no family or legal guardian. The report also highlighted that bodies of individuals who died alone at hospitals, did not have a legal guardian and had overdue hospital bills were taken to other institutions, presumably for research purposes.

Suifenhe is known to be a city where North Korea used to purchase Russian weapons through the black market in the past.The defector said North Korea had some bear-breeding farms until early 2000, but they have now disappeared. Another North Korean who escaped the country and now lives in South Korea told RFA that North Korea has been importing quite a large number of bear gallbladders from China because the Asian black bear population in the reclusive country has been gradually vanishing due to deforestation and other reasons.He also said some of the North Korean laborers in Russia bring in gallbladders when they come back from Russia and give them to party officials as gifts or bribes.RFA then highlighted a recent report posted on a Chinese internet media that claimed North Korea passed down the know-how of extracting bile from live bears in 1983.Bile bears are bears kept in captivity and harvested for their bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, which is used by some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.In East Asia, bears are often kept in captivity and farmed for their gallbladders and the bile inside. It has been estimated that as many as 12,000 bears are farmed this way across the region.","of bear gallbladders from china ,bear gallbladders into north korea ,bear gallbladders from china because ,bear gallbladders from china ,gallbladders from china because the","['North Korea', 'asian', 'China', ""Workers ' Party"", 'Radio Free Asia', 'North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Suifenhe', 'Heilongjiang Province', 'RFA', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'russian', 'North Korea', 'North Korean', 'South Korea', 'RFA', 'North Korea', 'China', 'asian', 'north korean', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'chinese']",10,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53293538  0.66954052

About 24 percent to 46 percent of the OIT was found in the air after five consecutive days of activation. As much as 76 percent of it was also detected from the automobile’s air conditioner after eight hours.The ministry added that an investigation is ongoing to find if there is a clear correlation between the use of OIT contained filters and a health risk to humans.Meanwhile, manufacturer 3M immediately released an apology on Friday and said that it would voluntarily recall all of the problematic filters. According to a local news report, 3M sold over 1.1 million filters to local companies over the last two years.Samsung also announced on Friday that it would replace current filters for OIT-free ones for customers upon request. It added that the models in concern are currently not available for sales.Some companies such as Cuckoo, however, argued that the amount of OIT contained in their products is too low to cause health risks to the human body.Coway also began to conduct its own research at Seoul National University’s environmental institute to prove the safety of its filters.“The result of our experiment showed that no OIT was detected , but we will bring it to an external institute for another confirmation,” said an official from Coway.By Kim Da-sol","samsung also announced on friday ,company aekyung toxic humidifier disinfectant ,samsung also announced ,million filters to local companies ,including hyundai mobis lg samsung","['LG', 'Samsung', 'Coway', 'LG', 'Samsung', 'Coway', 'Winia', 'Chungho Nice', 'Hyundai Mobis', 'LG', 'Samsung', 'Doowon', 'Doowon', 'Aekyung ’s', 'Coway ’s 18', 'Hong Jung - seop', 'OIT', 'OIT', 'OIT', 'Samsung', 'OIT', 'OIT', 'Seoul National University ’s', 'OIT', 'Coway', 'Kim Da - sol']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24267706  0.65915871

The remaining three stadiums at Gwangju, Incheon and Busan Sajik will join the move starting next year, the KBO said.The KBO amended its regulations last year, prohibiting sales of canned beverages and plastic bottles larger than 1 liter for safety reasons.A beer vendor sells beer in a disposable cup at Munhak Baseball Stadium in Incheon, Thursday. The KBO strengthened regulations as it was worried the heavy containers could be thrown onto the field. But the ban in turn generated more waste, as kiosks sold canned beverages along with paper cups to be carried inside the stadium. Paper cups sold at the stands are not recyclable. The KBO estimated at least 4,000 such cups are thrown out after each game.The ministry said that at least 2.9 million disposable cups from baseball stadiums are thrown away every year. Through the latest measure, the authorities expect the amount to be lowered by up to 30 percent.“We expect this agreement to encourage citizens to participate in recycling and control their use of disposable items for our environment,” said Kim Dong-gu, an official covering recycling policy at the ministry.Meanwhile, the National Tax Service said Thursday that it decided to allow one-man beer vendors -- better known as “beer boys“ here – to return to the baseball stadium stands. After the discussion with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the two authorities decided to revise the regulation and allow sales of snacks and food such as fried chicken delivery by the vendors.The original regulation only permitted sales of alcoholic beverages at authorized locations. But the policy met strong opposition as soon as it was implemented in April.The NTS explained such change in regulation was to “embrace the fact that our latest regulation did not recognize the general interest of Korean citizens.” By Kim Da-sol","six baseball stadiums in korea ,million disposable cups from baseball ,baseball stadium in incheon thursday ,disposable cups from baseball stadiums ,nine kbo stadiums by 2017","['South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Environment', 'the Korea Baseball Organization', 'PET', 'KBO', 'Korea', 'Jamsil', 'Gocheok Dome', 'Suwon', 'Daegu', 'PET', 'Busan Sajik', 'KBO', 'KBO', 'KBO', 'KBO', 'Kim Dong - gu', 'the National Tax Service', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'NTS', 'korean', 'Kim Da - sol']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57961184  0.89561832

The rampant poaching by Chinese fishing vessels has long been a thorny issue for Seoul every blue crab season as it wipes out fisheries in the West Sea and mars the livelihoods of residents on border islands. Then the boats began violating neutral waters in the estuary of the Hangang River early last month, prompting the South to launch a joint crackdown with the U.N. Command. “ had sold fishing licenses worth $30 million to some 1,500 ships this year, which is about three times the average, to secure dollars,” Rep. Lee Wan-young of the ruling Saenuri Party who serves in the National Assembly’s intelligence committee said after a closed-door briefing by the spy agency. “North Korean people, too, are unhappy because it has shrunk the catch and caused common complaints with their southern counterparts regarding worsening environmental damage such as from fuel oil sludge at sea.” Four months on since the U.N. slapped new sanctions over Pyongyang’s latest nuclear and missile tests, the North’s exports of coal, which accounts for around 40 percent of its entire outbound shipment, have dropped 40 percent from a year ago, while its weapons sale abroad has plunged 88 percent, Lee said, without providing detailed figures. The Security Council resolution entailed a sectoral ban for the first time on imports of North Korean coal, iron and iron ore except for “livelihood purposes.” “But the sanctions’ impact on the financial sector is apparently not so satisfactory,” the lawmaker added.  National Intelligence Director Lee Byung-ho  takes part in a briefing to the National Assembly on Friday.

Lee Cheol-woo.The young ruler is believed to be “suffering from insomnia” and possibly some “lifestyle diseases” due to binge drinking and eating, the ruling party member told reporters. The agency also raised the possibility for the North’s further liftoffs of Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missiles following a recent launch, which it said showed “technical progress” in terms of sharp-angle setup and flight safety.“North Korea will likely continue firing them to improve their performance for combat deployment and for political purposes including boasting its technical capabilities to strike the U.S.,” Lee said, citing the NIS.

Crohn’s disease is a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes abdominal pain, poor appetite and diarrhea. It is often caused by an abnormal immune response in which the body attacks the cells in the digestive tract in addition to harmful, invasive bacteria or viruses. 123rf.The Welfare Ministry currently supports about 50 percent of the cost needed for special formulas specifically produced for young Crohn’s disease patients aged 18 and under. However, the study organized by local pharmaceutical company Handok showed that only about 20 percent of the 55 surveyed parents were benefitting from the service for their children. Among the participants, 34 percent were unaware of the existence of the program altogether and 30 percent said they did not know how to apply for the program, although they knew such services existed.Those who wish to apply for the nutrition subsidy, according to the ministry, are required to submit a set of documents including a medical certificate to the nearby public health center, according to ministry officials.Without any government support, it costs up to 1 million won  a year for a 22-month-old child to acquire needed protein solely by drinking special formula. In order to apply, one needs to visit the nearest state-run health centers with a medical referral from a doctor. According to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, a total of 17,651 Koreans sought medical help for Crohn’s disease last year. The number of patients increased by 33 percent from 2010-2015, while patients aged 19 and under also rose by 25 percent. Poor lifestyle choices and stress are known to aggravate Crohn’s disease.

Command, prepare for the crackdown on Chinese vessels that fish illegally, in the waters near Incheon on June 11. “Given that the waters have for years not been visited by both sides, we had sent a notice to the North under the name of the UNC Military Armistice Commission before launching the campaign, and it is being carried out with MAC officers aboard,” spokesperson Moon Sang-gyun said at a regular news briefing. “We’re fully prepared for any North Korean provocation. ... And if North Korea stages a provocation against our military’s legitimate activities, we’ll sternly retaliate.” The team, consisting of South Korean military and police officers and UNC monitors, has since June 10 been clamping down on poaching by Chinese vessels at the estuary of the Hangang River, which constitutes not only a security violation, but also dries out fisheries and dents the livelihoods of fishing families on nearby border islands. As the operation was under way, no Chinese ship engaging in illicit fishing was detected in the estuary as of Monday, officials noted. The group impounded two boats on June 14, following the earlier seizure of two Chinese trawlers by South Korean fishermen, who handed them over to authorities early this month.In a separate dispatch, the North’s National Defense Commission threatened a “reckless nuclear retaliation.” It took issue on last week’s arrival in Busan of the USS Mississippi nuclear-powered submarine and the release by a private U.S. intelligence firm of a report on a military strike scenario against the communist state’s atomic facilities, among others. “It’s been long since our military has put within its range of a precision strike the U.S.’ anti-North aggression and logistics and supplies bases including the Anderson airfield in Guam where the B-52 strategic bombers take off and sea bases from which nuclear-powered submarines launch,” the state media said. “A nuclear war does not occur for a particular reason.” The series of threats represent Pyongyang’s attempts to ease Seoul’s tough stance since its latest nuclear and missile tests early this year, the Unification Ministry here said, adding it would not lead to any shift in global collaboration. “North Korea has been continuing a disguised peace offensive toward the South for a while since its party congress ,” ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee told reporters. “I believe they’ve realized that it doesn’t work any longer and thus are seeking to change our attitude through threats. But such threats of a provocation will hopefully not bring any crack in the sanctions campaign against the North.”By Shin Hyon-hee","on chinese boats illegally fishing ,commission threatened reckless nuclear retaliation ,chinese boats illegally fishing ,chinese boats illegally fishing in ,boats illegally fishing in neutral","['North Korea', 'the U.N.

The news report said the country's military is highly vigilant against their ""ever-more dangerous military moves.""On June 10, South Korea and the UNC conducted their first crackdown on Chinese fishing boats illegally operating in the area.A Chinese fishing boat escorted by a South Korean Coast Guard vessel enters the Port of Incheon, east of Seoul, on Wednesday, after being seized by the military police team for illegal fishing in the neutral waters of the Han River estuary.The region is a rich fishing ground that has been left largely untouched since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.A growing number of Chinese fishing boats have trespassed into the military buffer zone as the peak season for blue crabs has arrived.Chinese fishing boats often cross into South Korean waters in the Yellow Sea during peak crab season in search of bigger hauls, regularly leading to crackdowns by the South Korean Coast Guard.Chinese fishermen are presumed to have bought the right to operate in the waters on the North Korean side of the sea demarcation line, widely known as the Northern Limit Line, but they often intrude into the South Korean side.North Korean patrol and fishing vessels often show up in the western NLL region, along which the two Koreas fought several bloody sea battles in the past.Pyongyang does not acknowledge the de facto demarcation line drawn unilaterally by the U.S.-led UNC when the Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.","police team for illegal fishing ,first crackdown on chinese fishing ,crackdown on chinese fishing boats ,team for illegal fishing ,on chinese fishing boats illegally","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'the United Nations Command', 'chinese', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'UNC', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Korea', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'South Korea', 'UNC', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'south Korean Coast Guard', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Koreas', 'Pyongyang', 'UNC']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.19428402  0.07874512

The vaccines, which are given in two shots over six months, are currently not covered by the national health insurance, and cost about 360,000 won . While the program itself is beneficial, activists claimed that the government is selective when it comes to supporting young girls’ reproductive health.So far, the health care policies targeting women and girls have been sporadic and selective, the activists say, with the general perception toward women’s health and their rights for social protection being contradictory.YonhapFor example, oral birth control pills and morning-after pills are currently not covered by the national health insurance. The nation’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety also recently decided to continue disallowing over-the-counter sales of emergency contraception pills at pharmacies. Meanwhile, the Seoul Metropolitan Government recently announced that it would provide free sanitary pads for young girls who live below the poverty line in the region. The decision was announced after a number of nongovernmental organizations revealed that some 60,000 young women aged 15-19 are estimated to have problems purchasing sanitary pads due to financial difficultiesWhen Kang Min-jin, a woman living in Seoul, was attending high school, forgetting her sanitary pads meant risking being scolded by teachers. There were free pads for students to use in the school’s infirmary, but Kang was never comfortable asking for one. “Teachers would say something like, ‘It’s your responsibility to purchase your own pads,’” Kang told The Korea Herald.  “I think sanitary pads should be given for free to all female schoolchildren nationwide, regardless of their household income,” Kang said. “I don’t think  is any less of a public health issue .”Yoon Jeong-won, a Seoul-based gynecologist, said it is ironic that the government is providing HPV vaccinations for free when most birth control drugs and treatments are not covered by the state health insurance in Korea. “It has to do with how the state views young women’s bodies,” she said. “It does not want young women to develop cervical cancer. But at the same time, it does not want to grant free access to birth control pills. What does that say about women’s ownership of their bodies and their reproductive rights?”Citing its own study with gynecologists and pharmacists, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety last month argued that overuse of morning-after pills could be a health threat to women, especially young girls, and many are “not informed enough” on birth control in general. Contrary to the ministry’s claims, LNG ECPs, the type of morning-after pills available upon prescription in South Korea, are very safe and pose no risk of overdose, according to the World Health Organization.

The North, meanwhile, has remained mum on Seoul’s recent crackdown in the area for the fourth straight day. Seoul and the U.N. Command launched a military police team to root out the illegal fishing in neutral waters around the Hangang River estuary on Friday. The military has been keeping a keen eye on the North, over concerns the operation may provoke Pyongyang, given recent inter-Korea tensions.But the usually outspoken Pyongyang has been quiet on the first military operation in the area that has been free of authorities from either of the Koreas since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice.“We cannot conclusively say what is the intent behind the North’s silence, but we do believe that the speculations on the fishing rights  is plausible,” said ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun.A military police team carries out an operation to clamp down on illegal Chinese fishing at the neutral waters around the Hangang River estuary on Friday. He confirmed that the communist state has yet to comment on the operation, and said that military is on constant alert for any provocations from Pyongyang.Hours after Seoul and the UNC jointly commenced the operation, some 10 Chinese fishing boats spotted to have been illegally fishing in the neutral waters had moved to waters near the North Korean shores on the opposite side. The armistice agreement prohibits either South or North Korea from approaching within 100 meters of each other’s shores. The boats had since been staying there until moving out of the river mouth Monday, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The JCS said it is continuing the lookout in case of additional invasion by the boats.The armistice agreement states that the area extended from the Military Demarcation Line to the Northern Limit Line -- effectively the land and maritime borders between the Koreas -- is considered neutral waters. Any vessel wishing to enter the area must be registered with either Korea’s authorities.While the agreement stipulates each side can operate a force of “no more than four patrol boats for the civil police and not more than 24 civil police” in the area, such practice has not been carried out due to the sensitivity of inter-Korea relations. But the South Korean government acknowledged there are limits to using only diplomatic means to curb the illegal fishing by the Chinese. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries announced last week that the country’s crab catch as of April plunged 68.5 percent on-year to 664 tons.The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea said via a statement that the government is only halfheartedly trying to drive out the illegal fishing boats, pointing out that the much larger illegal fishing near the waters off the five northernmost islands in the West Sea remains unchecked.By Yoon Min-sik","down on illegal chinese fishing ,10 chinese fishing boats spotted ,the illegal fishing boats pointing ,mum on seoul recent crackdown ,out the illegal fishing boats","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'the U.N.

From Friday, the crackdown team entered the neutral waters where the estuary of the Han River meets the Yellow Sea. It is South Korea's first joint crackdown operation with the UNC since the border areas were declared a no man's land in the armistice which ended the 1950-53 Korean War.The armistice's annex governing civil shipping in neutral waters says no Korean or foreign ship is allowed to enter the area except those that are officially registered with South or North Korea. ""A number of illegal Chinese fishing boats have left the area yesterday following our crackdown team's operation,"" an official from the South Korean military said Sunday on condition of anonymity. ""There are only around 10 boats in the area.""When the crackdown team initiated the operation, there were more than 20 illegal fishing boats in the neutral waters. Military officials have said the operation will continue until the last Chinese fishing boat leaves the Han River estuary, but they have yet to resume action on Sunday because the Chinese fishing boats are now staying near North Korean shores. Under the armistice, the crackdown team cannot go near the North Korean coast. The military official said that the North's military has yet to make special movements on these fishing boats. ""We will consider whether to resume our operation today after considering the movements of Chinese fishing boats and weather conditions,"" the official said. June is a high season for catching blue crab in the largely untouched fishing ground, tempting Chinese fishermen to intrude into the militarily sensitive border areas between the Koreas. In the five months of 2016, Chinese fishing boats have been detected fishing in the neutral waters on around 520 occasions, according to the Ministry of National Defense. After the operation kicked off, China pledged cooperation with South Korea to stop illegal fishing, saying that Beijing respects international treaties on fishing and the local laws of the countries where its fishermen operate.","than 20 illegal fishing boats ,caught 45 kilograms of crabs ,crackdown on illegal chinese fishing ,20 illegal fishing boats in ,20 illegal fishing boats","[""South Korea 's"", 'Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'inter - korean', 'the Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'Coast Guard', 'United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'Coast Guard', 'UNC Military Armistice Commission', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'UNC', 'korean', 'North Korea', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Koreas', 'chinese', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Beijing']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42191678  0.23378593

104,104,Korea's crab catch plunges amid rise in uninvited Chinese boats,"South Korea's crab catch has been more than halved so far this year, the government said Friday, an apparent result of a recent rise in the number of Chinese boats fishing illegally in South Korean waters.According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the country's catch of crab amounted to 575 tons in April, down 69 percent from the same month last year.Also in the first four months of the year, the country's cr...","South Korea's crab catch has been more than halved so far this year, the government said Friday, an apparent result of a recent rise in the number of Chinese boats fishing illegally in South Korean waters.According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the country's catch of crab amounted to 575 tons in April, down 69 percent from the same month last year.Also in the first four months of the year, the country's crab catch plunged 68.5 percent on-year to 664 tons.The ministry largely attributed the cut to a simple drop in resources, noting the amount of baby crabs in the waters off the port of Incheon, west of Seoul, was tallied at 15,000 tons in 2013, less than half of the 2012 tally.However, those engaged in fishing argue the real problem is a continued rise in the number of Chinese boats fishing illegally, which has apparently caused the country's crab resources to dry up.According to the coast guard, there were over 300 Chinese ships fishing illegally in South Korea's western Yellow Sea alone on Thursday. In the first eight days of the month, an average of 163 Chinese boats were spotted each day in the area.The maritime police continue to seize or fine hundreds of Chinese vessels each year for illegal fishing, but the sheer number of Chinese ships operating illegally in South Korean waters makes it impossible to crack down on them, police officials say.Also, most Chinese ships stay close to South Korea's maritime border with North Korea, known as the Northern Limit Line, and often cross the border into the communist North when facing a crackdown.""Illegal fishing near the NLL is a tricky issue as it involves North Korea,"" a ministry official said. ""And that is why a close coordination of efforts with other related ministries is required.""A meeting of officials from the finance, public administration and welfare, foreign affairs, and defense ministries was held Friday to discuss measures aimed at curbing illegal fishing by Chinese boats, the official added.","300 chinese ships fishing illegally ,crab catch plunged 68 percent ,each year for illegal fishing ,fishing illegally in south korean ,chinese boats fishing illegally which","[""South Korea 's"", 'chinese', 'south korean', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Incheon', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'the Northern Limit Line', 'NLL', 'North Korea', 'chinese']",17,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46684924  0.80018651

It said such measures are critical to increase rice production this year.The country has ended the spring rice planting season in the wake of the rare congress of the Workers' Party of Korea last month. In the seventh WPK congress, the North announced various economic projects aimed at improving economic conditions in the impoverished country.The newspaper, an organ of the WPK, claimed the country has aggressively entered the weeding campaign following a successful rice planting in the first year of the nation's five-year economic development plan.The newspaper said that farmers, agricultural workers and volunteers all have a strong will to attain the goal of a high crop yield that can solve the country's food shortage problem.""We will devote all our wisdom and energies to solving the food problem under the guidance of the WPK and finish the rice production as required by the Juche  method of farming and attain the goals of grain production for this year under any circumstances,"" the paper said.In its previous editorial last month, the Rodong Sinmun called for the people to concentrate all their efforts on the rice-planting campaign to gain a breakthrough in grain production.The paper likened rice farming to a ""battle"" that must be won.Reflecting the country's renewed interest in farming, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited a machinery exhibition in his first inspection since he was appointed the chairman of the WPK early last month.He showed interest in the agricultural machinery and equipment during the inspection tour, according to the North's media report.Grain output numbers have gained more urgency as the country has been slapped with the toughest sanctions yet by the U.N. for its fourth nuclear test earlier this year. Pyongyang's provocations have, moreover, hurt the inflow of food aid from abroad that can pose serious challenges for the country down the road.","rice farming to battle that ,rice farming to battle ,the spring rice planting season ,weeding campaign following successful rice ,ended the spring rice planting","['North Korea', 'Rodong Sinmun', ""Workers ' Party"", ""the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'WPK congress', 'WPK', 'WPK', 'Juche', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'WPK', 'U.N.', 'Pyongyang']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49558371  0.43464345

He said such a measure may trigger unnecessary stigmatization against the mentally ill. The police’s decision was announced last week following the recent Gangnam murder case, in which a 23-year-old woman was stabbed to death by a man with a history of schizophrenia who said he killed her because he hated women. Citing the man’s history of mental illness, the police concluded that the case could not be classified as a misogynist crime, and instead announced a set of measures to eradicate violent crimes by the mentally ill. A number of nongovernment organizations, including representative groups of women and people with disabilities, have protested the decision -- calling it discriminatory against people with mental disabilities or disease. “The police’s announcement may trigger prejudice against those with mental illness, such as how all mentally ill people are dangerous or should be isolated,” Lee said in a statement. “There have  been an increasing number of online remarks that express hatred against those with mental conditions.”Studies have questioned the correlation between mental illness and serious crimes. In a 2014 study by the American Psychological Association on crimes committed by 143 offenders with serious mental disorders, only 7.5 percent were directly related to the symptoms of mental illness.Lee also expressed his concern over the growing public dispute on misogyny and hateful remarks against the marginalized. Many women’s rights groups have claimed that the Gangnam murder case must be understood as a result of serious gender disparity in Korea.“While the focus should be on starting a social discussion over the cause of such cases and ways to prevent them, it is worrying to see that  is spreading more toward revulsion against a certain gender or prejudice and isolation against the mentally disabled,” he said.Lee added that his organization plans to survey the public’s perception and the overall reality of the abasement and abhorrence against the socially-weak including women, immigrants and the disabled, to seek for policy alternatives.By Claire Lee","following the recent gangnam murder ,the recent gangnam murder ,recent gangnam murder case in ,recent gangnam murder ,the recent gangnam murder case","['National Human Rights Commission', 'Lee Sung - ho', 'Gangnam', 'Lee', 'the American Psychological Association', 'Lee', 'Gangnam', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'Claire Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45344028  0.75083572

Over the decades, chicken has evolved into everyday comfort food and it has even become representative of Korea’s food culture.According to latest statistics, each Korean consumes an average of 15.4 kilograms of chicken a year. They are used in numerous dishes ranging from samgyetang  to dakbokeumtang .But at the core of the meat’s popularity is the Korean-style fried chicken, which combines western cooking techniques and oriental seasonings to suit the palate of the Korean consumers.This fusion dish, which differs from traditional Korean chicken recipes, is referred to as “chikin ” instead of the Korean equivalent “dak twigim.”Chicken has also grown in popularity over recent years due to the rise of “chi-maek,” a word that combines chicken and beer.“Inviting somebody to have chi-maek carries a completely different tone from suggesting other get-togethers,” said Jeon Seung-wook, a 34-year-old office worker.“While it is filling enough to be counted as a full meal, chicken is much more casual as it is served in fully cooked pieces, allowing people to focus more on conversation.”This easygoing mood, along with the affordable price, is what makes chicken accessible to workers who get-together on weeknights or families and even single households looking for an easy home-delivery meal. Chicken joins in K-food waveGiven its steady demand and frequent media exposure, chicken has become a popular item of the Korean culinary wave, especially in neighboring China. It was the hit SBS drama “My Love from the Star” that aired in 2013-2014 which brought Korean-style chicken to the attention of the Chinese public.After the release of a scene in which the drama’s heroine Jun Ji-hyun cheered up over chi-maek, holding a chicken drumstick in one hand and a cup of beer in the other, Chinese fans queued for hours at Korean chicken stores.Travel agencies immediately added chicken meals to their tourist programs, while chicken companies and regional governments mulled using chicken as a cultural promotion tool.In March this year, Incheon City made headlines by hosting a chicken and beer street promotion for 4,500 Chinese visitors who consumed some 3,000 chickens in one sitting.“Despite its western-based origin, chicken is now quite fit to represent Korea’s popular food culture, especially in a foreigner’s perspective,” said Kim Sook-hyun, a Korean female residing in New York. She previously spent several years in Berlin, Germany.Although chicken is familiar to them, westerners tend to be intrigued by the Korean twist such as the spicy sauces, she explained.“In fact, one of the things that I missed most about home during my stay in Europe was seasoned spicy chicken, not tteokbokki or any other conventional Korean-style snacks,” she added.“It was the menu that reminded me of home -- that existed in so many parts of my memory back there, so why wouldn’t I see it as Korean food?” Chicken game of the chicken sellersWhile overseas demand has opened up new doors for Korea’s chicken industry, it has also egged on competition in the already saturated market. According to the Statistics Korea and Fair Trade Commission early this year, Korea’s chicken market currently stands at 5 trillion won  in size, comprising of some 40,000 stores and 300 franchise brands.The number of stores exceeds the global total of fast food giant McDonald’s or the No. 1 chicken franchise Kentucky Fried Chicken. The former held 36,525 stores worldwide as of last year and the latter 18,875 as of 2014.If non-franchise owner stores and beer pubs selling chicken menus are included, the number of chicken sellers in Korea is likely to be much higher than the commission’s figures. This oversupply has inevitably led to a mass fallout. Seoul Metropolitan Government data in February showed that the number of chicken stores in the city soared by 38 percent in 2010-2015, but an equal number also closed down within the first three years in business.Despite this trend, aspiring owner-operators still opt to open such stores as it seems a plausible way of creating income on limited capital, given the simple recipe and menu Maintenance and personnel expenses are also lower compared to other restaurant businesses, especially in the case of delivery-only stores.“Our country is like a chicken republic, where elderly retirees have no other way than opening a  store, regardless of their occupational skills,” said President Park Geun-hye during a financial strategic meeting last month.Her remarks were made in support of a labor bill permitting the dispatch of elderly workers to correlated small and medium-sized companies. However, it also highlights the excessive boom of the market.Observers noted that those who seek to open such businesses should recognize the tough market situation before hastily opening a chicken franchise store.“Franchise headquarters would boast guaranteeing the operator a certain monthly income, but these stated figures often turn out to be delusive,” said an official of the FTC.“One also has to consider the surrounding elements, such as the number of competing stores in proximity and the public image of the franchise brand itself.”By Bae Hyun-jung","abundant chicken eateries in korea ,chicken franchise kentucky fried chicken ,traditional korean chicken recipes ,europe was seasoned spicy chicken ,hours at korean chicken stores","['Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Jeon Seung - wook', 'Chicken', 'K - food', 'korean', 'China', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Jun Ji - hyun', 'chinese', 'korean', 'Incheon City', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Kim Sook - hyun', 'korean', 'New York', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'korean', 'korean', 'korean', 'Korea', 'the Statistics Korea', 'Fair Trade Commission', 'Korea', 'McDonald ’s', 'Kentucky Fried Chicken', 'Korea', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'Park Geun', 'FTC.“One', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62136406  0.80728078

According to tallies, a total of 27 died allegedly from using Aekyung’s products and 101 suffered damage to their health. However, up to this point none of them have received compensation from the company. In 2011, the government said that the two suspect chemicals in Aekyung’s humidifier sterilizer -- CMIT and MIT -- did not directly cause lung damage, based on a Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report in 2011. For this reason, their products were not banned from sale immediately, unlike other toxic humidifier sterilizers such as those from Oxy Reckitt Benckiser. The company reportedly voluntarily withdrew its humidifier sterilizers from the market in August 2011. The prosecution also excluded Aekyung from its investigation earlier this year. But the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health argued that a 6-year-old victim who recently underwent an operation to remove a tube in her neck had used the product, which was purchased after the decision to stop selling them.“We are only responsible for the sales of the products  which were manufactured by SK Chemical,” Aekyung’s public relations official told The Korea Herald. “But we admit our ethical responsibility for those who suffered from the use of our product. We will do our best based on the result of the prosecution's  investigation.” When asked whether the company was admitting to the causality of their product with the deaths, he said the company was awaiting the results of the investigation and that there was no plan to compensate victims as of now.On Tuesday, representatives of the victims’ group met with the ruling Saenuri Party’s whip Chung Jin-suk at the National Assembly.Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk greets a humidifier sterilizer victim at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald“I would like to say sorry to all victims' families. How can your sorrow in losing a family member be compared to anything?” said Chung, commencing the meeting.“We are doing our best to find the root cause of the humidifier sterilizer tragedy,” he added.Rep. Kim Gwang-lim, who participated in the meeting, told reporters that the party had reached an agreement with the victims’ group to hold a hearing by inviting responsible ministries, separate from the ongoing prosecutorial probe.Holding a hearing was one of the demands proposed by the victims’ group. Its nine other demands include enacting a “Humidifier Sterilizer Special Law,” and removing the environment minister from his post. On Tuesday, the Environment Ministry also vowed to investigate all biocide products until the end of next year for better safety standards on household products, amid widespread “chemical-phobia.”A biocide is a substance formulated to destroy organisms harmful to humans and is often included in household products for antibiotics or sterilizing purposes. These products, however, can have negative effects if used in excessive doses.“The ministry will firstly look into disputed household products such as deodorant or spray-type items that can pose higher health risk for users,” said the ministry in a statement. The ministry also plans to ask some 8,000 manufacturers and import companies to submit lists of biocide substances contained in their products.According to the Chemicals Registration and Assessment Act, just three out of 15 types of household products which come under direct supervision of the ministry are classified as biocide product -- antiseptics, repellents and preservatives.The ministry added that the list of products that contain biocide will be assessed in terms of exposure and content level. The result of the assessment will be made available to the public to spread awareness. Starting next year, the investigation will expand into biocide industrial goods, which did not fall under the 15 types of product under the ministry’s control.By Kim Da-sol","toxic humidifier sterilizer victims who ,2011 the prosecution also excluded ,tuesday representatives of the victims ,27 died allegedly from using ,two suspect chemicals in aekyung","['SK Chemicals', 'Aekyung ’s', 'Aekyung ’s', 'MIT', 'a Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health', 'SK Chemical', 'the Korea Herald', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'the National Assembly', 'Park Hae - mook', 'the Korea herald“i', 'Chung', 'Kim Gwang - lim', 'the Environment Ministry', 'the Chemicals Registration', 'Assessment Act', 'Kim Da - sol']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37262321  0.55224216

The upcoming submission, which is scheduled to be made in the second half of this year, seeks to be recognized by the Korean Drug Ministry as “pre-exposure prophylaxis” – or PrEP – a preventive medicine for those who do not have HIV or AIDS.“We think we’ll get our response from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety sometime next year, probably after June,” an official from Gilead Sciences told The Korea Herald. “Once we get the ministry’s approval, we can officially label the drug as PrEP.”In Korea, the drug is currently mostly prescribed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS patients. For prevention, the drug is only prescribed to health care workers, newborns born to HIV-positive parents, men and women who are legally married to patients infected with HIV or AIDS, including those in common-law marriages.  Gay marriage is not legally recognized in Korea.YonhapUnder the current system in Korea, men who have sex with men -- who are known to be 19 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population,  according to UNAIDS, the joint U.N. program on HIV and AIDs -- do not have access to the drug for prevention. An industry source who did not wish to be named said although it is more likely that more Koreans would gain access to the drug once Truvada is approved as PrEP, it is currently difficult to predict what is going to happen. “A lot of sensitive issues, such as LGBT rights and possible stigmatization, are involved with the use of this drug as a preventive medicine,” she said. “For example, there may be a possible stigma against those who prescribe the drug for preventive purposes. There’s also the issue of privacy and how we are going to protect the relevant personal data.” In the U.S., Truvada was approved as PrEP by the FDA back in 2012. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S., daily PrEP use can lower the risk of getting HIV and AIDS from sex by more than 90 percent. PrEP, however, does not work in the same way as a vaccine. Unlike a vaccine that teaches one’s body to fight off infection for several years, PrEP, which come in the form of pills, is required to be taken orally every day. The presence of the medicine in one’s bloodstream is known to stop HIV from spreading in the body.The cost of the drug is currently covered by the Korea’s National Health Insurance for HIV and AIDS patients. It costs 13,730 won  per pill. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 12,757 AIDS cases were reported in Korea from 1985-2014. Among them, 92.4 percent of the newly reported patients in 2014 were male. Also, 99.8 percent of them were infected through sex.

The Toxic Chemicals Control Act took effect in 1991.The ministry reportedly explained that the rest of the chemicals were not tested as they were “general chemicals,” a class of chemicals defined as having been in widespread use for a long time without serious toxic effects. The government has also argued it is impractical to test all 37,000 chemicals and categorize them by toxicity.YonhapSince 1991, general chemicals have made up 92 percent of all substances currently used in products nationwide.The practice has left loopholes in safety management for the past 25 years.Substances CMIT and MIT used in making the humidifier sterilizer of Aekyung, for instance, were permitted for use until they were designated as toxic materials in 2012.Lawyers’ group Minbyun said the current management of chemical ingredients posed grave dangers and called on the government to test all substances that have not had their safety proven. Observers also pointed to problems with the current management system of chemicals used in household goods.In 2015, the government implemented the Chemical Registration and Assessment Act and designated 15 kinds of products such as sterilizers, deodorants and air fresheners as household chemical products.But these products do not need to list the chemicals they contain, apart from those designated by the ministry as toxic. By Kim Da-sol","test all 37 000 chemicals ,toxic materials in 2012 lawyers ,of 2015 the toxic chemicals ,600 chemicals out of 37 ,tests on about 600 chemicals","['South Korea', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'the Toxic Chemicals', 'CMIT', 'MIT', 'Aekyung', 'Minbyun', 'the Chemical Registration', 'Assessment Act', 'Kim Da - sol']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3305859   0.44723862

The ministry is accused of skipping necessary tests and overlooking omitted documents when approving the products in question. The government is also being criticized for opposing the opposition-led legislative drive to fortify compensation for the victims.According to liberal lawyers’ group Minbyun, the Environment Ministry had skipped requirements on toxicity tests for CMIT and MIT. These are the chemicals contained in humidifier sterilizers from local brands Aekyung and E-mart. The ministry has argued that the two chemicals were regarded as general chemicals when the Toxic Chemicals Control Act took effect in 1991. The ministry has also said that it was “practically difficult” to test all 36,000 chemicals and sort them into the toxicoid category.In 2003, another humidifier sterilizer maker Cefu -- which used PGH in their product -- was approved by the National Institute of Environmental Research, although Cefu reportedly submitted an incomplete application without mentioning the purpose of the use of PGH and the import amount.South Korea’s Toxic Chemicals Control Act states that all chemical importers should submit import applications with clearly stated purpose of the use of chemicals and import amounts. The chemicals should also go through a mandatory chemical toxicity test at the NIER.But in April 2003, the NIER approved Cefu’s PGH to be imported and used in the product without it having gone through the chemical toxicity test. The NIER later even announced that PGH is “not toxic” in its official gazette.According to Danish chemical firm KeTox, which supplied PGH to Cefu, the Materials Safety Data Sheet on PGH warns that it is necessary to breathe in fresh air when a person inhales PGH.On Monday, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office summoned Cefu manufacturer Butterfly Effect’s chief executive officer surnamed Oh. As of 2014, the brand is blamed for 14 deaths, while 41 suffer health damages. Criticism toward the government has soared as it remains skeptical of several bills pushed by the opposition.A legislative bill on remedies for injuries caused by the use of toxic humidifier sterilizer -- which was proposed by Rep. Jang Ha-na from the opposition The Minjoo Party in May, 2013 -- was opposed by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Federation of Korean Industries.The bill states that victims should be provided with medical care benefits, living expenses, funeral expenses and condolence money for bereavement. The bill also states that relief funds for victims should be collected by the government, humidifier sterilizer manufacturers and distributers. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance argued that “it is difficult to accept the bill since the causality between chemicals contained in humidifier sterilizer and health damages is unclear.” The FKI also opposed the bill saying, “Chemical manufacturing companies will have too much financial burden.”With the ruling Saenuri Party sharing their concerns, a revised supplementary budget bill on 500 million won as well as negotiations on the bill fell apart Monday. The discussion is expected to recommence after the 20th National Assembly starts later this month.On Wednesday, Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu appeared for a meeting with the National Assembly’s Environment and Labor Committee to brief on the estimated damages caused by toxic humidifier sterilizers and the status of compensation for victims.Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu  attends a parliamentary meeting on Wednesday. Yoon apologized at the meeting saying that the “humidifier sterilizer tragedy was an accident caused by the ministry’s lax safety regulations on products.”The Environment Ministry’s vice-Minister Jeong Yeon-man also told reporters on Wednesday that the government is considering supporting the living expenses of victims and their families. “We were mainly focused in providing victims’ families with medical fee or funeral expenses so far, but now we would like to discuss methods to provide them with living expenses,” Jeong was quoted as saying. According to government data, a total of 203 humidifier sterilizer victims received an accumulated 3.75 billion won in compensation as of 2016, out of a total of 530 who reported health damages related to the use of humidifier sterilizers in July 2013. The compensation was paid by the government, which is currently in a court battle against 13 manufacturers for reimbursement.The Environment Ministry is currently conducting medical checkups on 752 applicants who reported health damages in 2015 at Asan Medical Center in downtown Seoul, to confirm the correlation of their symptoms to sterilizer toxicoid.By Kim Da-sol","fki also opposed the bill ,caused by toxic humidifier sterilizers ,opposed the bill saying chemical ,south korea toxic chemicals ,humidifier sterilizer tragedy the government","['Minbyun', 'the Environment Ministry', 'CMIT', 'MIT', 'the Toxic Chemicals', 'Cefu', 'PGH', 'the National Institute of Environmental Research', 'Cefu', 'PGH', 'South Korea ’s', 'Toxic Chemicals', 'nier.but', 'NIER', 'Cefu ’s PGH', 'NIER', 'PGH', 'danish', 'KeTox', 'PGH', 'Cefu', 'the Materials Safety Data Sheet', 'PGH', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Butterfly Effect ’s', 'Jang Ha - na', 'the Minjoo Party', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'the Ministry of Strategy', 'Finance', 'FKI', 'chemical', 'Saenuri Party', 'National Assembly', 'Yoon Seong - kyu', 'the National Assembly ’s Environment', 'Labor Committee', 'Yoon Seong - kyu', 'Yoon', 'Jeong Yeon - man', 'Jeong', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.17716576  0.36371583

The 39-year-old man, whose identity was withheld, visited Batangas, some 100 kilometers south of Manila, on April 27 and returned to South Korea on May 4, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said.He visited a clinic in Samcheok, some 290 km east of Seoul, on Monday after having a rash, along with joint and muscle pains. He was diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus in a urine test on Wednesday.The KCDC suspects he might have been bitten by a mosquito while in the Southeast Asian country, but has no companions during his stay.The health authorities said that he is being admitted to a hospital for further medial checkups, but there is slim possibility that he would transmit the virus to another person as he has not engaged in blood donation or got another mosquito bite since he returned to South Korea.The latest case raises the number of confirmed infections in South Korea to five -- one from Brazil, one from Vietnam and three from the Philippines. All of them had mosquito bites during their trip.A total of 47 countries mostly in South America and Southeast Asia reported at least one confirmed Zika case over the last two months as of last week, according to the KCDC.The KDCD asked the people to take care of themselves during their overseas trip to those countries, and recommended pregnant women cancel or delay their schedule.The virus, first discovered in Africa, has been linked to thousands of birth defects in newborn babies like abnormally small heads and improperly developed brains in Brazil.Months ahead of the Brazil Summer Olympics, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus outbreak a global emergency.","seoul on monday after having ,zika virus outbreak global emergency ,east of seoul on monday ,in urine test on wednesday ,virus infection in south korea","['South Korea', 'Philippines', 'Batangas', 'Manila', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Samcheok', 'Seoul', 'KCDC', 'southeast asian', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'Brazil', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines', 'Zika', 'Brazil', 'the Brazil Summer Olympics', 'the World Health Organization', 'Zika']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46481341  0.24258359

The increase has naturally led to a jump in illegal entry and employment. According to the Justice Ministry, the number of so-called overstayers in the country has shown a surging trend in recent years -- 167,780 in 2011, 177,854 in 2012, 183,106 in 2013, 208,778 in 2014 and 214,187 last year.The 2015 figure is more than three times higher than that of Japan, which recorded a relatively humble 62,818 on account of effective strict crackdowns. In 2004, Japan launched a five-year program to halve the number of foreigners who overstay their visas, with major steps including a sharp increase of crackdown workforce and fines on employers who hire them. It even revokes the business licenses of violating employers. South Korea adopted a similar program this year with the goal to bring down the number of immigrants who overstay their visas to below-200,000. But the goal does not seem achievable in the near future due largely to low manpower.  According to the ministry, the number of officials in charge of finding overstayers nationwide is only about 150 per immigration office, which means one agent has to track down more than 1,400 people living in the country illegally. Jeju, one of the country's most popular tourist sites, has seen the biggest increase in the number of visa overstayers in recent years. The population of foreign visitors there rose from 1,045,673 in 2011 to 1,681,399 in 2012, 1,812,172 in 2013, 2,859,092 in 2014 and 1,624,260 in 2015. In the 2015 figure, Chinese visitors accounted for a whopping 85.3 percent. The number of foreigners who visited Jeju without a visa also soared from 113,825 in 2011 to 232,929 in 2012, 429,221 in 2013 and 645,301 in 2014 and slightly declined to 629,724 last year decisively on account of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  outbreak that hit the nation, killing 36 people.The growth in the number of visa overstayers is noticeable especially since 2013 when the number of foreigners visiting the island crossed the 2-million line.A Jeju government official said the rapid jump stems from the increase of overseas and local brokers who help these foreigners illegally find jobs. The spread of information on the island's favorable economic conditions among Asian nations was also a major contributing factor. In particular, the visa-free system, which the island introduced in 2008 to attract more Chinese tourists is being abused as a channel for illegal entry and employment. Under the Special Act on the Establishment of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province and the Development of a Free International City, all tourists except for nationals from 11 terror-sponsoring countries can enter and stay on the island without a visa for up to30 days.On the other hand, the average arrest rate for those who overstay on Jeju remained at 29 percent from 2011-2014, with 53 cases in 2011, 147 in 147 in 2012, 172 in 2013 and 602 in 2014. An example of the misuse of the visa-free program happened on Jan. 13, when 59 of 155 Vietnamese tourists on a group tour to Jeju with no visas disappeared from their lodging. There are 23 fugitives still at large.Such lag capturing people who violate their visas is ascribable to the shortage of crackdown officials and ever-evolving tricks for illegal entry.            In November 2012, the coast guard arrested two Chinese nationals and a broker who attempted to enter the mainland from Jeju by using a small boat. The broker unsuccessfully tried to hand them over to a fishing vessel off the coast of the island after departing a Jeju port aboard a small boat. A Chinese man was caught while trying to take a Jeju-Wando ferry by hiding in a van in March last year, and seven Chinese people and their local broker were nabbed at Jeju's Hanlim Port while trying to secretly leave the island hidden in a container carried on a freighter.It is not rare for overstayers to be caught while illegally working on the island as well. On April 26, four brokers were prosecuted on charges of helping immigrants find illegal jobs at farms, factories and construction sites on the island. In a probe into the brokers, 26 Chinese men were deported after being arrested on the scene and 21 employers were found to have illegally hired immigrants in a bid to lower their wage burden. However, no employer who had hired such workers has been taken into custody thus far, inviting criticism that such leniency foster the spread of illegal employment. Notable is the fact that the number of foreign brokers is also on the rise.There are an increasing number of cases where Chinese and Chinese-Korean brokers take foreigners from the island in collusion with local counterparts, and arrange jobs for them in other regions of the country. According to the police, some foreigners who enter the country illegally or overstay visas intentionally come to Jeju initially, with the intent to find jobs in other areas, as the island is a relatively easy channel for entry.The increase of those who overstay visas on the island has resulted in the increase of crimes committed by foreigners there. According to the Jeju prosecution office, the number of foreign offenders surged from 350 in 2011 to 335 in 2012, 457 in 2013, 477 in 2014 and 673 in 2015. Crime is also becoming more violent, with an increase in robbery, drugs, sexual harassment, rape and homicide. In June last year, a 23-year-old Chinese man who overstayed his visa stabbed his compatriot with a knife at a night club. In April, a 30-year-old Chinese national was arrested on charges of confining and attacking a 44-year-old Chinese realtor to extort money. On April 7, a Chinese man in his 50s attempted to rape a housewife after breaking into her house. There was also one homicide reported every year from 2011 to 2015.Officials from the police, prosecution and immigration office on Jeju strongly voice the need for supplementary guidelines to the visa-free system as soon as possible.In a recent briefing on foreigners in the country illegally, Kim Han-soo, a senior prosecutor at the Jeju Prosecutors' Office, warned that Jeju could be full of such immigrants because of their misuse of the visa-free system.      ""We'll stage stern crackdowns on those who overstay their visas, illegal brokers and illegal employers to root out their wrongdoings,"" Kim said.","such visa violations the increase ,jeju without visa also soared ,visa violations the increase ,foreign offenders surged from 350 ,increase in robbery drugs sexual","['South Korea', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'below-200,000', 'Jeju', 'chinese', 'Jeju', 'Jeju', 'asian', 'chinese', 'the Development of a Free International City', 'Jeju', 'vietnamese', 'Jeju', 'chinese', 'Jeju', 'chinese', 'Jeju - Wando', 'chinese', ""Jeju 's Hanlim Port"", 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese - korean', 'Jeju', 'Jeju', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Jeju', 'Kim Han - soo', ""the Jeju Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Jeju', 'Kim']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33967724  0.45008957

Oil prices often spike when there is concern that production could be curtailed. A wildfire moves toward the town of Anzac on Wednesday, where was set up as an evacuation center for those ordered to leave Fort McMurray. Canada is the leading exporter of crude oil and natural gas to the United States, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration. Canada sends about 100 million barrels of crude and 240 billion cubic feet of natural gas per month to the U.S.S&P; Global Platts, which tracks the energy industry, estimated that up to 820,000 barrels a day of crude oil production were shut in by the fire, although the number could be lower if facilities were operating below peak capacity.""It definitely is helping to boost the prices, although  is not that high considering the amount of crude that is being threatened,"" said Jeff Mower of Platts. He attributed the restrained market reaction to high inventories of crude in the U.S., especially in the Midwest, where much of the Canadian crude goes for refining.Some grades of Canadian crude normally trade at premiums to benchmark U.S. oil while others usually trade at a discount, but all were trading higher Thursday and Friday than earlier in the week, according to Platts.The fire is near the tar sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta. So far there are no reports of damage to production facilities. More than 80,000 people have left Fort McMurray, where the fire has torched 1,600 homes and other buildings.Key pipelines were closed Thursday, although a major one reopened Friday morning, according to analysts for Genscape, which monitors the pipelines.Much of the oil from the tar sands is refined in the United States. The impact on the U.S. oil market will depend on how long the interruption lasts.If facilities are not damaged, ""then the production cuts are only as long-lasting as the fires,"" said Dylan White, an oil storage analyst with Genscape. ""Once the fires are subdued workers can come back to the production sites.""Ritterbusch and Associates, which advises oil traders, said that such a short-term outage shouldn't have much effect on oil prices because of a huge surplus of U.S. crude supplies.","oil prices because of huge ,canada is the leading exporter ,the massive wildfire in the ,helping send crude prices higher ,oil prices often spike when","['Canada', 'Benchmark U.S.', 'New York', 'Anzac', 'Canada', 'the United States', 'the Energy Information Administration', 'Canada', 'Global Platts', 'Jeff Mower', 'U.S.', 'canadian', 'canadian', 'U.S.', 'Platts', 'Fort McMurray', 'Alberta', 'Fort McMurray', 'Genscape', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Dylan White', 'Genscape', 'associate', 'U.S.']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54089558  0.9150511

In 2012, the last year for which official figures are available, legal mining accounted for 2.3 percent of GDP, or $8.5 billion. But authorities say that more than half of Colombia's mining sites are in fact illegal.In these illegal mines, which help finance illegal armed groups, ""excavators dig huge holes where water accumulates, perfect breeding groups for malaria-carrying mosquitoes,"" said University of Antioquia researcher Ivan Dario Velez.And the sites where the miners set up camp ""usually lack public utilities and have very poor hygiene conditions, which encourages the spread of mosquito and thus the disease,"" he said.Malaria symptoms include feverish headaches, chills, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.Last year, some 214 million people suffered from malaria, of which 438,000 died from the disease, according the World Health Organization. Most of those who died were children under five, the vast majority of them in Africa.The malaria death rate has dropped 72 percent in South America since 2000, and the WHO expects to eradicate the disease in eight Latin American countries by 2020.The outbreak in Choco is also linked to a shortage of medicine to fight the disease, according to the health minister.Gaviria said about 7,000 doses of needed medicine are being sent to the department, the poorest in the country.From 2015 to 2016, about 30 people died of malaria, most in isolated communities far from urban centers, according to the Office of the Ombudsman, which that warned this week of a ""worrisome increase"" in cases.Separately, in February officials launched an investigation into the deaths of 37 children and the poisoning of 64 others in the Choco region.

Relevant organizations should thoroughly investigate the case and take necessary measures such as receiving additional reports of damages so that the victims can get due compensation,” Park said during a Cabinet meeting.“ should also check whether there are any loopholes in the safety management of chemical products and whether there are any blind spots that need to be fixed as soon as possible to prevent any reoccurrence.”Park’s remarks came amid the prosecutorial probe into several humidifier disinfectant manufacturers and distributers that sold the problematic product. Public calls have been growing over the government’s role in managing the manufacturers of chemical products as well as for tougher punishment against the accused companies. Earlier in the day, the prosecution summoned Butterfly Effect’s former head surnamed Oh who led Cefu, a manufacturer of toxic humidifier disinfectant, and an official who provided the toxic ingredient. This is the first time that the prosecutors summoned company officials other than Oxy Reckitt Benckiser. Since earlier this month, the investigators have called in Oxy’s key members such as the former head and the ingredient developer. The probe was initially focused on Oxy as the majority of victims was found to have used Oxy’s product called Oxy Ssak Ssak containing the toxic ingredient PHMG. Butterfly Effect is suspected of selling the product that contained PGH, which is known to be more harmful than the PHMG that Oxy had used. Oh sold the product online from 2009 to 2011 and 27 of the users were found to have been affected, with 14 dead, investigators said. It is also suspected that Oh allegedly pretended that his company went out of business after the humidifier disinfectant case broke out. Later, however, it was found that his wife was running a similar business online, sources said. The prosecution suspects that the companies had known about the toxicity of the ingredients but had not conducted a safety test due to sales performance pressure. Following Oxy and Butterfly Effect, the prosecution is planning to summon officials of Lotte Mart and Homeplus, who sold the products. Meanwhile, the group of humidifier disinfectant victims and their families urged the prosecution to summon former and current foreign officials of Oxy as well. “Four foreign heads who have been in charge of Oxy while the company sold the murderous product from 2005 until now should take responsibility,” a statement by the group said.“ should not only resummon former Oxy head Shin Hyun-woo but also call in other former and incumbent heads and local and foreign executive board members.”Shin was questioned Wednesday over whether he had known about the toxicity of the product.

In October 2014 alone, 22 North Korean workers in Kuwait were arrested on bootlegging charges, according to the RFA. Other media reports said if North Korean workers are discovered selling the liquor to North Korean laborers or other people, they are deported back to North Korea. According to local sources, the manufacturing cost for a box of sadeeqi  is estimated at $20, but it is sold to regional smugglers for up to $50, making the business quite profitable and hard to root out.There used to be almost 4,000 North Koreans, mostly construction laborers, in the country, but the number has dropped to 3,200, according to the RFA.The North dispatches tens of thousands of workers abroad to raise hard currency for its struggling economy, stymied by sanctions and rampant inflation.

The quakes killed 34 people and injured some 2,000 others, according to Japanese media.In the wake of the quakes, the Hong Kong government issued a yellow travel warning, the lowest of the three-stage alert system, for the Kumamoto region, the South China Morning Post and other newspapers reported.The Hong Kong government advised those who are planning to visit the region or are already staying there to be on alert and stay away from the quake-stricken area.China's major tourist agencies have also suspended their tour programs to the disaster-battered Japanese areas for one month until May 16. According to Chinese newspapers, a number of Chinese tour companies canceled their tour programs to Kumamoto Prefecture and the broader Kyushu area, and announced policies to refund customers.Hong Kong Airlines also decided to allow passengers who have tickets for flights bound for Kumamoto this month to change their destinations, according to the Chinese media. Joseph Tung, an official at Hong Kong's Travel Industry Council, was quoted as saying that about 400 Hong Kong people are staying in the Kyushu area but none of them have been affected by the recent quakes.Taiwan's airplanes and tour industry took similar preventive measures.Taiwan's air carriers, including China Airlines, either canceled their flights to Kumamoto or allowed passengers to change their destinations, according to Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency.

A South Korean court granted an injunction in February 2013, filed by Buseok Temple in Seosan on the country's west coast, suspending the return of the statue.The Buddhist statue is presumed to have been made in the 14th century during the Koryo Dynasty  and was designated as a cultural asset by the prefecture.South Korea returned the other stolen statue, which had been located at Kaijin Shrine nearby the Japanese temple, back to the shrine last July after South Korean prosecutors concluded that they could not verify whether it had been illegally brought to Japan.That statue, a bronze standing figure of the Tathagata Buddha, is designated as an important national cultural property.Experts have said the statue, which was crafted in the 8th century during the Unified Silla period, was presumed to have been moved to Japan through either cultural exchange or looting during the Japanese invasion of Korea, known as the Imjin War, from 1592-1598.","statues stolen by korean theft ,plundered by japanese pirate raiders ,japanese temple was illegally brought ,buddhist statues stolen by korean ,statue stolen from japanese temple","['South Korea', 'buddhist', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'NHK', 'the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration', 'Buddhist', 'korean', 'Kannon Temple', 'Tsushima', 'Nagasaki Prefecture', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'south korean', 'Buseok Temple', 'buddhist', 'South Korea', 'Kaijin Shrine', 'japanese', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'the Tathagata Buddha', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Korea']",16,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24946181  0.06639045

Among those that caught yellow fever, 178 have died so far, with the disease spreading rapidly in nearby countries, the RFA said, quoting sources.It said some 1,000 North Korean workers are in Angola, including construction workers and medical staff, the report said, referring to the workforce North Korea dispatches overseas to earn money. The recent deaths of the North Koreans calls into question the quality of North Korea's yellow fever vaccine and the veracity of North Korea's claims to have inoculated its workers sent to the African country, according to the report. Those who became sick have asked to be repatriated, but the North Korean government has opted to not comply out of fear that they could cause the disease to spread at home, the media company said.  In a separate story, the RFA also said China's customs authorities have recently tightened their control of cargo at its borders with North Korea. Customs officials increased the frequency of their random inspections on cargo shipments to see if the claimed items match actual products being transported, the report said.The tightening is especially aimed at stopping packages labeled as apples but actually containing Chinese rice from being exported to North Korea, the report said.

The measures were announced just a day after the World Health Organization revealed that the number of diabetes patients worldwide had nearly quadrupled to 422 million in 2014 from 108 million in 1980. The WHO report showed that high blood sugar levels are linked to 3.7 million deaths worldwide each year, and warned that the numbers would only increase unless drastic action were taken.A study by the ministry showed that as of 2013, Koreans aged 3-29 were consuming too much sugar, with sugar accounting for more than 10 percent of their daily caloric intake. The largest proportion of the surveyed Koreans were consuming sugar by drinking carbonated drinks, followed by those who ate pastries, cookies and rice cakes. “Our research shows that those whose sugar consumption from processed foods accounted for more than 10 percent of their daily caloric intake had a 39 percent higher chance of developing obesity, and 66 percent higher chance of developing high blood pressure,” a ministry official said. South Korea has been seeing an increasing number of obesity patients in recent years. According to a study released by the National Health Insurance Service, the number of obese Koreans -- those with a body mass index of 30 or above -- accounted for 4.2 percent of the entire population in 2012, up from 2.5 percent in 2002.

The total amount of medical wastewater from hospitals and medical facilities is around 125.000-150.000 m3/day and night.Medical wastewater of hospitals and medical facilities is defined as liquid with solvents born in the hospital. In the hospital, wastewater contains chemicals and various microorganisms, especially pathogenic microorganisms causing disease and other sources. The chemicals are present in hospital wastewater from many groups, such as antibiotics, disinfectants, pharmaceuticals), radioactive isotopes, etc.Hospitals and medical facilities’ discharge of untreated medical wastewater into the natural environment, medical wastewater collection network of the city, can cause many problems such as a public health threat, causing imbalances in ecology of the water body, toxins accumulated in the ecological chain and environment.The medical wastewater treatment in hospitals and medical facilities is paid much attention to by the party and state, is regarded as one of the national key programs during the development and integration of the country.Medical wastewater is generated in the hospitals from three main sources:- Medical wastewater from treatment, laboratory rooms - Medical wastewater from pharmacy, there are drugs, vaccines, sera, organic solvents, testing chemicals, radiation chemical from the imaging divisions, etc.- Living wastewater from outpatients, inpatients, patients‘ relatives, officers and employees, from the cafeteria, etc.It is able to see that:- Medical wastewater of hospitals and medical facilities is at the ratio of biological oxygen demand / chemical oxygen demand  > 0.4-0.5, so it is suitable for processing by microorganisms. The ratio of BOD/COD of several hospitals is less than 0.5  due to the presence of persistent hydrocarbon components by microbiology  in medical wastewater- Medical wastewater of hospitals in Vietnam is at the ratio of low BOD/N-T  as compared with living wastewater - Compared with standard organic medical wastewater to design the processing equipment from Japan, Germany and Taiwan , the hospital wastewater in Vietnam is “missing” BOD, COD and “excessing” Nitrogen- The cause of lacking BOD, COD in wastewater in Vietnam’s hospitals is due to the anaerobic decomposition process of hydrocarbons into CH4 in septic tanks in the hospitals. - The technologies of Vietnam  are backward compared to the world. Specifically, according to the diagram of developing medical wastewater treatment technologies in hospitals and medical facilities by activated sludge, the technologies in Vietnam just stand at processing hydrocarbons, i.e. BOD, COD, with less attention to the denitrification problem, including ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen, i.e. corresponding to the technologies in years of 1960-1970 of the world- Lacking the processing of reducing Nitrate and total nitrogen - No clear role in the anaerobic process in reducing other polluted components such as phosphorus, heavy metals, substances and chemical sterilization of medical waste from specialized hospitals and medical facilities- Never giving a scientific basis to combine the process of anaerobic, anoxic and oxic process in medical wastewater treatment in the particular cases. Not paying much attention to the characteristics of the discharge and in accordance with the conditions of the infrastructure of hospitals and medical facilities- Unsustainable and unsynchronous status of devices, much dependent on awareness and knowledge of the operator.- Comments are consistent with survey results from 250 objective hospitals and medical facilities highlighted that the efficiency is not high  and approximately 65-70 percent handling chemical and physical parametersBasis for choosing technologies for medical wastewater treatment includes:- Ability to perform medical wastewater treatment meeting the requirements of NTR 28: 2010 by MONRE – Column A- Meeting the flow and discharge mode, the nature of the input wastewater, in accordance with operating conditions of hospitals and medical facilities- In accordance with the conditions of land, location and infrastructure of works of the hospital, there is flexibility in installation and operation, not causing secondary pollution - There is reasonable investment policies and operating costs- Ensuring stable and sustainable operation, less dependent on human factors- Technology in line with the level of development of the world and regionsThe microbial technology selected to handle medical wastewater for hospitals and medical facilities in Vietnam meets the economic criteria and techniques mentioned above to integrate the anaerobic, anoxic and oxic processes -- referred to as the AAO. This technology should be implemented in the flexible modular device with appropriate capacity, carefully calculated to hospitals and medical facilitiesThe approach to deal with AAO applied in our country demonstrates superiority versus other technologies capable of handling contaminated medical wastewater in hospitals, meeting satisfactory output in NTR 28: 2009/BTNMTThrough practical activities in Vietnam from 2008-today the treatment plants have confirmed the effectiveness of the technical, environmental and social as well as economic efficiency , occupying less space, not causing secondary pollution, especially with durability, reliability, and stability.

More than 205 ships stationed in Korea were also excluded from quarantine control despite the detection of one or more pathogens, as they left the country before the test result was available. In one case, a Chinese ship, which entered a local port Aug. 18, 2014 in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, was found to have been contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus on Aug. 22. The port authorities were only notified of the test results on Aug. 26. By that time, the ship had already visited Yeosu port in South Jeolla Province, Pyeongtaek port in Gyeonggi Province and Ulsan port. It left for Japan on Aug. 31. Vibrio Vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus are designated as first-grade pathogens alongside Salmonella. Once a pathogen is detected, the National Quarantine Stations is supposed to immediately input information into the online quarantine system and notify the regional quarantine office for monitoring. The eight public quarantine offices, however, were found to have delayed online updates for more half of the cases in which a virus had been detected.Upon the audit, the Health Ministry ordered the disease prevention body and the quarantine office to come up with measures to monitor the quarantine status and movement of ships that contain viruses.

The plastic also works as a protection from weeds. Despite serious environmental issues such as soil pollution, the number of farmers abandoning used sheets of plastic on the ground have been consistently high.“Although plastic sheets used among farmers here are mostly made of polyethylene, which is less harmful and does not release dioxine, it still hampers the growth of crops since it can block waterways underneath the ground, and plus, the plastic film is nonbiodegradable,” said an official at North Jeolla Province‘s environment and livestock deparment. Local government officials collect abandoned vinyl waste in a field in a rural town in North Jeolla Province. YonhapAccording to Korea Environment Corp., a unit which runs a plastic waste collection service, a total of 180,000 tons of plastic waste were collected in 2014, slightly more than half of the total amount of used plastic nationwide that year.The amount of collected plastic waste has been steadily increasing, though it is still far less than the amount produced, data showed.By province, Gangwon Province collected 23,400 tons of plastic waste in 2015, up 14 percent from the 20,430 tons collected in 2013. North Gyeongsang Province saw a 25 percent increase in plastic waste, collecting 34,728 tons of it in 2015 compared to 25,919 tons in 2013. Korea Environment Corp. cited as the reason the lack of recycling centers in rural towns, which makes it more difficult for residents to gather and remove plastic waste. As of 2015, there were 320 recycling centers in rural towns in North Gyeongsang Province, while 328 more will be added by the end of the year, according to the province.North Jeolla Province is also adding 34 more recycling centers to its current 93. Analysts said the local governments’ budget constraints also hampers the collection of plastic waste. “The government should distribute more of the budget to local government offices to run plastic waste collecting services, since with the current amount of collected plastic waste, the recycling process costs more than the collected waste itself,” professor Lee Hak-seong from the University of Ulsan told The Korea Herald.“Residents should be informed of the reasons why used plastic should be disposed of at designated recycling centers, and what it does to land when left on the ground,” he added.

But cutthroat competition has prompted some agencies to offer very cheap package programs that include filthy rooms and expensive options, and often force tourists to drop by several souvenir shops to reap commissions.The number of Chinese tourists visiting South Korea fell 2.3 percent on-year to 5.98 million in 2015, hit by a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak.South Korea aims to attract 8 million Chinese tourists this year by offering various specialized tour packages in fashion, beauty, culture and leisure; adopting eased visa regulations; and expanding air routes between the two nations.","chinese travelers and revoked licenses ,tourists visiting south korea fell ,million chinese tourists this year ,revoked licenses of 40 percent ,korea has canceled the licenses","['South Korea', 'chinese', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism', 'chinese', 'chinese', 'Korea', 'Kim Jong - deok', 'Chinese', 'korean', 'asian', 'chinese', 'South Korea', 'a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'South Korea', 'chinese']",17,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5781039   0.62762076

136,136,Unusual problems with Korean public toilets,"When Jen Kim, a Korean-American in her 20s, went to use a public restroom inside a local cafe franchise in Ilsan two years ago, she couldn’t help but notice a trash can that was overflowing with used toilet paper that emitted an unbearable odor.  “I left the stall immediately, telling myself I would rather hold it in and risk getting a urinary tract syndrome than use that bathroom,” she told The Korea Herald.On ...","When Jen Kim, a Korean-American in her 20s, went to use a public restroom inside a local cafe franchise in Ilsan two years ago, she couldn’t help but notice a trash can that was overflowing with used toilet paper that emitted an unbearable odor.  “I left the stall immediately, telling myself I would rather hold it in and risk getting a urinary tract syndrome than use that bathroom,” she told The Korea Herald.On the door of the stall, there was a sign that asked users not to flush toilet paper down the toilet. This is a common sight in Korea where public restrooms often have such signs, along with waste bins piled high with soiled toilet paper.  A public bathroom stall in Seoul has a sign that asks users not to flush waste paper down the toilet, and to discard them in trash cans instead, as water pressure is low. It is an occurrence that has peeved American expat Michael Hurt for a long time. The research professor at Korea University has been living in South Korea since 1994. “The practice of putting one’s wastepaper into a basket is completely unhygienic and unsanitary,” he told The Korea Herald. “And it’s interesting that during the MERS  scare recently and the SARS  outbreak before that, one of the  emphasis became that of hygiene and reducing transmission of viruses and bacteria. But little thought was given to the fact that feces smeared all over paper sitting out in open-air containers is also pretty problematic.”Many signs in bathroom stalls explain that the water pressure of the flushing system is low. Hence patrons are asked to toss wastepaper into a bin instead. However, according to Pyo Hye-ryeong, who heads a nongovernmental organization that advocates sanitary public bathroom facilities, water pressure is rarely a cause of clogging in public bathrooms in South Korea. “According to our research findings, most clogging cases in public bathrooms occur because people flush random objects down the toilet, including food garbage,” said Pyo, who represents the Citizens’ Coalition for Restroom Culture. “Toilet paper manufactured nowadays rarely makes toilets clog because it dissolves in water in about 30 seconds.”Random items clogging up the pipes include socks, leggings, used baby diapers and sanitary napkins. Jen Kim also had a similar experience in a public bathroom inside a cafe in Ilsan, where she saw a sign that asked patrons not to flush outrageous items, including condoms and socks. The sign in fact had actual pictures of toilets clogged with leggings and what appeared to be somebody’s pants, she said. “Having learned that some patrons would go as far as trying to flush their pants down the toilet, I understand the logic that having people toss toilet paper into the bin lowers the risk of clogging,” said Kim.The practice of throwing out used toilet paper into trash cans began here in the late 1980s, after the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics, according to Baek Chung-yeop, an official at the Ministry of the Interior. Before the Olympics here, nearly 70 percent of all public bathrooms in Seoul had squat toilets without plumbing systems, he said. A public bathroom stall in Seoul with a separate trash can for used toilet paper. “The government replaced as many squat toilets with flush toilets as possible in 1988, because they didn’t want to give a bad impression to visitors during the games,” said Baek, who oversees public bathroom policies at the ministry.He added, “So now we had these flush toilets, but toilet paper that was being produced at the time didn’t really dissolve in water well. As they often clogged toilets, people started using separate trash cans in the stalls.”Pyo from the CCRC claimed the practice that continues to this day can be a threat to public health. She has been advocating for public bathrooms that do not have such trash cans since the 1990s. “Very often the trash cans are not emptied frequently enough,” she said. “Sometimes they remain piled up in a closed space for more than 10 hours. Anyone with common sense wouldn’t think such an environment is in any way hygienic.”When asked by The Korea Herald about the potential health risks of such trash bins, physicians at the Samsung Medical Center said that one’s chance of contracting an infectious disease is low, unless a person directly touches the used toilet paper. While Cho Eun-hee, a high-ranking official at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agreed with these doctors, she also noted that children are particularly vulnerable in public bathrooms with piled-up wastepaper.“Kids are curious and you never know what they would touch in stalls of public bathrooms,” said the director of infectious disease surveillance division of the KCDC.  “The worst-case scenario would be someone -- or a kid -- accidentally and unknowingly touches the wastepaper, doesn’t wash their hands and eats something with their unwashed hands. One may contract a number of waterborne diseases this way.”Lee Jang-hoon, professor at Kwangwoon University’s environmental engineering program, said trash cans are also one of the major causes of bad odors. Lee explained that Korean bathrooms are already vulnerable to bad odors, as more than 80 percent of properties in Seoul use septic tanks, small-scale sewage systems that treat and dispose of household wastewater on site. In North America, only about 25 percent of the population relies on septic tanks, mostly in rural areas that lack connection to public sewage pipes. “Septic tanks were introduced to Korea by the Japanese in the 1920s, during the colonial era,” Lee said. “At the time, the Japanese were using the septic system instead of the public sewage system, and as a result, Korea ended up using the same thing. As septic tank odor is a common problem, Japan has switched to the public sewage system over the last 30 years. Korea is just beginning to realize the problem. We have this trash can problem, on top of the septic system problem.”The South Korean government has only started taking notice of the problem in recent years. It is gradually making changes to public bathrooms nationwide. In 2013, the Ministry of the Interior began removing wastepaper bins from bathroom stalls in state-run facilities. This included all Seoul subway stations along lines 5 to 9. The government has also begun switching its campaign from telling people not to flush anything down the toilet to telling them to only discard toilet paper. Seoul City Hall, the building of the Gyeonggi Provincial government and Suwon City Hall have removed all trash cans from their bathrooms. “Our ultimate goal is to remove trash cans from all public bathrooms across Seoul,” said Kim Woo-gyeom, who works in the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s public health bureau. Above all, Pyo from CCRC said that what South Korea needs is public decency. “The thing is, people wouldn’t flush their socks down the toilet at home, because once it clogs, they’ll have to fix it on their own,” she said. “Those who flush such outrageous items do it partially because they know somebody else will have to deal with it.”By Claire Lee  Kim Da-sol contributed to this article.—Ed.","discard toilet paper seoul city ,trash cans from their bathrooms ,public bathrooms said the director ,all public bathrooms in seoul ,only discard toilet paper seoul","['Jen Kim', 'korean - American', 'Ilsan', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'american', 'Michael Hurt', 'Korea University', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Pyo Hye - ryeong', 'South Korea', 'Pyo', 'toilet', 'Jen Kim', 'Ilsan', 'Kim', 'Baek Chung - yeop', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Baek', 'ccrc', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Samsung Medical Center', 'Cho Eun - hee', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'KCDC', 'Jang - hoon', 'Kwangwoon University ’s', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Japanese', 'Lee', 'Japanese', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'Seoul', 'Seoul City Hall', 'Gyeonggi provincial', 'Suwon City Hall', 'Seoul', 'Kim Woo - gyeom', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s', 'Pyo', 'CCRC', 'South Korea', 'Claire Lee', 'Kim Da - sol']",9,"[ 0.          6.          0.         ... -0.54551435  0.18926215

According to Chung-Ang University’s Green River Research Center, a large number of toads are killed every year in Yangjaecheon Stream in southern Seoul, especially near the paddy field. In the 1,400-square-meter rice paddy near Yanjaecheon Stream, about 3,000 to 4,000 toads breed every year. However, this number has dropped sharply, mainly due to the bike and pedestrian roads that have been constructed between the paddy field and the adjacent hill. Toads are official “indicator species” and their numbers can show the level of ecological risk and climate change. Residing usually near wetlands, toads look for water bodies in early March during breeding season. Grown-up toads soon return to nearby hills in April and May whereas baby toads find homes on their own in October. Roadkill happens the most during the moving season in spring and October, researchers said. “Although the exact number is difficult to count, only about 20 percent of the toads succeeded in returning to their home after breeding in the paddy fields. The rest are killed because of many reasons such as by bikes, pedestrians or ducks,” said environmental and plant engineering professor Kim Jin-hong who headed the research team. The paddy field in the middle of the stream was built two decades ago for children’s ecology courses on rice farming. However, it also became a breeding site for toads living in the adjacent hill. In order to secure the travel route and safety of toads, Gangnam-gu Office installed 20 ecological corridors under the bike and pedestrian roads in 2013, along with a 204-meter-long guard fence to better lead them to use the corridors. Through monitoring the movement of toads with a camera for the past year, the research team found that many toads were still exposed to the risk of becoming roadkill as they did not use the ecological corridors effectively. “Toads were still moving through the bike and pedestrian roads instead of the corridors. Many bicyclists and pedestrians do not notice them as toads usually move at night. The dead toads are also often removed quickly by ducks or other birds,” said Yoon Deok-soo, the president of civic group People for Protecting Yangjaecheon Stream. Entrances to the ecological corridor had also previously been challenging for toads to use, he added. The amphibians had to climb up a slight step to enter the corridor, which would have been tough for baby toads. As part of efforts to better guide amphibian animals to move through the safe corridors, the district office independently installed a new ecological corridor that is wider by twofold than the original ones and without the small step. The research team said it would continue to monitor the effectiveness of the new corridor. Yangjeachoen Stream is not the only habitat in the capital for amphibious species.  A man walks over the ecological corridor on a pedestrian pathway at Yangjaecheon Stream in southern Seoul. Gangseo-gu in western Seoul is the only district in the capital where three legally protected amphibian species reside. They are the narrow-mouthed toad, the Korean golden frog and Suweon tree frog. The Gangseo Wetland in a public park near the Hangang River is the largest home for narrow-mouthed toads in the city. Like other amphibians, narrow-mouthed toads gather and reproduce in water bodies in summer and move back to dry areas for hibernation in October. Amphibians that have become roadkill are most spotted around late May when they move to water bodies, and in September and October when they return to dry areas, environmentalists said. According to environment group Mulpure Ecoeducation Center’s monitoring report, 500,000 out of 850,000 narrow-mouthed toads were killed on a 100-meter bike road in the park between 2011 and 2012.The deaths have declined over the past few years as sufficient rainfall allowed the species to move faster. But ecological corridors are still essential for the species, experts said. “The fact that there are no ecological corridors under the bike roads show that the city did not consider the importance of ecological factors when constructing infrastructures for humans,” said MEC’s coordinator Park Jae-seon. With the public increasingly calling for the conservation of narrow-mouth toads, the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Monday decided to build ecological corridors at the wetland. “ asked the MEC for recommendations for corridor-needed spots at the wetland. The installment will be finished no later than May, considering the moving season of the amphibian animals,” said a city official. Seoul City, however, has no further plans to install ecological corridors along the side of the Hangang River. At the river, which is an important habitat for many species, bike roads measuring 70 kilometers in total, have been installed and none of them have ecological corridors. Seoul City is not the only municipality with a lack of ecological corridors. According to the Environment Ministry, only 17 ecological corridors have been installed across the country as of this year, with none of them in Seoul. Yangjaecheon Stream’s ecological corridor is not counted, a ministry official said. “The number does not reflect all corridors installed as the ministry only counts those reported by the cities. At least more than 17 corridors are estimated to have been installed in the country,” said a ministry official in charge of managing the ecological corridors. The government should come up with comprehensive measures to protect species which live near the bike roads as more cities gear up to build roads that cater to human needs, experts said. “There is a need for the government to check the ecological conditions of areas first whenever it plans to construct bike or pedestrian roads at rivers and streams, and come up with measures on how to maintain ecological conditions for animal species. So far, there is no consideration for species at all,” professor Kim Jin-hong said.By Lee Hyun-jeong","toads are killed every year ,000 toads breed every year ,of toads are killed every ,more amphibians are being killed ,toads breed every year however","['Yangjaecheon Stream', 'Seoul', 'Chung - Ang University ’s Green River Research Center', 'Yangjaecheon Stream', 'Seoul', 'Yanjaecheon Stream', 'Kim Jin - hong', 'Gangnam - gu Office', 'Yoon Deok - soo', 'People for protect Yangjaecheon Stream', 'Yangjeachoen Stream', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'amphibian', 'Mulpure Ecoeducation Center ’s', 'MEC', 'Park Jae - seon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government', 'MEC', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul City', 'the Environment Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Yangjaecheon Stream ’s', 'Kim Jin - hong', 'Lee Hyun - jeong']",5,"[ 0.          5.          0.         ... -0.74339247  1.14719605

According to the report, children of undocumented immigrants were especially vulnerable to social isolation as well as lack of basic medical care. Children who were born overseas and moved to Korea as one of their parents married a Korean national often experienced bullying at school because of their physical appearance and language barriers, the report also showed. A significant number of them were under financial difficulties and were unable to pay for lunch and other school-related fees. 123RFArticle 2 of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which South Korea signed in 1990, states that every child’s rights to education and protection must be ensured regardless of the parent’s or legal guardian’s race, sex, religion or national, ethnic or social origin, among other factors. Article 8 of the convention also states that if a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, “State Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to reestablishing speedily his or her identity.” However, cases featured in the latest report showed that children of illegal immigrants were experiencing systemic exclusion in Korea’s education and medical system. One of the children was denied by Kukkiwon, the World Taekwondo Headquarters, when he applied to take a domestic promotion test, because he was stateless and did not have an official ID. Another child, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was unable to receive necessary social and medical benefits. As a non-national, he had been denied acknowledgement as a person with disability. According to lawmaker Jasmine Lee of the ruling Saenuri Party, it is estimated that some 20,000 stateless children are currently residing in South Korea. Lee, who is the first non-ethnic Korean to become a lawmaker here, proposed a bill that would allow the birth registration of children born in South Korea to one or more parents who are illegal immigrants. The proposal, which has received negative responses from some civic groups, is currently pending at the National Assembly. Lee also published a book in January, which comprised her thoughts on South Korea‘s current policies on multiculturalism. In the book, she suggested establishing a ”control tower“ -- a single government agency that would oversee all immigration policies -- to promote diversity while tackling the country’s low birthrate effectively.“There are currently 14 government ministries and agencies that deal with immigration policies,” she said in the book. “We need a single agency that will develop effective policies for the next 20 to 30 years to come.”By Claire Lee","korean national often experienced bullying ,residents in south korea suffer ,korea suffer from racial discrimination ,bullying at school because of ,undocumented immigrants were especially vulnerable","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'korean', 'the U.N.

Among the cases, the largest number of them, at 31, involved using Zolpidem. When the drug is taken with a large amount of alcohol, dangerous side effects including loss of consciousness, memory loss, and impaired judgement and thinking may occur.YonhapDrug-facilitated sexual violence refers to those involving alcohol or drugs that are used to compromise an individual’s ability to consent to sexual activities. The substances are often abused by perpetrators to reduce a victim’s ability to resist and to prevent them from remembering the abuse. In South Korea, it is illegal to obtain Zolpidem without a prescription from a doctor. However, it has been frequently reported by the police that the drug is being manufactured and sold illegally online. The second largest number of the drug-facilitated sexual abuse cases, at 21, involved the use of lorazepam and alprazolam, medications often used to treat anxiety disorders. The drugs are known to induce sleep, relax muscles and interfere with new memory formation. Also, 19 cases involved the use of chlorphenamin, a drug commonly used to prevent allergic symptoms such as skin rash. The drug is also known to reduce fear-related behaviors. The number of reported sexual violence cases have been steadily on the rise in South Korea since 2009. According to Gender Ministry data, the number of cases increased from 17,242 in 2009 to 29,517 in 2014. According to the study by the National Forensic Service, 48 percent of the drug-facilitated sexual abuse victims were those between 20 and 29 years old.

Some family members of the nine passengers who remain unaccounted have stayed in a makeshift residence set up at Paengmok harbor in Jindo.While the divers on the salvage team have attempted to set up nets on each entrance and window of Sewol, some areas remain inaccessible, leading officials to believe that the best option is to surround the entire ship. A total of 36 sections of metal fence will be sent to the site, and will be assembled underwater and attached to the seabed. The shipments are expected to go through customs in the adjacent Mokpo Harbor on Monday.Officials said that simulation proved the fences would withstand the area’s strong currents that have hindered salvage operations.

A total of 124 South Korean companies have been operating in the zone, some 50 kilometers northwest of Seoul, employing more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.The estimated financial damage breaks down to some 569 billion won in investment and facilities, and some 245 billion won in inventory.The association said any potential losses stemming from compensation to their customers and the stoppage of their operations was not included in the tally.According to the association, 49 companies largely rely on their factories in the industrial park for their production.""Actual damage should be counted more accurately, and will be revealed later,"" it said.South Korean companies at the inter-Korean industrial park have been urging their government to roll out full support measures as their losses from the park's shutdown are unimaginable.When the industrial park was closed in 2013 for 160 days, South Korean firms reported a combined loss of 1.05 trillion won.The companies, however, claim the actual damage will be greater considering the loss of business partners and credibility.""We strongly demand that the government fully compensate our losses in investment and other assets as insurance coverage is very limited,"" it said.In order to minimize South Korean firms' possible losses, the country's financial regulator earlier said it would provide financial aid to the firms operating there.The complex, which opened in 2004, had served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North, while South Korea had benefited from cheap but skilled North Korean labor. The complex had been recognized as an exception to Seoul's sanctions against Pyongyang designed to punish it for the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010.","sinking of south korean warship ,the park shutdown are unimaginable ,pyongyang rocket launch the shutdown ,815 billion won in losses ,the sinking of south korean","['south korean', 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'the Kaesong Industrial Complex', 'Pyongyang', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'south korean', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.08627755  0.33889401

The government has said the Asian tiger mosquito has been cited for the spread of the virus, and that its control efforts will be centered on this insect. The tiger mosquito becomes active around May.""A total of 39 areas that can breed large numbers of mosquitoes will be checked from March through October,"" it said. The number of regions to be checked is up by 17 compared to 2015, with insect control measures to be implemented within the month, much earlier than April, which has been the norm in the past.Seoul declared the Zika virus a legal infectious disease on Jan. 29, with the World Health Organization saying it is a global health emergency after it spread rapidly through several Latin American countries.The Zika virus is almost always non-fatal, causing only mild symptoms like fevers, joint and muscle pain, headaches and bloodshot eyes.

South Korea designated it a legal infectious disease late last month.""At the moment, there is an extremely low chance of the virus spreading in South Korea, but the mosquito-borne virus can spread under the right conditions,"" Yoon In-kyu, director of the Dengue Vaccine Initiative at the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, said in a interview with Yonhap News Agency. Seoul said earlier that with no mosquitoes to help spread the virus, the risk of an outbreak in the winter is nonexistent. But it cautioned that the situation could change when mosquitoes become active in summer, vowing to beef up monitoring at airports and keep tabs on people coming from Zika outbreak regions.The Zika virus is almost always non-fatal, causing only mild symptoms like fever, joint and muscle pain, headaches and bloodshot eyes. On the other hand, the virus can cause microcephaly, a debilitating condition that causes a baby to be born with an abnormally small head and brain.Yoon, who studied the Zika virus when he worked in Thailand and the Philippines, pointed out that if a mosquito bites an infected person and then goes on to bite another, the disease can be transmitted. Scientists have said the virus can survive in the blood stream for some time and can even be transmitted through sexual intercourse.The virologist said South Korea needs to be on guard to prevent conditions from becoming favorable over the course of several years.""An unexpected outbreak of dengue fever in the middle of Tokyo in 2014 is a classic case of a virus becoming active over time,"" he said.The fever was the first known outbreak in 70 years and forced Japanese authorities to put Yoyogi Park off limits until health workers killed off insect colonies with pesticide.Yoon said that the Zika virus has some 70 percent genetic commonality with dengue and are both transmitted by mosquitoes. ""While diseases like Zika, Chikungunya and dengue, were usually limited to certain regions in the past, they have started spreading in recent years,"" he said.The scientist, who works for an organization dedicated to developing drugs that counter disease in developing countries, said that while it is similar to dengue, the medical community just does not have enough data to make headway on a vaccine.

In an emergency meeting chaired by Health Minister Chung Chin-youb in Seoul, health authorities and medical professionals agreed to strengthen blood safety measures at all medical facilities nationwide, banning those who have traveled to Zika-affected countries from donating blood for at least 30 days upon their return to Korea, as well as coming up with more efficient and scientific methods to control mosquitos before the summer months arrive.They also agreed to release guidelines for pregnant women, who are considered to be the most vulnerable to the virus, as soon as possible.“Although the possibility of the Zika virus spreading in South Korea is very low -- as no mosquitos are active during the winter months -- we will make sure we are fully prepared and equipped to deal with the virus should it spread in the country,” Chung said during the meeting. WHO on Monday issued a worldwide warning that the Zika virus -- transmitted through an infected mosquito that causes mild symptoms such as fever -- is a global public health emergency that requires a united response. The agency claimed the infection has been linked to cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. The specific warning -- officially titled “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” -- has been issued by WHO only three times before, for the 2014 outbreak of Ebola, the 2009 pandemic of swine flu and the 2014 resurgence of polio after its near eradication. When asked about WHO’s decision, Jeong Eun-kyung, acting head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the current situation was alarming worldwide, especially because there are no vaccines or rapid and reliable diagnostic tests available.“Also, most people in newly affected countries are not immune to the particular virus,” Jeong said. “This means a very large number of people can be infected in a very short period of time.” Jeong Eun-kyung, acting head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks during a meeting to discuss measures to prevent the spread of the Zika virus in Seoul on Tuesday. The KCDC and medical experts explained that there is currently no possible way to prevent the virus from being transmitted to a fetus if the mother has been infected. The only preventive action a pregnant woman can take is to protect herself from mosquito bites, such as by wearing long clothing and treating the clothes with insecticide. The KCDC also strongly advised that pregnant women and those considering becoming pregnant may want to postpone travel to countries where Zika is circulating, including Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and Barbados. Kwon Ja-young, an associate professor of gynecology at Yonsei University College of Medicine, said should a pregnant women be diagnosed with the virus, she should take an ultrasound test every three weeks throughout her entire pregnancy. “The tests are purely for diagnostic purposes,” she said. “There are currently no ways to treat infected fetuses. However, not all pregnant women who have been infected with the Zika virus give birth to babies with underdeveloped brains.”Although the risk of the Zika virus being transmitted through blood transfusion is low, the KCDC is banning those who have visited the Zika-affected countries -- the list can be found at the KCDC website at www.cdc.go.kr -- from donating blood for at least 30 days after their return to Korea.The agency also advised travelers who visited Zika-affected countries to use condoms for 30 days after returning home. “We believe the virus stays in the body for about two weeks,” Jeong from the KCDC said. “We advise travelers to take precautionary actions for at least 30 days upon their return.”By Claire Lee","virus in seoul on tuesday ,tuesday to prevent possible outbreak ,ban blood donations from travelers ,of ebola the 2009 pandemic ,control mosquitos before the summer","['South Korea ’s', 'Zika', 'the World Health Organization', 'Health', 'Chung Chin - youb', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Zika', 'South Korea', 'Chung', 'Zika', 'who', 'Jeong Eun - kyung', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Jeong', 'Jeong Eun - kyung', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Seoul', 'KCDC', 'KCDC', 'Zika', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Thailand', 'Yonsei University College of Medicine', 'KCDC', 'KCDC', 'Korea', 'Jeong', 'KCDC', 'Claire Lee']",9,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.22889408  0.51885742

A biopharmaceutical, simply known as a biologic, is any medical product extracted from or manufactured with biological sources. Examples of biologics include gene therapy, allergenic products, vaccines and blood components. Currently, there are about 7,000 biological medicines in development around the world. Many of them have the potential to provide new treatments or even cures for diseases that have no or few treatment options, such as immunological disorders, diabetes, HIV, mental health disorders and infectious diseases, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America. Interior Minister Hong Yun-sik speaks during a briefing on the government‘s New Year policy plans ahead of the presidential meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. Also in attendance were representatives of the ministries of justice, environment, public safety, government legislation and food and drug safety. YonhapSouth Korea has been making continuous efforts to break into the global biopharmaceutical market, aiming to produce a total of nine new biologics that can be distributed worldwide by the year 2020. Last year, South Korean pharmaceutical companies together earned 9.3 trillion won  exporting drug development technologies, seeting a benchmark as the country's most so far.Earlier this month, Korean firm Samsung Bioepis announced that their product Benepali -- a biosimilar referencing Enbrel, also known as SB4 -- for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, had been approved by the European Commission.Also earlier this month, Korean firm Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical signed a technology licensing agreement with Japan’s Fuji Pharma Co. for its second-generation biosimilar named “CKD-11101” for anemia. Based on the agreement, Fuji has agreed to exclusively supply the drug in Japan after clinical trials. Shoppers browse through cosmetic products at the Lotte World Tower Duty Free in Seoul. YonhapOn top of shortening the review period for biologics for rare and incurable diseases, the KFDS said it will provide government consultations for firms that are developing cell therapy products, vaccines and new biosimilars on ways to export their products efficiently and successfully.To reach its goal to come up with nine new biologics to be manufactured and distributed globally, the government is currently reviewing a total of 75 projects that can treat diabetes and high blood pressure, among others. The KFDS also announced deregulation measures for the nation’s cosmetics industry, including a plan to establish a regulation-free complex for cosmetics products in Osong, North Chungcheong Province. Within the zones of this complex, cosmetics makers will be allowed to develop products and perform experiments with eased regulations, the officials said.“In the regulation-free complex, cosmetics sellers who have not registered themselves as manufacturers will be allowed to produce and sell their products,” said Lee Seong-min from the KFDS. The officials, however, did not offer details on how to control the operation or what exact type of cosmetic companies would be able to join the complex.The measures also included allowing cosmetics firms to run hair salons and other beauty services.  Also, moisturizers and creams that specifically target individuals who have atopic diseases will now be allowed to be manufactured and sold. Previously, cosmetics products were not allowed to indicate that they were for individuals with atopic diseases unless they were medicines produced by approved pharmaceutical companies. According to KFDS, South Korean cosmetics companies together made 1.9 trillion won by exporting their products overseas in 2014, up from 290 billion won in 2005.

It follows a daylong provisional quarantine of the area issued Wednesday. The ministry added that the ban was provisional and could be extended. It is also mulling whether to apply the quarantine to the neighboring provinces of South Chungcheong and South Jeolla. Korean law stipulates that if a livestock-related infection risks breaking out and proliferating, the agriculture minister or the head of a regional government is entitled to ban such livestock or related products from leaving the region. Those who violate the measure can face up to one year in prison or 10 million won  in fine. “The measure was unavoidable to prevent foot-and-mouth disease from spreading and to ensure that it is rooted out in its early stages,” said Lee Jun-won, head of the Agriculture Ministry’s food industry policy office.The outbreak, which started Monday in Gimje and Wednesday at Gochang, has resulted in mass culling of 670 and 9,800 pigs in the two cities, respectively. It marked the first local occurrences eight months of the infectious disease, which affects cloven-hoofed animals.

A progressive lawyers’ group claimed that the deal was invalid according to international law, while other experts pointed out that the agreement between two governments carries legal obligations. Some also questioned the agreement as conflicting with domestic laws.“Putting aside the contents, the deal itself has no legally binding power according to international law, as there was no exchange of documents or letters,” Song Ki-ho, from the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, told The Korea Herald. “Therefore, the deal with Japan is not a legal treaty.” He cited the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties -- regulating international law on treaties between states -- which stipulates that a treaty is defined as an agreement concluded between countries in written form and governed by international law. The remarks came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there was no exchange of documents or letters for the deal between Tokyo and Seoul. The lawyers’ group earlier requested the authorities disclose the written form of the agreement to see whether the deal could be seen as a legally binding treaty. In the diplomatic deal defined as “final and irreversible” by both countries, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised Japan would pay 1 billion yen  to a foundation for the 46 surviving victims. In return, Seoul promised not to raise the issue again on the world stage if Tokyo fulfills its commitments. The deal has faced public backlash, with claims the government failed to fully represent the interests of the victims for the sake of hastily reaching an agreement.  Citizens and civic activists hold a press conference calling for annulment of the Dec. 28 Korea-Japan agreement on sex slavery in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap“Both governments appeared to declare the resolution of the issue in the form of international promise or assurance, but the sex slavery issue in nature cannot be solved irreversibly and finally,” Song said. “The South Korean government has no right to declare the final and irreversible resolution of the issue.”The United Nations’ General Assembly passed a resolution on the basic principles for the victims of human rights violations in 2005, making it an international responsibility to protect war crime victims’ honor and rights to compensation. “As the agreement is not legally effective, Korea has no duty to stick to it and the nation can anytime withdraw from the settlement,” he said. But Cho Jung-hyun, a law professor from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, pointed out that the deal might not be a treaty under international law, but both governments have legal responsibility to follow it. “Though not in written form, the two governments officially announced the settlement,” Cho told The Korea Herald. “So they have legal obligation to abide by the settlement based on diplomatic trust.”“But the scope of the government’s authority can be questioned,” he said. “The deal might mean that two countries agreed to end the dispute over the sex slavery issue once and for all at the national level. But it would not necessarily mean that the Korean government will stop individuals from raising the issue and demanding compensation.” Lee Chang-hee, an honorary law professor from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, took issue with the deal’s binding power under domestic law as well. “The agreement was made between foreign ministries without consulting the National Assembly,” Lee said. “If the agreement were to be legally binding in the country, the parliament should approve it.”Citing the Constitutional Court’s ruling in 2011, the senior scholar criticized the government for dodging its responsibility to take action on behalf of the victims forced into sexual servitude for the Japanese military. In the ruling, the top court said that the government violated the constitutional rights of the victims by failing to address them on the world stage and help them in getting compensation from Japan.

Spike glycoprotein is the element of the virus that can penetrate a living human cell and proliferate.The revelation marks the first time the KCDC acknowledged a mutation had occurred. The public health and safety agency, while acknowledging the variation occurred, pointed out that the genetic difference with the sample from a past outbreak in Saudi Arabia stood at just 0.1 percent.""A mutation did take place, but its is doubtful that it could have meaningfully altered the capability of the virus to spread from person to person and its ability to make people sick,"" an official said.The respiratory disease that was first confirmed on May 20 and brought into the country by a person who visited the Middle East, claimed 38 lives before the government officially declared the country free of MERS on Dec. 23. A total of 187 people were infected overall, with thousands more placed under quarantine as a precautionary measure.In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease reached 20 percent, which is not as high as the 30-40 percent numbers reported for past outbreaks. Most deaths in the country were of elderly people and those already suffering from underlying diseases.The agency said, however, that they cannot determine if the changes detected altered the way the virus spread.""All we know for certain is that a variation occurred, with more detailed analysis needed to see what affect it had on the spread,"" a state researcher said. He said that while the initial tests were conducted on a limited number of patients, research is underway to screen clinical specimens from 32 people that will help shed better light on the matter.Related to the findings that were posted in the January edition of the U.S. Emerging Infectious Diseases magazine, Paik Soon-young, a professor of microbiology at the Catholic University of Korea, said the spike glycoprotein mutation is important and can explain why the MERS disease, which was not overly infectious in the Middle East, spread so quickly in South Korea.""There is a need to focus the country's research capability on finding the reason for the change,"" he said.The government said that while the disease no longer poses a threat to public health, authorities will carefully monitor developments and take immediate action if the need arises.","korea last year underwent mutation ,taken from eight people infected ,last year underwent mutation that ,in south korea the fatality ,government said friday the korea","['the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Spike', 'KCDC', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Korea', 'the U.S. emerge Infectious Diseases', 'the Catholic University of Korea', 'South Korea']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59362197  0.55760753

""The current situation is almost as serious as in 2009 when the country struggled to cope with the Influenza A scare.""Because a lot of soldiers are stationed in these areas, the lifting of the ban can allow collective blood drives in military barracks that can push up reserve numbers quickly, he said.According to the ministry and the Korea National Red Cross, there is usually a drop in blood reserves during the winter, although last year it was more severe.The outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and mumps in some schools hurt blood drives, it said.The ministry said that all blood collected from malaria-prone areas will be kept in cold storage for 14 days which will allow it to be tested.  The 14 day period will allow all malaria parasites to die making the blood safe for transfusion. In the event the temporary lifting of the ban does not do enough, the government can expand the waiver period.While the national reserve has fallen, frontline hospitals are still reporting 4-5 days of blood, so ordinary people need not be overly concerned, the ministry said.""The national reserve is maintained as a precautionary measure to cope with emergency situations,"" it said.","health concerns most malaria cases ,korea will temporarily allow blood ,some schools hurt blood drives ,public health concerns most malaria ,blood collected from malaria prone","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'the Korea National Red Cross']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2298898   0.33001605

162,162,Mutation detected in S. Korean MERS virus: government,"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus that spread through South Korea last year underwent a mutation that could have affected its ability to infect people and the fatality rate, the government said Friday.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said bodily fluid specimens taken from eight people infected with the MERS inducing coronavirus, showed signs of genetic mutation in spike glyc...","The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  virus that spread through South Korea last year underwent a mutation that could have affected its ability to infect people and the fatality rate, the government said Friday.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said bodily fluid specimens taken from eight people infected with the MERS inducing coronavirus, showed signs of genetic mutation in spike glycoprotein when compared with previous documented cases. Spike glycoprotein is the element of the virus that can penetrate a living human cell and proliferate. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn  looks around quarantine facilities at a hospital in Seoul in November. YonhapThe public health and safety agency said this could alter the capability of the virus to spread from person to person and its ability to make people sick. The revelation marks the first time the KCDC acknowledged a mutation had occurred. The respiratory disease that was first confirmed on May 20 and brought into the country by a person who visited the Middle East, claimed 38 lives before the government officially declared the country free of MERS on Dec. 23. A total of 187 people were infected overall, with thousands more placed under quarantine as a precautionary measure.In South Korea, the fatality rate of the disease reached 20 percent, which is not as high as the 30-40 percent numbers reported for past outbreaks. Most deaths in the country were of elderly people and those already suffering from underlying diseases.The KCDC said that compared with previous viruses, there were eight alterations to spike glycoprotein, with tests showing that the virus checked from samples even triggering changes in the cells of test animals.The latest discovery is seen as a sign that the mutation took place while MERS was spreading in the country.The agency said, however, that they cannot determine if the changes detected altered the way the virus spread.""All we know for certain is that a mutation occurred, with more detailed analysis needed to see what affect it had on the spread,""a state researcher said. He said that while the initial tests were conducted on a limited number of patients, research is underway to screen clinical specimens from 32 people that will help shed better light on the matter.Related to the findings that were posted in the January edition of the U.S. Emerging Infectious Diseases magazine, Paik Soon-young, a professor of microbiology at the Catholic University of Korea, said the spike glycoprotein mutation is important and can explain why the MERS disease, which was not overly infectious in the Middle East, spread so quickly in South Korea.""There is a need to focus the country's research capability on finding the reason for the change,"" he said.The government said that while the disease no longer poses a threat to public health, authorities will carefully monitor developments and take immediate action if the need arises.","korea last year underwent mutation ,genetic mutation in spike glycoprotein ,hospital in seoul in november ,taken from eight people infected ,the korea centers for disease","['the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Spike', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'KCDC', 'South Korea', 'KCDC', 'the U.S. emerge Infectious Diseases', 'the Catholic University of Korea', 'South Korea']",9,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.4956232   0.13304868

The Ministry of Public Safety and Security said it would provide special ambulances that are equipped with 12 emergency medical devices to 205 fire stations. In these ambulances, medical staff will be able to conduct emergency treatments, such as intubation or heart-stimulating drug injections, which are difficult to carry out in general ambulances. The special ambulances, however, require staff with emergency expertise, such as Grade-I emergency medical technicians or nurses, the authorities said.“As professional emergency treatments will be permitted in special ambulances before arriving at the hospital, it will likely raise the revival rate of emergency patients in critical condition,” the ministry’s officials said. This is part of the ministry’s move to improve emergency rescue measures. Korea is known to have a higher mortality rate for patients with treatable injuries, the ministry said. As of 2010, the death rate from treatable injuries for the country’s top 20 emergency centers recorded 35.2 percent. This is nearly double the rates of major developed countries such as the U.S., Japan and Germany, it added.Along with introducing special ambulances, the government said it would standardize ambulance provision. Currently, about 1,300 ambulances in the country run differing models according to local authority rules.It also vowed to offer psychological counseling at 30 stations to better support firefighters, who commonly become exposed to stress in disaster situations. The program will consist of mental health checkups, private counseling and comprehensive classes, officials said.The program was first introduced last year at 19 stations for some 4,700 firefighters.
