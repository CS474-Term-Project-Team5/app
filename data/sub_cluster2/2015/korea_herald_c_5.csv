The Welfare Ministry said patients visiting the top 140 emergency rooms in the country will be classified into five categories depending on the urgency and severity of their condition, and charged different fees accordingly.  Non-emergency patients who show mild symptoms such as flu will be required to shoulder all the emergency room fees on their own, while that of emergency patients will be partially covered by the national health insurance program. Until last year, all patients benefitted from partial coverage.  YonhapThe new move came as part of measures to better control infectious diseases and protect public health, after emergency room crowding was suspected as one of the culprits behind the Middle East respiratory syndrome crisis last year.A total of 88 out of 186 MERS victims were found to have been infected in emergency rooms, the ministry said.The government’s data also showed that about 80 percent of emergency room users were not in critical condition. The most common affliction of emergency room patients visiting the country’s top five hospitals was cancer, followed by open wounds, flu and acute gastroenteritis. Once patients arrive at the emergency room, medical staff will determine the urgency and severity of symptoms. If judged urgent, the patients will be given emergency treatment. If symptoms seem infectious, they will be immediately quarantined. If symptoms are mild, however, the patients will be led to different medical institutions upon their consent.Emergency room use fees will vary by hospitals, ranging from 18,000 won ($15) to 54,000 won, with larger ones costing more, the authorities said. Non-emergency patients must pay the fees even if their only treatment is a drug prescription.

Looking at their warm, puffy creations, the cooks’ beamed as they imagined them being doled out to those in need, a daily routine for the volunteers.Standing among them was Yoon Kyung-ae, an 83-year-old volunteer who has become a familiar face at the Korean Red Cross, with which she has been working every day for the past three decades.The start of her voluntary work was nothing more than a coincidence. “I still remember the first day. It was Oct. 10, 1986 right after I retired from teaching. My friend asked me if I would join a Japanese class held at the Korean Red Cross’ office. That was the beginning,” said the 83-year-old former middle school teacher.  Yoon Kyung-ae Park Hyun-koo/The Korea HeraldWhile learning Japanese at the office, Yoon gradually opened her eyes to voluntary work. She joined the organization with the aim of dedicating the rest of her life to others, she said. Her first voluntary job was offering assistance at an information desk at Seoul Red Cross Hospital. Her job gradually broadened to guiding visitors to operation rooms and assisting at the hospital’s pharmacy. She mainly helped with sorting pills. The experience at the hospital left her with many fruitful memories, she said.“One day, a random man was urgently looking for a particular doctor. I guided him to the doctor and luckily he was able to receive the surgery that he needed. I cared for him until he left the hospital. A few days later, the man visited me to express gratitude with a box of sweet potatoes. He was a sweet potato farmer,” she said with laugh. “Since then, we have become friends and we still keep in touch. He still sends me a box of sweet potatoes every year.” Her dedication to helping others was not limited to hospitals. Whenever disasters occurred in the country such as the Seongsu Bridge collapse in 1994 or Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995, she ran to the scene and supported the survivors and rescue workers. She also never hesitated to offer a helping hand to shelter-seekers or refugees whenever weather disasters hit the country. “The poorer the region is, the harsher the damage is when a disasters happened. The only thing the volunteers could do was to make sure that the refugees have three meals a day at shelters,” Yoon added.As of late last month, the total length of time she spent on voluntary service in the past 30 years amounts to 30,395 hours, according to Korean Red Cross officials. Starting from 2002, the former teacher has visited a disabled welfare center four days a week to support the disabled residents.Despite being in her 80s, she does not feel any physical difficulties in carrying out her voluntary service. “Nothing is physically hard or challenging to me. Everything is enjoyable and fun. See? I’m still healthy enough to carry this box,” said Yoon, grabbing the daily supply box with two hands. In recognition of her dedication to voluntary service, she received several awards from the organization over the years. “Volunteering is nothing special. It’s just a spirit of offering a helping hand to anyone anywhere at any time. That’s actually the best way to stay happy, joyful and healthy,” she said with a blissful smile.  By Lee Hyun-jeong(rene@heraldcorp.com)","make cream cakes hours ,former teacher dedicates 30 ,hours later sponge cakes ,sponge cakes and sweet ,cream cakes hours","['Korean Red Cross', 'Jongno', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.25588983  0.33149144

According to the poll by the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion, 51.8 percent of the respondents said that the political wrangling between the ruling party and opposition bloc contributed most to worsening social confrontations. In the multiple-choice survey of 2,000 Koreans aged 19 and over, the wealth gap was chosen as the second-biggest factor (40.3 percent) and personal selfishness (36.4 percent) as the third reason for social strife in the country.The majority of those surveyed, or 75 percent, viewed conflicts among different classes as the worst, followed by labor-management (68.9 percent), ideological clashes (67.7 percent) and regional conflicts (55.9 percent).The survey was released by a committee set up by President Park Geun-hye upon her inauguration to champion one of her key pledges of national integration. The administration has been upping its pressure on the rival parties to endorse stalled bills, including those on labor reform, blaming them for taking the nation‘s economy hostage for their own political interests.The most urgent matter to be tackled is the ideological war (44 percent), followed by labor-management conflict (33.4 percent) and regional conflict (27.8 percent), the respondents said.One in 7 respondents picked the nation’s rapid economic development as South Korea’s proudest achievement since its independence from Japan in 1945. With four reform agendas -- the labor, education, public and finance sectors -- hanging in the balance, 59.9 percent of respondents chose labor market reform as the priority in promoting social unity. Asked what constitutes “social integration,” 23.6 percent of the surveyed pointed to “respect for law and order,” followed by “freedom that entails responsibility” (21.9 percent) and “coexistence of various values” (20.3 percent).Those aged 60 or over stressed patriotism most, while those in their 20s and 30s emphasized freedom and a variety of values, illustrating a generational rift in perceiving social unity. On a scale of 1 to 5 from least to most divided, the level of social conflicts stood at 3.65, while that of social cohesion was 2.33, according to the poll. Conducted by pollster Research and Research from Oct. 23-26 by phone, the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","political feuds biggest obstacle ,political feuds biggest ,feuds biggest obstacle to ,feuds biggest obstacle ,for deteriorating social conflicts","['Koreans', 'the Presidential Committee for National Cohesion']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92356688 -0.07400873

Infection cases will be later sent to a laboratory for a three-hour final verification process in a new diagnosis system set up by the medical command. ""The latest research outcome is expected to help find victims of biological weapons in the early stages and respond effectively so we can minimize human damage and the loss of combat forces,"" Lt.Col.

The Constitutional Court, however, said the medication is a temporary treatment for the offenders and the hormones could be produced again when the treatment is stopped.The court also pointed out that the treatment targets are narrowly selected, and only for pedophiles, after experts analysis.Three judges who opposed to the law said it is problematic to use the treatment when the effects and the side effects have not yet been properly verified.The law authorizing chemical castration for sex offenders came into effect in 2011 -- the first Asian country to adopt this type of treatment -- amid a public outcry over a series of rapists reoffending following their release.Chemical castration involves administering medication -- either via injection or tablets -- to take away sexual interest and make it impossible for a person to perform sexual acts. The effects are reversible after the person stops taking the drug.

She was wearing shorts and was barefoot at the time. She weighed just 16 kilograms and was 120 centimeters tall.  (123RF)While being confined, her father and his girlfriend reportedly rarely gave her anything to eat. The girl told police she was constantly physically abused by both of them. According to the police, her father had been addicted to games, while her biological mother left her when the victim was 3 years old.South Korea has seen a dramatic increase in its number of reported child abuse cases, from 7,406 in 2010 to 15,025 last year, partly due to stricter rules on reports. In 2014, more than 80 percent of the abusers were confirmed to be the parents of the victims. The Incheon victim initially had attended an elementary school in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, in 2012, before moving to the current residence with her father and his girlfriend in the same year. Even in Bucheon, the child was reportedly often absent from the school. The girl never came back to school after the summer break in August, leading the teacher to visit her home. A missing report was filed, but it was later confirmed the girl had moved to Incheon with her parents.After moving to Incheon, the father never notified the city government of his new address, making it impossible for her teacher or education authorities to track her down.“We are aware of the problems that have been revealed by this case and are thinking of ways to better protect children who don’t show up to school from possible domestic abuse,” said Kim from the Welfare Ministry.According to the National Child Protection Agency, the victim is currently being treated at a hospital and her condition is getting better. She reportedly told the agency she wants her father to be punished.Among the 10,027 confirmed child abusers last year, 8,207 were the victims’ parents. The largest number of cases, 33 percent, were caused by the parents’ “lack of knowledge and skills in child care,” such as not being able to differentiate abuse and discipline. Twenty percent of the cases were triggered by the parents’ social isolation, as well as their stress stemming from financial difficulties. Ten percent of the abusers had conflicts with either their spouse or other family members. Also, a large portion of the abusers, 32.4 percent, were unemployed. An elementary school teacher, who wished to remain unidentified, said the current system, where a teacher is required to mail a notice to a student‘s house when he or she is absent consecutively for more than a week, is ineffective. “We are required to send the notice to the address that is written on the student’s legal documents, such as his or her ID,” she told The Korea Herald. “But there is no way for us to find out whether or not he or she actually lives there. The best way would be to visit the student in person and find out if he or she is physically okay.”According to the National Child Protection Agency, there are only 37 shelters nationwide for children who have abusive parents and are unable to live with them. Those shelters together can house just 250 children.

The number, composed of their birthdate and seven unique digits, is commonly used in daily activities including creation of bank accounts, online shopping or purchase of mobile phones. But as the law does not have a clause allowing Koreans to alter their identification number, citizens use the same number at all times, even when their information is leaked. The court has ordered the government to change the number only in exceptional cases when errors are found in the birthdate.Refuting claims that the system overhaul could be abused by criminals, the court stressed the need for an “objective and fair system to review applications for changing resident numbers.”A group of five people, including a man surnamed Kang, filed a suit against the Ministry of Interior with the Constitutional Court after the government rejected the request and lower courts ruled against them. They asked the court to revoke the government’s rejection, arguing that their numbers were stolen and exposed them to the danger of identity theft and scams. But the ministry maintained that there are no alternatives to the current system and the permission to change resident numbers would take a toll on their administrative tasks. It also cited the hefty costs. According to the ministry’s own estimate, the reform of the system could cost up to 670 billion won ($571 million). The verdict came amid mounting concerns over security of personal information amid a series of data theft cases and financial scams in Korea in recent years.In early 2014, a massive leak of client databases at Lotte Card, KB Kookmin Card and NongHyup Card shocked Koreans, triggering calls for a reform in the current resident registration system. More than 200 million identification numbers were leaked online as a result. Under the growing pressure, the government put forward a bill to allow its citizens to change the numbers when there are well-established fears and danger of damage to their person or property.But activists and experts have pointed out that the measure does not sufficiently protect data from being stolen and misused in the first place, suggesting that the number be composed of entirely random digits not related to personal details. The resident registration system was introduced in 1968 as a 12-digit number, as part of efforts to track down North Korean spies in the aftermath of an attempted assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee. The current 13-digit system took effect in 1975.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","registration numbers was unconstitutional ,was unconstitutional the court ,law barring south koreans ,wednesday that law barring ,numbers was unconstitutional","['the Constitutional Court', 'South Koreans']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42546034  0.2637102

(Yonhap)As of Friday, 464 of 480 students from Seoul National University Law School have submitted the dropout documents to the dean’s office, while students from Ewha Womans University remain undecided on when to hand in the papers. After the respective administrations review their documents, a final decision on the dropouts will be made.The move is in protest against the Justice Ministry’s announcement Thursday to maintain the state-run bar exam -- originally slated for removal in 2017 -- until 2021, citing public opinion polls that showed 85.4 percent of the respondents saying it was too early to scrap the exams.The bar exam -- introduced in 1963 -- was set to be abolished during the previous Roh Moo-hyun administration, with the National Assembly passing an act to set up law schools in 2007. Officials cited academic elitism as a prevalent problem of the system, as the majority students who passed the exam were from a handful of top-notch education institutes.But the public opinion has turned sour over the past few years in light of the hefty costs of attending law schools -- ranging from 10 to 30 million won ($ 8,650-$25,922) a year -- coupled with admission scandals involving lawmakers.While the Justice Ministry vowed to find solutions that would minimize possible side effects of the system by 2021, it was met with a massive backlash from the law school students who accused it of breaking its pledge.“The biggest problem is that the ministry went back on its words just to become the patron of a bunch of ‘wailers,’” said a student from SNU Law School who declined to be named. “We (the students) know that law schools have some issues that need to be addressed and improved. But the solution should come from within the institutes, not in retrograding to the old system of bar exams.”Civic groups like the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy have also denounced the government’s decision, saying that the ministry, not the law schools, is responsible for hindering the system from settling down.The Korean Association of Law Schools -- of which 25 law school chiefs are members -- held a general meeting Friday and discussed measures against the government policy. This included possible boycott of setting questions for the state bar exam.“A heated reaction from (law school) students is only natural as the decision broke coherence and stability of their policy,” one of the law school heads told local media. The government’s attempt to find a middle ground has also failed to satisfy those seeking permanent continuation of the bar exams, namely the local lawyers’ group. The Korean Bar Association issued a statement Thursday condemning the ministry for “turning down the majority of Korean people hoping to retain the bar exam.”Other relevant organizations such as the Supreme Court and the Education Ministry also showed discontent saying the Justice Ministry did not discuss the issue with them.As the backlash surged, the Justice Ministry took a step back on Friday and said its decision was not final. But the latest statement appeared to have backfired when the KBA denounced the decision as “giving in to the pestering by law school students.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","refused to attend classes ,law schools in korea ,state run bar exam ,dropout letters and refused ,vehement opposition as students","['Korea', 'the University of Seoul Law School', 'the Justice Ministry']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11910748  0.10753343

The couple tied the knot 42 years ago but has been separated since 1984, following the plaintiff's series of affairs. He started to live with his mistress in the mid-1990s.Without any economic support from the plaintiff, his 67-year-old wife raised their three children while working and supporting her parents-in-law.South Korea does not allow the spouse responsible for the breakdown of the marriage to file a divorce lawsuit except for some exceptional cases.A district court, however, ruled in favor of the husband, saying enough time has passed to make it meaningless to place the blame.An appeals court overturned the ruling and said he is still responsible for the rocky marriage and pointed out that the wife not wanting to get a divorce is not out of a retaliatory spirit.In September, the Supreme Court started allowing more exceptions for divorce suits while maintaining the country's ""fault divorce"" system, in which the spouse responsible for the breakdown of the marriage is not allowed to file a divorce lawsuit.In a 7-6 ruling, the top court said it is too premature to change the law in consideration of the country's social and economic conditions. But it expanded the scope of grounds for exceptions: when the spouse at fault is sufficiently taking care of his/her partner and children to make up for the fault and when it is meaningless to place the blame after many years.

As per the law, schools are prohibited from teaching English to first- and second-graders as part of their curriculum. A revised version of the law, which took effect last September, states that after-school classes are an exception.But the group pointed out that after-school English classes at these elementary schools ― which ranged from one to three hours a day ― have become mandatory for all students. For example, school buses are operated only after the “after-school” English classes finish.The classes were conducted virtually as part of the regular curriculum, complete with evaluations and report cards, the group said. “Conducting English classes like regular classes that are part of the curriculum, holding tests for students and grading them are all blatant violation of the law,” the group said, calling for a special inspection by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to ensure that the schools abide by the laws.SMOE declined to comment on the matter, adding they have not considered any steps to be taken against schools violating the regulations. In 2013, SMOE found that 30 private elementary schools violated regulations related to curriculum.Banning English lessons for younger students is part of the Park Geun-hye administration’s effort to curb “advanced learning,” which refers to students prematurely studying material for older students. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","schools run illegal english ,private schools run illegal ,run illegal english lessons ,illegal english lessons some ,schools run illegal",['Seoul'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22042665 -0.08803955

As most of the accused, including well-known lecturers, admitted to the charges, they will be indicted next month, prosecutors said.  (Yonhap)The prosecution raided universities and publishers across the country, seizing evidence such as emails and academic portfolios. It also booked four publishing company employees who are suspected of involvement in the scheme. The professors, mostly in science and engineering majors, are accused of publishing others’ works under their own names by simply changing the book covers to boost their academic profiles ahead of assessments for rehiring. The publishers ignored the practice or even encouraged professors to help offload unsold science books by redesigning them as new ones, prosecutors said.The original authors also allegedly turned a blind eye to the practice under pressure to maintain a favorable relationship with the publishers for future book deals. Some of them are suspected of having taken kickbacks from publishers in return for keeping quiet. The professors in question are likely to be dismissed from their posts if they are found guilty. Universities have policies against rehiring those who have been fined more than 3 million won ($2,600). Those violating the copyright law can face imprisonment of up to five years and a penalty of 50 million won.The alleged collusion among professors and publishing companies shed light on the ethical problems rampant in academia, where plagiarism among professors and teachers has been persistent.Most recently, Changwon National University president Choi Hae-bum was involved in a plagiarism scandal as 33 professors from the school took issue with his doctorate thesis. According to a survey from last year of 417 graduate school students from Korea University, 33 percent of the respondents said they had experienced corruption in the process of conducting research or writing a thesis. “The practice has been prevalent since 1980 in the publishing sector, but it has never been caught,” said Kim Young-jong from the prosecutors’ office. “We will take stern action against the university professors who have little morality to protect innocent students from them.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","200 professors for copyright ,charge 200 professors for ,charge 200 professors ,would charge 200 professors ,professors from 50 universities",['the Uijeongbu District Prosecutors ’ Office'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85441548  0.48468769

It brings together the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus its eight dialogue partners -- South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, Russia, Australia, India and New Zealand.  The leaders also agreed to cooperate to counter terrorist and violent extremist ideology, and to invest in enhancing the ability of communities and individuals to challenge terrorist propaganda.  The statement is the latest in a series of moves by world leaders to galvanize international efforts to tackle terrorism following the recent deadly terrorist attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 people.  In Turkey, Park and other leaders of the G-20 summit condemned the deadly attacks in Paris and said they ""remain united in combating terrorism.""  In Manila, Park and other leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also strongly condemned terrorism and called for international cooperation and solidarity in the fight against terrorism.  Also Sunday, most of the leaders of the East Asia Summit shared the view that territorial disputes in the South China Sea should be peacefully resolved, noting the freedom of navigation and overflight should be guaranteed, according to Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office.  The presidential office said various opinions over the South China Sea were put forward at the summit, in a thinly veiled reference to a rift in the region.  China has been pushing land reclamation projects in the South China Sea, creating tension with the U.S. and some Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines.  ""I hope that all relevant countries contribute to promoting peace and stability in the South China Sea by complying with pledges not to seek militarization"" in the disputed region, Park said at the summit.  In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that ""China does not intend to pursue militarization,"" in a joint news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.  South Korea has a strategic interest in the South China Sea as it is a key shipping route through which 30 percent of South Korea's exports and 90 percent of South Korean energy shipments pass.  Separately, Park called on member states of the East Asia Summit to speak with one voice to North Korea to help resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.  South Korea, China, Japan, the U.S. and Russia have been involved in the long-stalled negotiations to coax North Korea into abandoning its nuclear program.  Still, North Korea has repeatedly vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, despite repeated warnings from Seoul and Washington that the policy is a dead end for the country.  ""North Korea should recognize that it can never get what it wants with its nuclear program, and give up the nuclear program and hold the hands of dialogue and cooperation extended by the international community,"" Park said in a separate summit with ASEAN.  Meanwhile, Park had a brief encounter with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the summit in Kuala Lumpur.

Foreign tourists have been applying for the tour packages at the Masik ski resort near North Korea's eastern coastal city of Wonsan, which opened earlier last year as a pet project of the North's young leader Kim Jong-un, the English-language Pyongyang Times newspaper reported. Citing the North's Korea International Youth and Children's Travel Company, the report said the North Korean travel company ""is going to conduct large-scale ski tourism in the Masik Pass area from late November.""

The rate, however, marked a slight annual decrease since 88.7 percent in 2012, although still high compared to other countries like the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, which show between 41 to 76 percent. Of the surveyed hospitals and health centers, 1,547 prescribed antibiotics for ear infection 90 percent of the time. (123rf)According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the world’s largest medical library, while a virus or bacteria can cause ear infections, antibiotics do not help viral infections.Korea also revised relevant laws last year stating that prescription of antibiotics is only advised for those aged 24 months and under with confirmed diagnosis. In other cases, the doctors are advised to monitor symptoms such as pain and fever for two to three days.But HIRA’s latest survey showed that 84.4 percent of the kids aged between two and seven and 82.5 percent of them between seven and 15 were prescribed antibiotics.“As it is difficult to discern ear infection due to a virus to those from bacteria, parents who are worried about complications wish to use the antibiotics immediately. There needs to be cooperation from the medical professionals and change in perception among the citizens for appropriate use of antibiotics,” HIRA said.It added that it would look into ways to revise the standards for using antibiotics, as abusing them could lead to antibiotics resistance and tolerance.From news reports","ear infection rampant antibiotics ,children ear infection rampant ,of 10 prescribed antibiotics ,antibiotics for children suffering ,infection rampant antibiotics are","['South Korea', 'the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2491684   0.47399232

The ministry said it caught 4,751 foreigners in breach of immigration law including some 3,600 who worked here without a visa. The rest were people whose visas had expired. The ministry has carried out an intensive crackdown against illegal immigration since September in cooperation with police and other ministries. Under the Immigration Control Law, immigration offices can take foreign nationals who are illegally working in Korea into emergency custody and issue them exit orders. The foreign workers are subsequently repatriated to their home countries unless they are granted refugee status.Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese accounted for the highest numbers of people caught. Most of them were found to have worked in factories, construction sites, massage parlors or bars, the authorities said. Of the employers who were caught, 79 were sent to prosecutors on charges of hiring a large number of illegal aliens. The rest were fined up to 20 million won ($17,000). Along with the crackdown, the ministry encouraged about 4,500 illegal residents to voluntarily return to their countries. The ministry has vowed to strengthen its crackdown against illegal brokers who find work for foreign nationals, as well as illegal immigrants and employers.

They are eager to be the first ones in office, and for a reason.It used to be no different for young intern Jeon -- she wished to be identified only by her family name -- until all her hard work came to naught. She used to begin her day at the office by making coffee for her seniors, and couldn’t imagine dozing off or slacking, for everyone in her team was watching her -- job performance and attitude would be evaluated when hiring full-time workers after the internship.Jeon endured everything -- from tedious chores to fawning over her weird boss who would frequently leer at her. Despite all these efforts and perseverance, all she was left with after her internship was a text message which read, “We’re sorry but we have decided not to move your application forward.”“I was devastated,” said Jeon, who is back on the sluggish local job market, saying she feels like she has wasted her precious time on a wild goose chase.   Young job seekers look at job postings on a bulletin board (Yonhap)This is not an isolated case. According to government statistics, one out of five young job seekers begin their career paths as nonregular workers, such as interns or trainees. Many businesses hire new workers through internships through which the companies offer full-time positions to a certain portion -- ranging from 50 to 90 percent -- of high-performers. In this way, companies can identify potential employees who are also trained and experienced through the probation period.  Every year, tens of thousands of young Koreans enter into exploitive work arrangements, working overtime and mostly doing menial works for little or no pay, because they consider it as a rite of passage to be admitted into the white-collar world. These desperate jobseekers can barely complain or speak up against their poor working conditions, for disobedience could jeopardize possible job opportunities. “Nobody complains about working overtime,” said Choi, who gained a permanent position at a public firm last year through a 6-month internship at the company. “There was also fierce competition among interns. They were willing to work overtime and nobody asked for the rightful reward as long as they could become regular workers.”Heavy strain and worries are what torment these young people most, since they have to cast their dice on the internship -- they might be wasting their precious time for nothing. Also, they might have to make excuses in their next interviews, while their certificates and English test scores -- which often cost them significant amount of effort and money -- expire in two years. Some even suffer from the fear of being around people, as families and relatives meddle and put heavy strain on them.For female interns, the reality is even harsher. A 22-year-old college student Jang, who recently did an internship at an architectural firm, had to put up with her boss who would pass offensive sexual comments on her body. A few years earlier, a congressman was under fire for sexually harassing his intern. Likewise, female interns are often targeted for sexual harassment. Internships are supposed to provide on-site experience for the fresh graduates, while it can work as a system to find potential future hires for employers. Companies, however, often take advantage of the system and view it as an opportunity to exploit the plight of cheap and passionate workers. Earlier this year, a local social commerce firm, Wemakeprice.com, drew flak for firing all of its 11 interns after hiring them for two weeks. But such tyranny never seems to stop. Recently, a local financial firm reportedly laid off more than half of their interns due to financial problems.In April 2013, a 20-something Korean man hanged himself in his apartment. The young man had begun his sales internship at an insurance firm few months earlier, but had been reportedly suffering from work pressure, due to bad sales performance. Who are pushing the young job seekers to death? The need seems to be growing for more decent jobs for fresh graduates and strict legal guidelines that protects the young, desperate job seekers.By Ko Ji-seon (jiseonko@heraldcorp.com)","hardships from working overtime ,bleak for most jobseekers ,bleak job market hardships ,working overtime to sexual ,subway station at dusk",['hardship'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25506029 -0.03164894

However, those who can confidently say that they had an efficient internship experience are small in number. This, in part, many take internships without adequate information about a position, while some say that many internships do not offer much by way of experience needs for specific fields. Here are details of some internships which are worth doing in your undergraduate days.Interns are making a presentation based on team projects during the National Assembly internship (Korean League Of Women Voters)National Assembly With the purpose of raising students’ interest and understanding of politics, and to foster next generation leaders, internships at the National Assembly occasionally makes available internship opportunities. It is usually hosted by legislators themselves directly, posting a recruitment notice on the National Assembly’s official website or by the Korean League of Women Voters.Interns assist aides or secretaries who are in charge of duties including, data investigation, data reviewing and preparing for parliamentary inspection. They also receive training for legislation proposal through team projects. “There are times when interns’ refreshing ideas gives practical help in putting out real legislative motions,” said Kim Sung-ok, the central chief of the federation.During the internship period, quite a few students actually get hired as aides or secretaries, or at least dream to be one.Consultation company“The relationship between consulting company and client can be compared to that between a doctor and patient. It can pinpoint the client company’s problems, which can be difficult for insiders to spot,” said an executive who was an intern in one of the top three consulting companies in Korea.In order to make an accurate diagnosis for the client, precise information analysis is essential, which is the interns’ main duty.As accurate data analysis strengthens the basis of the company’s operations, and an intern’s job cannot be neglected.“However, it depends on the interns’ capability of conducting their duties, whether to take part in practical working process of arranging for certain events or programs which are requested by the client,” said 24-year-old Choi, who worked at a PR consulting company before. Though consulting company usually refers to ‘management’ consulting companies, it can also include ‘PR’ or ‘advertisement agency’ in the broad sense.Architecture firmAn architecture firm is different from a construction firm, in that it is in charge of design and construction supervision of structures, which are to be built.In Korea, Samoo, Changjo and Heerim are some of the well-known architecture firms.The interns’ main duty is to draw the accurate design for blueprints, using computer programs and produce models -- a miniature of the actual structure.Surnamed Song, 26, who worked in a series of big and small architecture firms after majoring in the field as an undergraduate, said, “It’s also the interns’ share to make presentation materials, regarding the drawn design and blueprints, to explain those to the superiors.”Meanwhile, though it differs according to the scale of the company, it is difficult for the majority of interns to suggest practical ideas, which have a direct influence on the company.Apart from the opportunities mentioned above, other innumerable types of internships exist.The more one is informed of the specifics and gets to experience a differentiated internship, the more efficient it will be in terms of apprehending one’s aptitude and choosing a career path as well as standing out in the process of getting a job, such as during an interview.

(Yonhap)Park urged the National Institute of Korean History in charge of the publication to put efforts into gathering the “best” experts in the field to author the books to be used in middle and high schools from 2017.“The government has promised the people it will create a proper history textbook that contains the proud history of ours. For this it is of the utmost importance to create a pool of writers with that capacity,” she said.Park’s comments came as the NIKH has been facing difficulties lining up writers. One of the lead authors, professor Choi Mong-lyong, resigned over sexual harassment allegations last Friday.As opposition among progressives continued against the state-authored textbooks, the NIKH said Tuesday it had secured 75 potential authors including 25 volunteers that submitted their names during the recruitment period that ended Monday. The institute said the list would remain confidential for now for security reasons.Park also took aim at opposition political parties, which agreed to resume the parliamentary schedule over the weekend despite the ongoing textbook brawl to tend to budget reviews and pending bills. “The textbook issue should not and cannot be subject to political fighting,” she said.Park further elaborated on some of the contentious points, including the date of South Korea’s foundation.“The future of the Republic of Korea that has the history of division depends on our youth at this important juncture where we must realize reunification. It depends on their sense of pride and accurate perception of history,” she said.She said that current textbooks describe the year 1948 as the foundation of the South Korean “government” while it specifies North Korea as a state as being established the same year. Conservatives see this as implicitly favoring North Korea.Progressive scholars say the establishment of the “South Korean government” is meant to uphold the Constitution that states the current government succeeds the provisional government established in 1919.She added that the textbooks also depict both Koreas to be at fault for the Korean War (1950-1953) and that South Korea’s “economic development praised by the world is described as being antilabor and only depicts the negative side of the conglomerates and thereby stokes antibusiness sentiment.”The opposition has been claiming the new textbooks will aim to glorify the past pro-Japanese and dictatorial governments of the 1960s and 1970s, including rule under former President Park Chung-hee, the late father of Park, by highlighting the rapid industrialization and economic growth.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy immediately shot back at Park’s remarks.“It is shocking how preposterous (Park’s comments) sound,” said NPAD spokesman Kim Seong-soo in a statement.“It indeed must be a scary situation as, according to the president, our public has distorted souls by having learned from the wrong textbooks.”Park also pressed lawmakers to speed up the review and approval of key bills, including those aimed to boost the economy, create jobs and reform the labor sector.The president specifically urged for the prompt ratification of free trade agreements with China, New Zealand and Vietnam.“If the National Assembly neglects these bills and leaves them to be disposed of automatically, the people shall not condone it,” she said.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","bad history teaching threatens ,history teaching threatens children ,her administration controversial reintroduction ,textbooks saying inaction threatened ,bad history teaching","['Park Geun - hye', 'Koreans', 'Cabinet', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27058062 -0.08850652

The new commercial, currently in production, is aimed to curb smoking among Koreans more effectively, using a combination of possibly disturbing images and messages, said Choi Shin-gwang from the Health Ministry. “We’ve been told that the current commercial with the ballet dancer is not strong enough,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “We are trying to come up with a new commercial that is more powerful.”A scene from the Health Ministry`s current antismoking TV ad, featuring ballet dancers expressing the agony of smoking’s side effects through dance movements. (A screen capture)Choi, a public health official at the ministry, said the new commercial may contain images that may be “painful” to watch. He refused to share further details about the content of the production.The ministry’s move, however, may find criticism for lacking efficacy despite its severity, according to previous research.A 2011 study by the University of Missouri-Columbia found that using a combination of disturbing images and threatening messages to prevent smoking was not effective. According to the study, those who were exposed to highly disturbing antismoking ads, including both graphic images and messages, in fact had a lower emotional response than those who saw ads that only included either a message or an image.“Simply trying to encourage smokers to quit by exposing them to combined threatening and disgusting visual images is not an effective way to change attitudes and behaviors,” the study said. “Effective communication is more complicated than simply showing a disgusting picture. That kind of communication will usually result in a defensive avoidance response where the smoker will try to avoid the disgusting images, not the cigarettes.”South Korea is home to almost 10 million smokers, and an estimated 57,000 die each year due to smoking-related diseases including lung cancer. Last year, the country had one of the highest smoking rates for adult males among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, at 43.7 percent, surpassing the OECD average of 26 percent. The National Assembly last year approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking. The new bill took effect on Jan. 1. Smokers have opposed the measures, claiming it was a way for the government to collect more taxes at their expense.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","antismoking tv commercial starting ,graphic antismoking tv ads ,explicit antismoking tv commercial ,more explicit antismoking tv ,commercial starting next week","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry', 'Koreans', 'Choi Sh']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71371281  0.37025338

""The government will also request the protection of the team of writers as the National Police Agency had already announced stern actions.""  Earlier, the police said it will crack down on those who resort to violence or defamation against members of the history textbook team.The government plan hit a snag after a veteran history professor leading the team resigned two days after his appointment over sexual harassment allegations.Choi Mong-lyong, an emeritus professor at Seoul National University, allegedly made sexual remarks and inappropriately touched a female journalist.""It is very regrettable and pitiful,"" the minister said, adding that Choi had received enough criticism on the Internet.The government made public the names of only two leading writers -- Choi and Shin Hyung-sik, a history professor from the Ewha Woman's University -- although it has vowed to release a full list of the authors, prompting public criticism. ""Why would (the government) not make public the writers when the books are finished,"" Hwang refuted, indicating that the government may not unveil the names until the completion.

I‘ve sparked dispute concerning the NIKH. I’ll resign (as author of the) textbook, too,” he said, adding he did not want to burden the state-run institution. The NIKH is commissioned by the Education Ministry to oversee the publication process for the secondary education history textbooks.Choi, who was to be one of six main authors, had a meal with four local reporters Wednesday after the NIKH revealed the plans for the publication at a press conference. He allegedly uttered sexually offensive words and initiated inappropriate physical contact with a female reporter. He denied there was any contact, but admitted to “some jokes,” saying he is always like that.The 70-year-old scholar had already been embroiled in controversy after revealing in a Wednesday interview with local media that Hyun Jung-taik, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, had called him and requested he attend the NIKH’s press conference on that day, giving aid to the administration. He also said he was a “shield” for the government in the implementation of the contentious policy. The news fueled speculation that Cheong Wa Dae was pressuring scholars to support the textbook. Choi denied the phone call the next day, then flip-flopped again later, saying that while there was a phone call, it was just a conversation between old friends.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said the fiasco with Choi was a “disaster caused by the reckless and forced nature of the state textbook policy” and urged President Park Geun-hye to scrap the plan.Later in the afternoon, the NIKH confirmed Choi’s resignation and said he apologized to the female reporter in question.“Choi told us that he wishes his resignation does not tarnish the true purpose of ‘correct history textbooks,’” it said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","quits amid sexual harassment ,female reporter professor emeritus ,harassed female reporter professor ,textbook author quits ,textbook author quits amid","['Seoul National University Choi Mong - lyong', 'the National Institute of korean history']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40723398  0.17151272

Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea speaks during a meeting of vice education superintendents Monday at Sejong Government Complex. (Yonhap)Ministry officials at the office denied entry to the lawmakers, turned off the lights and called the police, with the standoff lingering on to the next day.The NPAD claimed that the unknown team has been reporting directly to the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, on grounds that the team in question had a folder marked “BH,” meaning Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae). NPAD member Kim Tae-Nyeon raised suspicion that the ministry had secretly operated the team since September, well before the ministry made its decision official. In an emergency briefing the next day, the ministry explained that the claims that it was running a secret task force were baseless, and that the team on history education had increased staff due to a spike in their workload.“We have no reason to hide the team, as it is not newly created but an already-existing one. Transfer records do not exist because (the officials) have not been relocated, but temporarily shifted,” said a ministry official in charge of the team. He claimed that the office was set up in Seoul, not in Sejong City where the ministry is based, because the government complex did not have sufficient room. He added that the officials at the office may have called the police because they panicked at the unscheduled visit by lawmakers and the media that accompanied them. The official denied that the ministry set up the team specifically to deal with the state textbooks, and said it had increased staffing to address the explosive increase in the parliament’s demand for data, and to deal with the media. He denied allegations that the team was directly reporting to Cheong Wa Dae, saying that he was heading the operation. But the official said that he only learned of the overnight standoff this morning via media coverage. A public statement denying the NPAD’s accusations was issued around midnight under the name of the Education Ministry. The special team will continue operations until Nov. 2.Parties were at loggerheads over the new allegations. NPAD floor leader Lee Jong-kul accused President Park Geun-hye of secretly pushing ahead with the state textbook plan, while the ruling Saenuri Party’s leader Kim Moo-sung accused the opposition of “forcibly imprisoning” the ministry officials in the office.With the dispute over state history textbooks showing no signs of fading out, some members of the ruling party have expressed opposition to the plan.Rep. Chung Doo-un, among the few Saenuri members who have opposed the policy, said that the state history textbooks was a “disaster” and urged the government to “admit to making a mistake.”“Public opinion is against the government because of (the state textbook). It is virtually a boon for the opposition. The government is reviving the opposition, which is suffering from faltering public support, with the policy,” he said in a radio interview.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","textbook clash opposition lawmakers ,school history textbooks sunday ,history textbooks sunday alleging ,worsen textbook clash opposition ,textbooks sunday alleging that","['Education Ministry', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'the National Institute for Internatio']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20444652  0.48921901

British American Tobacco launched Dunhill Exotic in April 2014 with 14 cigarettes per pack, while Japan Tobacco Inc. followed with a slimmer version of its Camel brand. Ministry officials said the latest move is aimed at discouraging smoking in general and in particular, preventing minors from buying cheaper cigarettes.""Small cigarette packs seem to make it possible for minors to purchase them more easily, canceling out state policy to enhance public health,"" a source said. Starting this year, the government raised taxes slapped on cigarettes by 2,000 won (US$1.70) per pack to prod people to quit.He pointed out that Canada, the United States and many European countries have either banned smaller packs or plan to do so in the near future. Canada has had such a law since 1994, while the U.S.implemented such measures in 2010, with the European Union to make it mandatory for all packs to have at least more than 20 cigarettes starting in 2016.

Last week, he and 23 colleagues at Pusan National University joined a nationwide move by professors to refuse to participate in the creation of state history textbooks.“The concept of ‘one history’ is basically against the essence of history education, which is to allow, encourage various interpretations (of history) by students,” said Yang, who doubles as the chief of the Korean Association of History Education.  Yang Jung-hyunHe voiced concerns that state-authored books will attempt to favorably depict controversial figures like former President Park Chung-hee. “It was only under Japanese Imperialism and (Park’s) Yushin dictatorship that state textbooks were used, with the sole intent of justifying the unlawful monopoly of power by imposing a monolithic historical view on students. Reviving the state history textbooks will send the wheels back to the times of the dictatorship,” he said. Yang added that the Korean Constitution states that education should be impartial and politically neutral, which is impossible if a certain party monopolizes the publishing rights. Speaking from past experience authoring a state-commissioned middle school history textbook published in 2002, Yang pointed out that writers of state textbooks are structurally subject to government influence even if the administration is not a dictatorship. In nearly two years of tussle over state history textbooks, both the conservative administration and ruling Saenuri Party were in tandem in emphasizing that current history textbooks are biased in favor of the leftists, and even favorably depict North Korea. Party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung claimed that historians are 90 percent leftists while the Education Ministry said the current textbooks looked like they were published in Pyongyang.For example, the ministry and the party pointed out that all textbooks depicted in-depth the North’s juche ideology ― the backbone of Pyongyang’s dictatorial regime ― accusing them of blindly repeating North Korea’s descriptions about itself. Saenuri last week hung a placard saying, “Our children are learning juche ideology!” across the country, which they took down a day later after it was revealed that the textbooks also criticize the juche idea.Yang, who dismissed Kim’s claim as “not even worth mentioning,” said such claims are taken out of context. He said as the two Koreas are still technically at war, it makes sense for South Korean students to learn about their hostile neighbor. “Know your enemy, they say. Students of course must know about the situation and ideas of North Korea.”“How could a textbook that glorifies North Korean ideology pass the state inspection? If the textbooks are indeed (biased), the president and the education minister should resign,” he said. The ministry has also accused current textbooks of having numerous errors. Proponents of the state history textbooks say the quality issue can be resolved when the government takes over. But Yang said state-published textbooks would not necessarily guarantee better quality.“From my experience, the state history textbooks do not have to worry about quality because there will be no competition. But privately published books have to compete with each other, giving them an incentive to consider what the students are interested in and what the teachers need,” he said. “This is actually what the ministry touted as the biggest advantage of the private publishing system when it was introduced back then.”Yang raised suspicion that the newly published books will be reminiscent of a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co., which was accused of being poorly written and biased in favor of conservatives. The PNU professor added that while past publishing of state textbooks took over two years, the ministry’s plan to use the state textbooks from March 2017 only allows the government a year to author the books. “The short period of time indicates that the true intent of the state textbook system is not in producing the best textbook possible,” Yang said. “It seems to me that President Park is compelled to see the state textbooks put to use before her tenure is over, as 2017 is her last year in office.“This makes me suspect that Park is looking to shine a positive light on her father’s rule,” he added, echoing concern voiced by opponents of the state history textbook.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","history textbooks for secondary ,rights of history textbooks ,the worst idea imaginable ,authoring state published textbook ,of history textbooks","['the Education Ministry', 'Yang Jung - hyun']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43115473  0.06334773

But then, huge amounts of money are from Goldman Sachs and Google.""""The finance is from giant, global and vertically integrated capitalist companies that will try to control every owner of a car in the world,"" Rifkin said.

Now drivers are saying, why don't we just set up a cooperative,"" Rifkin said, adding the cooperative system can suggest a new guideline to the global capitalism. ""A cooperative can do it cheaper.""""Regional cooperatives are getting together, and the profit does not have to go to a third party,"" he said, adding that Uber's system is not a unique one developed by a specific firm, but an idea that has existed for a long time.""I think cooperatives are not a part of the global capitalists' market. There are billions in cooperatives in banking, agriculture and so on. It is a huge part of every life in society.""I don't think there is an only way for the advancement in creativity,"" he added.Rifkin, meanwhile, said Airbnb can also become one example of the sharing economy but claimed its sustainability lies on how the younger generation copes with the government and the existing system.On Aug. 26, South Korea's Busan District Court fined a 55-year-old housewife, whose identity was withheld, 700,000 won ($590) for seeking to profit by renting out her house to people who booked through Airbnb without reporting to the local authorities.The South Korean public health control act requires anyone who runs an accommodation business to report it to the district office. For Rifkin, the issue is a symbolic one.""I think we are going to see a lot of regulation. Look at Airbnb. For sure, you don't want someone next door, if you are living in an apartment, (to use their rooms for Airbnb all day long),"" Rifkin said.Rifkin said it is inevitable to face discord with political authorities when it comes to the sharing economy, as other new systems and phenomenon in the market.""I have no doubt that there will be regulations in all of the sharing economy to make sure it is not abusive of the public good.There will be a lot of discussion,"" he said.""The political struggle around the sharing economy will affect you, your children and your grandchildren.

There were seven writers but now the government will put in some 30 writers,"" Hwang said during the National Assembly interpellation session. Currently, secondary school history textbooks are published by eight private publishing companies after being approved by an independent textbook review committee of experts. Schools choose from any of them, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.Under the new system, historians and scholars with expertise in different periods and fields of history will participate under the supervision of the National Institute of Korean History. Earlier in the day, representatives of some 20 student councils across the country staged a series of press conferences in Seoul to oppose the state-authored history textbooks.The student councils of Seoul National University, Yonsei University and Korea University released a statement criticizing the government's decision, saying it is ""a challenge to democracy, a fundamental spirit of the South Korean constitution.""A group of students majoring in education also held a press conference with similar calls.Meanwhile, a group of retired head principals of Seoul's middle and high schools held a rally in central Seoul in support of the government decision. ""The policy of state-designated textbooks is the solution so that the future generation has the correct view of history and the nation,"" said the group.The former teachers also said that the most important aspect of history education is that students can have pride in our country.""It is my wish and conviction that both parties and the people get together, and that best writers come up with the best book,"" Hwang said.

It relinquished the power to private publishers in 2011 under a government monitoring system.  Liberals argue that the government should enhance the monitoring system of the current government-authorized textbooks instead of the adoption of state-published books.  ""A government-authorized textbook is right for general subjects, but a history textbook that is based on facts should be state-written,"" Ahn said.   As to the issue of how to write about contentious modern history, the KFTA chief acknowledged the need to re-establish that part of history.  The Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a progressive umbrella union of teachers, has waged a campaign against the government's decision to publish state textbooks.   ""It is the government's intention to control the people through a single history textbook,"" Byun Seong-ho, chairman of the KTU, told Yonhap News Agency.   ""Taking over the publication of history textbooks is the Park Geun-hye administration's attempt to secure the legitimacy of reforming the labor market,"" Byun said.   As to the issue of modern history, Byun argued that the government is trying to glorify the days of the Yushin authoritarian rule under the Park Chung-hee administration.  The Yushin Constitution, adopted by the elder Park, father of current President Park, in 1972, greatly expanded presidential powers and allowed presidents to be re-elected without term limits.   ""There is no reason to push ahead with the decision without holding a single hearing but to glorify the dictatorship,"" Byun said.   Currently, secondary school history textbooks are published by eight private publishing companies after being approved by an independent textbook review committee of experts.

(Yonhap)Their announcement is on the coattails of professors from Yonsei University saying they would not “be involved in any way concerning the state history textbooks.” Other major universities including Seoul National University are expected to follow suit as hundreds of professors in history-related departments across the country have criticized the ministry’s plans for state textbooks.It is widely seen as backlash to the government and ruling Saenuri Party’s claims that the currently privately published textbooks are written in favor of liberals, and that 90 percent of historians in the country are leftists. Several scholars have raised suspicion that government intervention will result in a textbook that suits the taste of those in power. “State history textbooks will make history education a tool for politics. I don’t think scholars will be able to participate impartially as authors since the reintroduction of state textbooks is very political in nature,” Chung Yong-wook, a professor of contemporary Korean history at SNU, told local media. Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, however, said the ministry has already contacted and made an agreement with several scholars who will participate as authors. Reports have suggested the scholars are seven educators that had a private meeting with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-choon last month, five of whom are conservatives that publicly welcomed the state history textbooks. Kim Jung-bae, the head of the National Institute of Korean History that will be in charge of the history textbooks, said the authors for the state-issued textbooks in the 1970s were more competent than the authors of today.History textbooks of the 1970s, which were published under former President Park Chung-hee ― whose dictatorial rule spanned across the 1960s and 1970s ― were the original subject of controversy, as they had been accused of whitewashing the Park regime. Its description of the May 16 military coup, through which Park rose to power ― a “revolution that aimed to eradicate corruption and save the country from the threat of political confusion and terrorism” ― is one of the most contentious issues.Meanwhile, points accused of being “pro-leftist” by the government are expected to be addressed in authoring the new book. The ministry pointed out that the books’ description saying North Korea distributed land to farmers for free after Korea was liberated from Japan could lead to a positive perception of the country.The ministry also took issue with the use of the term “People’s Army” to refer to the North Korean army, while saying the description that North Korea established a government immediately after the South had conducted a general election could lead to students believing that the governments of the two Koreas are equal. South Korea does not legally recognize the Pyongyang government as a legitimate state.Portions about founding President Syngman Rhee are also expected to be tweaked. One of the textbooks states that Rhee’s passive approach to punishing those who were pro-Japan during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonialism of Korea was one of the reasons people turned against him. The ministry said that it was overly critical of Rhee. Securing a 4.4 billion won ($3.8 million) budget for the textbooks is also one of the looming challenges. Persuading the opposition lawmakers who are actively against the notion to sign off on the budget is expected be tough.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has said it will not cooperate in allocating the budget for the textbooks. Progressive education superintendents across the country, meanwhile, have vowed to author an alternative textbook for Korean history to complement what they suspect will be a lopsided history lesson in favor of conservatives. “I plan to create selective subjects such as historical philosophy, history and humanities, while allocating a budget to create separate certified textbooks,” said Jang Hui-guk, the education chief for Gwangju and the leader of education superintendent meetings in Korea.Korean law stipulates that an education chief is entitled to create a supplementary textbook, although it cannot replace the government-approved official textbook. The Education Ministry said it will pursue legal actions if the superintendent-certified textbooks are politically biased.Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon, who supervises education for the country’s capital and most populous city, has yet to participate in the “supplementary textbook” movement, although he publicly announced his disapproval of the state history textbooks.An official from the Seoul education office said that the supplementary textbooks are certainly considered an option, but are unlikely to completely replace the state textbooks. “The terminology being used in the media is ‘textbook,’ but it is more like teaching materials that we already use to supplement the classes,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","government published history textbooks ,2017 but history professors ,reinstate government published history ,history textbooks for secondary ,for state history textbook","['the Education Ministry', 'Kyung Hee Universit']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1127189   0.36968458

But scholars and the opposition lawmakers have pointed out that most of the points used as evidence of “left-leaning bias” are false, heralding further head-butting over the issue.  Members of a conservative civic group protest against NPAD chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in (right) and other party members who were holding a rally opposing the government’s revival of state-published history textbooks in Yeouido, Tuesday. (Yonhap)Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea along with National Institute of Korean History chief Kim Jung-bae, who will be overseeing the textbook production process, said Monday the rampant distortion in the textbooks by historians’ own viewpoints has forced the government’s hand in taking over publication rights. Currently South Korea allows eight private publishers to author history textbooks and authorizes them if they are up to standards.The stern warning by the ministry is coupled with an unconfirmed claim by ruling Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sung that 90 percent of Korean historians are leftists.One of the points made by Hwang was that some textbooks, including one from local publisher Mirae-N, claims that both Koreas shared responsibility for the 1950-53 Korean War that was sparked by the North’s invasion on June 25, 1950.The textbook describes the situation as the two Koreas being involved in frequent minor skirmishes at the border prior to the war. The description also said that South Korea’s first President Rhee Syng-man insisted on South-led unification and anticommunism while the North looked to communize the peninsula, which proponents of the state textbook took as evidence that privately authored textbooks treated the two Koreas the same and equally responsible for the war.But Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy claimed the Mirae-N textbook states that North Korea invaded the South, and carries a detailed description of Pyongyang’s battle orders delivered to frontline forces three days before the war. Another point made by Vice Education Minister Kim Jae-Choon was that one of the textbooks used the word “dictatorship” 24 times to describe South Korean politicians while using the word only twice for the North. But Cho Han-kyung, the president of the Association of Korean History Teachers, said the disparity comes from the textbooks dedicating a much larger proportion of the content to South Korean politics than politics of the North. “There has been only one hereditary regime in the North, while Seoul has had several dictatorial administrations,” he said. “The current textbook only describes the history of North Korea in a single subsection.”Another accusation the ministry threw out was that the textbooks were justifying North Korea’s juche (self-reliance) ideology, which is the foundation of state founder Kim Il-sung’s dictatorship. But opponents counter that while both textbooks from Kumsung Publishing and Chunjae Education, which have been accused of teaching the juche idea, explain what it is, they also say that it ultimately led to the personal idolization of Kim Il-sung and him monopolizing power. They say the idea was used as an excuse to control the citizens by executing anyone opposing him. The more pressing matter is that some of the ideas that are expected to be included in the new textbooks can prompt further ideological controversies. NIKH chief Kim said that the descriptions in the textbooks that say “the Korean government was founded in 1948” are wrong, saying it should instead say “Korea was founded in 1948.” He said that the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established in 1919 was by definition, provisional. Kim’s comments ran counter to Korean constitutional law that the country inherits the tradition of the provisional government. He later backed down and declined to answer exactly when he believed the country was founded.Further confusions loomed large as ministry officials also showed mixed views on details. While Kim said controversial theories and opinions cannot be written in the textbooks, Vice Minister Kim Jae-choon said a dominant theory can be introduced along with minority opinions, hinting at a long, perilous way for the fledgling, reborn state history textbook.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","current textbooks are biased ,textbooks are biased ,opposition lawmakers have pointed ,textbooks are biased in ,reinstate state history textbooks",['the Education Ministry ’s'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49213201  0.46361694

The decision was reportedly made by the committee’s chairwoman, Rep. You Seung-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. Their invitation as witnesses had been confirmed on Oct. 5, the same day it was revoked just hours earlier.  A group of human rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex issues activists protest last week in front of the central government building in Seoul against the Gender Ministry’s recent order for Daejeon Metropolitan City to delete articles that guarantee LGBTI rights in the city’s newly revised charter of gender equality. (Claire Lee/The Korea Herald)The two activists were to show up at the audit as witnesses of the Gender Ministry’s recent denial of LGBTI rights, involving the Daejeon Metropolitan City’s newly revised charter of gender equality. In August, the ministry sent the municipal government of Daejeon an official order to delete the charter’s newly introduced articles guaranteeing LGBTI rights, after receiving complaints from gay rights opponents and religious groups. “Every other witness, six of them, who had been previously scheduled to attend the audit ended up attending the audit,” said Na Young, one of the LGBTI activists protesting against the ministry and the committee. Rep. You Seung-hee’s office denied the accusations. “The chairwoman of the committee cannot finalize the list of witnesses by herself,” said Kim In-ah from Rep. Yoo’s office. “It’s untrue that Rep. You denied their entry.”Women and human rights’ activists have been demanding the ministry recognize and validate LGBTI rights as a gender issue, while the ministry has said the rights of sexual minorities are irrelevant to the Gender Equality Act. It instead explained that the issue falls under the Human Rights Commission and the National Human Rights Commission Act.The activists tried to hand deliver a letter to Gender Minister Kim Hee-jung after the audit session. As the minister refused to accept it, Kim’s secretary accepted it instead. The activists said they told the secretary that the particular incident involving the Gender Ministry and the gender equality charter of Daejeon will be addressed at a meeting with U.N.

Lee is one of President Park’s closest aides.While the ministry is yet to make an official announcement of its decision -- which is slated to happen early this week -- the ruling camp is said to have prepared for the introduction of the state-authored textbook upon President Park’s orders.In February last year, Park told the Education Ministry to “prepare measures to improve, such as by developing a balanced history textbook based on facts.”Sources have said that the government appears to have decided to have a state-run agency author the textbook under its supervision, noting that reinforcing the authorization process would fall short of serving its purpose as the progressive Korean Teachers and Educational Workers Union would block selection of certain textbooks. The government has claimed that of the eight textbooks currently published by private houses, only one is conservative and the other seven are authored by mostly the same leftist authors.Sunday’s meeting was presided by Saenuri chief policymaker Rep. Kim Jung-hoon, and also attended by chairwoman of the special history textbook committee Rep. Kim Eul-dong. They reportedly shared views that current history education was being manipulated by the leftists’ ideological and political purposes and that normalization of the textbook was necessary for a balanced view on history and integration of the people.They also reportedly discussed ways to promote the move to the general public, such as by distributing casebooks to parents and students with a list of distorted and erroneous historical events and interpretations written in the current textbooks. The special committee is also set to produce various programs tailored for social networking platforms as well as arranging public hearings and seminars.“Some from the opposition are suggesting that the history textbook issue is relevant to the incumbent government’s ideological propensity, but that is absurd,” said Rep. Kang Eun-hee, a member of the special committee.The opposition, meanwhile, has been taking issue with what they said was President Park’s long-held goal of “setting straight” the accomplishments of her father ever since he was assassinated by his intelligence chief in 1979.They are said to be contemplating holding rallies and moving to link the government’s move with other key issues that they hold sway to, such as the approval of major economic or budget bills. They are also reportedly considering pushing for the resignation of the education minister.“It took years of democratic movements to change the state-authored textbook, the remnant of Yushin, to state authorization. No conspiracy that attempts to turn back time of the Republic of Korea will succeed,” said NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo. Yushin refers to the constitutional amendment by the Park Chung-hee administration that allowed him to stay in power.The minor Justice Party also vowed to fight alongside NPAD against the government’s move.“The Education Ministry and the ruling party claim that the authors of the textbook are leaning to the left. But such an argument is based on data compiled by ultrarightist groups,” said Justice Party floor leader Rep. Jeong Jin-hoo.Currently, eight private publishing companies print history textbooks for middle and high schools after getting approval from the government. The schools then can choose any of the eight publishers’ textbooks. Elementary schools have been using state-authorized history textbooks throughout.The government was in charge of publishing history textbooks from 1973 to 2009. In 2010, it began allowing approved private publishing companies to print history textbooks.From news reports","introduce state history textbooks ,unifying the history textbook ,history textbooks for secondary ,on state history textbook ,history textbook the government","['Saenuri Party', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Hwang Woo - yea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57349163  0.19177639

South Korean authorities concluded that the North intentionally implanted the wooden-boxed landmines in the DMZ. But the North has denied responsibility, calling the South’s claim a fabrication.

The report, “Teachers in Asia Pacific: Status and Rights,” analyzed: entry requirements; preservice training; recruitment and deployment; workload; professional development; salaries; retirement; assessment; unions; and school leadership.The study found a mismatch between the supply and demand of teachers in almost all of the countries while showing higher attrition rates in Samoa. Some countries showed overrepresentation of males in senior leadership roles, raising concern that the shortage of females in leadership position may lead to a lack of role models for girls. In South Korea, the percentage of female teachers has consistently been on the rise but the majority of leadership positions are still occupied by men. According to Statistics Korea, women accounted for 76.7 percent, 67.9 percent and 48.9 percent of teachers in elementary, middle and high schools in 2014. But female principals for respective education institutes were only 22 percent, 21.3 percent and 8.9 percent.Working hours and opportunities for professional development was another issue that stood out. Mongolian teachers for example, are expected to work outside the office to fulfill their responsibilities.In case of Korean teachers, they are required to spend far more time on administrative work than average teachers in members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. OECD’s Teaching and Learning International Survey found that 80 percent of Korean teachers believe that their long working hours are what hinder them from participating in professional development activities.The shortfall in teachers’ development was not derived from lack of trying, the report indicated. “Nevertheless, in many countries the government commitment to professional development is evident, as demonstrated in Uzbekistan and Korea by the recent increases in the budget allocations for it,” the report said. Korea’s Education Ministry mandates an annual 60 hours of job training for teachers.But the work overload for teachers is making it difficult for educators to train themselves, Korean teachers say.Another issue is that teachers in many Asian countries have trouble publicizing their opinions, such as by joining unions. In Cambodia, teachers are considered civil servants and are banned from joining a union, although they can join teachers’ associations. While there is no such taboo in Korea, teachers ― also considered civil servants ― are banned from taking actions that are deemed politically motivated.The study pointed out that factors such as participatory decision making, shared leadership, freedom and independence in the classroom, professional development opportunities, self-efficacy and incentives are all contributory factors to teachers’ performance. It suggested that authorities should recognize teachers’ contributions and insights to enhance their status and increase their morale, while providing them a channel to raise educational concerns and contribute to the policy-making process.“We have entrusted teachers with the critical task of molding the minds of future generations. They need, and deserve, our support to carry out their work,” said UNESCO Bangkok director Kim Gwang-jo. “(The study) is an initial step toward better understanding how teachers are regarded and supported in this region.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","overtime work gender discrimination ,asian teachers many teachers ,problems including overtime work ,work gender discrimination against ,voice ail asian teachers","['UNESCO', 'South Korea', 'Uzbekistan']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49505076 -0.0804125

(Air Force)They range from sign language translators who act as the gateway to the outside world for the deaf, to soldiers missioned with a crucial role to deliver military information in the world’s last-remaining divided country.In Korea, there are about 1,200 sign language translators. Their job goes beyond translating words into signs to also providing necessary administrative information and help outdoor activities for the deaf whose population here has reached 270,000 last year.Of them, around 500 interpreters hold expertise in translating the gestures of the deaf into proper sign language for those who could not learn the cheirology at an early age.Once certified as sign language translators, they are dispatched to various workplaces ranging from hospitals, courts and broadcasting stations to banks. In the case of courts, the interpreters are assigned per case instead of an individual involved in a lawsuit for privacy reasons. The job of a sign language interpreter requires state-authorized certificates which takes about three to four years to achieve on average.The most important factor of sign language interpretation is not the hands but the facial expression. “The sign language cannot be delivered without facial expression. In vocal languages, people without hearing problems can express the degree of pain or different nuances with the tone of voice. That is what the facial expression does in sign language,” said sign language translator Kwon Na-yeon at Seoul Korean Sign Language Professional Institute. She added that the different grammar order of Korean vocal language and the sign language remains a challenge despite her seven years of experience that calls for continuous training.Woo Jee-hee, 36, who works at a public sign language interpretation center in Seoul, said sign language translation inevitably takes more time.“This is about visualizing the vocal language. It takes usually 1.2 times longer to interpret simultaneously.”Meanwhile, interpretation in the military is also one of the rare fields that requires specialized skills with their work dealing with some of the most security-sensitive and confidential information.On the divided peninsula, military cooperation with the U.S. and other countries remains crucial, and interpreter officers are dispatched to joint military drills and high-level talks. Interpreter officers are picked through a set of exams that include written and verbal tests. Once enrolled, they go through military training and translation education before being designated to posts. There are those assigned to the fields of combined operations with the U.S. troops such as the Combined Forces Command, to those dispatched to the Defense Ministry, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other affiliated organizations that also deal with military cooperation with other countries.The unusual position entails professional terms and concepts that require quick learning and nonstop research. For smooth and accurate interpretation, interpreter officers stress that a strong mentality is essential.“I think the most important traits are mental agility and guts. It’s a highly technical job for which there are little to no scripted events. You need to be able to learn quickly and control yourself not to get intimidated or frozen, even when you’re interpreting matters of great sensitivity with some of the most important decision makers in the world,” said ex-Air Force interpreter officer Cho Koon-ho. He was once in charge of interpreting the live news conference over the probe result of the torpedo attack on the corvette Cheonan in March 2010. He was directed to interpret the conference just hours before the event, and with little familiarity of the naval and nautical jargon, he crammed a hefty amount of professional information.“The good thing about this job is that you are able to deploy a valued skill-set that makes a meaningful, visible positive impact.

This rule, however, does not apply to people with work visas, those entering the country to study, and those married to a South Korean citizen. (123rf)In addition, the government even gives 30-50 percent discounts to foreign nationals depending on what kind of visas they hold. A person holding a D-2 study visa can get 50 percent off in terms of the insurance payments they have to make.From 2012 through 2014, this preferential health insurance payment arrangement equaled 4 billion won ($3.3 million) in savings for foreigners, with some 101,162 people and households paying less, it said.""Under the changes, people with work visas will be excluded from the early preferential benefit scheme, and will have to wait like the others,"" the ministry said.

Russia, short of cash at the time, sent military equipment such as choppers, tanks and armored fighting vehicles to South Korea. The helicopters were made by Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise and built between Sept. 1986 and Dec. 2009.It said that operators of the chopper are required to report measures taken that call for exchange of faulty parts and to check each Ka-32 after every 50 hours of flight.In addition, Seoul will inform Russia of its findings so it too can check the safety of the rotary aircraft and take necessary measures.

Teachers need to reimagine what their classrooms should look like.”  U.S. educator Jon Bergmann speaks Thursday during the Global Education Forum 2015, hosted by Daekyo Culture Foundation at Daekyo Tower in Gwanak-gu, southwestern Seoul. (Global Education Forum 2015)Bergmann was in Seoul to attend the Global Education Forum 2015.The flipped classroom is a strategy that reverses the traditional education model to deliver the instructional content ― often in forms of online video lectures ― outside the classroom, partaking in activities in the classroom. Bergmann said the model put students at the center of the learning process, allowing them to learn at their own pace, instead of being fed information by teachers. “It has effects on (students’) learning behavior. Students who might have had trouble with the traditional method can take ownership of their own learning, instead of waiting for teachers to give it to them.The idea of an inverted learning model was initiated back when Bergmann was teaching high school chemistry in 2007. Bergmann and his colleague Aaron Sams had been recording lectures for students who missed classes when they started asking “what is the value of class time if you don’t have to go to the classroom to get information?”Prerecording the lectures and letting students acquire information via videos in advance opens up opportunities for the educators to conduct various creative activities, such as projects and debates in the classroom, according to Bergmann.“This is a way to get schools away from a factory level of teaching; making teachers more valuable than information assimilators,” he said.One of the common perceptions about the flipped classroom is that it is primarily about students studying through lecture videos, which leads educators to focus on creating the video more than the class activities themselves. Bergmann, however, said that flipped learning puts more emphasis on the relationship between students and teachers, as well as among students. “The flipped classroom is not about the (lecture) videos, it’s about active engagements you can have in classrooms,” Bergmann said. “(Classes) are not taught by computers, they’re taught by teachers,” he said.In Korea, the flipped classroom model has been practiced by some 250 schools since 2012. But there has been concern as to whether the new model can establish itself in Korean schools, where much learning is still based on rote memorization from lectures.Bergmann said that while there is a lot of value in rote learning, teachers would need to find balance between rote learning and constructive learning.Finding that balance is important in flipped learning, Bergmann pointed out, which is why the teachers’ role is more important than ever.“To flip a class takes a lot of time. There are no right ways, but there are ways to flip it wrong,” he said. “We need to encourage the teachers. Flipped learning will not make your teaching life easier, but it will make your teaching better.”By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education for youtube generation ,for youtube generation education ,education for youtube ,youtube generation education will ,youtube generation education","['U.S.', 'YouTube', 'Jon Bergmann']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43376201  0.4300161

""Out of 829 parts that were under review, only 41 were ordered to be modified,"" Judge Ji Dae-woon said.The amendment order had come after some left-leaning historians asked the government to ban a textbook they thought contained a conservative bias.They criticized the textbook published by Kyohak Publishing Co. for being partial to Japan, which colonized the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45, and for glorifying South Korea's past authoritarian governments.There are eight types of history textbooks in South Korea.While ordering Kyohak to revise some parts of its textbook, the Ministry of Education subsequently ordered the other seven textbooks, which had already been approved, to be modified.Historians were asked to clarify details about the 1950-53 Korean War; North Korea's ""juche,"" or self-reliance, ideology; and the 2010 torpedoing of a South Korean warship by North Korea, among other items.

The project, worth 319 million won ($270,000), was initiated last September and will continue through next April. Future soldiers take a psychological evaluation at the Seoul office of the Military Manpower Administration in January 2015. (Yonhap)“The idea itself that the ministry can use soldiers’ personal data at will is a problem,” said Rep. Kwon Eun-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, who revealed the project to the media on Sunday during the parliamentary audit of the government.“It is doubtful whether the database, should it be established, would be helpful to single out maladjusted troops.” The lawmaker also pointed out that concerns about the potential leak of personal data and violation of human rights had been raised by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs, and even the human rights division within the Defense Ministry.“Without soldiers’ consent about the use of their personal data, the collection of the data and analyses on the specific information of the soldiers should be restricted,” the MGAHA was quoted by Rep. Kwon as saying.Some officials within the Defense Ministry raised the possibility that the project could trigger opposition from draftees and their parents.In response, the Defense Ministry said that it would first analyze the legal matters involving the project and seek to address them, with an aim to establish a comprehensive database that would allow the military to more proactively prevent accidents and suicides.To build the database, the ministry plans to use soldiers’ personal data, the results of their aptitude tests and information from the ministry’s counseling and investigation authorities, the ministry explained in a statement.“The project is needed to better deal with the soldiers that we fear could get into accidents, and better evaluate the stable management of the troops for each unit,” the ministry said.The use of big data analyses to better manage the troops was pushed for as the ministry has been pushing to capitalize on innovative technologies such as information and communications technology and the Internet of Things, or Internet-connected products, under the “Creative Defense” vision.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","weapons and shooting rampage ,unfit draftees sparks privacy ,including desertions with weapons ,to screen unfit draftees ,accidents crimes or suicide",['the Defense Ministry'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41177219 -0.30404681

Korea currently has state-published history textbooks for elementary schools, but allows eight publishers to author books for middle and high schools. Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea has emphasized the importance of students learning from “one version of history” that will supposedly help students obtain the correct perception of history. Kim Moo-sung, chairman of the ruling Saenuri Party, is also one of most outspoken champions of the state history textbook. But the prospect of state-published history textbooks has prompted concerns from many educators across the country.Education superintendents from Seoul, Incheon and Gangwon and Gyeonggi Provinces released a joint statement Tuesday to decry the attempt.“The state must set the boundary of curriculum based on a social agreement, and allow education of various forms and content within that boundary,” they said, adding that state textbooks are “in disaccord with the values of democracy, autonomy or diversity.”Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said that 15 of 17 education chiefs in Korea disapprove of state history textbooks for secondary education.In a survey conducted by Kim on 24,195 teachers at middle and high schools throughout Korea, 77.7 percent of the respondents said they oppose the state history textbooks.“As the majority in the education circles oppose the state history textbooks, the government’s attempt to reinstate the system should be abandoned right now,” Kim said. The Korea Teachers and Education Worker’s Union, the nation’s largest left-leaning teachers’ group, also raised objections against the system, along with 2,255 members of the Association of Korean History Teachers who released a joint statement last week.But some groups have said that history textbooks published under the current system fail to impart accurate historical knowledge to students, and that the state needs to take control in authoring a “correct version of history” in textbooks.In a forum held Tuesday at the Korea Press Center in central Seoul, the right-leaning Parents’ Association for Reviving Public Education claimed that the current history textbooks contain content that is biased in favor of the leftists, such as by saying both South and North Korea are responsible for the 1950-53 Korean War.The state history textbook issue is expected to spark a bipartisan standoff during Thursday’s parliamentary audit of the Education Ministry.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","denying local news report ,denies decision on textbook ,dae wednesday denied reports ,day denying local news ,denying local news",['the Education Ministry'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18173181  0.50690395

Several environmental groups, including Green Korea United, said they would seek revocation against the government’s approval for the cable car project on Mount Seoraksan in Gangwon Province, claiming that the decision is invalid as it didn’t strictly follow the procedural rules.Last Friday, the ministry’s national park committee decided by a vote to allow the construction of a 3.5-kilometer cable car on Mount Seoraksan in Yangyang County. The cable car project had been mired in controversy over the ecological impacts and economic feasibility. “Yangyang County’s application for the cable car (that was submitted to the ministry) didn’t cover the ecological values of Mount Seoraksan, violating the ministry’s guidelines,” they said.Civic groups also claimed that the majority of the committee was unfairly composed of public servants who have likely sided with the ministry. They said they would request the Board of Audit and Inspection to examine the procedure followed for the project. They also urged lawmakers to carry out a parliamentary probe into the ministry’s decision and to pass the national park protection law that has been pending at the National Assembly. The law aims at prohibiting the installation of facilities in government-designated nature preservation districts. Yangyang residents and the municipal government have argued that the cable car will not only boost the local economy by bringing over 100 billion won ($85 million) of revenue, but also offer more diverse travel routes for mountain visitors, especially for the elderly and disabled.Environmentalists, on the other hand, have expressed ecological concerns, claiming that the proposed cable car route covers a natural habitat for a number of endangered species, especially an endangered type of mountain goat. Acknowledging the opposition, the ministry ordered the county office to fulfill seven preconditions ahead of starting the project. It includes strengthening safety rules and measures to support endangered species, mapping out facility monitoring and donating partial revenue to a forest protection fund.The project will go ahead once the environment minister gives the final approval. The cable car is scheduled to start running from February 2018 when the PyeongChang Winter Olympics are set to be held.

The plan was revealed in the ministry’s public hearing for the revision of the education curriculum for elementary, middle and high schools, held at the Korea National University of Education in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province. Monday’s hearing covered common subjects for elementary school students, Korean language, Chinese characters and foreign languages. The creation of the separate subject was in response to nationwide calls for a safety education program after last year’s sinking of Sewol ferry that left 305 dead or missing, 250 of whom were high school students on a field trip. While most of the blame fell on the ship’s crew ― including the captain ― who left the vessel without evacuating the passengers, experts across the country also pointed out that the Korean education system failed to equip students with survival skills that could have helped them in the situation. Hong Hoo-jo, a professor of education at Korea University, said schools should be responsible to more systematically teach students how to protect themselves and their friends in emergencies. The ministry also said it is planning to cut the burden of academic work for English and Korean languages, two key subjects, as well as the annual college entrance exam known here as the Suneung. “We assess that (the new curriculum) will cut the amount students that have to study by nearly 20 percent,” a ministry official said. In keeping with the trend of reducing the studying burden, the ministry is planning to abolish a curved grading system for its Suneung English exam. The current grading system sorts students into one of nine ratings based on their relative score.In order to reduce what President Park Geun-hye described as “excessive English education,” the ministry will introduce an absolute grading system, which rates students based on the numerical grade.In addition, the ministry said Korean language in the new curriculum will incorporate a developmental process of communication skills. For example, the elementary school lessons will be primarily based on speaking and hearing, while reading and writing skills will be stressed in high school.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","in new school curriculum ,new school curriculum ,accidents officials said monday ,new school curriculum south ,new subject in elementary","['South Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2947475   0.22658247

In South Korea, the Marriage Brokers Business Management Act require brokers and agencies to provide foreign women and Korean men with full information about their future spouses in the form of authorized documents. Those who fail to abide by the law can face up to three years in prison and a financial penalty of up to 2 million won. Lee allegedly gave their client a piece of paper with a simple profile of the girls, enabling him to choose based on their names, ages and educational backgrounds. The illicit practice, which human rights activists have condemned for treating women and girls like products, remains a popular way for Korean men to find foreign matches.According to the police, many foreign women are coerced into marrying Korean men they hardly know and having sex with them the next day. The lack of information provided by the brokers about potential spouses often leads to cases of marriage fraud, in which foreign wives ended up not entering Korea or running away from their husbands once they settled here, the police said. False advertising is another business tactic prevalent among international brokers. A 51-year-old man, surnamed Dae, was accused of using misinformation to lure customers. He allegedly claimed that his agency had overseas branches and had successfully set up marriages for 24 couples, neither of which was true. Some of the agencies were not even registered with the authorities as required. As part of efforts to avert marriage fraud, the authorities have toughened the requirements on international marriage agencies and brokers, which reduced the number of licensed matchmaking services. The number dropped by two-thirds, from 1,370 in 2012 to 449 in 2014, according to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. But the tightened regulations led to the creation of a black market of unlicensed matchmakers, with the number of marriage fraud cases hovering around 600 in recent years. As of January, there are 305,446 marriage migrants in Korea, with 83 percent of them being women. The largest numbers came from China and Vietnam.By Ock Hyun-ju  (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","100 illegal marriage brokers ,100 illegal marriage ,police nab 100 illegal ,nab 100 illegal marriage ,100 international marriage brokers","['Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'the Marriage Brokers Business Management Act', 'korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55382729  0.46187383

The overall number of businesses offering sex, gambling or similar services apprehended by police dropped to 48,121 last year from 51,652 in 2013 and 55,785 in 2012, the report submitted by the National Police Agency to New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. You Dae-woon showed.Of such businesses, more businesses were caught offering sex services, with the number rising to 8,952 cases last year from 4,553 in 2013 and 3,263 in 2012.It showed that while the number of such businesses identified by the police decreased by 13.7 percent, the number of sex trade businesses surged by nearly threefold.Other types of obscene businesses marked a decrease, including those operating on lewd or sexual services and gambling that dropped by 44.6 percent and 24.4 percent, respectively.While the overall number of obscene businesses has dropped consistently since 2012, some regions showed a surge over the two years, the report said.They included Seoul (up 33.1 percent), North Chungcheong Province (18.0 percent), Jeju (8.2 percent) and South Chungcheong Province (3.3 percent).By the number of sex trade instances alone, Jeju showed a tenfold increase from 10 cases in 2012 to 101 cases last year. The numbers increased in Daejeon as well from 21 to 128, and Daegu from 85 to 509.Police said the drastic surge in sex trade operations caught in Jeju stems from the increase in foreign tourism, and the rise in new forms of prostitution, such as via a clandestine mobile sex trading system.“Last year’s number showed a surge especially because we fortified the clampdown as one of the policy goals,” an official said. “This year, we are concentrating on enterprise-level sex traders and other actions that promote prostitution,” the official added.There have been rising calls for more sophisticated ways of catching sex traders as the sex industry was seen finding creative ways to avoid reinforced clampdowns.Another police report in May showed that more than 6,600 cases of prostitution were arranged on the new platforms last year, more than triple the number of cases they caught in 2010. The latest methods of sex trade include the usage of online chat rooms, social networking sites and smartphone applications, the police said. The debate on legalizing prostitution has heated up in South Korea as the Constitutional Court began reviewing the law that criminalizes the sex trade. The court held its first public hearing in April.The antiprostitution law was enacted in 2004 to protect human rights, partly prompted by a fire that killed 14 sex workers who were locked in a brothel in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, in 2002. The law stipulates that both purchasing and selling of sex carry a penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,560). It gives exemption to people forced into prostitution, leaving only voluntary sex workers -- many of whom oppose the law -- subject to the punishment.From news reports","police nearly triple in ,led crackdown against prostitution ,police nearly triple ,businesses caught by police ,sex trade businesses caught",[],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65932626  0.13259992

(123rf)Kim is one of some 2,200 fathers who have chosen to take paternity leave in Korea this year, fighting traditional gender roles that have long deterred Korean men from taking paid time off to participate in child care. According to a survey released by the Ministry of Employment and Labor on Tuesday, the number of fathers taking paternity leave in the first half of this year stood at 2,212, up 40.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. Behind the trend is the social atmosphere underscoring an importance of shared responsibility between men and women for family affairs and child care amid women’s rising economic power, an official from the ministry said. Still, it only accounted for 5 percent of those taking time off for child care, highlighting a bigger burden on Korean women than men in raising children. The total number of Koreans on paternity or maternity leave saw an increase of 15.8 percent in the first half from 37,373 the previous year to 43,272.However, workers for large companies were more likely to grab the opportunity for parental leave than those belonging to small and medium-sized enterprises. Nearly 56 percent of the men who took child care leave in the first half were employed at conglomerates with more than 300 staff members. Also, 65 percent of the fathers on paternity leave were concentrated in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, where most of the conglomerates’ headquarters are located. SMEs, however, were more prone to adopt the policy that reduces working hours and pays less for male workers as an alternative to parental leave. Out of 992 laborers who received a smaller paycheck in return for slashed working hours, 76 percent belonged to SMEs. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","men taking parental leave ,office worker punishing work ,korean men taking parental ,worker punishing work hours ,office worker punishing","['Kim Ji - hwan', 'Kim']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.319309    0.26982644

He turned himself in a week later, admitting all charges. The case went cold, however, after the victim refused to testify to the police.While the current law bans anyone of a sexual crime against a minor from resuming, or commencing, a teaching career, one has to have been formally fired for such accusation or sentenced by court for this clause to take effect. But earlier this month, the SMOE announced it would immediately step in to remove accused sex offenders from teaching posts. It has requested its disciplinary committee to fire Kim. When fired, he will no longer be eligible to teach at any school.The revamped antisex-crime measures came after a recent large-scale sexual harassment scandal at a high school in Seodaemun district, in which five teachers were accused of sexually harassing over 100 female victims for over a year.Amid public furor that resonated across the country, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn held an emergency meeting and vowed to immediately remove any teacher accused of sexual abuse from his or her post. Anyone who knowingly conceals a sex crime at a school can also face expulsion.Sex crimes in schools are often hushed up as the current manual on sex crimes says that such cases should be investigated by a school committee, composed of teachers at the said school. This has made the committee susceptible to pressure from school authorities wishing to sweep the case under the rug.The SMOE said it would push to mandate outside authorities to participate in the committee.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sex offender teacher seoul ,permanently ban male teacher ,sex offenders the teacher ,ousts sex offender teacher ,sex offender teacher","['Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'SMO']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63418031 -0.13661361

One of the teachers, a man in his 50s, approaches a female teacher in her 30s and invites her to dance the blues with him. She rejects, but the man does not take no for an answer and the playful approach turns into an ugly scuffle involving unwanted physical contact, buttons torn apart and the victim striking the attacker with a microphone. All of thishappened with around 10 of their colleagues watching, including the school principal.“I was so shocked when I finally hit (the attacker) with the mic and the principal grabbed me (from hitting him further),” the victim recently told local media, adding that the principal did nothing to prevent the harassment from happening in the first place. Members of a parents’ group hold a rally protesting the sexual harassment cases of a high school in Seoul in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in downtown Seoul last Thursday. YonhapThe principal of the school ― located in Seodaemun-gu, central Seoul ― attempted to hush up the incident, to which the teachers reluctantly agreed, according to an anonymous source claiming to have a personal connection to the principal. When the case finally came to light in May after another teacher reported it to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, it was found to be only one of hundreds of other sexual harassment cases alleged to have occurred at the school. Five male teachers ― including the principal ― were accused of being involved in verbal and physical harassment against some eight teachers and more than 100 students. After a two-month investigation, the SMOE filed charges against the teachers to the local police, who began investigating the case last week. The case also shed light on unchecked sex crimes at schools and the lack of preventive and reprimand measures.While the karaoke incident took place more than a year ago in February 2014, the offender got away with a slap on the wrist, by being put on sick leave for about a year before he was transferred to another school. As public outcry grew, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Education Ministry and the SMOE last week vowed a “zero tolerance” policy on sexual predators in schools, including a one-strike rule that would ban teachers convicted of a sex crime from teaching again.The revision will also include immediately removing a teacher accused of sexual abuse from his or her post, and mandating the school committee reach a decision on the punishment within 30 days, shortened from the current regulation of 60 days.The measures, however, invited more criticism for having come too late, while exposing how weak the anti-sex crime measures in school had been.Loopholes in the current law had been making it particularly hard to protect teachers from abuse. Relevant laws including the Act on the Prevention of and Countermeasures against Violence in Schools stipulate that a teacher who committed a sex crime against a minor can be fired immediately, but there is no such clause covering sex crimes against adults. Even in the case of a sex crime against a minor, the teacher can still retain his or her license unless he or she is sentenced with a fine of 1 million won or more.In addition, the law mandates the offender should be removed from the school only after the teacher is charged, meaning the alleged victim and the attacker could remain at the same school for several months.Punishment against those who committed sex crimes have also been criticized as being lenient. According to Education Ministry data revealed by Rep. Han Sun-kyo of the Saenuri Party, 231 teachers have received disciplinary actions from January 2011 to June this year. But more than half, or 123, are still teaching at schools.In January, an Incheon court sentenced an English teacher to a 10 million won ($8,600) fine for touching his 16-year-old student’s thigh because she was “not concentrating in class.” The court said it handed down a lighter punishment because the accused had no criminal record. “Repeat crimes are more common among sex criminals than others. This begs the question of whether it is okay to let sex offenders return to their teaching posts,” said Rep. Han.After the nationwide furor incited by the Seodaemun-gu school incident, the authorities vowed to change the law to allow immediate removal of all sex offenders and to ban anyone with a history of sex crime from becoming a teacher. The Education Ministry said it would implement a system where victims can directly report the sex crimes to the authorities.But teachers remain skeptical about whether the new measures will encourage victims to come forward.Some also questioned the legal jurisdiction of the new measures to be enforced by the administrative sector, as it could run counter to the presumption of innocence until found guilty by the judiciary.A 25-year-old teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her colleagues often felt “discomfort” at the actions of other teachers but have been reluctant to point them out.“If the accused can return to school at any time, who would want to alert the authorities?” she said. She added that even if the direct reporting system was implemented, the victims would be hard-pressed to place their faith on the anonymity that the system claims to provide.“A school is a small place. Everyone pretty much knows what went on between people, and it’s only a matter of time before word gets out that somebody blew the whistle,” she said.An official from the Korean Women’s Development Institute pointed out that while many of the sex crime cases in schools go through the school disciplinary committee, the school’s priority is often to downplay the case to protect its reputation.Teachers say the scariest element about school sex crimes is that repetition and tolerance may lead to misperception about what is right and wrong.The victimized teacher at the Seodaemun-gu school told local media that sexual harassment had become somewhat of a “culture” at the school. “At first, students were so shocked to hear about the (verbal harassment), but soon they became accustomed to it. Their perception of what was right and wrong was clouded, as (sex abuse) became the norm. I don’t know how we can fix that,” she said.

But it was also cited as a major factor causing human atrocities, including massacres and bullying. What do we do when someone we love, or someone who belongs to our family or community, causes harm to the lives of strangers? Such questions entered my mind as the congresswomen of the ruling Saenuri Party have been collectively silent over the rape allegations against their fellow party lawmaker Sim Hag-bong this week.Further, it led to questions over whether it was unfair to demand politicians to fight against this particular human nature in such a case of an alleged crime, leastwise an ethical lapse.Rep. Kim Eul-dong (above) is one of the ruling Saenuri Pary`s congresswomen who have been collectively silent over the rape allegations against their fellow party lawmaker Sim Hag-bong. (Yonhap)Sim is facing sex crime allegations made by a female insurance planner in her 40s, who first claimed that the lawmaker raped her in a hotel room in Daegu. While Sim admitted to having had intercourse during business hours, he claimed it was consensual. The alleged victim later recanted her testimony saying that she had “not resisted as forcefully as she could have,” prompting speculation of an attempt on Sim’s part to cover up the case. As public outcry grew against the police for dropping the case, the prosecution announced Wednesday it would reinvestigate the claims.The female politicians of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have been taking to the podium, releasing statements calling for Sim’s resignation from his lawmaker’s seat.While even some Saenuri Party members have voiced no tolerance toward the allegation, absent from the whole scene were the female members of party, who were previously extremely vocal against sex crime allegations among politicians of other parties.One of the silent Saenuri congresswomen is the current Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung.It is not the first time they remained silent over sex crime allegations against their allied male politicians. The women lawmakers made no public statements when Park Hee-tae, a former National Assembly speaker, faced sexual assault allegations made by a 23-year-old female caddie working at a golf club last year.Some may say staying silent is not an act of unfairness. But as Desmond Tutu famously pointed out, when one is neutral in situations of injustice, he or she has chosen the side of the oppressor. As human nature, we want to fit in with the tribe we belong to. Yet, lawmakers are asked to make themselves an exception, as their duty is to be involved with the lives of others -- strangers who do not belong to their family or their community. Their job is to work beyond their self-interests. In this case, the female members of the conservative party can be seen as particularly cowardly for keeping mum on issues that otherwise would have taken center stage in their privileged platform of gender equality and female-related policies.It’s impossible for them to not realize the seriousness of the Sim Hag-bong’s case and the allegations made against him, although everyone is innocent until proven guilty.To have the intellect to realize what’s going on but lack the ethics to care and speak out on the concerns is an act of injustice on the lawmakers’ part. Their job is not to care for their fellow lawmakers, but to serve the public -- by recognizing mistakes of our times and making efforts so they aren’t repeated. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","factor causing human atrocities ,for justice many scientists ,many scientists and psychologists ,human atrocities including massacres ,causing human atrocities",[],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43642271  0.23569359

It was the first investigation by the joint working group at the base since the Pentagon announced in May that live samples of the lethal bacterium were sent from a U.S. military laboratory to laboratories in nine U.S. states and the American military base in South Korea. A U.S. probe confirmed later that 86 American and foreign labs had received the anthrax spores, which were not completely inactive. ""This joint working group will continue to ensure reliability and transparency of the ROK-U.S. capabilities to defend the Republic of Korea,"" USFK Maj. Gen.

Individual schools should have the final say-so when it comes to deciding education-related changes,” said the 71-year-old educator, who spent over 40 years as a teacher and education reformer in the provincial town of Geochang, South Gyeongsang Province.For decades, Geochang High School has gained nationwide fame under Chun’s auspices for its unorthodox methods that encompasses a strong character-building process, while enjoying its share of success in being among the nation’s top high schools in college admission process as well.In the 1990s, the tiny school in rural Korea was put on the map after then-President Kim Young-sam praised Chun for the success of his school.  Chun Sung-eun (Yoon Min-sik/The Korea Herald)Chun has been one of most outspoken opponents of South Korea’s top-down education system. In Korea, schools in 17 provinces and cities across the country are under the supervision of their education offices, which are in turn are supervised by the Education Ministry. The curricular revision, textbook authorization and pursuit of major education policies are decided by the authorities and relayed back to schools in a top-down manner.The hierarchy, which the system is based on, hinders the education reform process, he argued. Added to that, Korean parents’ education fever is legendary. On the coattails of the government rolling out its plans for character building education, private institutes for character building have popped up, scurrying to catch the attention of the zealous parents.Chun said this was the side effect of a defective education system, which has all of the students racing toward a single goal: getting accepted at a prestigious university. Instead of evaluating each student’s talents and needs, the education system lines them up in an order based on their test grades.“Our education has pushed children into a pit of constantly escalating competition. Parents had no choice as their children’s success is only based on school grades,” he said. “This is a sin committed by our education on the people of Korea.”Tackling relatively minor issues like “character education” will do little to change this culture of competition, he said. “Since Korea’s liberation in 1945, there has never been a real education policy on the Korean peninsula,” he said, adding that the only way is to completely change how we approach education. According to Chun, the relationship between the school and the ministry should be on equal footings in which the authorities can provide support for each individual school instead of dictating how they should be operated. “The discord between education policymakers and those in the field is due to the ministry’s excessive control,” he said. “Schools and teachers should have the liberty to design their own plans on how to teach their subjects.”Korea’s college evaluation, for example, has come under criticism for making higher education institutes into de facto cram schools for seeking jobs. Major criteria in the reform involves the employment rate of schools’ graduates, which results in the institutes shutting down departments that have low employment rates, like those in humanities.Chun said evaluation should not be conducted by authorities, who have the power to control schools’ budgets. Instead independent assessment bodies should evaluate the teachers and schools. Chun called it the “triangle model” of education ― independent evaluation, the ministry’s support and each school dictating how to operate itself.The model was devised when the former principal was working as the inaugural head of the Presidential Committee on Education Innovation, formed in 2003 by then-President Roh Moo-hyun. The “admission officer program,” which has universities evaluate students on not just grades, but various other qualities, was a brainchild of the committee.The point of the program was to ensure that admission offices would get to assess what each student is good at, rather than looking at his or her test scores. An ideal way is to get students to create a portfolio in the admission process, which would contain one’s curricular and extracurricular activities, Chun said.Chun said the school system should be more about just going to a top-tier school in the next phase. Elementary level education should be about letting children find out what they are good at; secondary education should help students judge which policies are the most beneficial to themselves.Over the past few years, there has been a debate in Korea about whether teachers should remain politically neutral. “A democratic society allows all members to state what they believe in. As long as secondary education helps students have critical views of policies, teachers should be able to make political statements,” he said.Higher education, finally, should be about maximizing the students’ talents and potential, he concluded.Basically education has to be about preparing students for their future, which includes helping them to choose their prospective careers, he said. As principal of Geochang High School, Chun and his colleagues introduced the so-called “10 commandments of choosing a job,” which went viral across the country soon after.Among the ideas promoted are urging students to choose the job they are needed in, instead of one that they desire to work in. It also encourages students to seek new frontiers and not to let low wage, lack of promotion or social status discourage them from searching for their goal.But the efforts by his school was not enough, Chun said. “All I could do was arm my students mentally,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","schools geochang last month ,presidential education committee during ,last month the education ,month the education ministry ,of presidential education","['the Education Ministry', 'Chun Sung - eun', 'Geochang High School', 'Roh Moo - hyun']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81053424  0.32358658

All the pills illegally being sold online and off-line without a prescription as of May were counterfeit and not confirmed to be safe, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.(Yonhap)According to a poll of 1,500 men who have taken medication to treat their erectile dysfunction, 1,015 people, or 67.7 percent of the surveyed, said they had obtained the pills illegally without a prescription. Of the 1,015 people who illegally purchased the pills, 67.6 percent said that they could “easily” access the drugs. Nearly 20 percent said they were reluctant to go to hospitals to obtain a prescription to treat impotence. In Korea, medications to treat erectile dysfunction, including Viagra and Cialis, can only be purchased with a valid prescription from a doctor due to safety issues. Led by the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management, the survey is based on telephone interviews conducted from May to July in 2013 with 1,500 adults throughout the nation.The younger generation was more likely to seek fake erectile dysfunction pills, according to the poll.Those in their 20s and 30s respectively had experience with fake Viagra pills three and two times more than men in their 60s, the study showed without revealing exact numbers.Asked how the men accessed the pills, eight in 10 people said they obtained the drugs through a friend. About 8 percent of the respondents said they bought them online and 7.4 percent from sex shops. The survey also showed that six of 10 men suffering from side effects of the impotence pills were found to have taken counterfeit drugs, raising concerns over the safety of cheap fake medication for impotence. The fake drugs were found to contain excessive doses of sildenafil or tadalafil, which can heighten risks for heart attack and myocardial infarction.  Despite safety concerns, Korea has seen a growing amount of counterfeit drugs for impotence smuggled in from China. The National Tax Service detected 1,443 cases of smuggled impotence medicine worth 584 billion won ($500 million) in total from 2010 to 2014, hitting an all-time high last year with 668 cases.The study was published in the latest journal for Korean College of Clinical Pharmacy.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","all the pills illegally ,patients take fake viagra ,counterfeit impotence pills with ,pills illegally being sold ,sunday all the pills","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66980433  0.56276125

If we find that the school attempted to conceal or downplay the incidents, it will be held responsible,” said Kim Hyeong-nam, a member of the SMOE audit team.The SMOE, which pledged severe punishment for those confirmed of their crimes, also came under fire for having mismanaged the situation until the case was reported to the police and eventually the prosecution by one of the victim’s parents.According to SMOE, the string of sexual violence cases started in February 2014. Some 130 students and eight teachers have so far testified to being sexual harassed.One of the accused, a 50-something teacher, for instance, allegedly made sexual advances on a female teacher in her 30s during the faculty’s dinner outing despite her vehement protests, ripping off her clothes in the process. The victim has claimed that her request for a reprimand against the teacher was repeatedly ignored.The supposed offender was placed on sick leave for about a year and transferred to another school in March, where he is still teaching. The decision to transfer a teacher to another school can only be finalized by the SMOE in case of high schools. The principal told local media that he phoned the city education office before transferring the teacher in question, fueling suspicion that the situation was overlooked by the authorities.“We are currently trying to figure out when exactly the SMOE found out about (the sexual harassment cases),” Kim said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","massive school sexual harassment ,school sexual harassment ,school sexual harassment under ,male teachers at seoul ,harassing their female colleagues","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43727946 -0.14936443

Starting from Monday, the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee will begin a session to hear from the National Intelligence Service’s top officials, including its chief Lee Byung-ho, about the result of the agency’s internal investigation. The NIS has been recovering the deleted data of its official who committed suicide earlier this month over the burgeoning scandal. The main political parties are expected to lock horns over the sufficiency of the spy agency’s internal probe to dispel the widespread public suspicion over the NIS’ civilian surveillance. The ruling Saenuri Party has been urging the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy to accept the results and accused it of politicizing the sensitive matter involving national security. The NPAD, for its part, is expected to launch a full-fledged blame game by criticizing the ruling bloc for protecting the spy agency citing widespread public distrust and a number of lingering suspicions of an alleged cover-up by the NIS, particularly over the death of its agent. The agent was found dead in his car in an apparent suicide after having deleted relevant records on his computer. Lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. (Yonhap)“I understand the NIS has recovered 100 percent of the delated files and are analyzing what it has retrieved,” said Rep. Moon Jeong-lim, floor speaker of Saenuri Party. “The NIS should come forward and tell the people exactly what happened without an ounce of doubt. I am confident they will,” said Moon. “Besides, given the threat from North Korea’s cyberattack, we need to stop compromising our cyberwarfare capability and discouraging those dedicated to enhancing the capability. NPAD should refrain from seeking political gains (over the hacking scandal),” added Moon.NPAD, however, demanded the agency go extra miles to prove that it had not engaged in any irregularities. The opposition urged the spy agency to submit some 30 documents, including all log files of the Remote Control System, a software that can tap into mobile phone. The opposition asserted that the files would be the best way for the NIS to clear wiretapping charges as they recorded data about how the hacking device was being used. NIS has refused to disclose the files, citing it might contain sensitive national security information.“We expect sincere cooperation from the NIS during a parliamentary session to hear from the officials,” said Rep. Kang Hee-yong, NPAD vice spokesman in a statement. “We will treat the session as a de facto parliamentary hearing. We are committed to getting to the bottom of the scandal,” said Kang. “If the NIS refuses to change its attitude toward the scandal, it will face a full-fledged national inspection and special prosecution. We urged NIS and Saenuri Party to help us reveal any wrongdoings and bring the nation back on track,” said Kang. The hacking allegations are expected to be discussed at three other parliamentary committees opening this month including the communications committee, defense committee and security committee.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","over hacking scandal lawmakers ,hacking scandal lawmakers ,nis over hacking scandal ,parliamentary probe this week ,hacking scandal lawmakers are","['the National Assembly ’s Intelligence Committee', 'the National Intelligence Service ’s', 'Lee Byung - ho']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46458948  0.76721436

As the secretary said, it was a serious mistake. It should never have happened. It's an inexcusable mistake. We're taking the actions to correct it,"" Undersecretary of Defense ...","The United States said Thursday it was an ""inexcusable mistake"" to ship a live anthrax sample to an American military base in South Korea, promising to consult the Asian ally in case of a similar shipment in the future.  ""This was a mistake. As the secretary said, it was a serious mistake. It should never have happened. It's an inexcusable mistake. We're taking the actions to correct it,"" Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall told reporters.  Kendall made the remark during a briefing on the outcome of an investigation into the erroneous shipments of live anthrax samples to 86 laboratories in 20 states, Washington, D.C., and seven foreign countries, including South Korea's Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul.  ""It was an unintended delivery. It was anthrax that was believed to be inactivated and not live and not able to be grown went to an air force base in Korea to a laboratory on that base for testing there. I don't think it ever would have gone anywhere else,"" Kendall said.  The official stressed that the U.S. had intended to deliver inactivated anthrax spores as part of efforts to make sure that the country is ""in a position to protect people in the case of an anthrax attack in Korea or anywhere else if we ship it.""  Kendall said the U.S. has no intent to resume anthrax shipments, but even if it does, it would consult Korea.  ""I can't speculate about what may happen in the future. Anything that we did do, I can assure you, though would be done in consultation with the Korean government, and there is a task force now working with the Korean government to investigate the specific events that happened at Osan,"" he said.  When the case surfaced in late May, U.S. Forces Korea said the sample delivered to Osan was destroyed after it was suspected of being live, but 22 civilian and military personnel ""may have been exposed"" and were given emergency treatment, though none of them showed any signs of exposure.  It said the sample was brought in for a training exercise aimed at testing field equipment and new systems designed to identify toxins and pathogens. North Korea is believed to be capable of cultivating various types of biological agents, such as anthrax, and producing them into biological weapons.  On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Defense unveiled a report after a 30-day investigation into the case.  It blamed ""inherent deficiencies"" in protocols for killing anthrax spores, claiming that ""a single root cause"" for the accident could not be identified and that the Department of Defense personnel correctly followed their own protocols -- albeit lacking -- to make anthrax samples inactive before shipments.  ""A key finding by the committee is that there is insufficient technical information in the broader scientific community to guide the development of thoroughly effective protocols for inactivation of spores and viability testing of (Bacillus anthracis),"" the report said.  ""This has contributed to the creation of protocols that do not completely or permanently sterilize BA with gamma irradiation. The absence of this critical information is a scientific communitywide problem and needs to be addressed with irradiation standards and viability testing procedures,"" it said.  The report said that the investigative committee found ""inherent deficiencies"" in protocols for the production of inactive spores that could lead to non-sterile products for three phases -- radiation dosing, viability testing and contamination prevention.   The report said that the anthrax samples contained low numbers of live spores and ""did not pose a risk to the general public.""Nonetheless, the shipment of live samples is a ""serious breach of regulations,"" the report said.  Thursday's report only made a series of usual recommendations, such as enhancing quality control programs at Department of Defense laboratories, making labs follow a common procedure for irradiation and viability testing, and establishing quality control procedures for inactivation and viability testing of anthrax spores.  U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter apologized for the incident and promised to take proper actions to prevent a recurrence when he met with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo on the sidelines of an annual security forum in Singapore.   South Korea and the U.S. have also formed a joint working group to investigate the incident.   The case has also given rise to calls for revising the Status of Forces Agreement, which stipulates the legal rights and obligations of some 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, in a way that requires the U.S. military to notify the host nation in advance before bringing in such hazardous materials.  Anthrax is a lethal disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, but the term is commonly used to refer to the causative agent itself.In 2001, anthrax-laced letters were mailed to U.S. news media and Senate offices and killed five people.  Following the Thursday report, USFK vowed efforts to ensure its biological defense programs with South Korea be continued in a safe and effective manner.   ""Alliance biological defense programs are designed to enhance Alliance readiness and defensive capabilities in the face of a very real and significant biological threat,"" USFK commander Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti was quoted as saying in a separate USFK press release in Seoul.   Under the program, the allies conduct annual exercises to enhance combat readiness against North Korea's biochemical weapons.  ""The establishment of the ROK-U.S. Alliance's Biological Defense Cooperation Joint Working Group will ensure continued cooperation on biological defense programs,"" Scaparrotti said.

The MMA had filed charges against Bae for violating the Military Service Act, which stipulates that any person subject to military conscription and whose travel permit has expired must return to Korea. The public’s interest erupted at the news, and the 29-year-old golfer became one of the most frequently searched keywords on Naver and Daum, Korea’s biggest search engines. Within hours, Bae ― once hell-bent on postponing the enlistment ― threw in the towel.“I respect the decision of the court, and will honor it humbly. I feel that returning home and fulfilling my military duties as soon as I can will help me mature further as a golfer,” said Bae, who has two PGA wins under his belt. He reiterated that he never intended to dodge his services and wanted only to improve his career. Bae Sang-moon (Yonhap)The golfer’s case showed that military services remain a thorny issue for Korean athletes playing overseas. Since the 1950-53 Korean War ceased in an armistice, the two Koreas remain technically at war. As such, all able-bodied Korean men are required by law to serve in the military for at least 21 months between ages 18 and 35. The service period varies according to branches: 21 months for the Army and the Marine Corp., 23 for the Navy and 24 for the Air Force.Spending two years in the barracks is taxing for anyone not looking to pursue a career in the military, but it presents a bigger challenge for athletes as it coincides with the prime of their careers.As an option for athletes to continue their playing careers, Korean law allows them to join Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps. The KAFAC teams ― covering most major sports including soccer, baseball and basketball ― compete in division 2 leagues or with college leagues. This allows players to hone their athletic skills during their service, although the limited roster means only a handful of players are able to benefit from the system.But for players competing overseas, a two-year absence from their respective leagues posts hurdles in their careers.Choo Shin-soo, an outfielder for the Texas Rangers, is one Korean athlete who recently wrestled with his military duties. In 2010, the then 28-year-old baseball player was running out of options as the military duty loomed over him.The two-year absence would have severely affected his career, as he was on the verge of blossoming into a star. His then-team, the Cleveland Indians, was also concerned. Choo confirmed in a TV interview the rumors that the Indians suggested Choo apply for U.S. citizenship.  Choo Shin-soo (AP-Yonhap)Fortunately for Choo, his concern was taken care of when the Korean national team won the gold at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games later that year. Korea’s conscription law states that those who have contributed significantly to the nation through athletic or artistic skills are exempt from military duties, although they must go through four weeks of combat training. The law was implemented in 1981 and revised in 1984 and 1990. It applies to athletes who win a medal in an Olympics event or those receiving the top ranking at an international sporting competition where 15 or more countries are participating.The law was later revised again in the 2000s. When the Korean men’s soccer team made the improbable trip to the semifinals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the government decided to revise the conscription law to exempt anyone who has advanced to the knock-out stages of the World Cup from military duty. Another clause was added to the conscription law to give the same benefit to the men’s baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, which also reached the semifinals.Players like soccer player Park Ji-sung ― a key player in Korea’s 2002 World Cup run at the age of 21 ― were left free to roam the international stage without worrying about military duties.But talks of favoritism forced the authorities to remove both clauses in 2007. Since 2008, the conscription law only exempts athletes who win a medal at an Olympics event or finish first in competition at the Asian Games.Regardless of the exemption, conscription of players advancing overseas has always been a source of heated debate, with things not ending in such an amicable fashion for some. While the fans’ support for Korea’s treasured players advancing overseas and broadening their career and Korea’s sports recognition is high, the public’s susceptibility to condemn any inkling of an attempt to dodge the demanding military service is equally prevalent, making the matter difficult to solve.In 2001, Korean-born baseball player Baek Cha-seung in the U.S. was accused of attempting to dodge military duties when he refused to return to Korea after his travel permit expired. He was moving back and forth between the major and minor leagues at the time. Four years later, he renounced his Korean citizenship and became a U.S. citizen.Baek recently claimed that he never intended to dodge military service and had only acquired U.S. citizenship to continue playing baseball, but it was well after he was labeled a “draft dodger” by the public.Similar criticism befell once-prominent prospect Park Chu-young in 2012. The then 27-year-old forward for Arsenal in the English Premier League had obtained a 10-year residency in Monaco ― where he played for two years ― which allowed him to delay his service until he turned 37.  Park Chu-young(Yonhap)Park eventually was exempt from military service after the Korean team grabbed a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics. But the public was not pleased by the fact that a player once hailed as Korean soccer’s golden boy used a loophole in the law to avoid military duties, and the subsequent furor pressured the MMA to revise the law.“According to the regulation at the time, people could acquire travel permits a year after they got the green card. But now it takes three years to get the permit,” said an MMA official.The revision had directly influenced Bae, who got the U.S. green card in 2013. He was previously permitted to stay abroad on a clause that allows students of tertiary education institutes to postpone their services until the age of 29.Although Bae said he will join the military, the MMA has already filed charges against him for his refusal to return to Korea in December 2014. Local police will investigate him within 30 days of his return.While Bae’s case is nearing the end, the military issue continues to provide hurdles for other Koreans pursuing athletic careers outside of Korea.Several English clubs, including Liverpool, are rumored to be eyeing Son Heung-min, the Bayer Leverkusen attacker and one of the country’s brightest young star soccer players. But supporters of Liverpool have expressed concerns about acquiring a player who might miss two years in his prime due to conscription.“If Son is required to enlist in 2020, this would mean that Liverpool would potentially only have access to his talents for four seasons ― the risks beyond this would be that any resale value of an inactive Son would plummet,” wrote Jack Lusby, a writer for “This is Anfield,” an independent Liverpool Football Club supporters’ website.

In recent years, the crimes of distributing sexually explicit videos along with the victims’ personal information online have been rising in South Korea. In some cases, victims’ jobs, college, major and even names are revealed, leaving an indelible stain on them. However, it is still not easy to catch the criminals with current investigation techniques. Even if they are caught, the punishment is mild compared to victims’ suffering. The program is also set to cover upgrading hidden camera crimes. Criminals increasingly distribute videos, secretly taken, on porn sites rather than simply collecting them. This becomes a serious social issue as most victims are not aware that their videos are distributed online. Even if they find out them, it is still almost impossible to completely delete the video online. There is even a category named “Stealing a Peek” on porn sites where such videos are featured.“PD Notebook” is set to tell what motivates people to commit such crimes and how to prevent them in the upcoming episode, which airs on Tuesday at 11:15 p.m.The program is noteworthy for its role in stimulating the U.S. beef protest and raising questions over scientist Hwang Woo-suk’s subsequently discredited stem cell cloning.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)","light on revenge porn ,on revenge porn sexually ,revenge porn mbc mbc ,with revenge porn mbc ,deals with revenge porn",['MBC)MBC ’s'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37755504  0.14899415

(Yonhap)As public distrust escalated upon reports of the hacking allegations, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has set up a special probe committee, calling the case an unprecedented hacking scandal.The NIS went on to highlight that their actions were for the sake of national security and that such an“irresponsible” debate was destroying “our own security.”Earlier on Friday, the two main political parties said they would conduct a bipartisan inspection into the agency.“The field inspection should be carried out before the end of this month,” Lee Chul-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party told reporters, adding that senior officials from the Saenuri Party and the NPAD would meet Monday to work out details.The decision came three days after the National Intelligence Service acknowledged in a closed-door briefing that it had purchased RCS software, referring to Remote Control System technology, but denied using it to monitor the country’s people.The software program can be used to hack data by installing spyware, allowing hackers to manipulate and track smartphones and computers.The NIS said it bought the hacking program from Milan-based Hacking Team in 2012, though it said it did not use the software for the surveillance of South Korean citizens. The agency noted that it has used most of its programs for the purpose of strengthening cyberwarfare capabilities against Pyongyang.Another ruling party official said 18 out of 20 hacking programs were used to try to glean intelligence on North Korea and the two others for research purposes.

(Yonhap)The weir was constructed in 1988 to control the water level, control water flow and prevent floods. It also aimed at playing a security role in preventing underwater infiltration by North Korean spies. Since last month, algal bloom spread has been detected in the Hangang River, with the Seoul Metropolitan Government issuing an algal bloom warning on June 30 in the downstream section. The government expanded the alert later to nearly all sections of the river in the capital. It was the first such warning in 15 years.The green tide poses harmful ecological impacts as it hinders the water flow and causes odors. It also contains toxic substances such as microcystin-LR, which can cause respiratory problems or even paralysis in humans. While the continuous drought and high temperatures are generally suspected as the main causes, some experts argue that Singok weir is actually a major culprit behind the green tide, citing the unusual starting point of the algae. “If there’s enough water flow, the problematic phenomenon does not occur. The algal bloom usually starts from the Paldang Dam in Gyeonggi Province and spreads to the Hangang River. This time, however, the green tide started from downstream where the weir is located,” said KFEM director Lee Sae-gul. According to the city government, the green tide was first concentrated in the 5-kilometer-long section around the Singok weir, spanning from Haengju Bridge to Banghwa Bridge this year.While the long-awaited rain showers last weekend mitigated the algal bloom, the city government has not lifted the warning alert yet, saying that the green tide level is likely to go up again. A day after the rain, the level started to rebound, the city said. “Once the green tide settles in a certain spot, it makes its periodical appearance,” said Kim Jung-wook, the president of the Korean Society of Limnology, warning that the algal bloom around Singok weir will occur annually.  Since 1998, experts have warned that the weir could seriously slow down the water flow, worsening the ecological system. They argued that the deaths of numerous fish near the weir late last month was caused by the green tide as well. Over 600 kilograms of dead fish were found June 27, three days before the algal bloom warning was issued. “The small dam slows down the water flow speed by two times, making it easier for the green tide to grow as the water pollutants remain stagnant,” Lee added. Fishermen in the neighboring area, however, refute such a scenario, arguing that the fish deaths were not caused by the algal bloom, but wastewater. “If the green tide was the real cause, then all the fish in the Hangang River would have had to die. The fish died only on June 27. I believe the illegal effluent, which massively flew toward the Singok weir region by those who attempted to throw away the wastewater on a rainy day, affected it,” said Park Chan-soo, the representative of a fisherman group in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.  About 40 fishermen who work near Singok weir claimed that the water level will go down if the weir is removed and that would pose difficulties to their means of living. “The weir supplies crucial water for farmers in our province. Plus, if the water level is not controlled, there will be highs and lows in the river. All fishermen will flock to the high water level areas, letting all fish get caught in a few years,” he added. Some experts also sided with the fishermen. “The small dam safely prevents the mud from coming up the river. If there’s no weir, the mud can affect the river because of the tidal current,” said civil engineering professor Jang Suk-hwan at Daejin University. The Ministry of Environment also remains cautious of linking the weir to the problematic green tide. “It’s very difficult to say that the small dam contributed to the ecological problem. Drought is more likely to have affected the phenomenon. Since last summer, the discharged water from Paldang Dam nearly halved because of the drought, having the Hangang River stay stagnant,” said a ministry official in a press conference Thursday. While the controversy goes on, a half-year study conducted by Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2013 has shown that it would be economically beneficial to tear down the small dam. The study showed that pulling it down would boost biodiversity and river quality as it would drop the biochemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll-A by up to 4 percent and 19 percent, respectively. The removal project was anticipated to cost about 17 billion won ($15 million). The city, however, decided in April to conduct the study again as some questioned the result, claiming that it was exaggerated.Even if the second study finds similar results, the city does not have the discretion to tear down the concrete construction, as the small dam is owned by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. “(We) know that the city doesn’t have any authority to unilaterally get rid of the weir. The study just aims at gathering the basic information as part its efforts to come up with solutions,” city officials said.Despite the growing concerns over the weir, the Land Ministry has been reluctant to remove the small dam, citing its benefits. The ministry said that pulling down the weir would not ensure high enough water level, but only break the ecological system that has long been settled around the weir. A decade after the weir was built, a 7.5-square-kilometer-large wetland was created around Singok weir. Being a habitat for various plants and animals, it was designated as a “protection region” by the government. As long as the small dam remains, ensuring good river water quality is the best solution, experts said. “The climate issue is a constant variable. The temperature will continue to go up while the drought will be more serious. If we cannot improve the climate conditions, the best solution for now is to strengthen the river water quality management,” said researcher Kim Young-ran at public think-tank Seoul Institute. “The green tide will likely become a daily life issue for us.”By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","the threatening green tide ,culprit for green tide ,river in seoul ,the river the algae ,and increasing ecological damage","['Seoul', 'Singok', 'Gyeonggi Province']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38639894  0.34922871

The NHRC said that barring the stepparent, who takes care of the child and oversees his education, from joining a school committee falls under “irrational discrimination,” stipulated by clause 2 of the National Human Rights Commission Act. It added that allowing one to exercise his or her rights as a parent at a school should be based on one’s actual relationship with the child, not on legal status.“The rights exercised as a school committee member does not involve legal complications such as the child‘s legal proxy.

The actual number of public executions is presumed to be higher.  The report said that since the number of such victims peaked at 161 in 2008, it has been largely on the decline with 82 in 2013 and five in 2014. Despite the slowdown, the figures represent a severe violation of human rights in the North, it added.  ""The North claimed that it has handed down capital punishment in very limited cases, but it has carried out executions in cases of a wide range of crimes,"" the report said.  It said that it is ""noticeable"" that in recent years, the North has killed those who were caught after watching and distributing DVDs of South Korean dramas or films that had been smuggled in from the outside. Execution for drug smugglers has also increased, the report added.  North Korea has long been regarded as one of the worst human rights violators. Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.  In late 2013, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered the execution of his once-powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek. The North's former defense chief Hyun Yong-chol is believed to have been executed in April for his disloyalty toward Kim.  North Korea's rights situation was in spotlight as the U.N. Commission of Inquiry last year unveiled a report that accused Pyongyang of ""systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights.""  In a related move, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution in December that calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer the North's rights situation to the International Criminal Court.  North Korea has sharpened its flak against South Korea as the U.N. has recently set up its field office tasked with monitoring the North's human rights records in Seoul. Pyongyang vowed retaliation against South Korea over the opening of the U.N. office.  The report showed that it is easy to find grave violations of human rights such as violence and torture at detention centers in the North.  North Korea has denied the existence of political prison camps, claiming that the country only maintains labor camps as correctional facilities for criminals.  The North is presumed to operate five prison camps nationwide, which are holding in captivity some 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners, the report showed.

Earlier this year, Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea visited Ehwa Womans University ― the first major institute to raise the tuition to the government-permitted limit of 2.4 percent ― after which the school abruptly said it would freeze the fees. According to the Korea Council of University Education, 174 of Korea’s 176 universities either froze or reduced their tuition fees for the first semester of 2015.“The burden of tuition fees in Korea is still high for most people. As a minister, I feel hard-pressed to suggest we remove that curb (on tuition hike),” Hwang said during a seminar with heads of the country’s leading universities last Thursday. Hwang said Korean universities still relies heavily on tuition for their finances, with fees accounting for 62.6 percent of their budgets on average.Instead of relying on tuition, Hwang said each university should look to make profits off their school funds, such as by starting their own businesses. A total of 156 private universities in Korea received 379.1 billion won ($336.7 million) in donations in 2013, according to this year’s report by the Korea Higher Education Research Institute. This marked a 30 percent decrease from 2009, when they received 541.8 billion won.In April, the government declared that the half-price tuition policy has been completed, with government and university scholarships covering roughly half the financial burdens. The announcement, however, faced criticism from students and experts who pointed out that the actual tuition remains unchanged and that only a limited number of students benefit from the policy.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","pressuring universities to refrain ,tuition fee hikes south ,curbs tuition fees for ,continue curbs tuition fees ,tuition fee hikes","['South Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Ehwa Womans Unive']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.18532778 0.09119622 0.09930869],Yoon Min-sik,Education,6,2015,"universities to allow tuition hikes ,that curb on tuition hike ,thursday hwang said korean universities ,curbs tuition fees for universities ,curb on tuition hike","['South Korea ’s', 'Education Ministry', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Hwang Woo - yea', 'Ehwa Womans University', 'the Korea Council of University Education', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Hwang', 'Hwang', 'korean', 'Hwang', 'Korea', 'the Korea Higher Education Research Institute', 'Yoon Min - sik']",13,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.18532778 0.09119622 0.09930869]

Each school is subject to a state evaluation every five years to prevent abnormal operations, such as only focusing on the main subjects for the annual college entrance exam.Of the 11 schools assessed by the SMOE this year, four fell short of the minimum passing score of 60. They were Kyungmoon High School, Mirim Girls’ High School, Sehwa Girls’ High School and Janghoon High School. The categories for the evaluation included long-term development plans for the school, the student admission process, the curriculum, competence of faculty members, school finances and facilities. An evaluation committee consisting of university professors, education workers and parents had been working on the assessment from May 29 to last Monday based on data submitted by each school and site inspection. Then SMOE will hold hearings for the schools on July 6-7, during which they may challenge the results. Each school will then get a chance to acquire a two-year extension after submitting a plan for improvement.For schools that fail to earn an extension, the SMOE will request the Education Ministry to cancel their designation as autonomous private high schools, turning them into regular schools. Last year, the SMOE decided to cancel the designation of six autonomous schools, but the ministry nullified the SMOE’s decision after wide-scale protests from parents.

""South Korea's diplomatic missions abroad have been ordered to provide correct, timely information about MERS to foreign media outlets and investors,"" he said.""Real time and accurate information is also being provided directly by the government. Such data is being provided in several foreign languages for easier access."" Store owners claimed that compared to May, sales have dropped as much as 50 percent, making it hard for many to pay rent and wages. They said that if the present situation drags on, they will have to fire some employees.Many hotels in Myeongdong and the surrounding areas said there has been a hike in cancellations, putting pressure on their ability to refund reservations.According to official data, more than 123,000 people canceled their planned trips to South Korea in the first three weeks of June.To counter the drop, the government said it will inject emergency funds and provide tax-related support to businesses that have been hit the hardest by MERS. The government said it will make available 40 billion won ($36.3 million) from the tourism promotion fund, with another 100 billion won worth of support to be provided by various credit guarantee funds.

As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 individuals in the country are being monitored at home for possible infection. The exact number and nationality of those concerned has not been fully confirmed because the information of their home countries was not collected in the initial stages of the screening, according to the ministry. “Once the MERS response team sends the list of those that they assume could be foreigners, we first identify based on names whether they are Korean nationals or not, and then proceed with the personal identification. So far, it may be uncertain, but there are believed to be around 20 to 30 expats under quarantine monitoring,” a Health Ministry official who is in charge of foreign affairs told The Korea Herald. “The nationality identification is underway, but even if everything is confirmed, their nationalities will be kept confidential because of diplomatic issues,” she said, adding that some countries ask that the information not be released. She stressed that the foreigners were being monitored by local health offices just like other Koreans. Once the home monitoring is ordered, residents are required to stay at home for two weeks and receive a check-in call from the health authorities each day.Health authorities said all those placed in quarantine, regardless of their nationality, are banned from traveling abroad by the Justice Ministry. The authorities need only the name, date of birth and address of those quarantined to ban the travel.Monday, concerns were raised after two Japanese citizens, who were supposed to be in quarantine, were confirmed to have returned to their country earlier in the day. The ministry said they left the country before the home isolation measure was imposed. Both once visited Samsung Medical Center where over 70 cases of infection were reported, the ministry said. While the two Japanese citizens tested negative in a preliminary MERS test, they remain under Japanese government monitoring, Japanese news outlets reported. Last week, one Chinese person was found to have caught the virus while working at a medical facility in Dongtan, Gyeonggi Province. As part of the efforts to contain the virus spreading to other countries, the Justice Ministry said it would allow the stay extension of those infected or under monitoring. The ministry also urged foreign nationals in Korea to actively report any potential MERS symptoms, along with any possible contact with a patient. It said foreign residents can also receive emergency government subsidies allocated for MERS patients and those quarantined for possible infection, if they comply with the government instructions. The emergency subsidy ranges from 409,000 won ($366) to 1.41 million won for one-person to six-person households. The MERS hotline ― 109 ― started to provide services in 19 different languages on Monday, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French and Vietnamese.Of more than 2,300 individuals in quarantine in the capital, no foreign nationals have been reported so far, Seoul City officials said.

Critics argue that the government’s lack of efforts to address expats’ concerns contradicts the government’s mantra of becoming a global, foreigner-friendly Korea, and its diplomatic efforts to promote trust in East Asia on nontraditional security challenges including transnational diseases.“The (Korean) government hasn’t done anything to help foreigners. I haven’t seen any official English-language material (about MERS),” said Christopher Cashel Cordo from the U.S., an English teacher in Seoul, stressing the only official message he got from Korean authorities was in Korean. “I think the government, in general, needs a task force or single public figure to offer frequent updates and information about the spread of the virus for the foreign population here,” he added, noting he had “no faith” in the Park Geun-hye administration with respect to his well-being.Quarantine officials sterlize a subway station in Wangsimni, Seoul, Thursday. (Yoon Byung-chan/The Korea Herald)As of April, there were over 1.4 million foreign residents registered in Korea.MERS-related information on the English website of Seoul’s Health Ministry was left largely neglected, while the Korean version of the website was updated minutes after the ministry’s daily briefing at 11 a.m.Since the first MERS case was confirmed on May 20, the ministry has not posted any information about the virus in English or any other language until May 27. Only on May 28, it posted a press release about the first confirmed patient and their containment efforts. Since then, there have been no updates until June 10.The Korean “Hotline” for consultations on MERS was established on Monday. The idea to provide the service in English did not come until recently, with the service starting at 9 a.m. this Friday, coinciding with a timeframe pinpointed by the government officials as a turning point for MERS to start subsiding.The Korea Herald tried to contact the ministry for comments, but no official was available. The Korean government’s lack of attention to MERS fears among foreigners has also been a source of frustration for many foreign diplomatic missions.They received an official government briefing about MERS at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry on Monday ― nearly 20 days after the first MERS case was confirmed.“The threat of the virus was underestimated by the hospital in the initial stages. The Korean government had to get involved more actively as a result,” George Khabelashvili, minister counsellor of the Georgian Embassy, told The Korea Herald.“Foreign service workers need to have full access to a wide range of information at any given moment because we need to inform our own citizens about ongoing situations in the country they are serving in.”Conflicting information from different South Korean public entities has further confused foreign embassy staff here, Ignacio Lacunza, deputy head of mission at the Argentine Embassy in Seoul pointed out.Fears about MERS were tangible among migrant workers, who have to work long hours without sufficient access to information.“The workers go to work early in the morning and come back home at midnight. They have no time to access information through media though they are fluent in English,” said Shekh Al Mamun from Bangladesh, senior vice president of Migrants’ Trade Union.“The Labor Ministry has a list of names and addresses of foreign residents. So why doesn’t it ask the migrants’ trade unions or factories to inform the foreigners? … It seems like the government does not care about us and has no plans to alleviate fears among foreigners.”The Korean government’s failure to address foreign nationals’ concerns has called into question Seoul’s move to improve its international status and promote regional cooperation on non-political issues including transnational diseases and disaster relief.“Control of diseases such as MERS is the representative topic in the realm of nontraditional security cooperation. Seoul has called for cooperation in that area,” said Kim Tae-hyun, an international politics professor at Chung-Ang University.“But the lack of attention (to foreign residents) seems to indicate that the Korean government is retrogressing from the global trend of close cooperation on handling transnational diseases.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)Yoon Min-sik, Ock Hyun-ju, Joel Lee and Paul Kerry contributed to this article. ―ED.","virus expats have complained ,fight the south korean ,government is facing criticism ,neglected in mers fight ,expats have complained",['south korean'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56733292  0.76947981

That’s good news for narrowing the perennial gaps in energy and transport blocking growth in many economies in the region. But, unless accompanied by protective safeguards, these projects risk damaging the environment, climate and communities ― and hindering growth. This must be a top concern for both the established lenders, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and the two new development banks: the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ― planned to be established in Beijing later this year ― and the New Development Bank of BRICS countries. That is because the human and economic cost of disasters from environmental and social neglect is high. Vinod ThomasRecall the 2010 BP-Amoco Gulf of Mexico oil spill in the United States which cost $25 billion in damages and clean up. From Bangladesh and India to China and Korea, there have been costly accidents in recent decades, involving buildings, bridges and boats. In the second half of the 20th century, discharges from factories and mines severely hurt people’s health in Minamata Bay in Japan and the island of Marinduque in the Philippines. New road projects in forest areas of Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and many other countries contributed to massive deforestation, which in turn has a deleterious effect on global warming. The Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River in India eventually displaced over 200,000 people, while China’s Three Gorges Dam displaced six times as many. The gain from safeguards would be several times higher than their cost, which is usually 3-4 percent of the project cost. For example, the environmental benefit of pollution abatement is three to 10 times the cost, according to some estimates. The benefit of preserving biodiversity may be in avoiding a trigger for an ecosystem collapse.In recognition of these risks, development banks have, for decades, required safeguards in their loans. The scale of the needed response can be huge but necessary: the Ertan 1 hydropower project on China’s Yalong River successfully resettled 46,000 people.Development banks must continue to improve safeguard policies, including support for ensuring the adequacy of countries’ safeguard systems. ADB revised its safeguard policy in 2009 and the World Bank is now doing the same, which could influence others. The original World Bank proposal was widely criticized for weakening the obligation for safeguard compliance. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has assured that the revision will not mean a “dilution.” Earlier in May, ADB President Takehiko Nakao and Liqun Jin, secretary-general of the Multilateral Interim Secretariat of the AIIB, jointly stressed “the importance of safeguards policies on environmental and social impacts of projects.” The vital question for established banks and newcomers alike as well as the countries is twofold: what is a desirable scope of safeguards, and how to get good compliance. There’s a growing consensus on the question of the “what,” but the “how” remains highly problematic. In particular, growth concerns press for greater flexibility in how safeguards are implemented. By citing a need to alleviate the burden for borrowers and executing agencies, it is tempting for alterations or new proposals to relax requirements for mitigation when approving a project and table them later instead. But rather than diluting safeguard policies this way, development banks should adhere to delivering sound safeguards while seeking greater efficiency and speed by reforming internal procedures. Indeed, sound economics argues for enforceable actions to rectify market failures that cause spillover damages from public and private investment. At the start of projects ― and not just those supported by development banks ― there has to be a binding mitigation plan based on established and clear rules, and compliance with the plan ought to be verified by an independent party and disclosed publicly.Development banks and countries must aim for better environmental and social impacts from safeguards as they expand infrastructure investment. That includes support for commitment, capacity and systems in countries to strengthen these defenses and their efficiency. By Vinod ThomasThe writer is director general of independent evaluation at the Asian Development Bank and former director general and senior vice president of the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group and chief economist for Asia. ― Ed.","these projects risk damaging ,drive for stronger economic ,crucial in infrastructure investment ,for stronger economic growth ,social protection crucial",[],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78558803 -0.01795333

Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education chief Cho Hi-yeon held an emergency meeting and decided to suspend classes for all 126 elementary schools and kindergartens in the city‘s southern districts of Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu from Monday to Wednesday. With the announcement, the number of schools, kindergartens, colleges, universities and special education institutions in Seoul that canceled classes totaled 178.“I would advise other schools to actively consider suspending classes as well to address the concerns of parents,” Cho said. “(The SMOE) will keep a keen eye on the situation, and may extend the period (of suspension) or order more schools to cancel their classes.”The SMOE has also allocated 600 million won ($530,000) to provide health-related supplies for all schools to check each student for fever, one of the most common symptoms of MERS.The Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education also decided to cancel classes for all kindergartens and elementary, middle and high schools in Suwon, Yongin, Pyeongtaek, Anseong, Hwaseong, Osan and Bucheon from Monday to Friday. A total of 1,255 educational institutes will be affected by the GPOE’s measure, according to officials.Korea‘s first-ever MERS patient had been admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital in Pyeongtaek, prior to his diagnosis in May.

Quoting unnamed medical experts or health professionals, the messages range from the list of hospitals in question to ways to prevent infection. The overflowing exchange of the often incongruous information appeared to show the level of public distrust against the government, which has been urging people to stay calm. Members of civic groups hold a rally in front of the government complex in downtown Seoul on Thursday, protesting the government’s lax countermeasures against MERS and calling for transparent release of relevant information. (Yonhap)Most recently, a website carrying the names and locations of 14 hospitals that have treated MERS patients was created under the name “MERS proliferation map.” The website, created with data contributed by registered Facebook users, showed the public’s growing hunger for information after two people died of the disease. The scare only intensified after tertiary infections were confirmed earlier this week, despite the health authorities saying it was highly unlikely.Earlier in the week, a message advising people to rub Vaseline inside their nose to prevent MERS went viral via social media and mobile messenger sevices. The myth was quickly debunked by experts, but it was followed ― and preceded ― by a myriad of rumors that spread across the country.On Wednesday, Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced Daechi Elementary School became the first Seoul-based school to cancel classes due to MERS. The news, however, had been circulating via social media and media outlets hours before the announcement.Parents in the affluent Gangnam district in southern Seoul have been sharing texts on supposed MERS patients and hospitals that treated them. But they were also accompanied by a series of groundless rumors.Busan police on Thursday took into custody a 34-year-old man on suspicion of spreading a false rumor that a MERS patient was admitted to one of the city’s hospitals. “The (rumors are) not completely groundless, but a lot of them are exaggerated. Understandable though as people are panicking and have no information,” 44-year-old doctor Yoon Choon-shik said. Yoon, whose fifth-grade son is attending an elementary school in Gangnam, said his son’s school was just about the only one in its area still left open amid mounting fear up epidemic. Over three dozen schools and kindergartens in Seoul canceled classes, while most private institutions have followed suit. Schools left open are pelleted with a hailstorm of demands from concerned parents.“The initial government report emphasized how MERS had a low infection rate. Look at what’s happening now,” said a woman surnamed Choi, whose son attends an elementary school in Seoul. “What are we supposed to do if one of the kids in class ends up infected?”Outdoor playgrounds are as empty as the classrooms, as parents are seeking to ensure that their children come into as little contact with others as possible. Some companies are even telling their employees to come in late, so that they can avoid jam-packed subways and buses at rush hour. The Education Ministry recently advised nursing students to refrain from hospital training. Despite the public craving more information, the Ministry of Health and Welfare maintained that it would continue limiting information, including the names of hospitals. The ministry’s secrecy has seen even more criticism since it was revealed that it locked down the public relations department after the first MERS death was reported on Monday. “I think the government is restricting information to prevent panic, but they don’t realize that the control itself has been making the anxiety among people even worse,” Yu said. “The government should open up and offer directions for people to follow. Right now, neither the government nor the people have faith in each other.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","social media messages ,fight with the government ,of social media messages ,quoting unnamed medical experts ,scores of social media",['netizen'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61783063  0.18799821

Stigma reigns and bullying is common, while teachers treat violent incidents as if they were regular playground scuffles, ignoring the deeper problem of intolerance.Hee-mun, a 16-year-old activist with the Teen Sexuality Rights Association of Korea, said she had seen students call gay peers “infected” and physically attack them. “Teachers treat homosexuality like it’s not a big deal. They even blurt out anti-gay jokes without even realizing it,” said Hee-mun. Members of the Teen Sexuality Rights Association of Korea hold a queer parade.Hee-mun quit school last year after realizing that education institutes in South Korea offered no protection for sexual minorities like her.Homosexual teenagers in the country face difficulty getting by at schools, as they are left unprotected from jokes, discrimination, ridicule and abuse from the likes of their peers and teachers.“A gay kid once found his bags torn apart with a knife. There’s even something called a ‘pinning game,’ where students get points for hitting (a gay student) in certain parts of the body with pins,” explained Juri, a 21-year-old lesbian activist for TSRAK. Sexual minorities overlooked But a lack of education about sexual minorities and policies to protect them makes it hard for them to seek help from authorities.On the contrary, the Education Ministry recently sparked furor from in and outside of the country by advising schools not to include descriptions about homosexuals in its guidelines on sex education.Human Rights Watch released a statement urging the government to revise the guidelines, saying it was discriminatory against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.“We were alarmed that the government would take such a step, since the new guidelines do not meet South Korea’s international human rights obligations to uphold rights to information, education, and health,” Kyle Knight, an LGBT rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The Korea Herald.“It is crucial for students to receive an accurate and rights-based education about a range of aspects of sexuality. ... Obscuring the truth about sexual orientation and gender identity incites stigma and hatred, and instills misinformation,” he said, urging schools to include information about LGBT people in their curriculum.TSRAK’s Juri pointed out that this was not the first time LGBT teens had been neglected by the education system. “In fact, LGBT teens have never received education concerning our sexual orientations. Schools never even mentioned us. And even when they do, it carries negative connotations,” she said. “So the ministry’s guideline doesn’t hurt us that much. It has always been that way.”‘Traditional ethics’ behind anti-gay sentimentLocal experts have also been voicing concerns about the widespread aversion to educating teens about sexual minorities.Human rights lawyer Han Ga-ram pointed to the underlying causes behind the anti-gay sentiment in Korea.“Many have perceived that homosexuals ― not hatred against homosexuals ― are the real problem in Korean society, which has led to a taboo against mentioning sexual minorities in textbooks,” said Han. “But prohibiting descriptions of homosexuality is what has created the problem in the first place.”Last year’s Gallup poll of 123 countries showed that Korea ranked 69th in terms of being “a good place for gay or lesbian people to live.” Only 18 percent of Koreans said it was a friendly environment for homosexuals while 57 percent thought it was hostile to them.Homosexuals are often depicted as comic or eccentric in mainstream media, and extreme conservative groups ― particularly Christian groups ― have accused them of being responsible for spreading sexually-transmitted diseases, shortening life spans and the low birthrate.Illustration by Park Gee-youngMost recently on Monday, five Christian groups launched the “Korean Churches’ Response Team on Homosexuality,” urging the Education Ministry to ban all education about gays and lesbians. Aside from religious groups, Korea’s highly conservative Confucian culture has often had trouble adopting concepts that were against what it dubbed “traditional sex ethics.” This was demonstrated in a recent controversy sparked after the Constitutional Court ruled that the law criminalizing adultery was unconstitutional.While the public sentiment was generally split on whether or not the court had made the right call, a debate ensued over people’s right to make their own decisions and take responsibility for their sexual activities.“As debate about sexual orientation surfaced, anti-gay activities also grew in size and intensity. In the past such comments or actions may have not garnered much attention, but things have changed as people start to discuss sexual rights more openly,” said Han. In recent years, local education offices ― namely Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education ― passed student human rights ordinances that include clauses banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. But in 2014, conservative former education superintendent Moon Yong-rin attempted to water down the clause to “students will not be discriminated against for their personal preference.”The attempt was scrapped after Moon lost his re-election bid, but the popular support it received from conservative and religious groups demonstrated that anti-LGBT sentiment was still rampant in the country.Neglected at school and homeIn 2009, a 15-year-old boy in Busan killed himself after being bullied for being gay. Classmates called him sexually demeaning names, and mental examinations had shown signs of severe depression and anxiety along with suicidal impulses.The law, however, failed to take his side even after death, as the Supreme Court ruled last year that the school was not responsible for his suicide, despite having failed to take any preventive action.Han called it a “classic case” of LGBT students not receiving any protection.“Teen sexual minorities are four to five times more likely to attempt suicide compared to other teenagers. In the Busan case, if the school knew nothing about how to handle violence against LGBT students, they should have sought outside help, such as from education offices or human rights organizations,” he said.For LGBT teens, the hardship often starts at home.“When I broke the news to my parents, their first reaction was denial. Then they tried to ‘fix me.’ Now they ignore me. So when I say I’m going to date my girlfriend, they say ‘what do you even know about dating?’” said Hee-mun, who said she was bisexual. “First time I told them, they suggested that I go to church and talk to the minister. Funny thing was, they’re not even churchgoers themselves.” Juri’s parents reluctantly accepted the fact that their daughter was a lesbian after nearly eight years, but the process was not easy.“We don’t talk about my love life, or about the hardships I face as a sexual minority. They acknowledge my sexual orientation, but it’s not like they root for their daughter,” she said. For teen LGBTs, the prospects of a gloomy future is what is also ailing them. Korea does not allow gay marriage and its social welfare system ―such as subsidies for married couples ― is based on the assumption that a couple is a man and a woman.Furthermore, lack of openly-gay celebrities or public figures mean gay students hardly have anyone to truly identify with.“I can’t really find my true role model anywhere. Everywhere I look, it’s the life of a heterosexual,” said Juri. “Sometimes, I’m at a loss as to how I should lead my life. Then I wonder; why should I have to worry about all this stuff? If I were a heterosexual, I wouldn’t have to think about this at all.”Activists say the process of abolishing the prejudice against sexual minorities should start in the classroom. The student human rights ordinance clause against LGBT discrimination is a start, but it is hardly sufficient, said Han.“Over 80 percent of (LGBT) students in our surveys say that one of their teachers has made anti-gay remarks. This implies that school is not a safe place for those students,” he said. “Authorities should develop policies to protect sexual minorities.

The decision was reached upon the notion that the flexible employment system could lessen labor costs ahead of increasing the retirement age to 60 next year, as well as help create more jobs for young job seekers. Currently, companies are required to win consent from the labor union to introduce the pay peak system. ""The party shares the Labor Ministry's principle to adopt the pay peak system to resolve the youth employment shortage,"" Rep. Kwon Seong-dong of Saenuri Party told reporters after the meeting.Still companies are required to slash wages by levels similar to those by firms that have already introduced the rule through consultation with the labor union, the lawmaker noted. The government move to draw up relaxed labor guidelines came in line with the revision in 2013 of the aged employment promotion law, which officially lengthened the official retirement age to 60. During the government-party meeting, Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon also called for parliamentary cooperation in legislation regarding the labor issues of how to define regular pay, as well as reducing work hours. Lee called for legislative efforts for these issues during the upcoming National Assembly session as early as June. The new guidelines are expected to face resistance from the labor sector, which has claimed that the introduction of the pay peak system will only eat into workers' wages as few employees stay on until 60.

The employees at the handbag manufacturing company lamented that the company gave them a warning and slashed their wages when they went to the toilet “too often.” They were only allowed to use the restrooms from 9:30-10:30 a.m. and from 2-3 p.m., with only three keys to the toilet available per production line. Each line has about 100 workers.  It is only one of the human rights abuse cases that have been raised in Korean-owned companies across Vietnam, a recent report by Korean Trans National Corporation Watch, a network of human rights advocacy groups, revealed. According to the 64-page report based on interviews with laborers, companies and civic organizations, local workers have suffered from unreasonably low pay, long working hours and constant insults from employers. Last year, Korean companies paid Vietnamese workers $90 to $135 a month, but the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor views this as being far lower than the basic cost of living, considering the soaring inflation in the country. Kim Jong-chul, a lawyer for Advocate for Public Interest Law, told the Korea Herald that the Vietnamese government shared responsibility for the situation, as it is accused of keeping the country’s minimum wage low to attract more foreign direct investment. In 2011, some 2,000 Vietnamese workers for a Hanoi-based Korean company went on a strike, demanding bonus payments and pay raise for overtime. Consumer prices in the first half of the year increased by 13.29 percent, but wages at the company did not rise in line with this, standing at $75 a month. The report also shed light on verbal and physical abuse in workplaces, noting that Vietnamese workers could not make a complaint about unfair treatment in fear of dismissal. An unidentified Korean-run company in Vietnam, where the majority of workers were women aged 18 to 25, were accused of forcing female workers to sign contracts that banned them from getting pregnant at least for three years after they were hired. They also had to consult with the company about their pregnancy plans.According to VGCL, 4 in 10 strikes that occurred in Vietnam between 2009 and 2014 were staged by workers at Korean-owned companies.   About 3,000 Korean companies, of which 66 percent are manufacturers, have entered the Vietnamese market since the early 1990s, investing more than $29 billion there. South Korea is the third-biggest investor in Vietnam, after Japan and Singapore. “Most of the strikes in Vietnam took place as Korean companies did not abide by labor laws,” said the Kim, who went on a 10-day field trip in Vietnam to look into human rights situation there.Although many of workers in Southeastern Asian countries have waged strikes, calling for a change in their working environments, the Korean companies have ignored their demands in order to keep production costs down, he said. Kim, thus, underscored the importance of the role of the Korean Embassy in Vietnam in tackling the human rights violations there. “The Korean Embassy in Vietnam is currently playing a role only in promoting Korean business in Vietnam, but it should expand its role to monitoring Korean companies and preventing them from violating local workers’ human rights,” Kim concluded.

(Yonhap)After the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of the government in June 2014, the KTU sought a comeback by attacking the clause itself. The attempt, however, was to no avail as the court shot down its challenge.“A teachers’ union exercises great influence on the working conditions of education workers. Excluding those who are not directly related to such working conditions cannot be seen as an excessive restriction (on the union),” the court said in its ruling. Furthermore, there aren’t any plausible benefits that can be gained from allowing dismissed teachers to become members.”While the KTU has already appealed the administrative court’s ruling ― and is likely to take the case to the Supreme Court if the high court also strikes it down ― Thursday’s ruling has virtually settled the case, as the contentious clause was the basis on which the government stripped the group of its legal status. Had the clause been ruled unconstitutional, the grounds upon which the administrative court made its ruling would have been removed. The ruling would likely have been overturned on appeal. If the decision is finalized, the KTU will lose its legal status for the first time since gaining formal status in 1999, 10 years after its foundation. It will subsequently lose all government subsidies while also being relinquished of the right to engage in collective bargaining with the government. All full-time union members of the KTU will also have to return to their teaching posts.The KTU denounced the decision, saying the Constitutional Court has “turned its back on time” by denying the rights of dismissed teachers to join a union. “The court has been accused of causing a regression of democracy. It is regretful that today’s ruling has done nothing to disprove that opinion,” said KTU leader Byeon Seong-ho. “Outlawing a trade union of 60,000 members just because it has nine dismissed workers is unheard of. Nevertheless, we will keep working to acquire our legal status as soon as possible.”The group will release a statement about its specific future plans including legal actions on Monday.The conservative Park Geun-hye government has rarely seen eye-to-eye with the left-leaning KTU, one of the most outspoken opponents of its education policies. The rift between the Education Ministry and the KTU was well demonstrated during last week’s World Education Forum 2015 in Incheon, when the group was not invited to participate despite being one of two biggest teachers unions in the country. The KTU responded by holding a press conference outside the venue, criticizing the ministry for “being hell-bent on self-praise while turning away from the actual education issues.”The teachers’ group has urged the judicial authorities as well as the government to “respect the international standards” that they said were to allow dismissed workers from joining trade unions. “There is no democratic nation that forbids dismissed workers from becoming members of a trade union. As a member of the International Labor Organization, Korea should abide by the agreement on the freedom of association and the protection of the right to collective organization,” the group said in a press conference Wednesday.Attempts to outlaw the KTU have sparked negative reactions from outside the country as well. International Trade Union Confederation and Education International on Thursday requested a permanent injunction of the Labor Ministry’s decision to delegalize the KTU. They said each trade union had a “long-recognized right to decide who may be members and eligible for leadership,” and that each union’s membership rules could reflect those decisions. “The ILO has clearly stated that the prohibition on dismissed and unemployed workers as members or leaders is a violation of the principles of freedom of association, not merely in the abstract but specifically with regard to Korea. We therefore urge the court to permanently enjoin the Ministry of Employment and Labor as its decision is contrary to international standards,” it said. During the WEF 2015, Education International chief Susan Hopgood urged the government to revise its law to allow dismissed teachers to join unions. “We think that government should recognize the KTU, stop its action to delegalize the organization and should respect the rights of teaching unions,” she said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","labor law banning dismissed ,banning dismissed education workers ,law banning dismissed education ,leaning teachers union fighting ,labor law banning","['the Constitutional Court', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers Union', 'the Labor Ministry']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28997022 -0.11568798

To better guard against enemies' online infiltrations, it is pushing to establish a new team in charge of cyber operations under the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) while increasing its personnel from the current 600 to 1,000.Meanwhile, the communist North is believed to have dispatched an increased number of anti-aircraft guns and established wind vanes along the western and central border regions in a move to counter propaganda leaflets floated by South Korean civic groups.The North has long bashed the South for not preventing its civic activists from sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets that criticize the North Korean regime across the border, and vowed harsh retaliation against such moves. Despite Pyongyang's repeated calls, the Seoul government has maintained it cannot stop the cross-border campaigns, citing the groups' freedom of speech. ""North Korea has continued to stage drills against the balloons by mobilizing anti-aircraft, anti-tank guns and artillery troops, according to our analysis,"" the Seoul officer said, noting that the South Korean military has been closely watching their movements.In October, the two Koreas exchanged machine gun fire across the tense border, after the North apparently tried to shoot down balloons carrying propaganda leaflets flown from the South.

South Korea's ODA contribution reached US$1.85 billion last year, after recording the sharpest growth rate in ODA spending over the five years among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But the foreign ministry in charge of ODA failed to strategize on the fund, which was, as a result, inefficiently distributed to many international organizations in small sums, the BAI said in a statement. ""Despite the growing size of the fund for multilateral development cooperation, the concerned ministry let the fund managed by several divisions in charge of international organizations, without rules or guidelines on a strategy, plan, internal review process, or result assessment and management of the fund,"" according to the BAI statement.The Foreign Ministry unilaterally promised the World Bank in 2012 to make contributions to the bank's Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund without necessary consultations with the finance ministry, which is in charge of overseeing contributions to global financial organizations, the audit agency said.Despite the finance ministry's resistance, the foreign ministry had to keep its promise and gave $10 million to the World Bank. BAI said the assistance ended without continuation, impairing the effectiveness of South Korea's ODA provision. The Foreign Ministry also failed to follow a proper accounting rule when spending $500,000 for the launch of the South Korea-Mekong cooperation fund in 2013, according to BAI.""The foreign minister is advised to prepare internal guidelines so the alloted fund for international organizations can be provided efficiently,"" the audit agency said. In the recent inspection result, the foreign ministry has also been chided for its supervision failure on illegal private-sector employment of former diplomats as well as irregular accounting by foreign missions.

The service, called an “amber alert” in the U.S., will allow users to receive information such as missing children’s photos, names and ages. It will send the alerts 3.5 times per month and release them only with the parent’s consent. Until now, police relied only on its smartphone application to spread information on missing children. The alerts were also shared among local banks, media outlets and hospitals. With the new alert system, the police will access nearly 14 million Facebook users nationwide and the company’s location tracking system to track down missing children. The police also signed an agreement with Korea’s top portal operator Naver to distribute missing children information since late April.

Specific plans on how to revise the existing names will also be discussed on Friday at a meeting of its advisory committee, which includes native English speakers.“It is important for the English name of a government organization to allow foreigners easily understand specifically what the organization does, and what its role is,” a ministry official said.The ministry has been discussing potential new English names with government agencies since March. For example, it has suggested that the Korean National Police Agency should erase “Korean” from its title. Officials explained that most police activities take place in Korea anyway, and when the agency’s name is spelled out in international events, the phrase “Republic of Korea” is automatically attached after the title. But the agency reportedly argued that it needed to retain its current name to differentiate itself from other countries’ police agencies with similar names.Confusing translations of government agencies have long been a source of complaint among foreigners in Korea, as many of them tend to be unclear in terms of describing their actual functions.For instance, the former Lee Myung-bak administration’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy ― now the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy ― caused confusion as its official title depicted an idea far from the organization’s actual role. The ministry oversaw international trade, foreign investment, energy projects and overall Korean industry and was not directly related to the concept of “knowledge economy,” or economy based on value created by knowledge.The Park Geun-hye administration’s agencies are said to have clearer English names than their predecessors. But it, too, has its share of strange-sounding names. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance was another English name criticized by foreigners, who said the word “strategy” was redundant as all ministries’ plans involve some sort of strategy.The Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs is in charge of affairs related to veterans and those acknowledged by the state to have dedicated their lives in meritorious service of Korea. But to describe the latter, the ministry uses the word “patriot,” which simply means anyone who loves and strongly supports their country.A 35-year-old from Britain said this sounded as if the ministry is “a government body that decides who loves the country.”While some names depicted a ministry’s nonexistent roles, others actually reduced the scope of their functions. The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning covers the general field of science and technology, but its name suggests that it specifically tackles science and information technology. Native English speakers also had a hard time grasping what was meant by “future planning,” as all ministries plan for the future.Some ministries resorted to repeating redundant words such as Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs, Ministry of Public Safety and Security and Ministry of Employment and Labor.

The laws also don’t recognize any other forms of sexual penetration ― such as forced anal or oral sex, or inserting of a foreign object into the body ― as rape, regardless of the gender of the victim.Scholars and legal experts say the current law fails to protect victims of sexual violence with its limited definition of rape, especially those in the military who are vulnerable to power abuse.“The current law says that penetration of the vagina by the male sex organ is the most serious form of sexual abuse,” said Chang Da-hye, a legal scholar at the Korean Institute of Criminology. “But when you think about it, the physical and emotional damage to a victim who experienced penetration of other body parts can be in fact more serious than those who have been ‘raped’ as defined by the current law.”‘Rape’ and ‘like-rape’In many countries, including the U.S. and France, rape is defined as any act of sexual penetration, whatever its nature, committed against another person. The International Criminal Court defines it as any “penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.”The World Health Organization defines it as “physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration ― even if slight ― of the vulva or anus, using body parts or an object.”Yet in Korea, the definition of rape is specifically limited to penetration of the female genitals by the male sex organ, and other forms of forced sexual penetration are defined as “like-rape” ― which carry lighter penalties than what the law defines as “rape.”Currently, the Korean law stipulates that the punishment for “rape” is imprisonment for a definite term of at least three years, which is the heaviest among all forms of criminalized sexual activities against able-bodied adults. Those who commit what the law defines as “like rape” as of 2013 ― “inserting one’s genitals into the inner part of another person’s body such as mouth or anus except genitals, or inserting a part of his or her body other than genitals, such as a finger, or any foreign objects into another person’s body” ― are punishable by at least two years in prison. Those who “rape” a person with disabilities are punishable by at least seven years behind bars, while those who commit “like rape” against a person with disabilities only face at least five years imprisonment.“The law should either expand its definition of rape ― by combining the current definitions of ‘rape’ and ‘like-rape’ ― or enforce heavier penalties on those who commit ‘like-rape,’ to an equivalent level of the ones on ‘rape,’” said Chun Jung-ah, an attorney who has represented many victims of sexual violence.“Ultimately, it’s the judge who makes the final decision for every case. But if the law stipulates that the penalties for ‘rape’ are heavier than the ones for ‘like-rape,’ it’s certainly more likely that those with ‘like-rape’ charges will face lighter punishment.”Patriarchy factorUntil 1995, Korea’s rape laws were under the chapter of “chastity crimes” of the criminal code. It was only in 2013 that the definition of “like-rape” was introduced and criminalized. Also until the same year, it did not acknowledge rape by women and therefore it was impossible for male victims to file complaints with the police.“Until 1995, the primary purpose of rape laws was to protect married women’s chastity (and virginity), to minimize their chance of bearing illegitimate children. It’s linked to the patriarchal notion that values pure bloodlines above all else,” said scholar Chang at the Korean Institute of Criminology. “Traditionally, when a woman was raped, it was considered as a damage to her husband or her father, and the reputation of her household, not herself. Such notions made it impossible for lawmakers to think of women as potential rapists in the past. It also made it difficult for them to think that rape can also occur between same-sex individuals.”The law now stipulates that it is to protect an individual’s sexual autonomy, regardless of his or her gender. However, Kim Jong-hye, a visiting researcher at the GongGam Human Rights Law Foundation, said the current rape laws contradict with what it’s supposed to protect, by separating “rape” and “like-rape.”“If its primary purpose is to protect women’s chastity and the so-called ‘pure bloodlines’ of households, the current law makes sense, because a forced penetration of female sex organ by the male sex organ is the only form of abuse that can lead to an unwanted pregnancy,” Kim said. “But if the purpose is to protect one’s sexual autonomy, as it is stated in the law, then how is a penetration of genitals any worse than any other forms of penetration? They are all a serious invasion of one’s sexual autonomy and violation of human rights.”Kim argued that the current law promotes a notion that for women, losing their virginity or chastity is the most serious form of damage, and something that a woman victim should be ashamed of. “It’s like a vicious cycle,” she said. “The laws reflect today’s society, where many female victims of sexual violence are still blamed for being too drunk or being too sexually provocative. And by enforcing heavier penalties for ‘rape’ than ‘like-rape,’ the laws spread the idea that the most serious or cruel form of sexual abuse is done by the male sex organ only.”Military power abuseExperts say the most vulnerable under the current law are in fact male victims of military sexual violence by their male superiors. “Most of sexual violence cases against women involve both ‘rape’ and ‘like-rape.’ It’s rare for rapists to commit ‘like-rape’ only (against women),’” said Bae Bok-ju, an activist supporting women with disabilities who have been sexually abused. “So if convicted, the perpetrator who abused women can be punished for both ‘rape’ and ‘like-rape.’ But male perpetrators who abused men will only be punished on the grounds of ‘like-rape,’ which carry lighter penalties, under the current law.”Korea’s military criminal law also differentiates “rape” and “like-rape,” and stipulates heavier penalties for rape charges -― imprisonment of at least five years ― than for ‘like-rape,’ which is punishable by at least three years in prison. According to the law, all sexual abuse between same-sex soldiers can only be charged with “like-rape.”Last year, a male Army conscript surnamed Yoon died after six male colleagues allegedly hit him in the chest while he was eating, which led him to choke on his food. According to the Military Human Rights Center, Yoon had been constantly sexually assaulted by the bullies, on top of being physically and verbally abused on a daily basis. Also last year, a 26-year-old army sergeant was arrested on charges of sexually abusing his subordinate at least three times in his residence.According to a 2013 study by Gallup Korea, an independent research firm, 37.6 percent of Korean men in their 20s and 30s said they have either witnessed or heard about sexual abuse cases while serving their military duties, while 31.2 percent said they think the issue of military sexual violence as a form of power abuse is serious.Ninety percent of perpetuators of military sex abuse cases among male individuals were the victims’ superiors, according to a 2013 scholarly thesis by Lim Tae-hun, who heads the Military Human Rights Center. Some 470 military sexual abuse cases were reported in 2013, but only 39.5 percent ended with a conviction, according to data released by Lim’s organization. Many cases remain unreported. Education needed Lawyer Chun has witnessed many male victims of sexual violence by men end up dropping charges. She said all male and female victims of sexual violence can experience severe post-traumatic stress regardless of the perpetrator’s gender. “Many male victims I’ve seen, however, suffer from an extreme sense of humiliation, which I think is different from the (reaction) of female victims,” she said. “One of the victims in fact told me, ‘I thought only women become victims of sexual abuse. I feel so humiliated that this actually has happened to me, and I don’t know who to share this with. I can’t even tell my close friends.’ A lot of them withdraw a complaint because they feel humiliated about talking to the police ― or in court ― about their experience. They have a hard time accepting themselves as victims.”Shin Jin-hee, a court-appointed attorney, said the system at the Court for Armed Forces should change as much as the current rape laws. One of the biggest existing problems, she said, is that the court very often does not inform soldier victims of military abuse that they have the right to speak to a lawyer, and are entitled to a court-appointed attorney if they can’t afford to hire one. “The law should be revised, that is for sure,” she said. “But I think what is desperately needed in military as well as the civil Korean society is human rights education, and that you can’t use sexual harassment or abuse as a ‘means of discipline’ or anything else.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korea rape laws ,prison for sexually abusing ,law only acknowledges rape ,six months in prison ,korea rape laws self",[],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27187952 -0.13509254

The Gender Equality Ministry signed an MOU with the heads of the country’s four biggest religious bodies ― the Christian Council of Korea, Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, Won-Buddhism and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul ― to collaborate on promoting the so-called “small weddings,” to encourage more people to get married without worrying about the cost of the ceremony. Upon signing, the four religious bodies agreed to offer their cathedrals and temples for use as wedding venues at a cost ranging from 200,000 won ($185) to 300,000 won. The organizations also plan to promote the importance of “spending less on weddings” via their broadcasting networks including PBC and WBS.“Today’s wedding culture, which consists of expensive wedding halls, costly furnishings for the newlyweds, and monetary gifts for the ceremony, is one of the biggest reasons why many young people either avoid or put off their marriages. We are even using terms such as ‘wedding-poor,’” said Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung.“We are determined to change today’s (wedding) culture into one that opts for more affordable ceremonies.”The marriage rate is considered to be an important factor in Korea’s fertility rate. Along with its general fertility rate ― 1.18 children per woman ― Korea also has one of the lowest out-of-wedlock birthrates in the world, marking 2.1 percent in 2010. This means most Koreans do not generally have children unless they are married, but the number of those who put off marriage has increased dramatically. More than 50 percent of Korean men born between 1976 and 1980 were single for the period of 2006 to 2010, whereas only 13.9 percent of those born between 1956 and 1960 were not married at that age, according to Statistics Korea. While the youth unemployment rate is soaring, Korean couples spent an average of 238 million won ($216,000) on their wedding ceremonies in the last two years, according to wedding consulting firm Duowed. Meanwhile, the average annual income of a young university graduate and a full-time employee is 30 million won. Cho Sung-ho, a researcher at Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, said he isn’t sure if the Gender Ministry’s MOU with the religious sector would lift the fertility rate.“Wedding venues are just one of hundreds of things that cost money when one prepares to get married, such as housing and money gifts for the parents,” he said. “I don’t think it’s about ‘spending less’ on weddings and giving up what you want to have in your milestone event. I think the first step should be learning that weddings and marriage aren’t the same thing, and that great weddings don’t guarantee happy marriages. I think changes will naturally follow once the public accepts that.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","start supporting small weddings ,small weddings to alleviate ,weddings to alleviate the ,small weddings drive aims ,more childbirths the gender","['the Gender Equality Ministry', 'MOU', 'the Christian Council of Korea', 'Jogye order', 'Won - Buddhism']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82296032  0.22594121

""As they are contacting other local firms to recruit talented employees as well, it's sparking problems over the loss of workforce and technologies.""The company claimed that Huawei contacted its development and sales staffs through recruitment agencies.Dasan Networks, listed on South Korea's secondary KOSDAQ market, is the country's top telecom device maker, but its annual revenue of 160 billion won ($148 million) posted last year is dwarfed by Huawei's 33.4 trillion won.Seoul-based Huawei declined to comment on the issue, adding its personnel-related policies are undisclosed.The local branch of Huawei started with around 70 employees in 2007, but the number is currently estimated to be above 200, with 75 percent of them being employed in South Korea.Industry watchers said although such moves are not illegal, it has been an unwritten rule in the telecom industry to refrain from such practices.Huawei's attempt to recruit high-ranking officials from local telecom companies also drew the public's attention in March as police said one of its executives, who previously worked for Ericsson-LG, allegedly leaked long-term evolution advanced technology data through a USB drive.

All draftees were previously banned from using cellphones for security reasons.The agency said the cellphones would help the military more easily locate soldiers in case of an emergency.Inside military installations, conscripts will be able to rent and use smartphones only at post exchanges. They will be allowed to send text messages and make video calls. The agency plans to secure enough mobile phones by May 1 so that PXs in all units can lend phones to draftees. The idea of allowing troops to use cellphones was suggested last year by a special panel dedicated to revamping the outmoded military culture. The panel was launched in August 2014 following a series of abuse cases at barracks that led to suicides and a shooting spree. A lack of communication with loved ones was cited as a potential cause of suicides in the military.By Song Sang-ho  (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","smartphones the military will ,monday soldiers who leave ,enlisted soldiers to rent ,vacation can rent cellphones ,use smartphones the military",['the Ministry of National Defense ’s Welfare Agency'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.09232128  0.21855

The difference here is that nearly half of the roughly 200 employees are disabled. While the employment choice may be unconventional, the work efficiency of his company is similar to the competitors, the owner of the menswear manufacturer said in an interview with The Korea Herald.“Those with disabilities do not use tricks and they work with honesty. That’s immediately reflected in the quality of the suits,” Kim Chang-hwan, CEO of suit manufacturer The Beautiful People said.The company supplies menswear for several big companies and also sells its own custom-made business suit line.As of this month, 89 out of 206 workers are disabled, with 70 percent having severe disabilities. Types vary from hearing loss and autism to linguistic, physical, intellectual and mental disabilities. They work in various divisions from suit production to human resource management and accounting.The Beautiful People CEO Kim Chang-hwan (center) talks to one of his employees at a factory in western Seoul on April 10. (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)“Some think employees with mild disabilities will work better than those with severe problems but that is not the case at all,” the 58-year-old owner said. “The level of disabilities and the work capacity are irrelevant.” The business has been flourishing consistently, recording 19 billion won ($ 17.6 million) in sales last year, compared to 7 billion won in 2010.“There has never been a case where we failed to meet a deadline. On the contrary, the employees show better professionalism and expertise as they tend to change their jobs less often once they are employed,” the CEO said.Kim has run the company since 1998 but it was not until 2002 that he considered hiring the disabled.“To be honest, I didn’t think of recruiting the disabled with a philanthropic motive at first,” Kim said. “When I was having difficulties in recruiting nondisabled workers, I met a friend with a hearing disability. I thought it would be a good chance to offer him a job.”Witnessing the efficiency of the friend, the CEO gradually expanded the number of employees with various types of disabilities. Hiring them was not smooth at first. Some managers in charge of supervising the disabled workers expressed concerns over their abilities due to their lack of understanding. Kim was even forced to fire a manger after having a feud over the matter.“As managers get to know how much the disabled work harder with diligence, they now ask me to employ more,” he said with a smile. Having recognized his efforts for employing more and more people with disabilities, Kim won two awards including the Employment and Labor Minister Award in 2004. The Beautiful People was also designated an “exemplary company for disabled employment” by the government in 2010.In order to get designated as an exemplary company, the owner needs to hire at least 30 percent of disabled workers for over seven years, with 50 percent of them having severe disabilities. The company should also ensure minimum wages and be equipped with disabled-friendly facilities. As of last year, 174 companies were designated across the country, officials said. One of Kim’s key principle in running the company has been to ensure a harmonious working environment.He started to learn sign language for better communication, while holding a variety of events to foster a strong bond among workers.Every spring, Kim and all his employees take an overnight trip to different parts of the country. Next month, they are heading to the coastal city of Yeosu in South Jeolla Province.“I just would like to make my company a place where employees want to go to work every morning and work together,” Kim said, standing against the backdrop of a wall filled with photos taken by him during the memorable trips.The CEO also sometimes rents a theater to watch a movie along with employees. He said he mostly chooses foreign films with subtitles for those with hearing disabilities.“It’s not easy to work with the disabled unless you think of them with open-mindedness and sincerity, as you would your own children. I believe sincerity is what really matters,” Kim said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","200 employees are disabled ,the roughly 200 employees ,at suit factory in ,roughly 200 employees ,200 employees",['Seoul'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61165655  0.16623037

The government and the victims’ families are seemingly on the same page concerning the salvage of the 6,825-ton vessel. President Park Geun-hye recently said that she would “actively review” the operation, and Maritime Minister Yoo Ki-june implied last week that the operation was likely to be technically possible. Pedestrians pass by a rally demanding a thorough investigation into the Sewol disaster at Gwanghwamun Square in downtown Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Recovering the ship has been a key demand of the people who lost their loved ones in the incident, as it would mean possibly recovering bodies of the nine victims who remain unaccounted for.Last week, the Maritime Minister announced an interim investigation result saying that the operation was plausible. But even if technically possible, debate is likely to continue over the immense cost. According to Yoo, the operation alone would cost about 120 billion won ($109 million) over a period of 12 to 18 months. The government estimated the total cost related to Sewol to accumulate to 550 billion won. Groups of bereaved families continued their rallies, demanding that the Park administration guarantee the recovery of the ill-fated ship.In a press conference Tuesday, civic groups and bereaved family members held a joint press conference to announce they would put off the memorial service for the Sewol victims slated for Thursday unless the government formally announced it would salvage the vessel.Controversy also surrounds the so-called Sewol special bill.The families demand that Park not sign the Sewol special bill, which they claimed would compromise the activities of the special investigative committee into irregularities that may have played a part in the accident. The key issue is whether the committee can remain impartial. Public officials would head its subcommittees under the bill, but committee head Lee Seok-tae pointed out this is inappropriate since the government itself is one of the probe’s targets. “If the committee were to be launched right now, the government bodies will also be investigated. But the bill stipulates that officials from those very bodies would be entrusted with key tasks (in the investigative committee). We feel this makes it very difficult for the committee to remain independent from outside influences,” Park Ju-min, the legal representative of the Sewol victims’ family group, told local media.The group which Park represents is the biggest group of Sewol victim families as of now, with family membersof 226 out of 461 victims belonging to it. It has consistently remained skeptical of the parliament-approved special bill and disapproved of the compensation plan announced by the government earlier this month.But a smaller group ― consisting of families of 36 nonstudent Sewol passengers who died ― was more open-minded toward the plan, indicating a possible rift among the victims’ families.By all signs, reaching a closure for Sewol tragedy remains a distant goal, the road to which is littered with obstacles.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","worst maritime disasters behind ,its worst maritime disasters ,closure on ferry disaster ,worst maritime disasters ,ferry disaster year","['Sewol', 'South Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88957554  0.46727002

On Tuesday, Rep. Choi Min-hee of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a revision to the Broadcasting Act toughening regulations against broadcasters’ unfair practices. Dubbed the “JYJ bill,” the proposed revision would enable the Korea Communications Commission to intervene when a broadcaster bans someone without reasonable cause.  JYJ member Kim Jun-su sings on local channel EBS’ music show aired late Monday night. It was his first appearance on a TV show in six years. E(BS)Citing the case of JYJ, Choi said that there needed to be a means to intervene in a broadcaster’s decision to ban certain individuals. JYJ was formed by Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu in 2010 when they broke away from TVXQ. Following the move, JYJ experienced friction with their former agency SM Entertainment, as a result of which they were prevented from appearing on terrestrial broadcasters’ music programs. According to Choi, the Fair Trade Commission’s 2013 ruling in favor of JYJ has done little to enable the group to perform on television.

The woman reportedly committed the crime out of anger after the man broke up with her.The punishment for rape is imprisonment for at least three years.

He added that as far as COMWEL is aware, this is the first time a KTX attendant is receiving compensation for depression. According to the commission, the former KTX attendant joined Korea Railroad Corp.’s subsidiary KORAIL Tourism Development in May 2006.Until 2012, she worked at the company’s Seoul branch. She was then temporarily transferred to work on projects regarding the opening of the ITX line linking Seoul to Chugncheon, Gangwon Province between March 2012 and January 2013. During this time, she was diagnosed with depression and a panic disorder and quit her job in October 2013. While at the Seoul office, she was subjected to continuous sexual harassment from customers whose comments ranged from asking her out, to implying sexual relations. She was also exposed to verbal and physical abuse from customers, the commission said.

It comes amid lingering public debate over a need to improve public health against individuals’ right to smoke.The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced on March 31 that it would start penalizing those who smoke in public spaces such as restaurants, Internet cafes, coffee shops and other public areas. Violators will be fined up to 100,000 won ($90), while the owners of establishments who tolerate smoking will be fined up to 1.7 million won ($1,500).  Pedestrians pass a “no smoking” sign in Gangnam, southern Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)Under the new measures, smokers must smoke in a designated area and are not allowed to smoke when they are eating in restaurants, playing games in Internet cafes or chatting at coffee shops. “We have advertised the policy to ban smoking in public spaces since late 2012. Before putting the policy into place this April, we have even given a grace period. Now it is time to enforce the policy,” said Ryu Si-ik, an official from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The measure comes amid the government’s initiative to stop people smoking for the sake of public health. Last September, authorities increased the price of cigarettes by 2,000 won per pack and mandated tobacco companies put “cautionary pictures” on cigarette packs as a wake-up-call to smokers. However, the measures are still being met with opposition from smokers and business owners, who cite the individual’s right to smoke. Earlier this month, pro-smoking advocates protested at the Constitutional Court of Korea, calling the authority’s move to designate all restaurants “smoking-free zones” unconstitutional.“I think smoking is entirely an individual’s business,” said 27-year-old Chung Se-yoon, a former Air Force officer. “Business owners who cannot afford to build a smoking room, meanwhile, would go out of business,” said Chung. He cited a case in the Air Force that designated every base a smoke-free area in 2013, but stepped back from the restriction following opposition and operated designated smoking areas instead.Advocates against smoking, however, say the ban is long overdue and the government should do what it takes to improve public health. “Smokers cannot fathom how annoying and harmful it is sitting next to them,” said Chung Sang-ik, a 28-year-old public worker. “I used to go to Internet cafes a lot. Even though the cafe runs a designated room for smokers, they never bothered to go there and smoke. It was really annoying,” said Chung.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","for smoking ban smoking ,penalizing those who smoke ,april following three month ,ends for smoking ban ,smoking ban smoking ban",['the Ministry of Health and Welfare'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28159603 -0.10012817

According to the National Human Rights Commission, all foreign nationals at the centers -- which include refugee applicants and people waiting to be deported -- were prevented from having personal time at fixed schedules, except for three times a week for a one-hour workout and religious service time. Under the law, centers housing foreigners are not be run as general detention facilities, however the people held there are not free to leave. The report was documented based on the on-site inspection of facilities in three places: Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province; Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province; and Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. “Such an environment can make them feel like they are being detained rather than protected,” the state-run organization said. “Various types of protective facilities should be considered for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children or patients.” According to the commission’s analysis on the health records of the people held in the centers, 4 in 10 were found to have experienced mental anxiety due to the stress of living there. The longer they stayed in the facilities, the more they tended to suffer severe unease, it said. As part efforts to secure the residents’ mental health, the watchdog recommended that the facilities introduce mental health programs. The commission also pointed out the poor condition of the bathrooms. The sound and odor from the toilets could spread to separate shower rooms due to structure issues, the report said. People also had to change their clothes in places where other people might see them, it added.The report said children’s rights were also poorly protected. From January 2013 to April last year, 41 minors lived in the shelters. The NHRC said a 3-year-old had to stay in a center for three months because the child’s parents were caught violating immigration law. In 2011, the United Nations advised countries to regard children’s rights as the top priority and to refrain from detaining children of refugees or asylum-seekers. The watchdog also urged the government to ensure full Internet access in the facilities so that those inside could communicate with their families. The commission’s survey showed that 64.3 percent of the residents wished to have Internet access.

The members physically attacked the unionized workers for offering financial support to schools for ethnic Korean children, established by a major ethnic Korean organization that has close ties to North Korea. The ultra-nationalist group members also verbally abused some of the female teachers, calling them “traitors” among other things.The group, which claims it has about 15,000 members, was founded in 2006 to “eliminate privileges” extended to noncitizen residents in Japan, mostly ethnic Koreans who are descendants of laborers from the Korean Peninsula before and during the World War II. The group has been criticized for its use of racist and hateful remarks against ethnic minorities. The members have used terms such as “cockroaches” and “criminals” while referring to ethnic Koreans living in Japan, and called for them to be killed. Last year, the Kyoto District Court ordered the group’s members to pay 12 million yen ($120,000) to a Korean school in the city for disturbing classes and attacking children by holding anti-Korean rallies outside the property.Also last year, Japan’s National Police Agency placed the group on its watch list for the members’ continued use of hate speech against ethnic Koreans in the country.

The latter request is unlawful because it can affect key management decisions and force companies to reveal business secrets.  Besides such actions, the watchdog said the GS and Lotte malls used their superior bargaining positions vis-a-vis producers to unilaterally hike up their sales commissions.   ""They claimed poor sales as the reason for altering their previously set commission rates that hurt their product suppliers,"" the FTC said.   In addition, the corporate regulator said home shopping malls failed to pay product cost on time after sales took place, and skipped paying interest on delayed payments in clear violation of existing rules.  The FTC said it will work with other agencies to keep close tabs on shopping malls so a free and fair trade environment can be maintained.  Companies that shipped products to home shopping channels said the latest action, comes after a steady stream of complaints have been filed for unfair practices.  ""Taking firm action should promote more fair trade and halt practices of passing along costs to suppliers, just because it was done that way in the past,"" an employee for a company that ships products to home shopping malls said.

As far as sex crimes are concerned, the government will toughen the laws so civil servants and soldiers can lose their jobs when they are punished with fines for the crimes, the ministry said.The government also seeks to revise laws to fire all school teachers and restrict them from holding a similar position for life if they are dismissed from their posts or receive criminal punishment or medical treatment while in custody for sex crimes.One of the government-proposed bills is scheduled to be up for approval during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, officials said.The measure came amid a recent surge in the number of sex crimes allegedly committed by university professors against students and senior military officers against subordinates.According to police figures, sex offenses involving those in superior positions have risen more than twofold from 140 in 2010 to 283 last year.In the latest in a series of sexual offenses involving senior military officers, the Navy said on Wednesday that a vice admiral is being probed over allegations that he demanded a female caddie to sing and dance for him at a golf range. In late January, an Army colonel was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female subordinate several times. Three months earlier, a major general in charge of an Army division in the Seoul metropolitan area was arrested on charges of sexually harassing a female subordinate at his office five times.""Crimes of sexual violence involving those in superior positions is not only a grave crime but also a behavior posing a threat to the foundation of a workplace,"" Kim Hee-jung, minister of gender equality and family, told reporters after the meeting.""Public offices will take a lead in uprooting crimes of sexual violence by firmly dealing with such crimes under the 'no lenience' principle.""

The former presidential official is suspected of pulling strings at public offices, including the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, to offer special favors involving state-led projects between 2008 and 2013. The prosecution is also looking into possibilities that Lee’s aide may have received kickbacks, the reports said.The prosecution declined to comment on the reports.The official, whose name was withheld, was a college professor before he joined the presidential campaign in 2007, according to vernacular daily DongA Ilbo. He is also suspected of pressuring conglomerates to financially support a scholarship foundation. The official is also alleged to have taken massive funds from municipal offices to build an art center in his hometown and illegally transferred the ownership of the building to himself, the newspaper claimed. The former presidential official denies the wrongdoings, the report added.The investigation is considered to be a part of a widening probe into the former administration, including a questioning of other high-ranking officials at the Culture Ministry who served while Lee was in power.Lee’s so-called energy diplomacy has been under escalating criticism that many of the investment decisions for energy projects overseas resulted in huge losses and wasted taxpayers’ money.Last week prosecutors raided the head offices of a construction company in Seoul and the state-run oil company suspected of making a botched investment in a Russian oil exploration project during the previous administration. Last month, a parliamentary committee launched a separate investigation into Lee’s controversial push for the overseas projects.Lee’s supporters have claimed that the investigation is part of a “political witch hunt” and that it is too early to declare Lee’s initiative a failure.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","bribery prosecutors are investigating ,power bribery prosecutors ,of power bribery prosecutors ,prosecutors are investigating senior ,bribery prosecutors","['Lee Myung - bak', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48593628  0.15796962

She also reportedly left the country for vacation without notifying or receiving approval from the university, failing to show up for her courses.The university decided not to renew her contract in February 2014.Since losing her teaching position, the ex-professor brought her case to the Appeal Commission for Teachers, which requested the university to reconsider its decision. The university responded by filing a lawsuit.The court ruled in favor of the university under the premise that the ex-professor, whose online postings had included vulgar English phrases, displayed “highly deplorable behavior that strayed far from what is required of an educator.”“Publicly mocking grammatical mistakes that her students made in an English course is highly condemnable behavior unfit for an educator,” the judge said.“The students who wrote the English essays ridiculed by the (former) professor likely suffered psychological damage while the university sustained damage to its public image and reputation.”By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","professor for mocking students ,ridiculed her students english ,have ridiculed her students ,ridiculed her students ,foreign professor for mocking","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Ewha Womans University ’s']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.441836   -0.18508303

During their meeting on Friday, the relevant ministries and the Saenuri Party said they would seek protective measures for low-income earners by setting a reasonable minimum insurance fee that would prevent the low-income bracket from being saddled with a higher payment obligation. The Ministry of Health initially proposed setting the minimum health insurance fee at 16,480 won ($15). Lawmakers argued, however, that the new fee, if implemented without any protective measures, would increase health insurance fees for 1.28 million low- or no-income households, which currently pay as little as 3,450 won per month for health insurance.“We reached a consensus that the government must set a minimum health insurance fee with a focus on strengthening equality,” said Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Myung-soo, the leading chairman of the joint discussion on reforming the country’s health insurance payment scheme.“It is unreasonable to ask low-incomers who have been paying insurance fees as low as 3,450 won to pay the difference because the fee has risen for everyone. There are some people who can’t even manage to pay the 3,450 won,” Lee said, stressing the need for a fairer payment system.Officials on Friday also agreed to work closely with the National Tax Service to collect more accurate data on citizens’ income levels and payment situations in order to develop more efficient reform measures.“There are reportedly 4 million citizens with no income, yet we haven’t been able to grasp that figure. We proposed building a more accurate database with the National Tax Services to better restructure the health insurance payment system,” Lee added.The next joint discussion on reforming the national health care insurance system will be held on April 8, with a focus on free-rider issues and related reforms affecting company-employed residents.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","insurance revamp to benefit ,revamp to benefit low ,health insurance revamp ,lawmakers agreed to minimize ,health insurance revamp to",['the Saenuri Party'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33783945  0.07633654

About 39 percent of those between 9 and 11 were exposed to bullying, which is 9 percent higher than those between 12 and 17, the report said. The survey was part of the study on children’s school life based on a survey conducted in 2013. “Children’s school violence experiences affect their mental health, family relationships and even their adult life,” the institute said. “It is necessary to enhance programs against school violence at schools for younger children as the survey shows that a higher proportion of younger students are victims of bullying.” Boys were more prone to violence with 33.4 percent, versus 30.9 percent of girls.The study also showed that the students’ backgrounds played a factor in their exposure to violence.Those living in urban cities were more exposed to bullying with 35.4 percent while others in suburban areas reached 25.1 percent. Slightly over 31 percent of the victims came from two-parent households, while about 39 percent were raised by a single parent or grandparents.Meanwhile, the report also noted that about 11 percent of the surveyed students were engaged in so-called defiant acts, some of them illegal.Of about 7 percent of the respondents who said they had tried alcohol, more were residing in smaller cities (9.5 percent) or suburban areas (5.0 percent), compared to those living in metropolitan cities (3.4 percent).The report also said students living in smaller cities (5.0 percent) or suburbs (5.6 percent) were more likely to have smoked than those in larger cities (2.6 percent).By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","school violence report three ,school violence the younger ,school violence report ,bullying about 39 percent ,in 10 teenagers exposed",['the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69107628  0.23309316

He admitted he asked them to sing, but denied that they were asked to dance.The allegations are the latest in a series of sexual assault cases that has rattled the military, which has been pushing for a zero-tolerance campaign to fix its damaged public image and troop morale.The case was reported to the Navy in January after caddies filed complaints with the officials in charge of the golf course. The officials then reported it to senior Navy officials, who reportedly concluded that it was not a serious case of sexual abuse.The Navy did not reopen the case until it was reported by local media, but the officials denied they had any intention of concealing the incident.Defense Minister Han Min-koo ordered a “stern measure” should the commander be found guilty of any sexual crime.“Minister Han was briefed on the case by the chief of naval operations at 10 p.m. on Wednesday and he ordered the authorities to sternly deal with the case after verifying the facts,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Kim Min-seok told reporters.To wipe out sex crimes in the military, the Defense Ministry has been working to devise a comprehensive package of measures, including a “one-strike system” under which senior officials, if caught sexually harassing subordinate soldiers, will be forcibly expelled from the military for good.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","commander sexually harassed caddies ,star commander sexually harassed ,harassed caddies at golf ,three star commander sexually ,sexually harassed caddies at","['Navy', 'Jinhae , South Gyeongsang Province']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14807646  0.27392057

A group of students at Seoul National University gathered and arranged a joint movement demanding that the school conduct thorough investigations of on-campus sexual harassment and better protect the victims, rather than the assaulters.The campaign was sparked after the school was accused of having a lukewarm attitude in dealing with a high-profile sexual harassment case involving renowned science professor Kang Seok-jin last year.Kang, who is currently arrested, now faces charges of repeatedly sexually assaulting eight female students since 2008 and another woman during an event last July. Universities face growing calls to be more proactive about sexual harassment cases on campus. (Yonhap)The case rattled local academic circles, and the university was slammed for its lackluster measures. Soon after the scandal hit, the school accepted Kang’s resignation, only to rescind it later upon protests from students that a resignation would exempt Kang from an internal investigation as he would no longer be among the university’s faculty.“In sexual violence cases in universities, I don’t think the attackers are properly punished. It is frustrating to see the organization actually defending the perpetrators,” said Kim Ha-kyung, a member of SNU’s feminist student society Dal, which participated in the movement.The students argue that being subject to a sex crime on campus aggravates what is already a stressful experience due to education authorities’ nearly nonexistent protective measures.“There are no tangible measures to protect the victims (of sex crimes), nor are there any means to force punishment on the perpetrators,” said Kim.In incidents of on-campus sexual harassment, a student generally submits the case to the relevant school authorities ― such as SNU’s human rights center ― and school authorities investigate the case to determine the validity of the accusation to be handed over to the police. In most cases, the case wraps up with the school penalizing the teacher unless the victim decides to go ahead and file a charge with the police separately.What is further hindering the victims is the fear that Korea’s conservative male-dominant society will slap a scarlet letter on them for even being involved in such a case. “I went drinking with a professor and we went to a karaoke bar. He sat beside me and told me to sing a song, while he casually put a hand on my thigh. From then on, he kept touching my thigh or my waist,” said an anonymous student victim. Despite her discomfort, she was afraid to tell anyone about it because she was “scared of attracting attention.”“I didn’t care about strangers talking behind my back, but sometimes people with the best intentions can hurt me with kind words.”It is rare for victims of on-campus sexual violence to press criminal charges, out of concern that the case will become publicized and he or she will become topic of public scrutiny. Kang’s case was no exception, with the incident remaining under wraps until students at other schools began talking about it, and the students at SNU began to come forward only after the case was out in the open.Some 65.3 percent of student victims in sex abuse cases did not take any action, according to a survey by the Presidential Committee on Young Generation. They cited that many universities mandate the victims to submit their names, phone numbers and details of the abuse without a clear guarantee of information protection.Officials at the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center said victims often tend to be timid, out of concern that people will accuse them of receiving grades or favors in exchange for sexual services. The victim’s shame and guilt are actually allowing sexual predators from facing due justice, they say.“Students, ironically, are afraid of the consequences that their teachers will face. Sometimes they think (the sexual harassment) is because ‘he likes me,’ which is a total misunderstanding. It is merely a sick habit,” said Bae Jeong-weon, a sex education councilor who heads the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life. “Students are young and innocent and could feel guilty about having someone fired. But it is purely because that person had a vulgar demeanor.”Calls for more organized and stricter investigations against sexual harassment on campuses are rising as the number of reported sexual harassment cases increase, not just by professors but among the students.Last week, Sogang University publicly apologized for an incident that occurred during its freshmen welcoming workshop, when a group of older students used sexually offensive terms in allocating rooms for first-year students. Some of the phrases stuck on the memos in the front doors of the rooms for female participants included “Touch it even if it’s small” and “I love breasts.”The incident ― which touched off a near-nationwide furor ― was only the latest in the long line of recent on-campus sex-related cases that have stained the reputation of Korea’s most prestigious universities, hinting at lackluster sexual awareness of the presumed intellectuals dwelling in the ivory tower.“Some young students think sex jokes makes them look open-minded and cool, but it is simply rude. It disregards the fact that each person has a different perception of sex depending on their upbringing, religious background and other factors,” Bae said.She also pointed to the lack of proper sex education for teenagers. Although the government mandates 15 hours of sex education per year for all schools, a survey by professor Woo Nam-sik from Kukje Theological University and Seminary found that 60 percent of teenagers said they learned “nothing new” in the school sex education cases. A recent survey by seven sex education institutions in Seoul found nearly half of middle school students in Seoul do not talk to anyone about sex.Experts have raised concern that without any authority figure to point the teenagers in the right direction, young students’ perceptions of sex are often influenced by other mediums such as pornography. Sexual predators have also been a problem in other countries such as the U.S. and U.K., where even top-tier schools like Oxford and Cambridge make sexual consent workshops a compulsory part of their freshmen orientations.A student at Northwestern University in the U.S. took legal action against the school after it failed to discipline a professor who sexually assaulted her.After a myriad of university sex crime cases bombarded the country last year, the Education Ministry in December recommended to universities to revise their regulations so professors accused of a sex crime could not voluntarily quit their jobs. Allowing those who committed sex crimes to resign offers them a near-free pass, since it spares them from further investigation conducted by the university. Unless the case is taken to court, which it rarely is, the perpetrator can evade justice and find another job. But the move, which the ministry claimed was “an unprecedented measure,” remains strictly voluntary for now.According to the ministry, the human rights standards related to sex crimes do not factor into the statewide college and university evaluation, meaning the government cannot force schools to comply under the threat of cutting subsidies or student openings.Each year, SNU provides online classes on prevention of sex-related crimes for faculty members. But according to Rep. Ahn Min-suk of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, only 20 percent of the professors take the lessons.Moreover, recent data provided by Rep. Park Joo-sun of the NPAD revealed that the Education Ministry is keeping track of sex offenses at 78 universities, only 38 percent of 98 universities here.The ministry vowed to pass a bill banning sex criminals from ever teaching again at college or universities within 2014. But the cited bill has not even been submitted to the National Assembly, raising questions about the authorities’ resolve to get to the bottom of the problem that has been ailing colleges and universities across the nation.By Yoon Min-sik, Won Ho-jung(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com) (hjwon@heraldcorp.com)","sex crimes plague universities ,crimes plague universities last ,on campus sexual harassment ,plague universities last month ,universities last month disconcerting",['Seoul National University'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68392628  0.15266003

Also, children were more likely to become involved in traffic incidents during the spring semester, particularly in May. Cases involving 7-year-olds made up 13.2 percent of the cases analyzed.The findings were part of a report that inspected some 140 billion data points related to traffic accidents, weather, and dangerous driving behaviors to determine the necessary steps in revising traffic laws and policies. To tackle the high number of accidents near schools, the Seoul government said it would strengthen traffic safety measures such as building speed bumps around the 50 elementary schools that have the most accidents, and increasing traffic safety education for young students in cooperation with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.The report also included studies on traffic accidents involving senior citizens, drunken driving and jaywalking near bus stops. Senior citizens were most likely to be involved in traffic accidents around traditional markets or parks. Jaywalking incidents were five times more likely to occur around bus stations located on bus-only lanes than around regular bus stations on the side of the road.

A group of students at Seoul National University gathered and arranged a joint movement demanding that the school conduct thorough investigations of on-campus sexual harassment and better protect the victims, rather than the assaulters.(Yonhap)The campaign was sparked after the school allegedly showed a lukewarm attitude in dealing with a high-profile sexual harassment case involving renowned science professor Kang Seok-jin last year.Kang, currently arrested, now faces charges of repeatedly sexually assaulting eight female students since 2008 and another woman during an event last July.The case rattled local academic circles, and the university was slammed for its lackluster measures. Soon after the scandal hit, the school accepted Kang’s resignation, only to rescind it later upon protests from students that a resignation would exempt Kang from an internal investigation as he would no longer be among the university’s faculty.“In sexual violence cases in universities, I don‘t think the attackers are properly punished. It is frustrating to see the organization actually defending the perpetrators,” said Kim Ha-kyung, a member of SNU’s feminist student society Dal, which participated in the movement.The students argue that being subject to a sex crime on campus aggravates what is already a stressful experience due to education authorities’ nearly nonexistent protective measures.“There are no tangible measures to protect the victims (of sex crimes), nor are there any means to force punishment on the perpetrators,” said Kim.In incidents of on-campus sexual harassment, a student generally submits the case to the relevant school authorities -- a human rights center as at SNU -- and school authorities investigate the case to determine the validity of the accusation to be handed over to the police. In most cases, the case wraps up with the school penalizing the teacher unless the victim decides to go ahead and file a charge with the police separately.What is further hindering the victims is the fear that Korea’s highly conservative male-dominant society will slap a scarlet letter on them for even being involved in such a case. “I went drinking with a professor and we went to a karaoke bar. He sat beside me and told me to sing a song, while he casually put a hand on my thigh. From then on, he kept touching my thigh or my waist,” said an anonymous student victim. Despite her discomfort, she was afraid to tell anyone about it because she was “scared of attracting attention.”“I didn’t care about strangers talking behind my back, but sometimes people with the best intentions can hurt me with kind words.”It is rare for victims of on-campus sexual violence to press criminal charges, out of concern that the case will become publicized and he or she will become topic of public scrutiny. Kang’s case was no exception, with the incident remaining under wraps until students at other schools began talking about it, and the students at SNU began to come forward only after the case was out in the open.Some 65.3 percent of student victims in sex abuse cases did not take any action, according to a survey by the Presidential Committee on Young Generation. They cited that many universities mandate the victims to submit their names, phone numbers and details of the abuse without a clear guarantee of information protection.Officials at the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center said victims often tend to be timid, out of concern that people will accuse them of receiving grades or favors in exchange for sexual services. The victim’s shame and guilt are actually allowing sexual predators from facing due justice, they say.“Students, ironically, are afraid of the consequences that their teachers will face. Sometimes they think (the sexual harassment) is because ‘he likes me,’ which is a total misunderstanding. It is merely a sick habit,” said Bae Jeong-weon, a sex education councilor who heads the Center for Sexuality and Harmonious Life. “Students are young and innocent and could feel guilty about having someone fired. But it is purely because that person had a vulgar demeanor.”Calls for more organized and stricter investigations against sexual harassment on campuses are rising as the number of reported sexual harassment cases increase, not just by professors but among the students.Last week, Sogang University publicly apologized for an incident that occurred during its freshmen welcoming workshop, when a group of older students used sexually offensive terms in allocating rooms for first-year students. Some of the phrases stuck on the memos in the front doors of the rooms for female participants included “Touch my breasts even if they’re too small” and “I love breasts.”The incident -- which touched off a near-nationwide furor -- was only the latest in the long line of recent on-campus sex-related cases that have stained the reputation of Korea’s most prestigious universities, hinting at lackluster sexual awareness of the presumed intellectuals dwelling in the ivory tower.“Some young students think sex jokes makes them look open-minded and cool, but it is simply rude. It disregards the fact that each person has a different perception of sex depending on their upbringing, religious background and other factors,” Bae said.She also pointed to the lack of proper sex education on teenagers. Although the government mandates 15 hours of sex education per year for all schools, a survey by professor Woo Nam-sik from Kukje Theological University and Seminary found that 60 percent of teenagers said they learned “nothing new” in the school sex education cases. A recent survey by seven sex education institutions in Seoul found nearly half of middle school students in Seoul do not talk to anyone about sex.Experts have raised concern that without any authority figure to point the teenagers in the right direction, young students’ perception of sex are often influenced by other mediums such as pornography. Sexual predators have also been a common plague in other countries such as the U.S. and U.K., where even top-tier schools like Oxford and Cambridge make sexual consent workshops a compulsory part of their freshmen orientations.A student at Northwestern University in the U.S. took legal action against the school after it failed to discipline a professor who sexually assaulted her.After a myriad of university sex crime cases bombarded the country last year, the Education Ministry in December recommended to universities to revise their regulations so professors accused of a sex crime could not voluntarily quit their jobs. Allowing those who committed sex crimes to resign quintessentially offers them a near-free pass, since it spares them from further investigation conducted by the university. Unless the case is taken to court, which it rarely is, the perpetrator can evade justice and find another job. But the move, which the ministry claimed was “an unprecedented measure,” remains strictly voluntary for now.According to the ministry, the human rights standards including sex crimes do not factor into the statewide college and university evaluation, meaning the government cannot force schools to comply under the threat of cutting subsidies or student openings.Each year, SNU provides online classes on prevention of sex-related crimes for faculty members. But according to Rep. Ahn Min-suk of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, only 20 percent of the professors take the lessons.Moreover, recent data provided by Rep. Park Joo-sun of the NPAD revealed that the Education Ministry is keeping track of sex offenses at 78 universities, only 38 percent of 98 universities here.The ministry vowed to pass a bill banning sex criminals from ever teaching again at college or universities within 2014. But the cited bill has not even been submitted to the National Assembly, raising questions on the authorities’ resolve to get to the bottom of the problem that has been ailing colleges and universities across the nation.By Yoon Min-sik and Won Ho-jung (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","sex crimes plague universities ,crimes plague universities last ,plague universities last month ,on campus sexual harassment ,reoccurring sex crimes plague",['Seoul National University'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56074351  0.02986258

On Thursday, it arrested a senior official of an affiliate of Lee’s company for complicity in the case.  Lee Kyu-tae, chairman of Ilgwang GongyeongLee is suspected of pocketing some 50 billion won ($44.4 million) by defrauding Seoul’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration. Since 2002, Lee has brokered deals to procure the training system between the DAPA and the foreign firm.Investigators are also looking into why the government did not demand any compensation from the Turkish firm for the delay in the delivery of the training system. The delivery, which was to be completed by May 2012, had been postponed for about two months. The government did not ask for compensation in accordance with bilateral contract terms, triggering speculation that the Turkish firm might have been spared of the responsibility to pay the compensation following Lee’s suspected lobbying of officials in the military and the DAPA.As Lee’s 30-year-old brokerage firm has engaged in many state acquisition projects, the ongoing probe into the firm could reveal more corruptive activities involving former and current government officials.  The front gate of Ilgwang Gongyeong, a large Korean defense broker that has engaged in various high-profile state procurement deals. (Yonhap)It was not the first time that Lee has faced corruption charges. He was arrested on charges of dereliction of duty and embezzlement in 2009 after he worked as a defense broker in the process of purchasing Russian-made weapons.The acceleration of the probe, launched in November, came amid lingering public distrust over the investigative team.Critics accused the team of focusing too much on individuals’ alleged corruption rather than directing the probe toward helping to eliminate “structural problems” that have facilitated corruption in the defense industry.Announcing its interim result of the probe last Sunday, the investigation team said projects involving corruptive activities were worth nearly 200 billion won combined, and that it had indicted 23 people, including five retired generals and five active-duty officials, on corruption charges. But public criticism rose after it was reported that four of the five indicted active-duty officials were released, while all civilian suspects were still detained. Critics said the military judicial system was “too lenient” on military suspects, hampering the anticorruption campaign. The military authorities argued that the officials in question were released as they confessed to their corruption. But observers said those who were released could destroy evidence, posing hurdles to the ongoing probe against them.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo vowed to employ a zero-tolerance policy against corruption, calling the ongoing anticorruption campaign a “critical undertaking where the nation’s fate is at stake.”“Our government will muster up all its capabilities to carry out this historic task to stamp out corruption as we believe that there will be no other chance to push for it if we fail this time,” he said in a statement to the nation. “Whatever cost it may take, we will complete our task to eradicate corruption.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","governmental team investigating corruption ,team investigating corruption in ,team investigating corruption ,corruption in the defense ,investigating corruption in the",[],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46726027  0.21657713

One of the girls reportedly had to quit school as she was repeatedly visited by the boys’ parents in the classroom and verbally attacked for reporting their sons to the police. The victims were blamed for “seducing the boys” and “not behaving properly as girls.”“(In our experience), it is in fact common for parents of juvenile sex offenders to be unaware of what sexual violence is or means,” said Kim Yoon-kyung, an official in the Gender Equality Ministry’s division for youth protection from sexual crimes.“They may also feel defensive of their child and angry that she or he could be accused of such a crime. And that is why both young offenders and their parents need to be educated together.”Since 2013, the South Korean government has been offering classes for teenage sex offenders, which they are asked to attend with their parents. In an effort to prevent second offenses and to better protect the victims, the ministry plans to expand the number of required sessions this year, officials said. The classes will be given to 230 individuals from 81 households this year, up from only 123 people from 58 households in 2014.Kim stressed that most juvenile delinquents have problems at home. In South Korea, 1 in 5 juvenile offenders is from a single-parent household or broken home. Among 91,633 convicted juvenile offenders here in 2013, 54.7 percent were living below the poverty line, according to a study released by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office.Kwon Hyun-jung, a women and children’s rights activist who has educated many teenage sex offenders, says one of the biggest family problems that may lead children to commit sex crimes is the lack of communication with their parents. “Children who don’t really talk to their parents, as well as those who think they are not getting the attention they need at home, often give no thought to parental reactions in the situation of temptation (of committing a crime),” Kwon told The Korea Herald.“And when the parent is not present psychologically when temptation to commit a crime occurs, it is much more likely that the child will commit the act.”However, most juvenile sex offenders commit a crime out of curiosity as well as lack of awareness, she said. “I would say, only 10 percent of the juvenile offenders end up doing such activities because they genuinely want to harm others,” she said.One of the juvenile offenders at Kwon’s organization in fact was a well-behaved high school student with good grades. He was caught after forcibly taking pictures of the private parts of an elementary school student. During his mandatory session with his parents, he broke down in tears, sharing how he had been stressed because of his schoolwork, and how difficult it was for him to tell his family about the academic pressure. “Looking at pornography was his way of escaping the stress, and that’s where he got the idea for his crime,” the activist said. “If he had other ways to relieve his stress or had someone who would listen to his problems, things could’ve been different.”Another teenage offender at the organization was a middle school student who gang-raped a fellow student. The student told his educators he was “simply curious” what it would be like to have sexual intercourse with a girl. His parents were strict and conservative, and the offender rarely talked to them at home. “Some of the notions he had were problematic,” Kwon said. “For example, he thought women shouldn’t drink (alcohol) or dress provocatively to avoid being raped. He also thought if a woman was drinking at the time of the rape or attack, the behavior of her abuser can be justified.”Kwon said the average age of juvenile sex offenders is dropping significantly; the youngest offender she has taught was a fourth-grader. “Under the current law, children aged 14 or under cannot be punished even if he or she commits sex crimes,” said Kim Jae-ryun, a lawyer who currently heads the Gender Ministry’s women and youth rights bureau.“That is why these education classes are extremely important.” In 2012, 23.5 percent of Korean children watched pornography for the first time as elementary school students, according to a study released by the Gender Ministry. The data also showed that 57.2 percent of teenagers that year did not use birth control when they had sex.“Inevitably, children are influenced by their parents and their authority figures,” activist Kwon said, adding that quality sex education and human rights awareness is needed for both parents and children. “Teenagers need either their parents or school to teach (them) what violence is and why it is never okay to engage in any act without the other person’s consent. In order to do that, grown-ups first need to accept that very concept of human rights.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","after raping five schoolgirls ,raping five schoolgirls on ,raping five schoolgirls ,police after raping five ,the police after raping","['Miryang', 'South Gyeongsang Province']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22526169  0.19030422

Bad, corruptive practices will no longer be tolerated.”The change-of-command ceremony was attended by top defense officials including Defense Minister Han Min-koo, who expressed appreciation for outgoing CNO Hwang Ki-chul’s contributions to the nation’s naval defense.On Monday, Hwang stepped down from his post over a corruption scandal, wrapping up his 41-year service. His resignation came amid public criticism over a separate high-profile corruption scandal involving former CNO Jeong Ok-geun.Touching on the readiness of naval forces, Jung said that he would push for “creative and effective” naval operations to maintain a robust maritime defense and win in future battle environments.Since being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1980, Jung has served in various top positions including in the Naval Education and Training Command, and the Republic of Korea Fleet Command.

""The government is considering conducting additional tests and re-education after a certain period of time, and canceling the licenses of those who fall behind the standard to prevent them from distorting Korean history and culture.""  According to the Korea Tourism Organization, 6.12 million Chinese visited South Korea last year, up 41.6 percent from a year ago, raising their ratio among foreign tourist groups from 35.5 percent to 43.1 percent.

The survey released Monday by Yoon’s English School found that more than 90 percent of parents here were not planning to reduce spending on the subject.Some 82.9 percent of Korean parents said they would not reduce the amount they spent on English education, while another 10.3 percent were planning to spend more. The survey consulted 514 parents of elementary, middle and high schools. Only 6.8 percent said they would cut down on spending on private classes.The Education Ministry is planning to apply an absolute grading system to the English section of the state-commissioned college entrance exam ― called Suneung ― starting in 2017. The move is an attempt to relieve academic pressure on students. The current curved grading system sorts all students in to nine groups based on rank and assigns scores this way. The ministry claims that this has fueled what it called “excessive competition.”The new system would allow students to get grades based solely on their performances, irrespective of how well other students perform, the officials said.But the survey showed that Suneung English was the primary concern for just 7.3 percent of parents. The majority ― 51.8 percent ― thought English skills were important regardless of the college exam.“English is considered crucial (among parents) in several aspects of life, such as getting jobs or promotion, so the absolute grading system seems to have a limited effect on the actual private education market,” said an official from Yoon’s English School.Widespread distrust in the government’s education policy as a whole was also hinted, as 23.2 percent of the parents said they had to be prepared in case the authorities changed their minds about the absolute grading system. A recent survey by the state-run Korean Educational Development Institute showed that only 8.7 percent of Korean adults had faith in the government’s education policy.Students’ lack of trust in the public education system also appears to drive them toward private institutes. A recent survey showed that 69 percent of students said school classes were insufficient for trying to improve one’s English skills.“Korean law doesn’t even allow schools to fire an English teacher who got 415 in TOEIC. Authorities say they will enhance public education but it’s impossible to do so without improving the quality of teachers of the subject,” said an official from local education firm YBM. “If the public officials can’t improve the quality of education, then maybe they should entrust the task to the private sector.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","english tests may fail ,percent of korean parents ,reduce english language education ,90 percent of parents ,english language education costs","['Yoon ’s English School', 'korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3776136   0.03053444

Despite the destruction, authorities have so far not received reports of serious injuries, missing people, or deaths.""Everyone is breathing a deep sigh of relief that there has been, to this date, no loss of life,"" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters.Palaszczuk said the central Queensland coastal town of Yeppoon, about 670 kilometres north of the capital Brisbane, and nearby Rockhampton were the worst hit.""The cyclone has actually caused quite some considerable damage in both Yeppoon and Rockhampton,"" she said, adding that some 60,000 people were without power.""Yeppoon has suffered the brunt of the cyclone and it is going to take a lot longer for power to be restored there.""Queensland's fire and emergency services said 200 homes in Yeppoon and 340 in Rockhampton were damaged or flooded.    - 'It just exploded' -Andrew Bennett described how his Yeppoon house was torn apart by the cyclone.""It was incredible, it just exploded,"" he told Brisbane's Courier Mail as he described the ""roaring"" wind. ""The house seemed to pulsate and the wind blew out the window. Then the roof blew off. I couldn't believe all the rain that was coming in.""The clean-up process has started in Rockhampton, which Marcia passed directly over, as fallen trees were removed from roads.There were long queues for fuel as it ran out at the two stations with power in the town of 80,000 residents, with people filling jerrycans for generators.Some 700 soldiers and several helicopters were ready to be deployed to help with the damage assessment and debris removal, Palaszczuk said, adding that emergency services, police and energy workers were already on the ground.In the Northern Territory, a state of emergency has been declared for areas hardest hit by Lam.Federal disaster relief support would be offered to affected residents, Abbott said, adding that similar help was also extended to Queensland.Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles said teams working with the Aboriginal communities of Galiwinku, Milingimbi, Ramingining and Gapuwiyak to restore power and water.Parts of southeast Queensland, which has already been saturated by a separate weather system bringing hundreds of millimetres of rain to the region since Thursday, could be hit by flooding as Marcia tracks south before moving out to sea later Saturday.Flood warnings have also been issued for northeast New South Wales state just below Queensland.Queensland has been smashed by several major storms and cyclones over the past few years with Cyclone Oswald, also a category five, flooding parts of the state in 2013, racking up insurance claims of some Aus$977 million (US$765 million).","twin cyclones more floods ,after two severe cyclones ,cyclones more floods expected ,severe cyclones left trail ,cyclones more floods","['AFP', 'Marcia', 'Queensland']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69469595  0.16081233

Last month, Duksung Women’s University filed a police complaint against a professor, whose personal information has been withheld, for molesting a student. The professor is alleged to have forcibly kissed his student after drinking last year. The school’s unusually proactive response to the alleged sex crime could be a wake-up call for Korea’s universities, as many of them were considered to have been passive in dealing with similar cases in recent times. Having received a report from the victim, the Duksung conducted an internal probe and secured the professor’s testimony, in which he admitted his wrongdoing, school officials said. He denied his charges to police, public investigators said. The police will summon the professor again soon, they added.

Students already attending the institutes and those coming to the cited schools through a student exchange program, however, will be able to receive a visa.The measure is part of the ministry’s International Education Quality Assurance System that evaluates local tertiary education institutes’ capacity to host international students. “The visa restriction will last for a year, starting in the second semester of 2015. We would advise the cited schools to focus on managing the foreign students they have, rather than to trying to attract new foreign students,” said a ministry official.The key factors in the evaluation include the ratio of foreign students who are illegal residents, the number of foreign students who dropped out before receiving a degree and the school’s financial stability.“Since the IEQAS was introduced in 2011, Korea has seen a consistent decrease in the number of foreign students illegally residing in Korea. We were able to improve the general image of studying in Korea,” the official said.According to the Justice Ministry, the number of international students who stayed in Korea illegally slid from 7,546 in 2013 to 6,779 in 2014.The IEQAS committee consists of officials from the education and justice ministries along with civilian members. In addition to penalizing colleges for poor management of foreign students, they accredit institutes that excel in the area.It newly certified 37 universities and colleges in 2014, bringing the total number of approved institutes to 83. The accreditation is valid for three years. These institutes will be subject to benefits like more lenient standards by authorities issuing student visas, and priority in state-run projects or scholarship programs like the Global Korea Scholarship.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","four colleges banned from ,colleges banned from accepting ,four colleges banned ,colleges will be prohibited ,students four korean colleges","['korean', 'the Education Ministry', 'Hansei University', 'Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology', 'Jeonbuk Science College', 'Taegu Science University']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34860253  0.37993279

The Health Ministry will require all clinics that perform surgeries involving general anesthesia to be fully equipped with emergency medical supplies including a pulse oximeter and a ventilator as well as uninterrupted power supply.The ministry is also set to ban plastic surgery advertisements that do not properly inform patients of possible side effects, including ones with dramatic before and after photographs and ones that feature celebrities as models. Also, clinics will be encouraged to install surveillance cameras in their operating rooms for their patients’ safety.In order to make sure every patient has access to information about the surgeons who are in charge of their treatment, clinics will be required to display the name of the surgeon in front of the operating room before and during surgical procedures. Some clinics have been accused of having inexperienced surgeons perform procedures while telling patients that their surgery is being performed by experienced ones, as they cannot make out once they are put under anesthesia.In December, a number of health workers were investigated by health authorities for having a birthday party in an operating room in the middle of a surgical procedure at a plastic surgery clinic. “These measures will enhance safety in the nation’s plastic surgery sector,” said the ministry in a statement. “We believe this will help attract more foreign patients as well.”The number of Korean patients filing medical disputes after receiving cosmetic surgery or other aesthetic treatments increased dramatically from 439 in 2012 to 805 last year. Last year, a woman in her 50s died of dyspnea while receiving liposuction at a clinic in Seoul’s affluent district of Gangnam in September.In January, a Chinese woman who suffered a cardiac arrest while receiving plastic surgery in southern Seoul was sent to a general hospital and fell into a coma.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","plastic surgery rules tightened ,surgery rules tightened ,of controversial medical accidents ,surgery rules tightened following ,controversial medical accidents in",['the Health Ministry'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35723493  0.00763584

Abused minors can now directly request a court to suspend or strip off the parental rights of their parents, officials said. They were previously only allowed to file lawsuits through legal representatives. Otherwise, they had to wait until their legal age of 19. This is part of the court’s new measures to protect the children’s rights in family litigation, officials said. Public criticism grew over minors’ rights as many of them were being used as pawns in custody battles.To better carry out the new measure, the authorities will provide the underage litigants with legal assistants who will support the lawsuit processes, the court said.The court also made it mandatory to listen to the testimonies of children if the domestic cases affect the welfare of minors, the authorities said. Until now, the court was not obligated to hear children under 13 in parental rights or custody battles. The court authorities also strengthened the punishment for divorced parents who do not provide child support expenses without reasonable excuses. If the settled child expenses are not paid over 30 days, they can face a fine or detention, court officials said. Previously, the authorities could order detention only after 90 days.

He also reportedly wrapped his arm around a third student’s waist. In addition, there are allegations that he verbally abused female students, asking them their underwear size and about their physical relations with boyfriends.Meanwhile, a police station in southern Seoul is investigating another professor, surnamed Baek, into charges that he kissed a female student in November 2014. The professor is suspected of having touched her thigh a number of times over several months.The SNU human rights center is also conducting a probe into the claim. As soon as the center finalizes its inquiry, the school is expected to set up a decision-making panel to determine the sanction severity.In November, professor Kang Seok-jin of the department of mathematical sciences at SNU tendered his resignation following a scandal that he sexually abused dozens of his students for years.Kang had been under a prosecutors’ investigation for allegedly molesting a female intern who worked for him during the 2014 International Congress for Mathematicians in August, at which he was one of the speakers.After the case was reported, other female students spoke out claiming they too were sexually harassed by him.Kang was eventually placed under custody in early December on charges of molesting 22 students over the past 10 years. The university initially accepted his resignation, virtually letting him off the hook for the alleged crimes.A resignation before the university punishes him could ensure his severance pay, pension and little disadvantage when he seeks new jobs.However, following a public outcry, SNU rejected his resignation and vowed to continue its investigation.The school unveiled a plan in September to draft a Charter of Human Rights, becoming the first university to do so.

The ticket prices are in the relatively cheap 30,000 won ($27.36) range. The carrier has been changing sites after three to four days.  Industry sources estimated that about 20,000 tickets have been sold through TMON since last week, with more than 10,000 tickets also sold via WeMakePrice and Coupang.   It is not unprecedented but unusual that Korean Air has turned to social commerce stores to sell tickets in large numbers, especially for the Seoul-Jeju route which is heavily dominated by low-cost carriers.   The move is seen as an effort by Korean Air to lure customers away from the budget carriers, which have been chipping away at its dominance in domestic flight services. It also comes amid worries that customers are shunning Korean Air after the so-called ""nut rage"" incident that has tarnished its image among travelers.   Cho Hyun-ah, the eldest daughter of the airline's chairman, is on trial for endangering aviation safety after she ordered a senior crew member to deplane, angered that her macadamia nut snack was served in an unopened bag instead of on a plate. The Dec. 5 Seoul-bound flight out of New York had to return to the gate so that the crew member could get off.  On Monday, prosecutors sought a three-year prison term for Cho.  Experts say that the incident tarnished the image of Korean Air, which led many travelers to pick other airlines for their travel.  In December, Korean Air transported a total of 482,000 passengers through its domestic lines, down 6.6 percent from a year earlier. In contrast, Asiana Airlines, the second-largest air carrier, said its domestic flight customers increased 13.2 percent.

It is also considering employing a “one-strike” system in which senior officials, caught sexually harassing subordinate soldiers, will be forcibly expelled from the military for good, a senior Army official said.“We will toughen our disciplinary rules for sex crimes to mete out heavy punishments to those who sexually harass someone in the Army or commit worse sexual crimes,” the official told the media, declining to be named.Heavy punishments include suspension for one to three months, demotion, dismissal from the current position and expulsion from the military. The Army has taken such a hardline stance as sex crimes have continue to occur despite its adoption of a no-tolerance policy. It is expected to announce a comprehensive package of plans next month to stamp out sex crimes. The Army also plans to form a special agency at its headquarters dedicated to handling sex crimes. The agency to be headed by an Army deputy chief will consist of senior officials in charge of military investigation, law and personnel management. It will also be used to check whether each unit sternly deals with sex crimes on-site. To enhance education against sex crimes, the Army seeks to conduct a three-hour educational session for enlisted soldiers every three weeks. Soldiers have so far taken only one session each year.“We seek to improve education against sex crimes. Rather than offering just a rote-memorization class, we will devise a program in which draftees can engage in active discussions (to prevent sex crimes),” an army official said on condition of anonymity.”Last week, military police arrested an incumbent brigade commander on charges of sexually assaulting a female noncommissioned officer. The colonel, 47, in charge of a unit in Gangwon Province, is alleged to have sexually assaulted the NCO, 21, at his military residence on several occasions in the past two months. The colonel argues that the sexual relationship was based on “mutual consent,” while the NCO says she was sexually assaulted. Hours after the colonel’s arrest, Army Chief of Staff Kim Yo-hwan held an impromptu meeting with top commanders to discuss the case and ways to stamp out sexual crimes.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","sexually harassing subordinate soldiers ,army sex offenders ,soldiers will be forcibly ,army sex offenders to ,officials caught sexually harassing","['Army', 'Army']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01395811 -0.03973956

A special task force team is being launched in a bid to deal with fraud phone calls and new tricks from scammers, a police official said.The state-run financial regulator also warned that voice phishing scammers actively make fraud calls pretending to be parcel delivery services, since many Koreans send gifts for the occasion. “Be suspicious of unsolicited calls even if the caller claims to represent a respected or well-known company,” an official from the Financial Supervisory Service said.When a government organization has to contact individuals, it will never be through phone call but by sending a written statement, it added.A voice phishing scammer is caught on CCTV camera installed at a bank in Seoul. (Yonhap)According to the FSS data, there were 5,795 victims of voice phishing and a total of 58.6 billion won ($53.5 million) stolen in the first half of 2014 alone -- an increase of 39.2 percent and 121.1 percent respectively on-year.The Korea Internet and Safety Agency data showed that the amount of damages from scamming was 10.6 billion won from 1,480 cases in 2006.Experts said the numbers soared in 2013 as scams became sophisticated with the advent of smartphones -- from smishing to pharming and voice phishing. But the FSS data showed that just one out of 10 victims (11.4 percent) was able to recover the lost money in the first half of 2014. It is a 5.2 percent drop compared to 2013.Over the years, vishing scam calls came from China and were untraceable. But the tricks that scammers use have grown bold off late.When the new regulation surrounding year-end tax adjustment became a hot issue recently, smishing scammers sent text messages with a link to the financial organization website -- a fake website that charges large sums from the phone bill.A growing number of scammers pretended to be an official of the FSS or a government organization. They asked victims to update their personal confidential information such as bank account, credit card number and pin number. They used this information to withdraw cash or credit cash advances from ATM machines.Some even worked in teams to extort money from victims in a more systematic way.Police said Thursday that a team of eight unemployed college graduates were arrested for allegedly extorting 1.1 billion won over five years from some 100 victims in Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province.These perpetrators worked in pairs so they could withdraw money as quickly as possible from the ATM machines as well as to wipe their history quickly, a Daegu police official told a local media outlet. In a bid to prevent and minimize the damages of vishing scam victims, the FSS launched a system earlier this week to crack down on “fake bank deposit book” that may be abused by scammers.In 2012, the FSS introduced measures to prevent phone fraud cases, such as delaying withdrawals of large-sum financial transactions.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)","police step up crackdown ,tricks from scammers police ,forthcoming lunar new year ,scammers actively make fraud ,phishing ahead of holidays",[],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49170336  0.16619578

The rest of the recommendations will be revised or improved, the ministry said. As for academic credit, the ministry seeks to allow draftees to acquire it after completing three weeks of military training. It also plans to establish a system under which conscripts can acquire 18 credits ― enough to complete one university semester. Defense Minister Han Min-koo, (Yonhap)“Currently, 110 universities recognize these military credits, and other universities including Seoul National University have also expressed their willingness to recognize the credits,” said Minister Han.To reduce abuses among draftees in hard-to-monitor military installations, the ministry seeks to install more surveillance cameras, which it believes will help prevent and promptly detect abuse cases.To address the increase in the sex crime rate in the military, the ministry plans to apply a toughened rule to prosecute any soldier charged with sex crimes, and detain those suspected of a serious sex crime during an investigation process.By next year, the military also plans to offer mobile phones to all units to be shared by the enlisted troops so that they can better communicate with their families, particularly parents.As for its consideration of offering some extra points in the recruitment exams after soldiers’ discharge, the ministry plans to further develop the plan as it is still difficult to determine who will receive the extra points. The ministry previously said the extra points will be given those who “perform conscientiously.”Meanwhile, the Army is reportedly moving to draft a code of conduct to strengthen discipline against sexual misconduct. The move comes after a series of sex crime cases including a recent one in which a brigade commander sexually assaulted a young female noncommissioned officer.Under the code, a soldier is reportedly barred from entering the military residence of another of the opposite sex, and physical contact between male and female soldiers is strictly limited to shaking hands.

Those who do not remove pet waste in public will also face a tougher fine, officials said.

Park’s approval ratings recently hit a new low of 34.1 percent.Under the new system, the authorities levy less taxes throughout the year and return less in tax settlements at the beginning of a new year. The key issue is that workers who did not spend much through the year face greater tax burdens in February.Though the Finance Ministry had asserted that the new scheme was aimed at improvement in wealth distribution, there are concerns that more middle and low-income workers could eventually be subject to higher taxation.The meeting drew attention as four extraordinary aides, who was appointed early Monday, joined discussions with the senior presidential secretaries. The post of extraordinary aide have been created to bolster communications with the public.Public support for Park waned further last week, after preliminary calculations of this year’s tax settlements showed that taxpayers nationwide could end up paying more taxes, or receive much smaller rebates than expected. Revisions to tax codes in 2013 by the government were blamed for the increased taxes.Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party on Monday denounced Cheong Wa Dae for Friday’s personnel reshuffle.“The public had continued to call on the presidential office to drastically revamp the aides’ organization after (the behind-the-scenes) power struggle scandal. But (the president) still showed credibility toward Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and three core secretaries,” said Moon Hee-sang, chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy.Moon said the administration had glossed over public opinion as it conducted the overhaul without dismissal of the chief of staff and some others, who were seen as accountable for the scandal.In contrast, the opposition leader highly assessed Prime Minister nominee Lee Wan-koo. “He pushed forth wide communications with opposition lawmakers as a floor leader of the (ruling) Saenuri Party.”Moon, however, vowed to thoroughly review his personal records in the coming confirmation hearings of the National Assembly.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","salaried employees growing anger ,over their increased tax ,placate public over tax ,employees growing anger ,over tax burden president","['Park Geun', 'Park']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2913259   0.32449168

But the plan has sparked confusion from education circles as the government has presented it without details.The ministry said it would push to apply a “personality test” section for admission, currently used by some colleges, to all higher education institutes starting next year. Colleges that pilot the personality tests for admission will receive incentives, according to the policy revealed Thursday at the 2015 policy briefing at the presidential office. But the ministry appears to have hastily presented the plan. “We will need to conduct further research on how exactly we will increase the personality test part,” said a high-ranking ministry official, suggesting that the ministry could recommend colleges to ask more personality-related questions in interviews.The lack of explanation touched off a commotion among teachers and students, who felt the pressure of having to come up with a totally new admissions strategy.“Many teachers are perplexed about having to deal with another policy that came out of the blue. The ministry did not reveal any specific plans, but we as teachers feel like we have to come up with some kind of countermeasure,” said a Seoul-based high school teacher surnamed Lee. The Education Ministry attempted to address an array of complaints by reiterating that it is not introducing any new measures, but simply enhancing an existing one currently being practiced mostly at tertiary education institutions for teachers. “The controversy stemmed from the general misunderstanding that the government has created a new college admissions model,” explained another official from the ministry’s university admissions division, adding that its plan is merely to accredit colleges that use personality tests effectively, and expand their models to other institutes.But some experts expressed their concerns that the government’s emphasis on personality tests may give birth to a new private education market. While such a test is not conventionally covered at cram schools, they said Koreans’ low trust in the public education system may drive parents to turn toward private education.According to a recent survey by a Gangsa.com, a job information website for private education, 44.5 percent of people aged 10 to 50 thought public education was not enough for their children’s education, as opposed to 34.1 percent who said it was. The rest ― 21.5 percent ― said it was “so-so.”But some predicted the new plan would have minimal effect.“The confusion derives from the ministry introducing an already-existent policy as if it is a brand new one,” said an official from local private education institute Uway. “But I don’t think the government plans will spark an increase in private education, since character education is not something private education can do anything about.”He added that it was unlikely that many colleges would add personality tests since it would prolong the admissions process.

The lectures, prosecutors said, took place in front of prospective teachers and fellow members of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, the country's second-largest teachers' union.The four were also charged with the possession of original North Korean texts and the distribution of excerpts from a memoir by North Korean leader Kim Il-sung in violation of the National Security Law.The law bans any activities meant to praise, promote or propagandize North Korean ideals.The Seoul Central District Court found them guilty of these charges and gave them 18-month sentences with a two-year stay of execution.""The court finds them guilty of possessing documents that praise North Korea's 'songun' and 'juche' ideologies,"" Judge Cho Yong-hyeon said in a ruling, referring to the North's military-first and self-reliance philosophies.

Our religion does not allow that,"" said Zamfis Anuar, a Muslim primary school teacher in Kuala Lumpur.But the reaction in the West ""makes (Muslims) think, 'who are your friends?""The issue has emerged at a delicate time for Malaysia and Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- with both nations on alert over Islamic State militants' proven ability to lure their citizens to jihad in Syria.Many Muslims in Southeast Asia, like their counterparts elsewhere, believe a Western anti-Islam agenda exists, said Noorhaidi Hasan, a lecturer on Islam at Indonesia's Sunan Kalijaga Islamic University.""The Charlie Hebdo incident likely strengthens at some level their belief in that conspiracy theory,"" he said.  If coupled with worsening economic conditions, this could ""give rise to radicalism"", he added.      - Lure of Islamic State -   =========================   Frequently feted by the West as examples for the rest of the Muslim world, stable and economically dynamic Indonesia and Malaysia have centuries-old traditions of moderate Islam, which experts say are unlikely to change.But Indonesia has vivid memories of Islamic militant attacks including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, and small-scale extremist strikes still occur occasionally.Anti-terror crackdowns in both nations have dramatically weakened militant networks, but IS has attracted at least hundreds of Indonesian and Malaysian recruits, raising fears they will bring the group's violent ideology back home. Last year, tiny, oil-rich Brunei underlined a slow but steady regional drift toward more conservative Islam by phasing in a new sharia criminal code that will eventually include death by stoning, amputation of limbs and other harsh penalties for a range of crimes.In Malaysia, meanwhile, a conservative Islamic party has stepped up its own calls for similar measures in a state it controls.The Paris attack was likely quietly applauded among hardline conservative Muslims in the region, who feel Charlie Hebdo pushed too far, said Joseph Liow, an expert on Southeast Asian militancy at the Brookings Institute in the United States.""Even those classified as 'moderate' would be uneasy with Charlie Hebdo even if they condemn the attacks.  To them, Charlie Hebdo is, to put it in simple terms, extremist.""In this environment, leaders in the two countries have walked a delicate line. Indonesian President Joko Widodo condemned the Paris attacks, while saying no one should ""mock or insult"" religions, echoing similar calls by Malaysia's Najib Razak.       - Paris rally 'nauseating' -   ============================   But some in Muslim-majority, multi-ethnic Malaysia have used the attacks to decry the West.A conservative firebrand suggested the magazine had it coming, and popular Youth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin called the post-attack anti-terror march in Paris by various world leaders ""nauseating"".""Muslims are no longer talking about the attack but about the West's hostility. This can increase radical ideas,"" said Mohamad Asri Zainal Abidin, former official mufti, or Islamic scholar, for the northern Malaysian state of Perlis.""Many Muslims may start to believe that there is no space for good relations with the West, which leaves no hope for moderates.""Some Malaysian officials, meanwhile, have sparked concern by using the episode to justify an ongoing crackdown on free speech that has dismayed progressives.Both countries have warned of possible attacks at home by IS sympathisers, with Malaysian officials saying Charlie Hebdo could potentially escalate the threat.On Monday, Malaysia's Najib issued an unusual call for the country's Islamic authorities to use their influence to counter jihadism, and police have said they are stepping up monitoring of Islamic schools.AFP reporters who visited one such school outside Kuala Lumpur recently found teen students openly expressing a desire to die in the IS jihad.But observers said both countries have a firm grip on militancy and that the core tolerance embedded in their cultures appeared secure, especially if their economies remain stable.""Indonesia is on the right track,"" said Hasan, the Indonesian academic.

After the 2013 exams in November, four test-takers challenged the accuracy of a world geography question. The Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, in charge of making the questions, refused to recognize the error and engaged in a yearlong legal battle with the students. In October, a Seoul court ruled in favor of the students and the government subsequently proposed a set of measures to offset the damages. These included granting college admission to some students who failed to enter the colleges of their choice due to the flawed question.But the plaintiffs ― 100 students who had taken the world geography test ― said Monday that they were substantially penalized by errors in college admission. They blamed the state and the KICE, saying their reluctance to admit their faults ultimately worsened the damage caused by the error. “The flaw of the cited question could have been easily determined through statistics. The KICE had ample time to admit the errors and minimize the damage, but they did not,” the students said in their petition.According to Kim Hyeon-cheol, their legal representative, the focus of the lawsuit is not the error itself but the defendants’ attitude after the students challenged the question. The total compensation requested by the students comes to 2.34 billion won ($2.16 million). As of Tuesday, 450 students across the country said they intended to take part in the lawsuit.The grades of 18,884 students nationwide were affected by the flawed question. The incident is widely considered one of the worst Suneung-related disputes since the national exam was introduced in 1994. In the aftermath of the public uproar that followed, which was stoked by the discovery of two more flawed questions in the 2014 exams, the Education Ministry vowed to announce a reform plan by March.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","students sue over flawed ,flawed college entrance exam ,entrance exam lodged lawsuit ,four test takers challenged ,sue over flawed college",['Korea'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21405116 -0.04622201

The girl fell on the floor with her two legs up in the air.After a court hearing, the teacher offered an apology over what she described as a ""foolish act.""Repeated calls to the court for comment went unanswered.The case has sparked a public uproar and prompted the government and the ruling Saenuri Party to unveil a set of measures to toughen punishment for child abuse at daycare centers.Under a ""one-strike"" guideline, any daycare center would be shut down if child abuse is found there, and the perpetrator and facility's director will be permanently ostracized from the industry.The plan would also require all daycare centers to install security cameras and disclose footage on parents' request.

Some of you lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart.""Many in the crowd wept as Francis spoke, overcome by the memory of the Nov. 8, 2013, storm that leveled entire villages with ferocious winds and 7-meter (21-foot) waves and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing. Francis joined them in solidarity, even donning the same yellow rain poncho over his vestments that Mass-goers were given to protect them from the storm.He drew applause when he told them that he had decided to visit the city of 200,000 in the eastern Leyte province in the days immediately after the storm.""I wanted to come to be with you. It's a bit late, I have to say, but I am here.""Francis spoke in his native Spanish -- which he reverts to when he wants to speak from the heart. He ditched his prepared homily and instead composed a brief prayer off the cuff that began:  ""Thank you, Lord, for sharing our pain. Thank you, Lord, for giving us hope...""As he spoke, the winds whipped the altar cloth and threatened to topple over the candlesticks.Francis was scheduled to have lunch with survivors of Haiyan and meet with clergy who provided relief to the victims in the storm's aftermath before returning to the capital, Manila. But the Mass was pushed up by 45 minutes, and the rest of his day in Tacloban put into question by approaching Tropical Storm Mekkhala. The storm, packing winds of 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, suspended ferry services to Leyte province, stranding thousands of travelers including some who wanted to see the pope. With the winds strong enough to blow away thatched roofs common in the regions, it is forecast to slam ashore on nearby Samar Island later Saturday. A police official estimated the crowd at 150,000 before the pope's arrival and said tens of thousands more were lined up outside the airport area. Wearing plastic raincoats, the festive crowd in the city clapped in unison to blaring music welcoming the pope, cheering when his plane landed after the hour-long flight from Manila.The pope blew kisses, waved and flashed the thumbs up sign to the crowd while riding on a covered popemobile from the airport terminal to the nearby altar.""I hope the pope can help us forget and help us accept that our loved ones are gone,"" said Joan Cator, 23, weeping as she spoke. She lost two aunts and four nieces and nephews. ""We still cry often and don't talk about what happened.""Villagers hung banners welcoming the pope from the bow of a steel-hulled cargo shop that smashed houses when it was swept in by Haiyan and remains on shore.""Pope Francis cannot give us houses and jobs, but he can send our prayers to God,"" said Ernesto Hengzon, 62. ""I'm praying for good health and for my children too. I am old and sickly. I'm praying that God will stop these big storms. We cannot take any more of it. We have barely recovered. Many people are still down there.""Francis is visiting the Philippines after stopping in Sri Lanka earlier in the week.On Sunday, he is due to celebrate the culminating Mass of the visit in Manila's Rizal Park, where as many as 6 million people are expected. St. John Paul II drew a record 5 million people to his final Mass in Manila in 1995, and organizers say they think Francis may top that record.During his visit, Francis has condemned the corruption that deprives the poor and he issued his strongest defense yet of church teaching opposing artificial contraception. He also made a surprise visit to meet with street children cared for by a Catholic foundation. Photos of the event show a beaming Francis sitting with two boys on his lap, and another with children embracing his belly.Security has been tighter than it has ever been for this pope. It appeared to let up a bit outside of Manila: Cellphones worked in Tacloban and the police presence appeared to be less intrusive, though Mass-goers were told not to bring umbrellas.","devastating 2013 typhoon braving ,2013 typhoon braving rains ,of devastating 2013 typhoon ,devastating 2013 typhoon ,typhoon braving rains and","['Philippines', 'AP', 'Francis', 'Philippines', 'Francis', 'catholic']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51308     0.30991894

Bullying was found to be the motive for the rampage.He then ran away from his 22nd Infantry Unit with his rifle and a stash of ammunition. Two days later, he was captured while being under siege by thousands of troops right after a botched suicide attempt.Two months later, Lim was indicted on charges of murder and desertion.During his final court-martial hearing held at the First Army Headquarters in Wonju, some 132 kilometers southeast of Seoul, military prosecutors demanded the capital punishment, arguing that he committed a ""cruel and premeditated attack"" on unarmed comrades.""""Such a severe punishment is inevitable as he has been trying to justify his wrongdoings while putting the blame on his colleagues who had allegedly ostracized him for his behavior,"" the prosecution said in its argument.But Lim's lawyer appealed for leniency, contending that the exact cause of the incident has yet to be determined.""It's questionable if the death sentence can resolve the problem,"" the lawyer said in his final argument.Earlier in the day, the military court adopted as an evidence the result of a psychiatric test conducted on Lim for a month from November. According to military sources, the test showed that the soldier was ""generally normal.""South Korea's military law stipulates that a soldier faces the capital punishment for killing a superior officer. One of the fallen soldiers was a staff sergeant in Lim's unit.The sentencing is due to take place on Feb. 3.

Arsenic was found at two locations.Meanwhile, the government earlier pledged to build more state-run day care facilities nationwide in an effort to induce women to participate in the economy.

The survey was conducted on 990 middle and high school students.In addition, the report suggested a mismatch between what students thought was important and what was being taught primarily at schools. Some 61.4 percent said speaking was the most crucial skill in English, but 58.4 percent of the students thought their classes focused mostly on grammar. Such a trend appears to have evolved from the test-based culture in Korean classrooms, as 64 percent of students said the teachers’ extensive focus on grammar was because it was the main focus of exams.”Local experts have pointed out the ineffectiveness of Korea’s English education system as it is mostly based on test scores. A recent report by the Educational Testing Service showed that Korea’s IBT TOEFL were among the lowest among members of the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, especially in the speaking section, on which only Japan and Turkey performed worse.The percentage of students who thought English classes in school were not sufficient increased as students got older ― from 60.6 percent among first year middle school students to 74.7 percent among high school seniors.On the contrary, 84.4 percent of students thought private education helped them study English, and 73.2 percent said they would get private education if they can.Naturally, the biggest reason for getting private education was “because I can’t speak English well by just taking school classes,” 40.7 percent of the students said. The report showed that students are turning to private education due to their lack of trust in the public education system. Koreans are estimated to spend about 6.3 trillion won ($5.8 billion) annually on English private education, which is the highest of all subjects.“The government needs to provide accurate information about policies regarding English education to parents, who play a pivotal role in deciding whether or not students will get private education,” said Jeong Yu-gyeong, lead author of the survey, who teaches at Dongduk Girls’ Middle School.“It must also expand training programs for English teachers, so they can offer well-balanced classes.”In a bid to tackle the high cost of English education, the Education Ministry last year said it would implement an absolute grading system for the English section of the annual college exam in place of the existing curved grading system. But some experts raised questions about whether the measure would be effective, as it may simply intensify the competition in other subjects like math or Korean language.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","students dissatisfied with english ,school teacher in seoul ,dissatisfied with english classes ,70 percent of students ,by high school teacher",['Seoul'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66251749 -0.12987855

His four-year term was confirmed at the top court in February 2014.The SK chief’s brother Chey Jae-won, who also completed one-third of his term, was given three years and six months for similar charges.LIG Nex1’s Koo has been in prison for more than 800 days after he was indicted for issuing fraudulent commercial paper. His jail term is four years.President Park Geun-hye on Monday reiterated the fairness in the coming selection of the Justice Ministry. “It is not appropriate for business leaders to be granted any favors. (On the contrary), it is also not appropriate to inflict reverse discrimination on them,” she said in her New Year’s press conference.When the ministry finally excluded the three business tycoons from the roll, they are to pin hopes on the next conditional release, which will be on the March 1 Independence Movement Memorial Day.Over the past few decades, many imprisoned conglomerate CEOs and senior executives enjoyed special pardons by previous presidents as well as the justice minister-led parole.The 2009 pardon for Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-hee is believed to have resulted in Korea’s winning bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, Gangwon Province, while Hyundai Motor chief Chung Mong-koo, pardoned in 2008, served as the honorary chairman of the 2012 Yeosu Expo organizing committee.Meanwhile, the civic group People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy recently said in a statement that “forgiving someone because he is expected to make money will damage social justice.”By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","include imprisoned business leaders ,unlikely to get parole ,imprisoned business leaders ,imprisoned business leaders on ,parole for the jailed","['the Ministry of Justice', 'Saenuri Party']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59113586  0.25266907

In a nationally televised news conference on Monday, South Korean President Park Geun-hye expressed her hope for the two Koreas to hold a new round of reunions of families separated by the1950-53 Korean War, around Lunar New Year’s Day, which falls on Feb. 19.Seoul’s Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok, however, denied the report, saying that the exercise schedule was fixed a long time ago. “It has nothing to do with possible family reunions, though the exact date of when to begin the drill is subject to change.”In a brief email statement, U.S. Forces Korea said South Korea and the U.S. “are preparing for exercise Key Resolve ... Key Resolve focuses on crisis management and command and control of alliance forces. More information on the exercise will be available at a later date.” The North has called on the U.S. and South Korea to stop joint military drills, claiming that they are a rehearsal for a northward invasion. But the allies have vowed to continue the exercises, as they are defensive in nature.The drill usually involves tens of thousands of troops from both sides. About 28,500 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

However, illegal immigrants who reside in Seoul are not eligible for any allowance for raising or educating their children.Among the 12 citizen representatives selected by the SMG to make their decision on the matter, eight voted in favor of the rights of undocumented children during their hearing last month. “The citizen representatives concluded that excluding illegal immigrants from the childcare benefits is an act of discrimination on the basis of their nationality, and we have put this into our decision to advise the SMG,” the human rights experts said in a statement. Article 2 of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child’s rights to education and protection must be ensured regardless of the parent’s or legal guardian’s race; color; sex; religion; or national, ethnic or social origin; among others. Article 8 of the convention also states that if a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, “States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to reestablishing speedily his or her identity.”Park Sook-mi from the SMG also said article 2 of the Human Rights Ordinance of SMG applies to those who stay in Seoul temporarily as Seoul citizens. “There are about 400,000 foreigners who live in Seoul and we strive to be a global city that values and promotes human rights,” said Yeom. “The SMG should pay more attention to this matter and come up with a proactive plan to protect them.”In response to the experts’ advice, the SMG said it would launch a study to find out exactly how many illegal immigrants with children reside in Seoul. “After that has been done, we can talk about the needed budget and other things to bring (about) this change,” said Park.

Among them, 79.2 percent said they worked without written contracts, while 10.5 percent said they experienced verbal and sexual harassment at work.While 15.6 percent said they were not paid for extra work, 12.6 percent said they were not paid at all.The ministry also registered 163 cases of teen workers’ rights being violated last month. The largest number of violations ― 65.9 percent ― occurred in small restaurants and cafes nationwide. Other employers that broke the rules included hair salons, bakeries, convenience stores and movie theaters. Almost 40 percent of the reported cases had to do with not informing employees about working conditions, including wages, working hours and holidays. Some employers purposely did not include all the required information in their written contracts, said Koh Young-sook from the Gender Equality Ministry.While 16.6 percent of the cases involved not offering any written contracts, 12.2 percent of the violations had to do with not informing the workers about the minimum wage. More than 25 percent of the reported employers did not undergo the required education on sexual harassment at the workplace.Under the current law, an employer can be fined up to 5 million won ($4,500) for not informing employees about working conditions, and up to 20 million won for paying workers below the minimum wage rate. Currently, the minimum wage in Korea is 5,580 won an hour. Jeong Eun-hye from the ministry said the government is planning to launch a service whereby legal or labor experts would visit teens in need at their workplaces, should they face problems with wages or experience any form of harassment. Teen workers can also send a text message at #1388 for help if they think they are experiencing labor rights violations.

The move effectively blocks students from retaining their status as an incumbent student without registering for a new semester while seeking a job.Due to the prolonged economic slump that froze the job market, it has become common for university students to delay their graduation until they land a job. Several companies are known to discriminate against graduates when recruiting new workers, and it is common for internship opportunities to be offered exclusively to current students.“Over the past few years, it has become harder to find a job. Students are postponing graduation in a bid to buy time to become more qualified (for jobs),” said a 28-year-old graduate student at a Seoul-based university. To delay their graduation, students usually register for extra semesters or deliberately refuse to hand-in the assignments required to graduate. The latter is usually preferred as the former requires considerable amount of tuition fees that virtually serves no purpose academically.Ewha’s new policy, however, made it impossible for its students to use the second option. A student of the university said although students who “completed” the course are technically not graduates, it is still likely to hurt their chances since they are no longer considered an incumbent university member. “On top of that, they told us this important decision right before the semester, which was inconsiderate,” she said.Other universities like Konkuk University are also making it mandatary for students to register in order to be considered an active member of the university. Observers said the universities’ measure is likely to drive students to register for extra semesters rather than to risk entering the job market early.Prolonging the school years for graduation has already become a dominant trend in Korea. Data revealed by Rep. Park Chang-sik of Saenuri Party showed 2,276 students in 2013 registered themselves for nine or more semesters in a bid to put off graduation.As a result, it is taking more time than before for young people to find work. According to Korea Employment Information Service, the average age of new employees at companies with 100 or more workers was 33.2 for men and 28.6 for women. Another survey by Saramin showed 76.2 percent of the companies thought the average age for job applicants was rising.The trend of older job applicants appears to have changed the definition of “youth” in the job market. State-run institutes are mandated to allocate 3 percent of their jobs to youngsters. Last year, the definition of “youth” in the cited regulation was changed from 29 or younger to 34 or younger.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","on postponing graduation universities ,new semesters sparking complaints ,graduation universities said monday ,students to postpone graduation ,postponing graduation universities",['Ewha Womans University'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26529261  0.31074804

The ministry claimed that not having native speakers in private institutes ― known here as hagwon ― would considerably reduce the amount parents spend on English private education. “The costs of hagwon hiring foreigners is way too high. Our preliminary research indicates that the cost of hiring a foreigner is about 1.5 times that of hiring Koreans under the exact same working conditions” a ministry official said. He said this could be done by not issuing work visas to foreign nationals entering Korea to work at preschool hagwon.“It is still a work-in-progress. Details include whether or not it will apply to foreigners of Korean descent, whether or not to ban those already in Korea (from working at those hagwon) and whether to grant a grace period or implement it right away,” he said. The official reiterated that the plan was still in an early stage, and there was a possibility that the entire scheme would be scrapped. But it drew a fierce reaction from those in the private education industry.“Banning foreign teachers from being hired (at private institutes) is a plan potentially in violation of people’s constitutional right to receive education. It can also cause diplomatic issues, since it limits foreign nationals’ right to work in Korea,” the Korea Association of Hakwons said in a press conference last week. The association claimed that the increase in the number of native English teachers helped reduce the number of younger students going abroad to study English. The amount of money spent on studying abroad increased from 431.3 billion won ($396 million) in 2007 to 522.7 billion won in 2012, but the figure decreased for elementary school students. The group also quoted a 2011 survey by Korea Institute of Child Care and Education that showed about 60.7 percent of parents wanted English education for their children in the preschool stage. Whether the ministry measure will be effective in driving down the costs of private education remains to be seen. The average monthly cost of employing a native speaker in major private institutes usually hovers a little above 3 million won including housing and other expenses, according to industry sources. They said it generally costs more to hire a native speaker than a Korean to teach English, but claimed the difference is not jaw-dropping.Members of the Korea Association of Hakwons, a group of local private institutes, speak during a press conference on Dec. 23 in Seoul. (Yonhap)“On average, the costs of English private institutes or English kindergartens are not as high as people think,” said Kim Eun-sook, an official at YBM Education, a local private institute. She said the fees for public kindergartens average about 1.34 million won, which is actually higher than English hagwon. “Hagwons are monitored (by the association) based on how much we charge the parents. We have a ceiling on how much we can pay the foreign teachers, so this talk about reducing costs makes little sense,” Kim said.The measure also sparked outrage from foreign workers here, who saw the news as another door being slammed shut in their face. Public schools have seen significant reductions in NET staff in the past three years. According to Rep. Yoon Jae-ok of the ruling Saenuri Party, the percentage of schools with native English-speaking teachers dropped from over 85.7 percent in 2011 to 48.6 percent in 2014.Last year, Incheon’s education office said it had canceled hiring new native English teachers due to budget restraints. The Seoul education office is also planning to cut its budget for native teachers for this year, saying their effectiveness has been “unproven.”“I can understand why the government would try to cut down spending on private education, but this is ridiculous. Why can’t they just put a cap on how much hagwon charge?” said an American who used to teach at a school in Incheon. “How would specifically targeting non-Korean workers help? The only possible thing I can think of is maybe it can help more Koreans get jobs.”Elementary school students attend a class taught by a native English teacher. This photo is not directly related to the story.  (Korea Herald file photo)The effectiveness of early-stage English education is an ongoing debate, but the bigger issue for the governmental measure is that it failed to win support even from activists working to reduce the country’s reliance on private education.Lee Seul-gi, an official at the civic group World Without Worries About Private Education, said banning foreign teachers from preschool private education was hardly a fundamental solution.“I think English hagwon for children need to be regulated in some way, but just getting rid of foreign teachers is hardly the answer,” Lee said. “Realistically speaking I’m not sure if it’s even doable, since it can be seen as discrimination against foreigners.”The group has already released a statement bashing the government’s plan to reduce private education as “hastily put together,” slapping a big “F” grade on it. “Despite being the first comprehensive plan (on private education) under President Park Geun-hye’s administration, it doesn’t have any sections that are expected to have any real effect,” Lee said. She added that foreign teachers were hardly the main problem presented by English hagwon. These institutes often place immense stress on children, forcing them to do six or seven hours of work each day. Lee said the Education Ministry first needs to persuade parents that it was not absolutely critical for children to learn English early on in their lives. Rather than just banning foreign teachers from private institutes, the government needs to conduct research on the effectiveness of early-stage English education, she said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","considering banning foreign nationals ,to bar foreign teachers ,banning foreign nationals from ,private education the costs ,industry resists policy to",['the Education Ministry'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37903422  0.2926676

While 92.8 percent of all colleges have adopted the system, only 2.3 percent of students have used it as of the first semester of 2014 due to several restrictions.For example, many colleges prohibit scholarship recipients from using the system. Students also cannot get student loans in the middle of the semester, so students who fail to make a payment are forced to quit mid-year.  STUDENT PROTEST AT HUFS ― Students at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies on Wednesday protest the university’s decision to apply a curved grading system to all classes at the university campus in Seoul. (Yonhap)The ministry said it would ban the restriction on scholarship winners and allow students to take out loans in the middle of the semester. It will also allow students to make more frequent payments, which is also expected to increase the number of students using the system. According to 2012 data provided by Rep. Min Byung-joo of the Saenuri Party, students are more likely to use the system if they are allowed to make more frequent payments. Freshmen and transfer students, however, will not be able to use the installment payment system.The new measures will be applied to all colleges starting this year, officials said. It is still unclear how many colleges will actually adopt the ministry’s plan since, as of now, it is a merely a guideline.“The ministry does not plan to penalize schools that refuse to comply. But we may provide incentives for schools that adopt the system in the future,” a ministry official said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","plans for college tuition ,education ministry on thursday ,on their college tuition ,system for college tuition ,for college tuition",['the Education Ministry'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18818334  0.07221329
