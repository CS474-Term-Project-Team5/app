The forthcoming April general election to constitute the 20th National Assembly will be a race for parliamentary seats as well as a prelude to the 2017 presidential election.The rival parties are mired in a power struggle of their own as their eyes are singularly set on individually and collectively winning the next Assembly seats, the configuration of which is likely to decide the fate of the incumbent administration’s initiatives to cope with the approaching lame duck period of President Park Geun-hye.Slews of populist pledges for each constituency are anticipated without a fundamental chance to address the engrained regionalism, while the grave economic outlook and the unstable security front could fan the ideological division that has often worked as an easy political tool to galvanize each of their supporters.National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa speaks to reporters on Thursday. YonhapThe heavy political calculations have even led to an unprecedented expiration of legal electoral maps, with the National Election Commission being forced to offer a grace period for the parties to agree on how to redistribute the constituencies.For the ruling party, the key task is to overcome the slipping approval rate of incumbent President Park Geun-hye, who will enter her fourth year in office in late February, all amid of an escalating power struggle between Park’s supporters and the “non-Parks.”But their dilemma may be nothing compared to that of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. While struggling to keep itself from falling apart, the party also has to publicize its new agenda and identity to the public, with less than four months remaining to the election.Marking out the 2016 elections is the appearance of a new political power group other than the two leading parties.“The new party will embrace ‘rational reform’ instead of ‘old progressivism’ and ‘reactionary conservatism,’” former opposition cochairman and onetime independent presidential candidate Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo said Sunday, revealing his blueprint for the political party that he is to kick off.“Neither the developmental dictatorship of the 1970s nor the activist paradigms of the 1980s may solve the incumbent problems of our times,” he said, referring to the Park Geun-hye administration and the opposition party respectively.It remains to be seen whether the information technology guru-turned-politician will succeed this time as a true third force, and not repeat his failed positioning ahead of the 2012 presidential election.Ahn’s move, regardless of its success, poses a threat to the Minjoo Party, which needs unity in order to stand up against the ruling camp.The party holds 119 out of 300 seats in the National Assembly. This is already lower than the 120 seat baseline the party considers necessary in order to hold blocking power in the parliament, but is likely to fall further in the coming weeks. While eight lawmakers have left the party since Ahn’s defection, a group of senior members including former floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won have been hinting at their imminent defection.Struggling to hold the party together, the leadership decided to hold a national convention as soon as possible and prepare for the general election.The ruling Saenuri Party may be faring better than the opposition camp, but is getting increasingly caught up in its candidate nomination rules, an issue which has divided the pro-Park faction against others.The party’s nomination committee is pushing ahead with a recommendation system which, according to dissenters including party leader Kim, will enable the leadership to favor specific candidates.The two groups are also at odds on whether or not to offer extra credits to former government officials running for their first parliamentary office, with the pro-Park faction in favor of the idea and the non-Park group against it.At the heart of the problem is the unstable public polls of President Park Geun-hye, a factor that has divided her close aides and those who wish to stand apart from the group. The average approval rating of the president has remained in the low 40 percent range over the past few months, according to leading pollsters.By Bae Hyun-jung(tellme@heraldcorp.com)","up for presidential race ,presidential election the rival ,presidential race once again ,election season is high ,for presidential race","['National Assembly', 'Assembly']",29,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.94386792  0.42684096

Having graduated from a private women’s colleges in Seoul, she currently makes about 2.5 million won ($2,120) a month working at a marketing firm. As she lives alone and supports herself in Seoul while her family is in Daejeon, she doesn’t have much opportunity to save.“I know my parents don’t have anything ready for their postretirement expenses,” she told The Korea Herald. “I know I’ll have to support them once my father retires. I know they haven’t been able to save anything because they spent most of their income on me,” Shin said. While she feels she owes them support in their later years, it also pressures her into thinking that marriage and children in her own life may be an unrealistic luxury.Shin’s problems are apparently shared among many South Koreans, who often feel obliged to support their offspring even after they go off to college, land a job and get married. Add that with low youth employment, an economic slowdown and soaring living expenses, saving for postretirement life has become a tough challenge. A mall in Seoul. (Yonhap)According to the report released by the KB Financial Group Research Center, which surveyed 2,906 Koreans aged 25-59 nationwide on their household finances, Koreans need an average monthly income of 2.26 million won for postretirement expenses. However, based on the surveyed individuals’ savings, public and private pension plans and other financial assets, they only had an average monthly income of 1.1 million won for their postretirement days. The report showed that married couples with children are more vulnerable to postretirement income risks, as they tend to sacrifice their retirement savings for their children’s education and wedding costs. According to the report, married couples with children require an average monthly income of 2.52 million won postretirement, but they only end up saving 43 percent of the needed funds.Married couples without children are currently saving 63 percent of the needed funds for their postretirement expenses, which is 2.21 million won a month. Among all occupations, public servants were best prepared for their postretirement days, saving 70.7 percent of the required funds needed after retirement. Self-employed workers were saving 45.2 percent of the needed funds, while high-earning professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, were saving 57.8 percent.Those who felt they weren’t financially prepared for their postretirement years said they didn’t have enough income, they were spending too much on their children or they had too much debt to pay off.In October, a report released by the National Pension Research Institute showed that transfer payments, such as social retirement benefits and public pension payments, only make up about 28.8 percent of the average income of Korean elderly, with almost 50 percent of the elderly living below the poverty line.The high poverty rate and inadequate public transfer payments mean that most Korean elderly must stay employed, even if they don’t want to, or financially depend on family members or children in order to live above the poverty line, the report claimed.The paper also showed that 46.9 percent of the Korean elderly population lived in poverty -- defined as having income of less than half the median national income -- as of last year. The number was significantly higher than those of other developed nations, such as Norway (1.5 percent), the U.K. (7.9 percent), the U.S. (19.3 percent) and Taiwan (26.6 percent).In countries such as Denmark, Poland, the U.K., Finland, Australia and Canada, public transfer payments, such as pension payments, retirement benefits and living allowance, accounted for at least 70 percent of the average income of the elderly population.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","most south koreans short ,women colleges in seoul ,koreans short on retirement ,year old office worker ,seoul while her family","['Shin Yu - hee', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Daejeon']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79544491  0.58036458

As people unwind after a hectic day of work with bottles of soju, some beer and ample amounts of Korean barbecue in the local popular hangout, things start to get a little rough around a clearly-drunk 50-something man.Uniformed police officers arrive on the scene and attempt to calm things down, but are welcomed with a slap and violent behavior with rants of “How dare you lecture me when you’re just my son’s age!” Cops specialized in rescue and security missions at mountains conduct drills to enhance their capabilities in saving people`s lives. (Yonhap)Officer Lee, 29, has gotten used to it. As he says, it is nothing dramatic, just grueling tedious work of aiding people in their lives.“I’d say around 80 percent of our cases are somehow related to drinking. When they get drunk, conversation is not an option. Physical abuse occurs frequently,” said Lee, who works at a police substation in Incheon.“People’s cane” is what people call the police in Korea, used to describe a slew of different roles they are expected to carry out for citizens. But the respect they get often falls far short of the authority the heavy-handed nickname suggests.Lee explained that many, especially those decades older than him, look down on young policemen like him. He said the frequent disputes over police abuse forces them to arrest citizens in the most nonviolent way possible, making them more vulnerable to violence. The public’s sensitivity toward police violence is in part linked to police abuses in the past, particularly by the conscribed auxiliary police against pro-democracy protesters in the 1980s. The use of police force at mass rallies continues to be a bitterly divisive issue to this day.Korean police regulations state that the first shot out of a firearm should always be a blank. Officers are entitled to charge citizens who “disrupt public duty” for those who physically abuse or issue threats on an officer, but this is not an easy task. Cops specialized in rescue and security missions at rivers conduct drills to enhance their capabilities in saving people`s lives. (Yonhap)In order to prove such action has taken place, one must take evidence such as CCTV footage -- which is borderline impossible given the generally spontaneous nature of the event -- while testifying to other officers and the prosecution. According to field officers, such actions are often frowned upon by fellow policemen who think they are making a big deal out of nothing.But dealing with the drunks is only part of the job description for policemen; it also includes arresting violent criminals, escorting victims to police stations and therapy centers, and rescuing ambitious hikers and swimmers who bite off more than they can chew.Recently, with President Park Geun-hye urging the passage of the antiterrorist bill in light of the recent deadly Paris attacks, the more serious aspect of the roles of the police has also been highlighted -- to prevent possible terrorism.Last Saturday, the special weapons and tactics unit of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency held a public antiterrorism drill. The SWAT members demonstrated entering high-rise buildings, a shootout with the terrorists and using police dogs to thwart a bomb attack. Korean police’s domain is not confined to domestic affairs either. Officers and explosives detection dogs at Incheon International Airport Police are entrusted with the task of sniffing out risks imported from overseas. The Korean National Police Agency earlier this week also launched a team comprising forensic experts to be dispatched to protect Koreans in the Philippines following rampant crimes committed against its nationals.But for the majority of the policemen, their work revolves around the everyday lives of citizens, which is no mean feat.A recent story of a 31-year-old woman -- booked for drunken violence -- who defecated in a police station highlighted the absurd levels that Korean officers have to face each day.According to a survey by the Police Science Institute, civilians’ complaints were the highest source of stress for officers, at 4.15 out of 5 points. It was well above promotion/disciplinary actions, dealing with colleagues or even dealing with violent criminals, which respectively stood at 3.85, 3.7 and 3.62.Last week, Korean movie “Veteran” -- about a police officer who get to the bottom of a financial tycoon-related crime -- was selected as the best cop movie of the year.But Lee said the movie is more a fantasy than reality. “Beating up criminals to arrest them? Not a chance, not to mention it is nearly impossible to use firearms,” he said. “Police work is not as dramatic or ideal as people think -- it’s just bottom-line hard work.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","police officer daily grind ,amounts of korean barbecue ,rough around clearly drunk ,hectic day of work ,drunk 50 something man","['Incheon', 'korean']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60662901  0.55169588

""He continued to test both positive and negative for the MERS virus.""   His death left South Korea with no MERS patients, six months after the first case was confirmed on May 20.  The country, meanwhile, declared a de facto end to the outbreak in late July.   Including the latest death, the fatality rate of MERS in South Korea stands at 20.4 percent, with most deaths being linked to underlying medical conditions, such as a weak respiratory system, heart and lung diseases, and cancer.  MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, reportedly has a fatality rate of over 40 percent. There are currently no vaccines or treatment for the disease.  South Korea, meanwhile, has reported no new cases since July 4, with the World Health Organization declaring the country as entering a ""end of transmission"" phase.   Under WHO regulations, an official end to the outbreak can be declared 28 days after the last patient is declared recovered, although in the case of South Korea, health authorities may not make a formal declaration.

He applied to more than 30 companies, his confidence buoyed by the fact that he had received a “global education” in the U.S. since he was in elementary school. “Now I am afraid that my 15-year endeavor in the U.S. will come to nothing,” he said. A young jobseeker looks at a job posting on a bulletin board. YonhapHis frustration in finding a job in Korea reflects a changing trend among Koreans who once considered studying overseas as a ticket to success back home. Education authorities said Tuesday that the number of students who went abroad to study has plunged by two-thirds over the past eight years. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Education and Korean Educational Development Institute, 10,907 students left Korea to study overseas in 2014. In 2006 the number was 29,511. Of those in 2014, about 40 percent were elementary school students, with 34 percent being middle school students and 26 percent high school students. The 2006 statistics showed about 46 percent were elementary school students while 31 percent and 23 percent were middle and high school students, respectively. The number of Korean students who went overseas to study has fluctuated throughout the 2000s. Since 2000, when sending young children abroad to study became popular among parents, the number of students has increased annually with 2000 marking 4,397, 2001 showing 7,944 and 2002 at 10,132. Having peaked in 2006 when 29,511 left Korea to study, the number has been declining since then with 27,668 students in 2007, 27,349 students in 2008 and 18,118 during the 2009 financial crisis. Education officials estimated that, if trends continue, the total number of students studying abroad in 2015 would be less than 10,000. They attributed this to the widespread notion among young students that studying overseas does not automatically connect to better job prospects at home. “Back in previous days, students believed that studying abroad would help them get a better job. ... But those benefits don’t seem to exist anymore. Also, there are many domestic schools where students can learn English (without young students going abroad),” said officials from the Ministry of Education. Human resources departments at Korean companies agreed that those who have studied overseas do not necessary land better jobs than their competitors who lack overseas educational experience.  “Admittedly, companies are worried whether those who have graduated from colleges overseas would adjust to Korea’s unique working environment. If all things are equal among the applicants, I would prefer those who are familiar with Korea’s work ethics,” said an anonymous recruiter from a Korean retail conglomerate.

I don’t think I’m very addicted and don’t have serious health issues yet. It’s just a way to hang out with friends,” Park told The Korea Herald, asking not to be named. Park is one of a large number of Korean teenagers who do not consider smoking harmful. According to the latest survey conducted by Korea Health Promotion Foundation, about 15 percent of teenage smokers do not think smoking is harmful.Teen smokers and nonsmokers had different perceptions of the habit. Over 26 percent of underage smokers said smoking once or twice was OK -- a rate four times higher than that of teenage nonsmokers who think so, at 6.4 percent. While more than 85 percent of nonsmokers approved of legally banning youths from smoking, only 63 percent of teenage smokers agreed. Nearly 14 percent of smokers said they would smoke in the future whereas 2.7 percent of nonsmokers said they would likely smoke someday. Meanwhile, the organization’s study showed that students were 74 percent more likely to start smoking underage if they saw their teachers smoking at school. “Antismoking education must be carried out in a way that can correct students’ misunderstandings and change their perceptions of smoking,” said Lim Wan-ryung, a researcher at the organization. As part of the efforts to curb youth smoking, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched antismoking programs at over 11,000 schools this year, officials said.

Most have difficulty in determining their career paths as they are uncertain about their true interest or have inadequate information and experience regarding the range of occupations. A sophomore from Ewha Womens University’s law school is taking part in a law school internship held at Seoul Western District Court. (Yonhap)In this sense, internship may play a pivotal role in discovering one’s aptitude and talents, while tasting the realities of life in the wider society. “Initially, I yearned to get a job in the finance industry, based on its social reputation along with its strong relevance with my major. However, after working in the field as an intern, I could objectively determine whether finance suits me or not,” said a 24-year-old student from a Seoul-based university.The majority of students start an internship for a simple reason -- “to add one more qualification to my resume.” However, most realize that there are a slew of other significant factors to take in as a lesson after going through the internship period. One such lesson is realizing the differences between university life and life as a member of the society.“The proper way to face superiors, how to talk politely, while being concrete, the need to take care of work ahead of time were some of the important things that I learned” said Park, who was an intern at a public relations company. “But most of all, perceiving the way to form a ‘good human relationship,’ which is the core part of having an easygoing work life, was the biggest lesson that I received in the broad sense. It was a great opportunity to become aware that the workplace is very different from my university life.” Participants gesture at an internship program held by the Korean International Trade Association. (Yonhap)Above knowing the significance of developing effective and good relations with others, comprehending the overall ambience and culture of the company is another merit of internships, since it can enable students to quickly adopt to the workplace.A university student, who interned at the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry, confessed, “I had heard that employees work under a very free atmosphere at the place. However, after experiencing it myself, I realized that there were also some issues which were far different from what I heard.”Meanwhile, to double the efficiency during the internship period, it is wise to opt for an internship that has high practical job relevancy. Although a majority of internship recruitment notices initially inform that the interns will have a chance to share some workload of full-time employees, the reality might be much different.Firms where interns handle miscellaneous work are aplenty.A 26-year-old, from Hankuk Universities of Foreign Studies, indicated, “I actually experienced sharing some practical work of full-time employees. High job relevance really contributed best in deciding whether the job well suits me or not.”Just unquestioningly relying on information available on the Internet is not the right way to find an effective internship. Rather, it is better to receive advice and information from pre-interns or go through as many internships as one can.Although internship has no absolute role in determining one’s career path, no one can deny that it is the best means to have the biggest and practical influence on it.

Born in 1988 and adopted by a U.S. couple at age 1, Kim arrived in South Korea last year in hopes of finding her birth parents. Kim finally began her search in Korea as an adult, but the process was far from easy. A visit to the Korea Adoption Services, which offers birth family search services for adoptees, was disheartening as officials there told her she wasn’t allowed to see any information about her birth family without their consent. They told her a telegram had been mailed to her mother, and only if she agrees, Kim would be able to meet her in person. Kim is one of many Korean adoptees demanding a revision of the current Special Adoption Law, which they argue prevents them from accessing their records and finding birth families. “Finding our families and knowing our histories shouldn’t depend on accident or luck,” Kim said at a recent forum at the National Assembly in Seoul. Korean adoptees, lawyers and public servants attend a forum discussing the ways to improve the current Special Adoption Law at the National Assembly on Oct. 29. Rep. Choi Dong-ic’s officeIf Kim had not asked for the paper receipt for the telegram, she may have never been able to reunite with her mother. The agency had blackened the recipient’s tracking code on the receipt, but Kim traced it by holding it against a bus window. When Kim finally met her mother by showing up at her place, she realized her mother in fact had been searching for her, too. Her mother had replied to the telegram sent from the KAS asking for further clarification, but got no response from them. The agency had been telling Kim they did not hear back from her mother.Since the KAS was established in 2012 upon the revision of the adoption law, the number of adoptees asking for their personal records to find their birth families has increased dramatically. While 258 adoptees asked to see their information in 2012, 1,654 have done the same this year as of August.In total, 4,790 adoptees requested their records to find their birth parents from 2012-2015, but only 14.7 percent of them were able to reunite with their families, according to data released by New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Lee Jong-kul. Although the law aims to protect children’s rights, the way the KAS interprets some of its articles has made it almost impossible for returning adoptees to see their records, adoptees argued. According to the law, one can access their birth records without their birth parents’ permission only if the birth parent is dead or cannot be found, or the adoptee has a medical condition or other reason for doing so. Jane Jeong Trenka, an adoptee and president of the Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea, said the KAS was applying the clauses too strictly by telling adoptees that they could only receive they personal records if all three criteria are met. “We believe that this is unreasonable, and this was certainly not our intention,” she said, referring to her organization’s input and support in amending the law three years ago. One of the major changes stipulated by the act was that all children must have a complete birth registration here before being put forward for adoption. Because meeting all three criteria at the same time is practically impossible, many adoptees would spend years simply tracing their birth parents.Hanna Johansson, an adoptee in Sweden, has visited Korea six times since 2007 in search of her birth family. The trips have cost her about $15,000, but she has yet to find any relatives.It has been an arduous journey. She began her search from the papers from the Social Welfare Society, the Korean agency that was in charge of her adoption in 1976. The papers said she was an orphan. It was only in 2010 when Johansson discovered that she was found by a police officer in Seoul’s Wangsimni area and was taken to a hospital before being adopted without any records of her birth parents. In 2013, she realized that perhaps the most crucial information had been kept from her -- the name of the police officer who had found her. While the name was included in the file shown to her in 2010 by SWS, it was written in Chinese characters. She learned it was the name of the officer after sharing the documents with Trenka. Johansson was finally able to meet the police officer after sending the KAS about 50 emails.“I think SWS never thought the adoptees would return to search,” Johansson told The Korea Herald. “I think they just do not care if we can get the information or not.” South Korean babies are being sent to the U.S. via plane to be adopted in 1956.YonhapGovernment statistics show that the current system, particularly the process of contacting the birth parents through telegrams instead of text messages or phone calls, is proving ineffective. According to data released by NPAD Rep. Choi Dong-ic, the KAS sent a total of 2,301 telegrams to birth parents between January 2012 and August 2015. Of them, 705 agreed to have their information revealed, while 1,596 did not respond or wished to remain anonymous.Currently, the KAS interprets a non-response from the birth parent as not agreeing to disclose their information. Consequently, 91 percent of 1,391 birth parents who did not give consent for their information to be disclosed from January 2014 until August this year were actually those who never replied.During the forum, Trenka pointed out that there is no way for adoptees to even confirm that these telegrams were even sent, and verify if the right birth parent received them. Trenka and lawyer So Ra-mi also argued that many birth parents would mistake the telegrams as junk mail even if they received them, as some of them simply say “a foreigner is looking to find you,” without informing that the person is an adoptee.South Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers, who are vulnerable to social discrimination and stigmatization here. Woo Hong-sik from the KAS said this is why telegrams are being sent when contacting birth parents, instead of calling or visiting them in person. “Birth mothers who have been remarried (after sending their child overseas for adoption) often keep their past a secret,” he said. “A birth mother may not want their current family to find out that she’s had a child as an unwed woman in the past. Revealing that information could severely affect her relationship with her current family.”However, Kang Tae-in, a representative of a group of Korean birth families, said it was untrue that most birth parents don’t want to be found. He said many members of his group have tried to search for their children, only to be insulted and lied to by adoption agencies. One of the members was told, “You gave up on her. What makes you qualified to search for her now?” when he visited the agency that was in charge of his daughter’s adoption to Denmark. The father was also told that according to Danish laws, birth parents cannot contact their adopted children unless the adoptee contacts them first. However, the father later found out that Denmark has no such laws.Lawyer So Ra-mi said the current system goes against Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stipulates that the child “shall have the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.” For another adoptee, Andrea Kim Cavicchi, locating her birth mother’s burial site involved posting flyers, knocking on the door of every house and visiting three other villages where her mother may have lived, all on her own. She had been reunited with her maternal aunt in 2006 after appearing on a TV show in Korea. Her aunt informed Cavicchi that her mother had passed away, but refused to share any other information.When Cavicchi asked the KAS to persuade her adoption agency, Holt, to hand over her file to help her locate the grave site, the KAS refused, saying she did not have a medical condition, one of the three requirements to access her records. While Cavicchi managed to locate the site without any organizational support, the adoption agency told her to be “grateful” that she was adopted because she would have been stigmatized for having a single mother who was mentally challenged had she stayed in Korea. She said the most painful part of the search was a deep sense of hopelessness.“(The painful part was) knowing I’ll never find answers to some questions. … What made my mother laugh? What did her voice sound like? What was her favorite food?” she told The Korea Herald. Cavicchi reached closure when she finally found her mother’s grave site. She learned that her mother remarried after Cavicchi was sent away, and that she was 27 when she died. But Cavicchi said the feeling of “han” remains, referring to a Korean word describing a sense of unresolved resentment against injustices suffered. “We will never physically meet in this lifetime, Mom, but I want you to know that I am fighting for you,” she wrote in her article titled “Dear Eomma (mom)” published last year. “I embody your han.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","popular korean actress lee ,birth mother after watching ,popular korean actress ,that popular korean actress ,birth parents kim finally","['Annie Kim', 'korean', 'Lee Young', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'Kim']",29,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.8414712   0.54943633

Since recycling is not mandatory in our state, that was pretty much all I had to do. Now I struggle here with my roommate nagging me for not following the recycling regulations that are so strict,” said Lee. These “strict” recycling regulations were introduced in 1995 and require residents and business operators to separate out trash that can be recycled, such as plastics, glasses, cans and milk cartons. Paper, plastics, cans and other recyclable waste must be separated from household trash and be thrown out at a designated area for recycling. Vendors come to the site regularly every week to pick up the recycled waste. Large trash, such as furniture and home appliances, must be dumped with a state-issued sticker attached to them.More specifically, milk cartons must be separated from other paper trash because they are coated with hard-to-recycle materials such as vinyl and thus require an extended period of time to decompose. Broken glass and other sharp-and-pointed objects must be put in designated sacks, not trash bags.Among the recyclable trash, items that can be reused are sold to vendors who collect them. Other items that cannot be reused, such as Styrofoam, are reprocessed for other purposes, such as construction materials. “The separation of trash was officially mandated in 2003. The rule was set in law with a penalty imposed on violators. Since then, we have fostered recycling programs and reduced the amount of trash that otherwise would be buried,” said Son Kyung-pyo of the Environment Ministry’s resources recycling division.According to the ministry’s statistics, per capita household waste was reduced to 0.94 kg per day in 2013 from 1.3 kg per day in 1994. From 1994 to 2013, the rate of trash that was buried decreased from 81.2 percent to 9.6 percent and the amount of trash that has been incinerated has decreased from 15.3 percent to 6.4 percent. The rate of trash that has been recycled increased from 15.3 percent to 83.2 percent. “Environmental benefits aside, recycling brings more economic benefits to countries that have a small landmass and few resources like Korea. Large countries like the U.S. spend a lot of money on traveling between recycling facilities, but small countries like us can save money by recycling,” Son said.But Korea’s signature recycling system has sometimes upset residents because of its strict, and sometimes, ambiguous rules. In February 2015, Seoul city government announced that it would no longer accept regular trash bags that contained paper or plastic. Following the announcement, Seoul residents were confused as to whether items such as toilet paper, diapers and sanitary pads should be included in the category of paper to be recycled, and refused to recycle them. The government later explained it had used an “ambiguous” expression in the announcement and clarified that toilet paper, diapers and sanitary pads were not subject to recycling rules. “The government recycling policy is a step in the right direction. But sometimes it is a bit confusing and ambiguous. Before implementing the policy, the government should communicate better with the public over the details,” said Kim Seoul-gi, a 58-year-old Seoul resident. By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","milk cartons from trash ,saw her roommates sifting ,breakdown of korea recycling ,her roommates sifting through ,graduate student lee hee","['the United States', 'Lee Hee - jung', 'U.S.']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32358623  0.30931306

This otherwise common scene is made more special as the students are homeless and the teacher is Cho Sei-hon, among the top tier of photographers in Korea. This is part of Cho and Seoul City’s welfare program called “Himang Frame,” or frame of hope, seeking to help homeless members of society become more self-reliant by providing them with a chance to learn photography skills. Cho has run the program since 2012. For Cho, with over three decades of career experience in photojournalism and fashion photography, taking pictures is not merely a way to capture a moment, but a means to connect the public and inspire hope. “I’m grateful I can do the volunteer work when my talent is nothing more than just taking pictures. It is just that people like myself became more useful as society has changed (to pay closer attention to welfare),” the ICON STUDIO owner told The Korea Herald in an interview. Cho Sei-hon (second from right) instructs his students while they practice at his studio in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, on Thursday. (ICON STUDIO)After the two-month-long class that provides students with cameras and other necessary gear, he picks the two best students to work as public photographers in Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. In March 2013, the first two homeless photographers opened a photo studio. Depending on the size of the pictures, they earn around 3,000 won ($2.65) per shot that they take and print for tourists. While the photography becomes a useful source of income, the city also provides them with basic monthly allowances to support their living conditions. Cho originally brought up the idea for Himang Frame after he was invited to a British photo exhibition in 2011 held by U.K. nonprofit foundation A Positive View, which pursues philanthropy through photography. Prince William became Royal Patron of the organization in 2010 after his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. Some 100 photographers around the world are regularly invited to the charity event to auction off their pictures for charity. All the auction proceeds are donated to photography class programs for the homeless in the U.K. “At a dinner event in the U.K., I came across one of the photographers. Surprisingly, I found that he was once a homeless person who learned photography from the charity program. With the support, he became a professional photographer. I started to think, ‘Why couldn’t this happen in Seoul?’” said the 56-year-old. Returning to Korea, he shared the idea with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon right before he was elected in 2011. After his inauguration, Park pushed ahead with the project with Cho in February 2012. As of now, four homeless photographers are working at the public photo studio, with two more expected to debut soon as this year’s program is to be finished later this week.“I’m hoping to train at least 10 photographers so that they can even form their own cooperative union and become truly self-reliant,” he said. Cho’s philanthropic activities date back to 2000.It began when he took family pictures of those with intellectual disabilities. But it was not until he felt the “obligation to support others” that he was asked by a social worker to take pictures of children put up for adoption on their 100th day after birth, celebrating a Korean tradition that recognizes the baby’s health and prosperity.To raise awareness, he took pictures of each baby being held by a celebrity volunteer, and the event soon became regular with the adoptee photo exhibition being held every December as “Letters from Angels.”“I somehow felt the sense of duty. Thanks to the participation of top celebrities, I was able to contribute to raising the awareness of the adoptee issue by encouraging these top stars to be more vocal as well,” the photographer said. “At first, some thought that I was taking advantage of the innocent children to boost my popularity. But as the exhibition event continued for over a decade, no one looks at me with such prejudice anymore,” he added with laugh. Cho also took pictures of disabled athletes and held an exhibition at the general assembly of the International Paralympic Committee in Seoul in 2007. Moved by his photos, the IPC committee offered him the chance to work as one of 20 official photographers for the Paralympic Games held in Vancouver, Beijing and London. “I wanted to break the prejudice through photography,” he said. “When you see the people from the sky, everyone looks like dots. I just try to equalize the disabled in the picture by discovering their beautiful sides. That way, I believe it can improve the public perception toward the disabled.”Cho is currently the chairman of public relations at the Korea Paralympic Committee. “Photography is a universal language. It moves the heart and wins sympathy without any translation.”Recognized for his service, he received a presidential citation in 2011, along with an award from the Welfare Ministry for his adoptee program and another from the Culture Ministry for helping the disabled in 2010.To better “donate” his talent and collectively support those in need with his professional skills, he set up a company called The Himang Frame for a Positive View in September 2012.In conjunction with Himang Frame, Cho has also operated the Green Frame program since 2012 to support underprivileged youth who are interested in photography, especially the disabled, orphans and multicultural children. He has taught about 300 students annually since 2012, with financial support from Samsung Group.“It felt so fruitful and rewarding when two orphan students were admitted to college as photography majors this year. Gaining school admission means they can stay at the orphanage until they graduate. A little support extended their living support and paved the way for change in their life,” the photographer said. Under the regulation, orphans are required to leave the orphanage once they legally become adults. The rule is suspended if they are admitted to college.As the Green Frame program is only available in Seoul, he now dreams of a greater goal to expand the program to those living in isolated areas, possibly with a mobile photography classroom. Cho has also started providing such learning opportunities to blind children.“As long as I explain in detail, the blind do understand what I say and take pictures as their senses of hearing and touch are much more developed. They can even distinguish where the light and shadows are by feeling the heat,” he said.“Is it really necessary to see the pictures with eyes when they can visualize the object in mind?

The patient was recovering from the aftereffects of MERS after testing negative earlier. The 152nd patient received a lung transplant after suffering from MERS but failed to recover fully. Following the latest death, the fatality rate of the disease in Korea rose from 19.4 percent to 19.9 percent.The CDC said that the five super-spreaders, all of whom had pneumonia, transmitted the virus to 153 of the 184 patients detected between May 20, 2015, and July 13, 2015. Two of the total 186 infected patients have been excluded from the denominator as their transmission routes remain uncertain, the CDC said. Thirty-five-year-old patient No. 14, for instance, spread the virus to 85 people while staying at Samsung Medical Center, showing the strongest contagiousness observed from the crisis, the CDC said in its report. Officials take the temperature of hospital-goers at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul on Oct. 13 after one of the patients recovered from MERS was diagnosed again. YonhapThe CDC published these and other epidemiological results on Korea’s MERS outbreak on the Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives journal. This is the CDC’s first such report on the MERS outbreak here.The CDC said it has defined those as super-spreaders if the patient had transmitted the virus to at least four people.The median age of the super-spreaders was 41 years and they all contacted hundreds of people while staying at their respective medical facilities. Four of them were men. Patients 1, 14 and 16 had severe coughs and infected 28 people, 85 people, and 23 people, respectively. On the other hand, Patient 15 and patient 76, who rarely coughed, infected six people and 11 people, respectively, the report said.These patients were hospitalized for an average of 10 days, and the number of people who came into close contact with them ranged from 288 to 805. While patient No. 14 wore a mask intermittently, other super-spreaders did not wear one. None received aerosol-generating treatment.Of the 186 patients infected across 16 hospitals, some 44.1 percent of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8 percent were caregivers, and 13.4 percent were health care personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days.The report said the respiratory droplet route is seen as the most likely method of transmission but that further survey is currently ongoing.The report also confirmed failed preventive measures in the early stage.The patient No. 1 started developing fever and myalgia on May 11 after returning from a business trip to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. His diagnosis did not come until May 20, partly due to a failure of him telling medical staff the countries he had traveled to in his first several hospital visits. By then, he had already come into contact with over 600 people during his multiple visits to different hospitals. Twenty-six cases of infection were confirmed among these initial contacts, and consecutive transmission via hospitals rapidly proceeded throughout the nation, the report explained. Even upon the first diagnosis, only three were placed in isolation. The number then increased to 64 the next day and to 120 upon the diagnosis of the fifth patient. Those who were not placed in isolation soon enough further transmitted the virus at other hospitals, some of them becoming super-spreaders.The analysis showed that the mortality rate of those aged 65 and over was almost eight times higher than that of younger patients.History of diabetes, malignancy and the presence of underlying respiratory disease, cardiac disease and chronic kidney disease were also significantly associated with mortality. MERS is a viral disease that is still fairly new to humans. No vaccine or treatment is currently available for the disease, which contributes the high fatality rate of around 36 percent globally.There currently is only one MERS patient in South Korea. Thirty-five-year-old patient No. 80 tested negative for the virus on Sept. 30 and again on Oct. 1 but tested positive recently.From news reports","sunday after another patient ,patient died the patient ,83 of korean mers ,sunday the nation death ,five super spreaders during","['Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",29,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.16366759  0.70420688

It took us 65 years to be reunited, but we will soon meet again,” Lim Hak-kyu, 80, from the South shouted as his 85-year-old sister, Lim Ri-gyu, held out her hand through the bus window.Park Yong-deuk, 81, from the South insisted on bringing his 82-year-old sister Park Ryong-sun to Seoul as he broke down in tears. Lee Jeong-soo, 68, from South Korea wipes the tears of her father Lee Heung-jong, 88, during the last session of the first round of family reunions at Mount Geumgangsan in North Korea, Thursday. Joint Press Corps.“My sister, sister, I will take you to Seoul. We will go there together. I will send you back after you spend just three days with us there … you will have no problem,” Park said in a trembling voice.His nephew from the North separated the grieving siblings, saying, “We will meet when our countries are reunited.”The first round of the reunions at the mountain resort ended Thursday after the two-hour gathering where 389 South Koreans exchanged what could be their last words of love with their relatives they were separated from after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.A total of 141 North Korean participants attended the reunions, which were possible as part of a comprehensive inter-Korean agreement on Aug. 25 to defuse cross-border tensions and improve bilateral ties.During the final gathering in the morning at the resort, many participants got down on their knees and bowed to bid farewell to their parents, with some singing a sorrowful song longing for unification.‘It is a sad thing (for us to be separated again),” said Ri Hong-jong, 88, from the North as her 68-year-old daughter Lee Jeong-suk was poised to bow before him. “We are running out of time,” Lee said with teary eyes.Lee Gyeong-hee, 77 from the South, promised his 84-year-old sister Ri Ran-hee to live until 100, hoping that reunification will come before they die.“Live long. Some 20 years, we both will turn around 100 and will be able to meet again,” Lee told his sister, while firmly clasping her hands. As participants in their 80s and 90s cried out, South Korea’s medical staffers kept a close watch to see if they needed any medical support. Some 20 medical staffers with five ambulances accompanied South Korean participants. The second round of the reunions involving 255 South Koreans from 90 families will begin on Saturday. A total of 188 North Koreans are to participate in the second round that will continue through next Monday.Like the first round, the participants will have six meetings with their relatives, each session lasting two hours. They will meet for two group reunions, a welcome reception, one individual gathering, one joint dinner session and a farewell.By Song Sang-ho & Joint Press Corps (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","emotional farewell mount geumgangsan ,separated families boarded homebound ,reunions end with emotional ,91 separated families boarded ,painful sobs and aching",['North Korea'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33795628  0.38872597

Schools choose from any of the eight textbooks, while primary schools have a single set of state-authored history textbooks.After months of controversy, the Ministry of Education last week announced that history textbooks nationwide will be authored by the government starting in the 2017 school year. ""The problematic thing about the current system is that most of the authors participating in authoring and monitoring the textbooks are mostly left-leaning,"" said Cho Jin-hyung, the chief of the group.Cho said as for Rhee Syng-man, the first South Korean president, most textbooks described him as a leader who had many flaws rather than feats.""There were mostly negative contents about the Rhee Syng-man administration,"" Cho said, adding that books should have a balanced view of him as the leader in the chaotic period following Korea's liberation from Japan's  1910-45 colonial rule.Another non-profit education civic group, World Without Worries About Shadow Education raised concern that the government's decision to reintroduce a single set of textbooks could raise the cost of private education.""It is difficult to conclude that a single set of textbooks directly raises the cost of private education,"" said Yoon Jee-hee.""However, there is a high possibility that the burden on private education will be increased in light of the local education culture, which emphasizes private tutoring."" South Korean parents are known for their enthusiasm about education, with private education spending staying significantly high, though its growth has been slowing in recent years. Parents spent 18.2 trillion won ($17 billion) in 2014 on private education for their children, according to data released by the non-profit education civic group.Private education spending reached its peak in 2009 at 21 trillion won.

Now, I do so for you,"" Park said, with his eyes teary.They were among hundreds of Koreans granted a rare chance to meet their long-lost families living on the other part of the heavily-fortified border for the first time in more than six decades.Nearly 130,000 South Koreans are registered in the government's database as having family in the North, split by the 1950-53 Korean War. Half of them have already died and around 66,000 others still hope for reunions with their relatives in the North.Amid the rather chilly and cloudy autumn weather, the South Koreans headed back home without any plan to see their families in the communist nation again. Reunions may be unlikely before unification, as the two Koreas are technically still at war with the 1950-53 Korean War ending in a truce, not a peace treaty.Tight border control will continue, blocking phone calls and email exchanges.It marked the first inter-Korean family reunion event in a year and eight months, a result of the Aug. 25 deal between the two Koreas that ended a military standoff.Another round of reunions involving 250 more South Koreans from 90 families will be held from Saturday to next Monday at the scenic mountain, home to a resort developed by the South's Hyundai Group.Such family reunion events began in 2000, riding on the accomplishment of the first inter-Korean summit. Twenty face-to-face family reunion events have been held so far, as well as seven video conference reunions.

I believe traditional print will phase out. The question now is how do you make money,"" Rifkin said on the sideline of the five-day OECD Ministerial Meeting Daejeon 2015, World Science & Technology Forum that runs through Friday. The event is a gathering where scholars and government experts will discuss technology-related issues under the theme ""Creating our common future through science, technology, and innovation."" As a professor, Rifkin said he was impressed by how global news producers are actually making efforts to survive with the new trend.""They put free content but expertise in things people want.Free contents are there but you can buy subscriptions (and receive) more layered analysis and contents,"" Rifkin said, adding he also puts out large portion of his works for free.""There are still ways to make ends meet, although it will be challenging.This is the democratization of news and knowledge. It is very healthy for the younger generation,"" he said.Rifkin, meanwhile, stressed that the public still must be concerned over the falling quality of content.""What I'm worried about is contents losing ability (to help readers) think in a deep layered way. Then we lose the best talent we have, which is to produce knowledge,"" Rifkin said.Rifkin said although he admires South Korea's achievements in technology, the country also must make efforts to establish an environment-friendly ecosystem.""You are starving for something, but you don't know what it is. It is too much from being natural way of the planet. Where is nature? Where is environment living? We need to re-introduce the younger generation to awesome natural living,"" Rifkin said.During his keynote speech held earlier in the day, Rifkin highlighted that the traditional economic system has changed.""Already the young people live in hybrid systems. They are exchanging goods and services for free, zero margin cost in a sharing economy,"" he said.Rifkin said the wane of traditional industries and social systems will bring more benefits to mankind, adding he likes the beginning of new things.""I hope my work will be the beginning, not the end,"" he said, referring to his book titled, ""The End of Work.""

A popular idol singer in his country, he wants to be a global pop star with songs he composed. Last year, he appeared on national television show “X Factor,” a music contest among aspiring artists similar to “American Idol,” where he had already finished sixth place. Capitalizing on the success, he signed a gentlemen’s agreement with indie-pop label Homeovox Music. Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“It’s been an incredible journey so far. To be frank, I never dreamed of becoming a professional musician until one or two years ago,” Kostadinov told The Korea Herald last week. “I started singing with friends in my home town Sevlievo, a small town in north-central Bulgaria, and busked whenever I got low on cash.”Performing on the streets proved to be useful for Kostadinov, who claimed he was shy and shaky at start. Aside from earning quick cash, the experience empowered him with a shrewd sense of live performance, audience interaction and song selection.The up-and-coming artist visited Korea in early October at the invitation of the Korea Foundation. He performed at the Multicultural Arirang Music Festival in Changwon City on Oct. 4, Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 9 and Oct. 11 and at the opening ceremony of Citadines Haeundae Hotel in Busan on Oct. 13. Kostadinov also recorded a session of the variety show “A song for you” with Korean pop group CNBlue, which will be aired on KBS2 on Oct. 25. Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov and Bulgarian fans at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea Herald“Korean music is exceptional in that the producers are really smart and know how to make international hits,” he said. “K-pop artists are very passionate, talented and well-trained, and can dance and sing like no other.”“When all these things come together,” he explained, “it translates into a formula for the Korean Wave.”The tall singer with a sturdy, husky voice said that a key part of hallyu’s universal vogue had to do with linguistics. “The Korean language has musical qualities because of the way it sounds,” he highlighted. “In music, word intonation is important and Korean sounds very melodic. I think it’s one of the reasons why K-pop is so popular globally.”Koreans also know how to promote their music, he noted, pointing out that K-pop was readily audible and visible compared to music from other Asian countries. “People all over the world can just stumble upon K-pop and once they hear the music and see the dance and music video, they simply fall in love with it.”Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov and Bulgarian fans at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldIn July, Kostadinov witnessed firsthand the power of hallyu in Bulgaria when he was invited to be on the jury of a K-pop festival organized by the Korean embassy in Sofia.“It was incredible to see thousands of Bulgarians singing and dancing along K-pop songs by heart, so perfectly in Korean language,” he said. “It wasn’t just music, but a whole frenzied culture that included album sales, Korean people and food stalls on the sides.”Although Bulgaria and Korea are physically far apart, he argued that fans could connect through K-pop.From 2012 to 2014, Kostadinov studied art and design at the University of Huddersfield in England. He graduated with a first honors degree and was granted a master’s scholarship, but decided to pursue a music career back home instead. “So far in Bulgaria, we haven’t had companies supporting individual songwriters. Many singers parrot labels presented to them,” Kostadinov said. During his two-week visit here, he performed various songs, including “Arirang,” “The Sound of Silence” and “Love Somebody,” as well as his compositions “Inner Demons” and “I Won’t Pray.”He added, “If you have a style that you are good with, you need to stick with it and do everything you can to improve it and be recognized for that style.” Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 11. Joel Lee / The Korea HeraldThe young singer with raven hair and a beard, wearing a black hoodie, noted that diverse music genres have begun to spring up in Bulgaria over the past several years, triggered by people’s avant-garde desires.“Many talented artists perform underground and are not yet exposed through the mass media,” he said. “Over the next few years, I think there will be a qualitative shift in Bulgaria’s music industry, because people are simply fed up with the same, flat commercial scores.”Next year, Kostadinov plans to release four to five singles with videos, possibly an album, on top of performances around the world. “My ultimate dream is to be one of the most recognized musicians in the world,” he said smiling. “So far, it seems to be going perfectly well. I can’t wait to achieve them all, so I’m always rushing ― ‘ppalli-ppalli.’”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)Bulgarian singer, songwriter and guitarist Miryan Kostadinov at the Korea Foundation’s Cheonggyecheon Music Festival in Seoul on Oct. 9.

Seoul Central District Court upheld the previous rulings the evidence was insufficient to confirm that the broker had known that the runaway wife did not initially have intentions to marry and the broker deliberately provided false information about the foreign wife. A Korean man in his 50s surnamed Han met a Filipino woman in the Philippines in 2011 through the marriage broker after paying a fee of 24 million won ($21,000). The couple married in the Philippines and settled in Korea in July 2012. The foreign wife, however, ran away from home 56 days after arriving here, and severed contact with her husband. In 2013, Han sought compensation of 6 million won and return of the brokerage fee, claiming that the middleman allegedly had known that the wife came to Korea without intentions to marry. He also argued that the broker did not give documents of the contract and personal information of the spouse. The court ruled that there was no causality between the spouse’s runaway and the provision of the documents. It is also difficult to see that Han had suffered damages, the verdict added.The court, however, ordered that the broker return a partial brokerage fee of 9 million won to Han, saying that the contract was not terminated upon matchmaking, but that it was valid until Han filed the lawsuit.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","foreign wife korean man ,korean lower court tuesday ,wife korean man ,the foreign wife korean ,wife korean man in","['korean', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'korean']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47942299  0.58465594

Young people don't feel personally connected to it,"" said Dennis Blair, chairman of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, in an interview with Yonhap News Agency, in response to a question about the ""comfort women"" issue.Comfort women is a euphemistic term for victims of Japan's sexual enslavement of women during World War II.""But young people have to know where they came from, what happened, what their grandparents did, what their great-grandparents did,"" he said. ""It is a cop out to say that we never, we will never, we only should apologize once.""Such historical issues should be ""relearned and revisited and passed on in a very dynamic way,"" Blair said. ""History is alive and your understanding has to be refreshed from generation to generation.""The sexual slavery issue is the biggest thorn in frayed relations between Japan and South Korea, with Seoul demanding Tokyo take steps to address the grievances of elderly Korean victims of the atrocity and Japan refusing to do so.Tokyo has also been accused of attempting to whitewash its militaristic past, allegedly pressuring an American publisher to revise a description of the sexual slavery issue in a school textbook in an apparent attempt to water down the atrocity.Blair said that both South Korea and Japan should ""face their history.""""To overcome the events of history requires a two-way process,"" he said. ""There has to be understanding, apology, reconciliation, but then, there has to be acceptance by the other side so that things can move forward.""Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's war anniversary statement in August ""could have gone further from the Japanese side because, as I said, I think that it's very important for the leaders of both countries to move forward,"" Blair said.Blair also said South Korea and Japan view history too emotionally as something of traitor-or-patriot issues, stressing that history should be discussed in a cool-headed manner and in historical terms, with a focus on arguments.""Japan and Korea have so many important issues they need to work on together,"" he said. ""With so much important work to do, to have a historical issue just block the ability to move forward I think is not good. Not good for Korea, not good for Japan. Certainly not good for the U.S.""Blair recently drew media attention when he criticized Japanese Prime Minister Abe for failing to offer a clear, straightforward apology for the country's wartime crimes in a statement issued in August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.In an article posted on the Sasakawa USA's website, Blair said Abe's statement ""falls far short"" of Japan's 1995 statement of apology, known as ""Murayama Statement,"" in helping Japan ""face its own history squarely and assuring other countries it has done so.""Blair also said in the article that the Abe statement ""too often resorts to the anonymous passive voice with its avoidance of responsibility,"" such as ""countless lives were lost"" and ""there were women ... whose honor and dignity were severely injured.""""This statement is disappointing and misses a huge opportunity both to educate Prime Minister Abe's own supporters and to reassure other countries,"" Blair said in the article. ""We wish Japan's leaders would help its citizens understand their country's past better and more fully.""The criticism came as a surprise because Blair is the chairman of a think tank known for efforts to help promote Japan's image and interests in the U.S., and has been considered one of the pro-Japanese American security and foreign policy experts.""We're an independent organization and sometimes I criticize the U.S. government, sometimes I criticize the Japanese government, sometimes I criticize the Korean government and I think that's the job in democracy,"" he said of the article.""I hope my criticisms are founded on reason, not on emotion, that they are logical. I think the strength of democratic governments is to have reasoned dialogue. There's too little of it in the politics of any of our three countries,"" he said.Speaking of renewed tensions over North Korea's threat to conduct nuclear or missile tests, the former commander of the U.S. Pacific Command said Pyongyang is ""playing its old game"" of asking for concessions in exchange for refraining from doing bad things.""We have to be strong and resilient. If they take an action, we have to hit them harder than they hit us. I think the economic sanctions should continue to be strong. We have to, to the extent we can, help North Koreans realize what a terrible government they have,"" he said.Blair said Japan's controversial security legislation should be no cause for concern for South Korea because it's clear that Japanese public opinion, which he said will ultimately control the use of Japanese force, is not aggressive, but defensive.He also said he believes the legislation is a ""step in the right direction"" and would actually be in Korea's interest because Japan can provide logistical and other support for U.S. and Korean forces in the event of contingencies, even if Japanese forces are not involved in combat operations in Korea.Blair said he wishes South Korean President Park Geun-hye's upcoming visit to Washington a success.""I think it will be a good visit. Many of us, who have worked in Asia long time, have many Korean friends. We have many Japanese friends and we want both countries to succeed and we want both counties to improve their relationship with each other because it's in their interest and it's in the interest of the United States,"" he said.

This includes presentation skills, negotiation tactics and how to effectively carry out a business meeting. But it aims to achieve more than making students a business expert. One of Min’s main project is the “creative mobile app proposal,” which has students create hypothetical products for a hypothetical company, such as smartphone applications, devices for the Internet of Things and wearable computers.The project does not stop at merely creating ideas. Min chooses product plans that stand out and introduces them to relevant companies or government bodies. If the plan is deemed plausible, the respective organization develops the product, potentially creating jobs and profit.About 800 students participated in the project from 2010 to the spring semester of 2015. “Through this project, students foster the ability to develop their original ideas, which gives them an edge over potential competitors in a global job market. Companies also benefit from it because they are provided with creative ideas from the students,” Min said. One of the model projects for the spring semester of this year was an application and a website for helping refugees in Germany, by a student named Jonathan Berneth, which will help with organizational problems and make it easier for people to donate. Min said the project was initiated so that it could help students develop abilities that corporations demand.“There is a considerable gap between higher education and the talent companies are looking for,” Min pointed out. “In order to overcome this gap, it is important for students to acquire a competitive edge that the companies want by participating in various projects.He said the goal of the project is to train students to perform their jobs in future careers while being able to come up with creative ideas.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heradlcorp.com)","english guru helps students ,his business english class ,business english class ,valuable than ever professor ,english centers on teaching","['korean', 'Min Byoung', 'Konkuk University']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73201829  0.43212757

Seeking to break the ice, he told them a story starting with a Korean proverb. Word for word, it was supposed to be “Too many boatmen steer a boat to the mountain.” Instead, the interpreter opted for what she believed was a more comprehensible expression, “Too many cooks spoil the broth.” Yet the official, who had expected to hear “ship” or “mountain” to his dismay, gave her poor marks after the session and asked for someone else for the next round. This old saga, told by a senior diplomat to The Korea Herald, highlights the delicate and complex nature of the work that poses a dilemma between literal and liberal translations, even for the nation’s finest specialists. Heated debate persists over whether translation is an art or a science. Either oral or written, it requires not just an exceptional command of both languages but also a flair for conveying the nuance and intention of the speaker or writer and, perhaps their audience as well. Presidential interpreters are some of the best at it, many of them career diplomats armed with superb language skills and knowledge of sensitive foreign policy issues. “Unlike simultaneous or conference interpretation, we need to embody the speaker’s personality in addition to conveying exact meanings,” said Chung Eui-hae, director for ASEAN cooperation at the Foreign Ministry who served as an English interpreter for late President Roh Moo-hyun from 2006-08. “Presidential interpreters, in particular, need to help the two leaders build a rapport, going beyond being communication facilitators, while fostering the mood in line with the type of the event.” The field has increasingly been dominated by women. Females make up some 80 percent of the entire enrollment at the Graduate School of Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, according to school officials. Yet the overall scale of the market, where freelancing still holds sway, has rather shriveled in recent years, especially for English translation, as more Koreans gain overseas experience starting in childhood and get to mingle with international staff at school and work, insiders say. “To me, the No. 1 threat to my job security is the growing number of fluent English speakers,” said a freelance English interpreter who served former President Lee Myung-bak and prime ministers under Roh and wishes to remain anonymous. “Most chiefs of today’s corporations and institutions freely speak English, or they just pick someone from their own pool of capable employees and let them do the job unless the topic is critical and requires a professional.” The dynamics surrounding the job, traditionally considered the domain of humans, are also rapidly evolving in line with technological innovation. Some 10 years ago, many Web users enjoyed poking fun at the primitive translations of the Babel Fish service, then run by first-generation search engine AltaVista and now by Yahoo. For an input of “I am Sam,” a Korean translation would pop up, saying “I am a surface-to-air missile,” while the Korean word “woneomin” (“native”) used to be rendered as “circle fisherman” (from “won” and “eomin”). From Google to Skype to Flitto, however, the once primitive Web-based translation services are now growing smarter, with some now being available even without Internet access, and other gathering wisdom from social media in real time. Seoul’s Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, for its part, joined forces with the state-run Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute to roll out an automatic interpretation mobile application named GenieTalk two years ago. Its latest edition unveiled late last year recognizes more than 100,000 words, functions without Internet access and has made Bluetooth communication available. Yet many industry experts and insiders remain skeptical of the machines’ ability to fully replace career translators, especially given the Korean language’s abstract, subtle, and complex characteristics, though they acknowledge their assistance in boosting accuracy and speed. “Despite the rapid technological development, in terms of advanced translations and interpretations, machines have yet to overcome their limits due to the ambiguity and duplicity that come with nuanced human speech,” said Kwak Joong-Chol, a professor of interpreting at Hankook University of Foreign Studies. Cho Sei-young, a former career diplomat and Japanese interpreter for former Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam and currently an international relations professor at Dongseo University in Busan, echoed Kwak’s view. “Practical documents such as manuals may be doable with automatic translators. But no cutting-edge computers can be a substitute for creative work like poetry, novels or project planning. A sophisticated task such as summit interpretations will hardly be fulfilled by machines,” he said.

They speak about pressing brainteasers with the top actors on the world stage. They have access to the heavily fortified Cheong Wa Dae and its inner workings, as well as those of other presidential offices around the globe. Despite their seemingly coveted call of duty, almost the only time they make the headlines is when they blunder. At times, they are bewildered by the convoluted, highfalutin language of the politicians sitting next to their client even before composing their nerves in an environment that requires intense concentration. They are the president’s interpreters.Lee Sung-hwan (center), an assistant presidential secretary for foreign affairs and President Park Geun-hye`s execlusive English interpreter, sits between Park and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet during a U.N. session in New York on Sept. 27. (Yonhap)While well-trained specialists provide professional services, many of them are career diplomats who boast language skills and knowledge about sensitive diplomatic issues. Whatever their background, they are considered some of the best in the field of interpretation.“If you are preparing for a meeting, you want to fully understand what will be discussed and thoroughly check on the English translation of related technical terms. Once the session kicks off, you just focus on interpreting every word said by both sides without missing one,” says Seoul’s Ambassador to the Netherlands Choe Jong-hyun, who was an English interpreter for former Presidents Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung from 1996 to 2000. Bae Sun-kyung, who served as a Russian interpreter for President Park Geun-hye and her predecessors Lee Myung-bak and Roh Moo-hyun, also stressed the significance of delivering accuracy and context, for which additional explanations are indispensable at times. “Precise representation is far more essential at summits than dinner and other relatively casual settings, especially if the president needs to convey a strong, clear message. I take caution not to be inclined to personal feelings and exercise self-control,” says Bae, who is now a second secretary at the South Korean Embassy in Belarus. “But I often find it necessary to elucidate contextual meanings. You may think of it as sort of an interference that could damage the accuracy, but it is not. You would never know when you end up interpreting for someone who has little to no idea about the six-party talks, Cheonan corvette sinking, or the Sewol ferry tragedy.” Her point was echoed by a professional English interpreter who served Lee and, before that, prime ministers. “As I usually represent my client only, I was trying to read his or her intentions and goal and fit the mood,” she said, asking anonymity due to the sensitivity of her work. The intensity of the atmosphere and the high-stakes agenda are so stressful in themselves that it can cause severe anxiety coupled with health problems in the lead up to the events, the presidential interpreters say. In Bae’s case, it is indigestion, menstrual irregularity, insomnia and acne, among others. Yet the experience offers a crucial chance to delve into various diplomatic issues and thus improve their vocational capability, while seeing into the minds of their own president and other world leaders on major flashpoints, they note. “After the meeting ended, sometimes my head went blank and I just could not remember anything that was discussed in the past two hours,” said Chung Eui-hae, director for ASEAN cooperation at the Foreign Ministry who interpreted from Korean to English for Roh. “It involves a great deal of tension and stress, yes, but the moments of complete immersion make for a stunning experience.” Adding to the already high-pressure backdrop is the nearly flawless command of foreign languages possessed by some commanders in chief.Kim Dae-jung was known to have taught himself English and Japanese. Kim Young-sam is also a fluent Japanese speaker. The incumbent Park, who has shown her English and other language skills through speeches and other occasions, drew media attention after fixing her interpreter’s use of the term “party congress” to “party convention” during a meeting with German Ambassador Rolf Mafael here in early 2013. Cho Sei-young, a former director general for Northeast Asia affairs at the ministry and Japanese interpreter for the two Kims, says their own proficiency magnified the intensity of his service. In one episode, as he rode in a car after a summit in 1998 in Tokyo with then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Kim Dae-jung praised his work and even advised him to “enrich” his vocabulary such as by reading Japanese novels as the deceased president did himself while in prison. “They knew whether my interpretation was correct or not, so pressure was several times higher for Japanese interpreters,” says Cho, who now teaches international relations at Dongseo University in Busan.As professional interpreters have taken over a large part of their task, however, the burden on younger diplomats ― and their overall language ability and self-improvement efforts ― have sharply declined in recent years, he says. Bae also expressed hope that the Foreign Ministry would create a division to boost interpretation functions and nurture resources in the long term through training and education. “With the president or premier being the top diplomat of a country, repeatedly listening to their remarks at arm’s length allows you to look into his views on real diplomatic issues, and could create enormous synergy when you prepare the materials for the next summit or handle the issues yourself,” Cho adds. “Back then I was only a secretary-level servant but I took great pride in having an understanding of major diplomatic issues that is no less than that of senior diplomats.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","elite they fly hundreds ,society elite they fly ,presidential interpreters insiders ,they fly hundreds ,fly hundreds of thousands",[],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9484337   0.44943571

The interpretation profession is another such field, if not one of the most notable ones.At local graduate schools specializing in interpretation and translation, female students have far outnumbered male ones for a long time, which has contributed to the female dominance in the field. For example, women account for some 80 percent of students at the Graduate School of Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, the country’s first institution established in 1979 to produce interpreters, a school official told The Korea Herald. “When the first graduate school for interpretation opened some 30 decades ago, even then there were much more female applicants than male ones,” said Byun Joo-kyung who has worked as a freelance interpreter for some 13 years.“Some 20 years ago, Ewha Womans University opened a graduate course for interpretation, solely for female students, which might have contributed (to women’s dominance in the field).”Other cultural and economic factors add to the effect, as the Korean tradition encourages men to play a “leading” role rather than an ancillary one in whichever line of profession they are in.“As an interpreter, you are in a position to provide service to your client and barred from voicing your opinions. Given the country’s cultural aspects, men seem to prefer to lead whatever project they engage in, rather than being a part of it,” said an industry source who declined to be identified.Insiders also point out that the characteristics of the work that requires linguistic adeptness and sensitive protocol have made the job an ideal profession for women.“Clients also tend to prefer female interpreters for various reasons,” another source said.The type of work available for interpreters, which leans heavily toward freelance and contract-based stints, also play a part. Except for the small number of the so-called in-house interpreters who are hired on a permanent basis, most interpreters are freelancers. This makes interpreters’ employment highly sensitive to market conditions. Earlier this year, as an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome hit South Korea, many international forums that would require interpretation services were canceled or delayed. “When the MERS struck the nation, a series of conferences for which I was to provide interpretation were all canceled or put off,” a freelance interpreter said, wishing to remain anonymous. “When the North conducts provocations such as a nuclear test, conferences are also likely to be canceled or delayed.”Undeterred by cultural and societal challenges and market constraints, many male aspirants remain hopeful that they can develop a unique competitiveness by accumulating knowledge in areas of specific interest.“Yes, there may be challenges facing male interpreters. But we need to think outside the box and look at the benefits of the interpretation work that may offset those challenges,” said Lee Sang-ju, a 27-year-old student at the HUFS.“As male interpreters are apparently rare here, there may be niches in the market that they can create. As long as you have the will and motivation to become a full-fledged interpreter, you can find a way to secure your competitive edge.”By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","female students have far ,translation female students ,and translation female students ,translation female students have ,female students",['korean'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48718295  0.39456686

Tasked with books as thick as a dictionary, his trick to quick translation is to run the document through the Internet translation first before tackling the job himself.“Internet translation service saves time and efforts. Although the quality is not as good as that of translation by humans, it would have consumed twice as much time to translate the whole document without the Internet. The technology has come a long way,” said Kim.Once thought as a fixture of Sci-fi movie, humankind’s long-held ambition of communicating across language barriers went one-step closer to reality as a series of technology breakthroughs provide the tool that enables them to topple the babel tower -- a biblical reference to language barriers.One among them is Google Translate. Touted as the most widely used translation service, it covers 90 languages and boasts 500 million users on a monthly basis. Recently, Google rolled out an upgraded version that features translation of real-time conversation and images such as street signs and restaurant menus.Participants attend an event promoting Seoul government’s interpretation app GenieTalk. Ministry of Science, ICT and Future PlanningSkype Translator, Microsoft’s recently-unveiled rival to Google Translate, made the headlines with its simultaneous translation service. In the promotion video, an English-speaking student communicates almost flawlessly and simultaneously with a Spanish-native on the other side.“These technologies were not as fancy as they are now,” said translator Kim. “In the early days, the Internet translation service couldn’t even translate ‘annyeonghaseyo,’ ‘hello’ in Korean, into proper English,” Kim said, referring to the now-defunct prototype translation service Babel Fish. What brought the breakthrough is the technology called “machine learning,” a computer program that can learn by itself with enough exposure to spoken language. What has changed from previous generations is that the translation quality improves through use, trial and errors.For example, a translation machine could fail to properly translate “annyeonghaseyo,” into “hello” on the first try. But if the users spot it and fix the error, and get the result incorporated into the machine, it eventually spits out the correct version of translation. The groundbreaking technology, however, is not enough to translate a complicated sentence full of cultural and historic contexts into the one that sounds natural to native speakers. On the flip side, the factors that prevent natural translation pose an opportunity to Internet companies who amass stockpiles of data of their native language. Combined with the-more-the-better “machine learning” technology, vast databases contribute to a more natural-sounding translation. “Since we have more Korean-based data than any other search engines and excellent voice-processing technology that can even make out the difference between Korean homonyms, I think we excel at translation from Korean to English,” said an official from Naver, Korea’s biggest search engine. Other companies found their way to the solution with social-networking and collective knowledge, a new approach to make up for machine translation’s lack of accuracy in translating documents that require specific knowledge or cultural understanding.Flitto, a crowdsourcing translation developer, provides users with a forum where they can make a translation request to ideal “human” translators who are classified into different grades that reflect their performance standard such as speed and accuracy among others.“We are leveraging the talent of average citizens who have excellent language skills. Writing a business letter in foreign language will be a good example as it is a skill that needs good language skill, but not a skill as good as that of professional translators,” said Simon Lee, CEO of Flitto.Experts in translation industry remain skeptical about the prospect that machines will replace career translators who have extensive experience and special expertise in various fields. They claim that the underlying intent would be lost in translation, regardless of how advanced the technology is. “Our communication is usually ambiguous and inaccurate. So it is extremely difficult for machines to completely capture connotation behind the expressed language. How could the machines possibly translate simile-ridden literatures?” Kwak Joong-Chol, professor of interpreting at Hankook University of Foreign Studies. Other experts, such as Suk Jeong-hoon who has worked as professional translator for about 10 years, downplayed the significance of machines’ translation as the technology is all about “prompt” translation, not “accurate” translation, especially of Korean, a language that he considers the most hard-to-translate in the world. “What is impressive about the translation machines is their speed. But what really matters is what is being translated, not how fast the process is. The machines can only translate basic conversation by those who command perfect grammar, which I think is far from real-life conversation,” said Suk. “The nature of Korean makes matters worse. Not only is it unique in terms of linguistic structure, but it also has little demand for the language’s translation. Few businesses have ventured into developing translation systems involving Korean as it is apparently not the most sought-after language (in the global translation market),” Suk said.

27,27,27,Debate brews over decriminalization of sex trade,"Jang Se-hee was just 23-years-old when she started working as a sex worker.

Her father had just passed away after being hospitalized for seven years. “The medical bills were just enormous,” the 40-year-old said. “My siblings were too young, and my father had divorced my mother. I was the de-facto breadwinner of the family.”Jang was one of some 1,000 South Korean sex workers who gathered in central Seoul on Wednesday asking for the abolishment of the controversial anti-prostitution law, which has criminalized the buying and selling of sex since 2004.“We are telling the government that we are willing to and want to pay our income tax,” she told The Korea Herald. “And we are asking the government to regulate the industry and protect us with that tax money we are willing to pay. Right now we can’t pay taxes (because sex trade is illegal) and are not eligible to receive a lot of welfare benefits and protection because of this.”Amnesty International’s recent endorsement of a global effort to decriminalize all forms of consensual sex work that “does not involve coercion, exploitation or abuse” has been stirring controversy in Korea, where both purchasers and sellers of sex can face criminal charges.  South Korean sex workers participate Wednesday in a rally in central Seoul in protest of the antiprostitution law that has criminalized the sex trade since 2004. YonhapThe human rights group argued decriminalization was the best way to defend sex workers’ rights, as it will encourage governments to introduce specific laws and policies that regulate sex work more effectively. The effectiveness of the Korean anti-prostitution law has been seriously questioned in recent years. In spite of the law, the number of female sex workers in Korea in fact increased by 3.8 percent from 2010-2013, from 4,917 to 5,103, according to data from the Gender Ministry. According to Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the number of illegal sex trade businesses that operate in unconventional places, such as residential buildings and Internet cafes, increased dramatically from 2010 to 2014, from 2,068 to 6,669.Jang said the government’s current program to support sex workers failed to meet their practical needs. The former sex worker, who worked in brothels for about a decade, said many prostitutes continue to stay in the illegal business because they can’t make a living otherwise. A number of her colleagues have been seriously abused by their customers since 2004, the year the anti-prostitution law was enacted, but could not report the abuse to the police as they are afraid of being criminally charged. She said she and her colleagues do not want the government to decriminalize sex trade completely, without any regulations. She wants brothels to be licensed by the government and for the authorities to monitor the industry. “Many of us are in our 30s and 40s without formal education, and we have families to support. A lot of us are the breadwinners of our families,” she said. “The government currently gives 400,000 won ($335) a month to those who quit sex work and are looking for another job. How do you make a living and support your family with 400,000 won a month? Many say we are lazy for not trying to find another job. But most people have no idea what it is like for women without an education to find a job that pays enough to support herself and her family.”According to Hanteo National Union, a representative body of Korean sex workers, 80 percent of them did not attend or finish high school. A government study last year that surveyed 15 sex workers also showed that 86.6 percent of them grew up in broken homes, while 60 percent of them became involved in prostitution as teenagers after running away from home.In Korea, prostitution is closely associated with domestic abuse against children and teens. According to a joint study by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and Ewha Womans University which surveyed 219 runaway teens this year, 18.3 percent of them -- and 31.6 percent of those aged 14-16 -- said they had been involved in the sex trade at least once in their lives. The highest number of them, 66.7 percent, said they did it because they needed money, while 46.2 percent said they didn’t have any place to stay, and 28.2 percent said it was because they needed food. It is estimated that the biggest reason why Korean teens run away from home is because of family conflicts and domestic violence.“It’s a vicious circle,” said Byun Hyun-ju from Women’s Human Rights Commission of Korea. “Domestic abuse leads to prostitution, and prostitution leads to other forms of abuse against women.”In spite of the continued demand from sex workers, the Korean government stands firm on its stance that the commercial sex trade cannot be legal. Gender Equality Minister Kim Hee-jung said in that sex was “something that cannot be sold and bought.”Sarah Benson, the chief executive officer for a Dublin-based NGO supporting women affected by prostitution, said while no individual should be punished for selling sex, evidence shows that decriminalization of prostitution does not help the sex trade and or sex trafficking victims. According to Benson, Germany and the Netherlands did not see a decline in human trafficking and violence directed at prostitutes in spite of decriminalizing sex work early in the last decade.  “Even when you offer the opportunity to legitimize the business of prostitution, those who organize it (will) attempt to and continue to operate criminally,” she said in a press meeting at the International Symposium on the Prevention of Sex Trafficking held in Seoul on Wednesday. “And most importantly, the conditions for persons in prostitution do not improve, human trafficking increases because of the size of the sex trade increases. The ability of the police to target and challenge traffickers is compromised because when you make something a legitimate business then the opportunity to go on and investigate becomes more difficult.”Benson said the sex trade is a very clear example of a hierarchy of power, and therefore purchasers of sex and traffickers should not be decriminalized. “Nobody is ever forced to buy sex,” she said. “The person in prostitution in the vast majority of cases is somebody who is either coerced or (does so) for a variety of other reasons which are still based on vulnerability and lack of other options.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","south korean sex workers ,sex worker her father ,had divorced my mother ,korean sex workers ,korean sex workers who","['Jang Se - hee', 'south korean', 'Seoul']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6262511   0.39910227

He was detained Thursday in Seoul, eight days after he allegedly put her body in the trunk of a car and set it on fire.The police said the 48-year-old suspect kidnapped the victim to allure karaoke worker “A,” a man he was originally planning to kill for revenge. The personal information of “A” was withheld. Kim and “A” were involved in an assault case over a traffic lane violation issue in a mild car accident in May. While Kim was fined, “A” was acquitted, police said. Kim had visited the workplace of “A” seven times and asked him to pay back the fine but was rebuffed, so he decided to murder “A” by enticing him with a woman. Kim allegedly planned to ask the victim to contact “A” by posing as a job seeker, investigators said. The suspect then kidnapped the victim at a parking lot of a market but strangled her to death as she resisted, they added. Asked why he brutally damaged the victim’s body, Kim testified that he was outraged over the failed plan and that the victim had insulted him. Kim claimed that he felt sorry for the victim as he had not intended to kill her, police said.On Saturday, the suspect expressed his intention to kill “A” to the gathered media as he was being taken to the court for arrest warrant screening. Kim was also found with a note listing the names of 28 people with whom he thought he had conflicts. The two-page note found in his pocket included names of judges, doctors and police officers.The name of “A” was on the list, they said.During a probe, he muttered to himself, saying, “I need to kill all of them,” police said.The suspect was found to have 22 criminal convictions including assault.

(Yonhap)Kim, who had 22 criminal convictions including one for assault, was arrested Thursday, eight days after he allegedly stabbed a 35-year-old woman, surnamed Joo, outside a discount store before abandoning the body in the trunk of her car. The murder suspect said during the probe that he wrote down the names upon being treated badly and being unhappy with them. He even mumbled to himself, “I should kill them all,” according to the police.That the notes contained mostly female names raised the possibility that the crime had been motivated against women, though the suspect claimed he killed the victim only to steal her car and mobile phone.The police, however, dismissed speculation that the list could have indicated potential targets for his crimes.“There was no one on the list victimized by Kim,” the police said. “We see the list as a meaningless scheme.” Kim is suspected of kidnapping Joo as she loaded groceries into her car in an underground parking lot in Asan, Chungcheong Province, on Sept. 9. He dragged the victim around the country in her car before killing her and setting the vehicle on fire to destroy the evidence of his crime. The unemployed man, who lived on government subsidies, was apprehended in a separate case in Seoul after he broke into a veterinary hospital and threatened a nurse with a knife, demanding a euthanasia drug used on pets. A veterinarian and another nurse allegedly locked themselves in the office and made a distress call to the police.  The police are said to be having difficulties in questioning him, as he has been emotionally unstable and refused to make statements. The police requested a court issue an arrest warrant to further investigate him and find out his motives.(laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","year old murder suspect ,murder suspect had two ,old murder suspect ,her car underway police ,suspected of killing woman","['south korean', 'Kim Il - gon']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.06955361  0.1287753

Between January and July, only 84,224 out of 630,427 applicants were enlisted in the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps, beating odds of 1 in about 7.5, said Rep. Chung Mi-kyung of the ruling Saenuri Party, based on data submitted by the Military Manpower Administration for an annual audit. Acceptance is skewed toward older candidates who must enlist by age 38.The rate is down 3.2 percentage points from 16.6 percent last year, when 134,393 out of 807,520 were accepted. By branch, the Air Force proved to be most competitive this year, with about 8.2 people chasing every post, followed by the Army with 7.9, the Marine Corps with 6.1 and the Navy at 5.9. The widening mismatch reflects the cutthroat competition in the job market, as well as a surge in military resources -- chiefly the offspring of baby boomers who were born between 1955 and 1963, the lawmaker said, citing the MMA’s analysis. There were some 336,000 servicemen candidates born in 1990, 349,000 in 1991, 364,000 in 1992, 374,000 in 1993, 378,000 in 1994 and 380,000 in 1995. Yet the military’s demand for draftees continues to decline, from 271,000 last year to 250,000, in line with the military’s ongoing reform plan.As a result, the Defense Ministry is adjusting the quota upward and tighten physical test standards. “Despite the measures, the competition will inevitably continue to increase given the extensive discrepancy between supply and demand and youth unemployment,” Chung said, calling for a comprehensive overhaul of the MMA’s conscription system. Yet the trend contrasts with the growing number of South Koreans who give up their nationality and thereby become exempt from the military service. In 2014, 4,386 men opted for foreign citizenship, up from 3,375 in 2013, according to Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, also citing MMA statistics. Taking into account the 2,374 renunciations registered between January and July this year, the five-year tally tops 16,000. The seven-month total also includes 30 children of secretary- or higher-level public servants, Jin noted.

The woman, surnamed Kim, brought the baby girl to her center in July of last year, after the biological mother reportedly gave up custody of the child shortly after giving birth at a Busan-based hospital.Soon after the infant arrived at her center in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province, Kim tried to sell the child for 650 million won ($550,000) to an individual surnamed Jeong whom she met online. Jeong, who posted a false online post saying she was desperately interested in adopting a child even if it meant going through an illegal broker, was in fact an undercover reporter for a TV program who was researching the situation of child trafficking.   About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers. (Yonhap)The writer eventually reported Kim to the police. The baby showed a number of signs of abuse when found by the authorities. She was suffering from a skin disease and weighed only 2.62 kilograms, much less than her birth weight of 3.37 kilograms.During the trial, Kim argued that she never actually sold the baby, as the writer was not interested in being a parent, and therefore she never committed a crime. The court, however, upheld her “guilty” verdict.South Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers who have few resourses to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization. Many of them are forced to give up their children even to this day. By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","mother for illegal adoption ,owner gets year jail ,single mother for illegal ,unwed single mother for ,an unwed single mother","['the Supreme Court', 'Kim', 'Busan']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78834701 -0.27012831

34,34,34,Changing faces,"Last year, Park Ji-eun, a 26-year-old in Seoul, had a nose job and double-eyelid surgery. It was her final year in university and she wanted to get it done before applying for jobs. “I didn’t have any dramatic reasons for doing it,” she said. “I don’t think I had been particularly unhappy with my looks.

It was her final year in university and she wanted to get it done before applying for jobs. “I didn’t have any dramatic reasons for doing it,” she said. “I don’t think I had been particularly unhappy with my looks. I just wanted to improve it, just like the way you would improve your CV.”Park, who now works at a big firm, said she is satisfied with the results and her decision. Yet her experience post-surgery was not always pleasant. Once, Park was told that she was a “fake beauty.” Some belittled her by saying she wasn’t “naturally beautiful.”Park belongs to the 20 percent of all South Korean women who are reported to have undergone plastic surgery at least once in their lives. While Korea is often referred to as the world’s plastic surgery-capital ― it ranked fourth among the countries that performed the most cosmetic surgical procedures last year ― the country’s lookism today is linked to more complex social and economic situations, experts say.“There is a lot of evidence that the plastic surgery industry is unethically involved in the nation’s labor and job market,” said culture critic Lee Moon-won. “So many firms require applicants to include their photographs when submitting their resume, while plastic surgery clinics openly say ‘appearance can be your competitive edge in the job market’ in their public ads.”Often, the persistently high number of unemployed young Koreans ― standing at 410,000 as of the first half of this year ― attribute their bad luck to their looks. Korea’s peculiarly high tolerance of candid judgements about one’s appearance also adds to its obsession over looks.The nation’s popular culture depicts this tendency in many ways.“Let Me In,” a television program offering a complete makeover mainly through extensive plastic surgery, is one of those blamed for stoking lookism.Featured women in the program include a young job seeker who wishes to become a flight attendant but feels her appearance is preventing her from landing her dream job. Another is a North Korean defector who claims her “aggressive” facial features make her vulnerable to discrimination here.Another unemployed participant, a bullying and dating abuse survivor who had been wearing a facial mask every day to hide her protruding jaw, in fact bent her knees in front of the MCs and begged. “I want to live like a human being for once in my life,” she said in tears.“Most of the women featured are socially marginalized, with low incomes. Their problems, such as low self-confidence, don’t only stem from their appearance,” said Lee Yun-so from Womenlink, a women’s rights organization, who recently filed a public petition against the program.“It’s a vicious circle. It’s a disadvantage (in the job market) if you are not physically attractive, and when you are unemployed, you can’t ‘solve’ the situation because you can’t afford to pay for your surgery.”A “milder” version of such lookism was apparent in a recent episode of MBC’s “Real Men,” a variety show featuring celebrities experiencing life in the military,When Kim Hyun-sook, a female comedian, came out after dyeing her hair back to black to comply with military rules, other cast members had a field day, teasing her that she had become even less attractive.“Commenting on or making fun of someone’s looks is so normal in our society that no one thinks there is anything wrong with it even when it’s being done on national television,” Lee Yun-so said.While the emphasis on looks in the earlier days of Korea’s modernization was geared toward looking clean-cut and neat, the preference has evolved into more elaborate and glamorous features. Now the trend changes with a blink of an eye, from a bigger set of eyes and a higher nose to a smaller face shape. More men have also joined the craze, seeking to tweak their facial features and building their bodies, a phenomenon dubbed the “Adonis complex.”Some blame the obsession on Korea’s ruthless capitalism, with media and the establishment reinforcing lookism by commercializing sex and feeding off sensational interests to maximize their income.Rapid introduction of the Western culture since the Korean War (1950-53) also played a major role, as the Eastern notions of beauty were overtaken by the Western features that quickly became the standard for things that are beautiful, supreme and successful.Such excessive infatuation toward looks have subsequently fostered the country’s surgical skills.For the Korean government, its $5 billion plastic surgery industry attracts foreign visitors and their cash. Last year, 267,000 foreigners visited Korea to receive medical treatment in the country, spending 560 billion won ($468.8 million). Of the visitors, the second-largest number of them, 36,000, received cosmetic treatments or surgical procedures at plastic surgery clinics. Seoul’s Gangnam district, where 35.5 percent of all cosmetic surgery clinics are located, made 165.7 billion won from treating foreign visitors last year, accounting for 29.8 percent of the total spending by patients from overseas.For Park Ji-eun, being shamed for having undergone plastic surgery is what she finds the most ironic in today’s society.“I’m honest about it whenever somebody asks. I tell them I’ve undergone plastic surgery,” she said. “But I see irony in this whole situation. We don’t shame people who climb the social ladder by studying hard or working hard. We are often told that what matters is how much effort you put in to better yourself. “People who undergo plastic surgery pay their own money and endure physical pain to obtain what they weren’t given. If this is not making efforts, what is?”By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","final year in university ,her final year ,year old in seoul ,her final year in ,faces last year park","['Park Ji - eun', 'Seoul']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60170525  0.47566116

President Park Geun-hye waves to the crowd during her visit to a market in Daegu on Monday. YonhapAccording to local pollster Realmeter, Park’s job rating surged to 50.4 percent last week, recovering the 50 percent mark for first time in 10 months. The day she attended a massive military parade in Beijing on Thursday, her approval rating hit a new record this year at 54 percent, a 20 percentage point increase just in two weeks, according to Gallup Korea.With security her traditional forte, Park is widely expected to use her popularity to push ahead with her reform drive to revitalize the sluggish economy, despite objections from the opposition.Riding on her popularity in full swing, Park on Monday visited Daegu, the nation’s third-largest city, where she holds a strong support base, and vowed that she would keep this momentum and use it to carry out diplomatic and domestic tasks.“I believe that I should vigorously push forward for peace and the stability of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia on the diplomatic front and also to achieve reform for economic revitalization and for the future of the nation on the domestic front (at the same time),” she said at a meeting with local officials in Daegu.Calling it a rare phenomenon for a president who already passed his or her midway point of a single five-year term to recover the 50 percent mark, experts, however, remained cautious on Park’s remaining two years in office.“I believe it is a passing phenomenon contributed mainly by the breakthrough in inter-Korean talks,” said Yoon Seong-yi, political professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.Citing her weakness of being uncommunicative and a unilateral leader, the professor said she still faces lingering challenges to revive the nation’s economy and achieve labor reforms and economic democratization aimed at making the market a fair ground for all.With her presidency passing the midway mark and attention fast shifting to general elections next year, Park also sounded desperate in pushing her reform drive, the centerpiece of her state agenda.“We have no time to waste or wait,” she said, urging representatives of labor and business who returned to the negotiation table to make concessions on labor reforms.“We must reach an agreement for coexistence, with strong determination that this year is the last chance for labor reforms.”Park has begun her third year in office on a sour note, as controversy loomed over a political scandal involving her close aides. The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome further consolidated antagonists from last year’s Sewol ferry sinking tragedy, as the public condemned the government’s early response. Her leadership and her lack of communication with the public came under fire, further dragging her popularity down to a record low of 29 percent in June. But ironically it was North Korea’s mine blast in the demilitarized zone and the military tensions between the Koreas that shifted the spotlight back on Park’s leadership. Her hardline stance against North Korea’s provocation and her approach toward the reclusive regime’s volatility brought Seoul into an advantageous position in the breakthrough talks late last month.With North Korea expressing regret over the mine blast, and Seoul cementing closer ties with Pyongyang’s traditional ally and the biggest benefactor, Beijing, at the summit and military parade this month, conservatives here say that Park has brought a paradigm shift in Northeast Asian politics. Calling it the “Park Geun-hye doctrine,” right-leaning media and her supporters claimed that she has presented a vision to resolve North Korea’s nuclear ambition through the peaceful unification of two Koreas.

(Yonhap)President Park Geun-hye has renewed calls for a correct recognition of history to move ties forward in the region as she visited a symbolic building in China that served as a base against Japan's aggression.  Park attended a ceremony on Friday to reopen a historic building in Shanghai that was used by Korea's provisional government during part of Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.  The ceremony ""showed that South Korea and China share the historic meaning and value of sites of our independence struggle,"" Park said in the ceremony.  She vowed to make efforts to keep those sites intact through close cooperation with China.  China has helped preserve the building and other historic sites related with Korea's independence movement against Japan, in a sign of deepening ties between South Korea and China.  Many Koreans moved to China to continue the anti-Japanese resistance movement during the colonial rule.  ""Our people remember well that Chinese people provided support"" to Korea's independence movement, Park said in an interview with the People's Daily, a state-run Chinese newspaper, published on Friday. ""We are thankful to our old friends.""   The provisional government was formed on April 13, 1919, as the Korean government-in-exile, a month after Korea launched an independence movement against Japan. The Korean Peninsula was later divided into the capitalist South and the communist North after its independence from Japan in 1945.  Shanghai is the second and last stop on Park's three-day trip to China. In Beijing, she met with her Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and attended a military parade, the centerpiece of the 70th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II.  Xi has highlighted that Koreans and Chinese fought against Japan's aggressions as he expressed his gratitude to Park for visiting China for the celebrations.  South Korea, China and Japan are key trade partners, but tensions still persist between South Korea and Japan and between China and Japan over territorial and other history-related issues.  Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony and controlled much of China in the early part of the 20th century.  ""The countries in the region need to make joint efforts to move toward a new future based on a correct recognition of history,"" Park told the People's Daily. ""On that premise, sufferings of past history can be healed and overcome.""  Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tokyo ""has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.""  Still, Abe did not offer his own clear apology for Japan's militaristic past in the statement issued on Aug. 14, on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.  Park and Xi have agreed to hold a trilateral summit with Japan in Seoul in either late October or early November.  A trilateral summit has not been held since May 2012 due to the tensions in the region. China was represented by its prime minister in a previous trilateral summit.  Park expressed hope that Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo can create a new order of trust, noting it is very important for the neighbors to boost mutual cooperation.  She also called for cooperation with China to ensure lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, where North Korea poses threats with its missile and nuclear programs.  China is believed to have significant leverage over North Korea, which has long been dependent on Chinese diplomatic support and economic aid.  Park said in a meeting with hundreds of people of the Korean community in Shanghai that China's cooperation is very critical in bringing out changes in North Korea and in achieving unification with North Korea.  She also reaffirmed her stance that South Korea will sternly retaliate against North Korea, if provoked, but it will make efforts to continue dialogue and cooperation with North Korea.  The two Koreas have recently produced a deal that eased the tensions and paved the way for reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.

In South Korea, a new controversial bill is being introduced to prevent Korean parents from becoming modern-day King Lears, some of whom reportedly get abused or neglected by their adult children after handing down most of their wealth and possessions.The bill, which is being introduced by the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, gives Korean parents the right to sue their children in case of mistreatment and to return any gifts that were previously given to them. A total of 5,772 instances of elderly abuse took place in Korea last year, according to government data. (Yonhap)Under the current law, a donor may rescind a contract of gift if the recipient committed an act of crime against the donor, or if “the donee is under duty to support the donor but does not perform his duty.” However, the law also stipulates that rescission of a contract of gift does not have any effect once the gift has already been given to the donee. “The current Korean civil act contradicts itself,” said Choi Byoung-chun from the Institute for Democracy and Policies, a think tank for the NPAD. “While Article No. 556 says a donor can rescind a contract should there be a criminal offense against him or her, or the child does not perform his supporting duty, Article No. 558 -- which stipulates that rescission of a contract is invalid once the gift has already been handed over -- makes it impossible to retrieve any of the possessions regardless of the circumstances. Article No. 558 needs to go now.”The introduction of the bill, dubbed “Anti-bulhyo bill” -- “bulhyo” means mistreating one’s parents -- is seen as the NPAD’s calculative move to attract elderly voters for next year’s upcoming general election.The NPAD’s bill states that a parent has the right to sue their children in the event of any mistreatment, not only criminal activities, and have them to return gifts that were given to them in the past. The donee, once asked to return the gift, will have to give back the equivalent monetary value even if he or she has spent it all. While the move is laden with controversial aspects, such as the subjective view of filial duty and the legal intervention in parent-child relations, the government was also seen to be jumping on the bandwagon by reportedly pushing for its own version of law revision. According to the Welfare Ministry, a total of 5,772 instances of elderly abuse took place in Korea last year. Of the abusers, 51.1 percent were the victims’ adult children. The number of Korean parents suing their children for financial support more than doubled from 135 in 2004 to 262 last year. In some European countries, the laws guarantee the donor’s rights to reclaim their gifts should there be mistreatment by the donee. Germany’s Civil Code stipulates that “a donation may be revoked if the donee is guilty of ingratitude by serious wrongdoing to the donor or to a close relative of the donor.” The French Civil Code also says that an inter vivos gift may be revoked on account of ingratitude when the donee has made an attempt against the life of the donor, or he has been found guilty of cruelty, serious offenses or grievous insults against him, or when he refuses maintenance to him.“The current law allows ungrateful individuals to get away with their duties as scions after receiving gifts from their parents,” said Choi. “We’ve seen parents who gave their children almost all of their possessions, thinking the children would take care of and financially support them once receiving the gifts, only to find out they would not even speak to them on the phone.”However, some experts said the law revision won’t be able to tackle Korea’s high elderly poverty rate, which nearly reached 50 percent early this year. The revision can only benefit a small portion of the elderly population, said family law expert Choi In-hee from Korea Women’s Development Institute.“The number of elderly individuals who can actually afford to give gifts to their children is very small,” said Choi. “This means most elderly people can’t really benefit from this revision because they don’t have any gifts to give to begin with.”Choi said the government should share an individual or a family’s responsibility to take care and financially support the elderly member of the family. Under the current law, all adult Koreans are legally obligated to financially support their spouses, parents and parents-in-laws should they become unable to support themselves with their own financial resources of labor.The country’s destitute elderly individuals have been suffering from the particular laws, as the recipients of state welfare payments lose a portion or all of their allowance if any member of their immediate family -- a spouse, child or child-in-law -- has a regular monthly income, depending on how much they make.“This system is hard on both the parents and their children, especially if they are all low-income earners,” she said. “The point is to increase the government’s involvement in the caring and supporting of the elderly population.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","to prevent korean parents ,korean parents from becoming ,prevent korean parents from ,prevent korean parents ,his children who betray","['Shakespeare', 'South Korea', 'korean']",29,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.35980853  0.1687963

I wish to become a car engineer.”Bluntly praising one’s qualities and telling life experiences that do little to stress one’s abilities or academic prowess are only some of the pitfalls students can fall into while writing self-introductory essays, South Korean education firms that offer lessons on composing essays say.They offer a service that a growing number of students are turning to in their arduous struggle to enter college, as universities have begun placing more emphasis on test takers’ writing skills.Education authorities have been moving to highlight nonacademic aspects in the college admissions process as part of their efforts to alleviate the students from the burden of intense test competition.But a glaring problem with the new approach is that students have been left without any training from their earlier education in how to write such essays, leading to the bitter irony of some students plagiarizing other people’s life stories or getting private tutors to write their personal introductions. There have been complaints that Korea’s high school curriculum is overly focused on preparing for multiple-choice tests like school exams and the annual college entrance exam known here as the “Suneung.” In a hasty response to such criticism, the ministry revised the curriculum so that each high school student could select an essay class in school, starting last year.But with no formal textbooks developed by the government yet, essay-writing education is still predominantly conducted in the private sector. “Throughout my middle and high school days, I’ve never even learned how to write. Yet I suddenly have to write an essay about my life for college. So, naturally we have no choice but to turn to private education,” said a high school senior at a Seoul-based school.  Students and parents listen to a lecture by the Seoul Education Research and Information Institute on how to write self-introductory essays for college applications at Soongsil University in Seoul on Aug. 23. (Yonhap)Lee Man-gi, an official from local education firm Uway which offers lessons on how to write these essays, said a lack of storytelling ability causes many students to have trouble writing self-introductory essays.“There is a huge disparity among students’ ability levels to write, and they have trouble identifying which life experience is worth mentioning. This is what our institute instructs the students on” he said. In addition, he mentioned that the immense academic workload piled on students restricts them from having varied experiences outside of studying.“Their club activities, the books they’ve read. ... There isn’t too much discrepancy among Korean kids. Yet they have to write something that stands out. This is why they seek help,” he said. Meanwhile, the ability to write good essays is becoming more important.According to the 2016 college admissions guidelines announced by the Korean Council for University Education last month, the percentage of extraordinary admissions has increased in this year’s admissions process.Extraordinary admissions happen through a process conducted between August and October, basing the evaluations more on general schoolwork and extracurricular activities than the Suneung.In these admissions courses, self-introductory essays and interviews are an important part of the grading process. According to Rep. An Min-suk of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, there have been 7,623 cases of suspected plagiarism among self-introductory essays submitted in the admissions process for the 2015 school year. “Admissions fraud strips other people of their rightful opportunities, and must be severely dealt with,” said An, urging the authorities to crack down on students, teachers and anyone involved in such cheating.But according to Lee Seok-rok, an admissions officer for Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, the occurrence of plagiarism is actually trending down.In light of the rampant plagiarism of essays, the KCUE in 2012 announced guidelines for colleges to weed out copycats in the admissions process. Most major schools, including HUFS, adopted a system to identify similarities in essays to pick out those who copied and pasted others’ work. “I think more students are now worried that copying other’s essays will eliminate their chance of getting accepted at universities,” said Lee, pointing out that HUFS only had three cases of suspected plagiarism last year. Sungkyunkwan University, Korea University and Seoul National University had the most plagiarism cases of all universities with 541, 424 and 422, respectively.While less students are copying others’ work, more students are paying for the wisdom of others.A recent report by a local daily showed that university students who were accepted at top-tier universities via nonscheduled admissions often teach high schoolers how to write essays and do interviews. According to the report, one sold his self-introductory essay for 50,000 won ($42) to each student wanting to know his “secrets,” and was paid about 150,000 won per essay for correcting them.These lessons for self-introductory essays have formed a profitable market, with local private education firms offering classes as well. With so many students feeling clueless about how to effectively explain who they are, admissions officers advise them to just stick to the basics: persuade the reader why one needs to pick him or her. “School records just show results of students’ work. Self-introductory essays give students a chance to explain the process of their school lives, and allow them to explain why he or she belongs (at the university),” said HUFS’s Lee.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","car engineer bluntly praising ,essays south korean education ,very interested in cars ,interested in cars wish ,become car engineer bluntly",['south korean'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73600215  0.29087833

In late July, Korean Air purser Park Chang-jin lodged a suit against his former boss, Cho Hyun-ah, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for damages caused by the incident. Cho's legal team requested that the U.S. court dismiss the case, arguing that it should be handled by a court in South Korea, home to both the plaintiff and defendant, for practical reasons. Moreover, the legal team said that Park is fully capable of receiving compensation in his home country without having to reach out to overseas courts. ""(Park) has already demonstrated that it is possible for him to seek compensation in South Korea,"" one of Cho's legal representatives said, adding that Park is already taking time off from work after his case was recognized as an industrial accident last month by a local labor welfare agency. On Dec. 5, Cho forced a Korean Air flight departing from New York back to the gate because of the way her nuts were served -- in an unopened bag instead of on a plate -- and had Park disembark from the plane.The latest dismissal request is the second one filed by the former executive of Korean Air. Earlier in July, her legal team took similar countermeasures against a suit filed by another crew member to whom Cho had lashed out on during the in-flight commotion.Both plaintiffs are required to provide a response to the court by mid-September. In June, the Seoul High Court sentenced Cho to 10 months in prison but suspended the term for two years for changing the aircraft's flight route at the time when she forced Park off the plane. Prosecutors said they have submitted an appeal to have the court's decision reversed.

42,42,42,Drinking significant factor in domestic violence in South Korea,"When Lee Tae-ho, a social worker at the National Child Protection Agency, last year visited a 7-year-old at his home upon request from his school teacher, nothing seemed too out of place at first. 　“My mother drinks a lot of water when she’s eating,” the child told him about his single mother.　It didn’t take long for Lee to realize that the “water” was in fact the colorless Korean alcoholic beverage soju. 　U...","When Lee Tae-ho, a social worker at the National Child Protection Agency, last year visited a 7-year-old at his home upon request from his school teacher, nothing seemed too out of place at first. “My mother drinks a lot of water when she’s eating,” the child told him about his single mother.It didn’t take long for Lee to realize that the “water” was in fact the colorless Korean alcoholic beverage soju. Unemployed and depressed since her bitter divorce, the mother would drink about 20 bottles of soju a week, and would fail to provide basic care for her young children. The boy and his sister, 6, would skip dinner most days. A number of times, the suicidal mother asked them if it “would be better if they all killed themselves together.”As a social worker working for a state-run agency, Lee said he has personally witnessed many domestic violence abusers with drinking problems. Lee’s observation was demonstrated in a recent study, which found a significant connection between alcohol abuse and domestic and sexual violence in South Korea.  A recent study found a significant connection between alcohol abuse and domestic and sexual violence in South Korea. (123RF)The scholarly article from Dongguk University, which surveyed 4,851 arrested individuals for violent crimes last year, showed that 73.1 percent of the domestic violence abusers and 67.9 percent of sex offenders committed their offenses while under the influence of alcohol. While some say violent abusers with untreated alcoholism should face heavier punishment, others point out that those with low socioeconomic status are much more vulnerable to addiction and committing crimes, and therefore a stronger safety net is needed to tackle the issue in the long run. In 2009, a shocking case of child rape drove Korea into a fury when it was revealed that the assailant, a 57-year-old named Cho Doo-soon, was given 12 years in prison after damaging 80 percent of the young victim’s colon through his offense. That year, the court said Cho had “diminished capacity for his decisions” because he was drunk at the time of the offense, which weighed into the sentencing. The victim, who was 8 at the time of the incident in 2008, was also abducted and beaten by Cho before being raped. Cho had been unemployed and addicted to alcohol.Lee Won-jeong, a police officer who authored the study for Dongguk University, claimed that criminals should never be given reduced punishments for “being drunk” at the time of the offense. Instead, ex-convicts with a record of alcohol addiction who chose not to get the required medical treatment should face heavier penalties should they become second offenders, he wrote. “In order to do this, the police should establish a separate team that monitors all offenders with drinking problems, and that offers treatment options so they don’t repeat their mistakes again,” he wrote. Social worker Lee said most domestic violence cases against children he witnessed were triggered by marital problems and the financial problems of the parents. The abusive, alcoholic mother, for example, became depressed after her husband suddenly went missing. After the divorce, the unemployed mother relied on state subsidies given to destitute individuals who make less than the government-designated minimum cost of living. She soon started drinking alone at night. “She kept telling me that she no longer wants to live,” Lee said, “and that she can’t even kill herself because of her children. In many cases that I have seen, they had three signs before the abuse took place -- divorce, depression and alcoholism.”Studies have shown that Korean domestic abuse offenders with drinking problems tend to have low socioeconomic status. A 2012 research paper by the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation, which surveyed 142 domestic violence offenders with alcoholism, showed that 30 percent of them were unemployed while 43 percent were temporary workers on daily contracts. Almost 50 percent of them attended up to elementary or middle school. Meanwhile, 99.3 percent of them were men.Park Seong-su, a professor at Semyung University’s police administration program, said addiction can be more prone to affect people who are faced with overwhelming situations or unresolved emotions. “You need something to focus on in order to forget about whatever problems you have in your real life,” he said. “This can be common in people who are faced with financial hardships and a lack of support. Feelings of helplessness are what often cause depression, and depression often leads to addictions.”The study also found that 54.5 percent of the offenders had a father who also had drinking problems. Almost 55 percent of them said it’s their anger and distrust for their wives that led to their abusive behavior, while 23.9 percent said their low self-confidence triggered domestic abuse. Also, 21.8 percent cited stress as the main cause of their violence. Korea is notorious for its culture of binge drinking. In a report released last year by Euromonitor, a London-based market intelligence firm, Koreans were said to drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average, making them the heaviest drinkers in the world, beating out the Russians and Thais.Meanwhile, confirmed cases of child abuse in Korea jumped nearly 50 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being the parents. According to the latest data available from the Gender Equality Ministry, 46.1 percent of Korean parents abused their children at least once in 2013, and 45.5 percent of married Koreans were abused by their spouses in the same year. Social worker Lee said many children who have been abused by their parents often don’t want to be separated from their mothers and fathers in spite of the violence. “The child of the alcoholic mother in fact refused to speak further when I asked him more about his mother,” Lee said. “What is best for the children in abusive homes, I think, is to treat their parents and reunite them once they are healthy. What would be even better is to prevent addiction and other mental illnesses in socially and financially vulnerable homes.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","my mother drinks lot ,the colorless korean alcoholic ,first my mother drinks ,my mother drinks ,his single mother","['Lee Tae - ho', 'the National Child Protection Agency', 'Lee', 'korean']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80778027  0.41566664

Girls got 5.4 more points in standard scores in Korean Language type B category ― the Suneung math and Korean sections are conducted in two sets of tests, an easier type A and more difficult type B. Math type B, the only subject where boys outperformed girls in the 2013 Suneung, was also taken over by girls, although the disparity was the smallest among all subjects at 0.4.The data reflected the recent trend of female students outperforming their male counterparts in school work. (Yonhap)According to an analysis of the KICE’s evaluation on academic achievement of middle and high school students, girls had a profound lead in both Korean Language and English ― by 8.3 to 10.7 points ― while boys only had a minor advantage of 1.1 in high school math. “In secondary education, girls tend to be more diligent and hardworking than boys. They also pay more attention to detail, which helps because most of our exams are about getting the facts right,” said an English teacher at a Seoul-based middle school.A five-year analysis of the data also showed that the boys’ lead in the math category had consistently shrunk since recording 3 points average higher disparity in 2010, while girls maintained a steady lead in the two other categories. While girls generally did better than boys in recent Suneung exams, experts say that girls’ dominance in Math type B is likely to have been a result of authorities’ failure to balance out how difficult each subject is.For example, 4.3 percent of the students got the perfect score in Math type B, but only 0.09 percent aced the Korean Language type B. Based on the nine-level grading system, those who took Math B had to have scored perfect marks to be graded in the top level, as the test was relatively too easy.“Because last year’s Suneung had such easy math exams, boys had a harder time showing better grades on the test that failed to distinctively assess the students’ capacity,” said Yang Jung-ho, a professor of education at Sungkyunkwan University. Girls, on the other hand, had a significant advantage in doing well in what they already excelled in on the test that was much more difficult, he added.He pointed out that 4 percent of male students got the top rating in Math type B, while 1.9 percent of the female students garnered the top rating. In the case of both Math type A and B, more male students received the top rating than their female counterparts. In addition to gender disparity, there were also substantial differences in the performances of students from large cities and rural areas.In terms of standard scores, students from large cities ― those with a population of 500,000 or more ― scored as much as 11.6 points more than those from rural areas.Yang said this is because those living in metropolitan areas tend to have higher incomes as well as more access to private language education and information related to education, which allows them to be more committed to their children’s education than those in rural areas.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","college exam female students ,female students dominate college ,dominate college exam female ,exam female students who ,exam female students","['Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation', 'KICE', 'english']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43078327  0.29811519

The 89-year-old looks at it every day. It’s a reminder of who she is and where she comes from ― a member of a historic family that was behind Korea’s military activism against the Japanese rule.Oh’s family has an unparalleled iconic tale to tell when it comes to Korea’s fight for independence during the colonial rule that lasted from 1910-1945. Three generations of the family, including Oh’s mother, sister, and grandfather, devoted themselves into the cause, enduring years of financial hardship, relentless travel across China and sacrifice of personal happiness.Born in 1926 to Manchuria-based Korean activists and raised in multiple Chinese cities including Nanjing and Chongqing, Oh was separated from her father at age 10 when he was arrested by the Japanese while on a mission in Beijing. For the next 10 years, she and her two siblings were raised by their mother in China, assuming their father was probably dead. “We knew he spent three years in jail after he disappeared,” she said. “But we didn’t know what happened to him after that.” Independence activist Oh Hee-ock speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald. ( Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald)Oh’s mother, Jeong Jeong-san, was a fearless activist often dubbed a “woman warrior.” When they lived in Manchuria, she cultivated the wasteland on her own and started rice farming. Every day, she’d cook 12 bags of rice to feed soldiers of the Korean Liberation Army, in which her father-in-law, Oh In-soo, and husband, Oh Gwang-seon, played leading roles. Gwang-seon, in particular, was one of the closest aides of Kim Koo (1876-1949), the last Premier of the Provisional Government of Republic of Korea, a partially recognized Korean government-in-exile that was based in Shanghai and later in Chongqing during Japanese rule. Kim was also a leader of the Korean independence movement and became a reunification activist after 1945. One of the supporters of Kim and the Korean Liberation Army was Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975), the Chinese political and military leader who later became the first president of Taiwan. Oh and her sister were allowed to attend a school founded by Chiang in China when their mother could not afford to send them to school as a single parent. Jeong also encouraged her teenage daughters to become soldiers and fight against the Japanese. Oh was only 14 when she joined the army in Chongqing. “It just felt very natural for me and my sister,” Oh recalled. “We didn’t think not joining the army was an option.”While her sister, Hee-young, worked as an intelligence agent and was responsible of recruiting soldiers and plotting guerilla warfare along with Chinese activists, Oh spent most of her time organizing political campaigns against the Japanese authorities, engaging in a number of propaganda plays and musical performances. What gripped Oh and her colleagues in China was a heavy sense of loss. “We were on this mission together and the mission was about retrieving what was forcefully taken away from us ― our country,” she said.Oh and her family moved to Korea in 1946, a year after the country was liberated from Japan. They were soon reunited with their father in Incheon. He had been rescued by a Chinese family after being left in a remote wilderness by the Japanese, and worked in Manchuria on secret military missions.Yet the family faced more hardships in their home country, even after the Korean War (1950-1953). Oh is still particularly grief-stricken by her late sister’s life and how it ended. “My sister was such a gifted, eloquent and intelligent person. She spoke Chinese and English on top of Korean. She had so much to offer,” Oh said. “Our teachers always said she would make a great lawyer.”Unlike Oh, who managed to get a job as a teacher after moving to Korea, her sister didn’t get the same opportunity. Before moving to Korea, Hee-young married a fellow Korean activist, Shin Song-sik, in China in 1944, and had her first son shortly after. The son died as a child during the Korean War. She had six children after that. “She was too busy being a mother (to do anything else),” Oh said.Throughout her life, Hee-young suffered severe financial hardships, after Shin chose not to join the Korea Army Forces because his belief ― which had been based on activism for unification ― conflicted with South Korea’s anti-North Korean military agenda. He tried to start a business once, but it ended in bankruptcy after he was swindled out of his savings. Hee-young died in 1969 of cervical cancer. She was only 42. Shin died of lung cancer four years later. Their orphaned children were forced to part ways to support themselves, and only two of them managed to attend high school.It was in 1990 that Hee-young was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation for her work as an independence activist, along with other family members including Oh, her husband Shin, and her parents. “It really breaks my heart whenever I think about her,” Oh said.Oh’s father, on the other hand, was never promoted beyond colonel in the South Korean Army, in spite of his contributions during the colonial period. Being left out of the much-deserved promotion for 8 years also led to financial struggles for his family. He died in 1967 at age 71.“I heard that only the president can promote a colonel to a (general),” she said. “My father was a close aide of Kim Koo, who was the strongest political rival of Syngman Rhee, the first President of South Korea.”Oh said she still had conflicted feelings about her late father. He was a remarkable solider and a caring father, she recalled. He was ahead of his time and determined to educate his daughters. But he also caused Oh’s mother suffering by leaving her for 10 years ― albeit involuntarily ― and living with another woman and having children with her during that period. “Perhaps it’s better for an activist with a big purpose to not marry at all,” she said. “I don’t think you can do both; serve your country and supporting your family at the same time.”Her mother, who spent most of her later life alone until her death in 1992, also suffered from financial hardships. “I could not visit her very often because I had to take care of my own grandchildren,” she said. “Once she visited me at my house, and asked if I had any money to support her. She had to rely on a stick to walk at the time but still came all the way to see me. That day I had no money to give her and she had to leave the house empty handed. I still think about that day and I still wish I could have helped her. I think about it over and over again.”After all these years, Oh, who is the sole survivor of her family, wishes to see the reunification of the two Koreas. Just like Kim Koo, her father had fiercely opposed the establishment of separate governments in North and South Korea after Korean liberation. The division was a loss of the country that Oh and her family had so desperately envisioned.“My family’s efforts were for a liberated Korea, not a divided one,” she said. Oh still clearly remembers the lyrics of a song which she often sang with her sister and fellow soldiers in China as a young activist. The song was written by composer Lee Si-woo in 1935, inspired by a real-life story of a woman whose husband was killed by the Japanese after crossing the Tumen River to campaign in China for Korean independence. “There is a boatman rowing on the blue Tumen River,” the song goes.“My love once took a boat and years flew by. Where was my love heading? My love, when are you returning to me?”By Claire Lee(dyc@heraldcorp.com)","fighter recounts family struggle ,late mother and sister ,comes to korea fight ,independence fighter recounts family ,mother and sister the","['Suwon', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Korea', 'japanese', 'Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42828527  0.28776854

""Still, Lee conveyed the message that the Koreas need to talk and cooperate with each other, and I think that alone is a major accomplishment.""The official said there were ""many reasons"" that the meeting never materialized but declined to specify further.The official also thanked his North Korean counterparts for hosting Lee and her delegation. When the South Koreans arrived at Sunan International Airport in Pyongyang, they were escorted through the special gate reserved for VIPs, and an ambulance was also handy in case the elderly ex-first lady became sick.""Lee had lunch with her family after coming home and is now staying at her home,"" the official added. ""She had a busy schedule, but she's doing well.""The South Korean government, which had insisted that Lee was traveling in a personal capacity and didn't ask her to deliver any government message, has faced some criticism that it didn't try hard enough to make the Lee-Kim talks happen.A Unification Ministry official, however, countered on Sunday that it was Pyongyang that didn't seem interested in such a meeting in the first place.""Contrary to our expectations here, North Korea might not have given any thought to Kim's meeting with Lee from the beginning,""the ministry official said. ""From the preparatory stages (of the trip), North Korea didn't take much initiative. If we had asked Lee to deliver our message, it would have put a burden on North Korea and set us up for a major disappointment if the talks didn't take place.""Another government official said: ""It's not appropriate to measure the success of Lee's visit just on whether she met Kim Jong-un. If anything, it takes away from the significance of her trip.""

48,48,48,S. Korea’s job training program for women expands in Vietnam,"Last year, Lee Ji-hyang, a South Korean manicurist, flew to Vietnam for a new challenge. She signed up to teach women job seekers in Quang Nam, a province in Vietnam’s South Central Coast region, as part of Korea’s assistance program for developing countries.“I trained about 40 women who wished to be manicurists for about a month,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “I had an interpreter with me throughout all of the cl...","Last year, Lee Ji-hyang, a South Korean manicurist, flew to Vietnam for a new challenge. She signed up to teach women job seekers in Quang Nam, a province in Vietnam’s South Central Coast region, as part of Korea’s assistance program for developing countries.“I trained about 40 women who wished to be manicurists for about a month,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “I had an interpreter with me throughout all of the classes, but sometimes I didn’t really need to explain anything verbally because they already knew what to do. They were all very determined.”Ironically, labor policies for women hasn’t been Seoul’s forte; Korea has the highest wage gap by gender among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. The employment rate for women in Korea in 2013, which stood at 53.9 percent, was in fact much lower than that in Vietnam in the same year -- 72 percent. According to a report last year by the World Economic Forum, Korea ranked 117th out of 142 countries on gender parity, below all of the OECD nations except Turkey.   Vietnamese female job seekers learn makeup skills in a job training center run and financed by Korea’s Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family). Regardless, its gender equality project in Vietnam -- which mainly consists of offering job training programs for unemployed women -- has benefitted some 2,972 Vietnamese women since 2011 in hopes of offering more specialized fields of jobs. Among the women who received free job training, 1,239 were employed as manicurists, makeup artists and even started their own businesses as handicraft artists. “The second largest number of women immigrants residing in Korea are from Vietnam, following those from China,” said Oh Min-ok from the ministry in Seoul. “This certainly has played as one of the factors when we made our decision to launch this project there.”Korea’s Gender Equality Ministry currently runs and supports three job training centers in three different regions in Vietnam -- Quang Nam, Thai Binh and Can Tho. Starting this August, the centers are introducing new classes with different skills, including graphic design, retail strategy and cleaning. Textbooks gathering the centers’ four years of work will be published as well. All of the courses are either taught by Koreans who are experts in the specific job skills, including makeup or nail care, or locals who have been trained by Koreans to teach the classes. “All of the three centers are located in relatively remote regions. We are dealing with women who are not living in the cities and don’t have a lot of resources when seeking employment,” said Huh Hye-young, who currently works in Vietnam at the centers. She has been serving there since 2012.“Many of them work in farms owned by their families, but they are often out of work when there is no help needed. The purpose is to train them with skills that can eventually lead to possible employment, regardless of where they live.”One of the most popular classes has been nail art training. Because of Vietnam’s warm weather, manicure and pedicure services are becoming increasingly popular in the country, according to Huh. Although all of the training programs offered at the centers are free, not everyone who wishes to participate can take the classes. Every applicant has to go through an interview process in order to be selected. “Once, too many applied to take classes on nail art, so only about 50 percent of those who signed up were selected to participate,” said Huh.In spite of its high labor force participation rate of women, Vietnam was one of the few countries in the world where the gender pay gap actually widened in 2012-2013, according to International Labor Organization reports. Korea’s gender pay gap also still stands high, higher than the one in Vietnam. Korean women were paid 37.4 percent less than their male counterparts in 2012, while Vietnamese women made about 20 to 30 percent less than men in 2013.Studies by the World Bank show that women’s high employment participation in lower income countries derives from the fact that individuals cannot survive without working. The quality of the women’s work, therefore, usually remains poor, as they are often hired by their own family members for agricultural work, and are often unpaid for their labor.On the other hand, the reports pointed out that developed nations with high labor participation rate of women have extensive social protection coverage and are societies where part-time work is possible and accepted. Korea is also striving to reach such a level, as the country is still without a state-run unemployment assistance program and has among the longest work hours of the OECD nations. Most temporary workers are also not entitled to full-time benefits.Manicurist Lee said skills are what can lead to a woman’s independence, which also leads to dignity. Among students at the centers was Nguyen Thi Thau, a 29-year-old with a speech impairment, who had been struggling with job prospects because of her disability. After completing her courses in nail art, which she excelled in, she was soon hired by a local beauty salon.“Many of the women I taught are also working as home-visiting manicurists,” she said. “When you have the skills you need, you can still work even if you don’t have the money to start your own salon, or be employed by someone else. It gives you something that you can start with, even if you don’t have a lot of resources or opportunities. Then you don’t need to rely on somebody else. That’s why I found my experience in Vietnam rewarding.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","women expands in vietnam ,teach women job seekers ,trained about 40 women ,40 women who wished ,women job seekers","['Lee Ji - hyang', 'south korean', 'Vietnam', 'Quang Nam', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'the Korea Herald']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48804989  0.14415017

During her tearful meeting with the police, she confessed to committing the crime out of anger, as her husband had recently left her following a series of fights over child care. She had been on medication for severe postpartum depression. “The initial plan was to kill myself,” the mother told the police. “But I was afraid that my son would lead a miserable life without his mom. I was going to commit suicide after ending his life, but I became scared (to end my own life) after he died.”The tragedy is just one of the dramatically increasing number of child abuse cases in South Korea. According to the latest data released by the Welfare Ministry on Thursday, the number of child abuse cases increased by 50 percent in 2014 from the year before, with more than 80 percent of the abusers being parents. The number of child abuse cases increased by 50 percent in Korea in 2014 from the year before, with more than 80 percent of the abusers being parents. (123RF)This means 1.10 in every 1,000 Korean children was abused at least once last year, while only 0.73 in every 1,000 children experienced the same in 2013. Last year alone, 15,025 suspected cases were reported. Among them, 10,027 were confirmed as child abuse violations.The study showed that the largest number of cases, or 48 percent, involved more than one type of abuse, including physical abuse. The second most common type of abuse at 18.6 percent was child neglect, which is a pattern of failing to provide for a child’s basic needs -- including food, hygiene and clothing. About 15 percent of the cases involved emotional abuse, while 14.5 percent consisted of physical violence.Among the 10,027 confirmed abusers, 8,207 were the victims’ parents. The largest number of cases, 33 percent, were caused by the parents’ “lack of knowledge and skills in child care,” such as not being able to differentiate abuse and discipline. Twenty percent of the cases were triggered by the parents’ social isolation, as well as their stress stemming from financial difficulties. Ten percent of the abusers had conflicts with either their spouse or other family members. Also, the majority of the abusers, 32.4 percent, were unemployed. “Child abuse cases has been hard to crack down because it happens behind closed doors in the ‘private’ sphere,” said Lee Tae-ho from the National Child Protection Agency.“It is still viewed by many (Koreans) as a private family matter that need not involve the criminal justice system.” One of the child abuse victims Lee encountered had bruises all over her body when she was reported by her school teacher. Trying to hide her scars and bruises, the middle school student would always wear thick, black tights even in summer. Her parents would hit her whenever she didn’t meet her curfew, or did not dress “appropriately” for her age.When Lee visited the victim’s home to speak with her parents, they told him, “Who do you think you are to interfere with our private lives? We disciplined her because she’s ours and we love her so much. What more do you need?”Her father also told Lee that he, too, had been “disciplined” the same way by his parents when he was a child, and that he didn’t think ”there was anything wrong” with it.“There is still a general perception (in Korea) that a parent knows about his or her child the best, and that children are possessions or properties of their parents (rather than independent beings),” Lee said. “Korean culture (which emphasizes hierarchy and respect for the elders), has long favored parental rights over children’s rights. “The number of child abuse cases are increasing partly because more people are acknowledging what it is and report whenever they witness the victims or abusers.”Among the 10,027 young Korean victims, 14.6 percent of them were infants aged 0-3. The report by the Health Ministry said being exposed to abuse during the first four years of one’s life can be particularly dangerous, and it can severely damage a child’s social development and leave lifelong psychological scars. Abusive or neglectful behavior toward infants include limited physical contact with the child -- such as no kisses or hugs or other signs of affection -- and failing to bathe or feed the baby regularly. “As abused children cannot express emotions safely, adult survivors of this abuse can struggle with anger and have a difficulty maintaining relationships,” the report said. “It is necessary to make it mandatory for all parents with young infants to receive education on parenting, and for all medical institutions and health care workers to check for signs of child abuse when they receive children patients for regular health check-ups.”Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who are financially struggling or having marriage stress have a higher chance of abusing -- or neglecting -- their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University.Along with stress, social isolation of a parent because of having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization. Lee from the National Child Protection Agency said family preservation and therapy for both abusers and victims are as important as seeking justice for the damage done to children. “The issue cannot be stopped by just punishing the abusers,” he said. “In the long term, the government should make efforts to eliminate risk factors for child abuse, such as parental stress or financial difficulties. Welfare programs as well as psychological therapy are both needed in order to establish this.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","during her tearful meeting ,strangling her year old ,old mother was arrested ,anger as her husband ,arrested for running away","['Cheongju', 'North Chungcheong Province']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41790232  0.23044445

""I am sorry to the people for causing worries and discomfort,"" Hwang said, asking the people to return to their normal daily lives. (Yonhap)The prime minister also offered an apology for the country's poor early response to the outbreak of the disease.The government came under criticism that it had failed to bring the disease under control at an early date since the first outbreak was reported on May 26. Hwang also vowed to swiftly execute a supplementary budget bill that was passed through the National Assembly on Friday.After a three-week tug-of-war between the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament gave the nod to the 11.6 trillion-won ($9.9 billion) extra budget to cope with fallout from MERS, which has had a negative impact on Asia's fourth-largest economy. With the declaration, the government said it will scale down its temporary disease control center that was set up to deal with the MERS outbreak.However, it will continue to maintain a high level of watch against any new cases, the health ministry said.Monitoring efforts will include scanning all passengers for fever at the country's major airports and ports.The outbreak was also expected to change the way the country deals with infectious diseases in the future.Already, the government has given all medical institutions access to the so-called drug utilization review system, which the health insurance review agency used to determine any abuse or misuse of medicine. It can also provide information about a patient's previous conditions and possible exposure to any infectious diseases.The move comes as the country's first MERS patient, a 68-year-old male, has been partly blamed for the spread of the disease here. The man had failed to mention his trip to the Middle East, where he supposedly caught the MERS coronavirus, as well as his previous visits to other hospitals, apparently exposing tens of others to the disease.The health ministry said additional and more detailed steps to deal with infectious diseases in the future will likely be announced next month.

Led by Rep. Kang Chang-hee of the ruling Saenuri Party, the visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier initiated their three-day layover here, designed to display South Korea’s appreciation for Russia’s immense sacrifice and contribution during the six-year conflict, organizers said. The event came shortly after they arrived in the Russian capital 12 days after departing from Seoul, and before heading to Berlin via Warsaw on the Eurail.Earlier in the day, the participants celebrated their finish of the Trans-Siberian Railroad linking Vladivostok and Moscow, with the welcome from another some 250 people of Russia’s foreign and rail agencies and city government and others. “The ‘Eurasia Express’ has great meaning as it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between South Korea and Russia, as well as the 70th anniversary of Russia’s victory in World War II,” said Vladimir Yakunin, president of Russian Railways, at the ceremony.Seoul’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yong said the project will help remake the country into a peninsula, not an island disconnected from the continent due to the territorial division with North Korea. “It will reconnect South Korea as a peninsula, and the peninsula as a region, which bridges Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific. The railway marks a first step, not an end, that has such a significant meaning,” he said in his congratulatory remarks. By Shin Hyon-hee Korea Herald correspondent(heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","fallen wwii soldiers moscow ,to fallen wwii soldiers ,fallen wwii soldiers ,fallen soldiers during world ,wwii soldiers moscow more","['MOSCOW', 'Eurasia Express', 'Moscow', 'trans - siberian', 'Kang Chang - hee', 'Saenuri Party']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8471027   0.50994307

He has just finished his second internship at a big firm, with no full-time job lined up. Park, who holds a double degree in business and international relations, has applied to about 60 companies since January, but was only interviewed by three firms that eventually did not offer him any positions.“I spent an extra year after graduating high school to write my college entrance exam again, and I spent two years in the military,” Park told The Korea Herald. “I also took a year or two during my university years to travel the world and study for the bar exam, which I eventually gave up. I regret taking those years off now because I feel I’m falling behind everyone else.”Park is one of some 410,000 young South Koreans in their 20s who are not in school and out of work as of June this year, according to Statistics Korea on Sunday.  Young Koreans in Seoul protest against the government’s labor policies for the nation’s youth population, using a large, gold-colored spoon to criticize politicians and businessmen with prosperous backgrounds and therefore ""never experienced the difficulties faced by young job seekers today.” In the Korean language, someone born into a wealthy family is said to have “been born with a gold spoon in his or her mouth.” (Yonhap)The nation’s youth unemployment reached the highest this year since 2000, raising serious concerns about the government’s labor policies especially for the country’s younger population, as well as the limited job security among young contract workers. The number of unemployed young Koreans, which stood at 330,000 back in 2013, rose to 380,000 last year, and reached 410,000 in the first half of this year. This is the second consecutive year for the youth unemployment rate to peak since 2000 -- when the country was still reeling from the aftermaths of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The statistics show that the government’s efforts to tackle youth unemployment have not been effective so far. The Ministry of Labor and Employment allocated 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) this year for projects to combat youth unemployment, with some 40 policies -- including special programs for those who wish to seek employment overseas and free mentorship service -- specifically aiming to support young job seekers. In an effort to fight the low employment among the younger people, the ministry even formed a special task force in June to help them find positions or opportunities that match their skills or draw on their formal job training or education. Kim Soo-hyun, a researcher at the Seoul Institute, said the Asian financial crisis had a long-lasting impact on Korea’s job market. “As the market became unpredictable after the crisis, more companies preferred to hire contract workers with previous job experience over young, full-time workers for entry positions, who are difficult to dismiss even if the business goes down,” he wrote in his study on youth unemployment published last year.Kim Gwang-seok, a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute, also said the lack of full-time positions among young workers is linked to the high youth unemployment rate. According to Statistics Korea, 34.8 percent of Koreans aged 15-29 started their career with a contractual position as of May, meaning one-third of young Koreans participate in the workforce for the first time with a limited job security. Among them, 19.6 percent said their first job’s contract was less than a year.Part-time job opportunities have worked to spike the employment rate for the time being.According to the statistics, the number of Koreans in their 20s who were newly employed in fact increased by 56,000 last year from 2013.But according to lawmaker Chung Se-kyun from the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the situation poses a more long-term problem on the whole, saying that the number of young Koreans aged 15-29 who are out of work would reach 1.16 million, if the statistics include those who “gave up” work, and those who are not actively seeking employment at all. Researcher Kim had a similar outlook. “If the number of contract positions increase while the full-time positions don’t, it will eventually increase the unemployment rate later on. “It’s because once the contract ends, the worker has to endure another period of unemployment until he or she finds a job,” Kim said.Seoul Institute’s Kim echoed the concerns. “Increasing number of contract jobs may raise the employment rate temporarily,” he wrote. “But in the long run, it can’t really be a solution to the essence of the problem. The limited job security among the young population is linked to many other social problems, including the rise of single households and low fertility rate.”Kim also suggested regulating the nation’s work hours -- it’s the longest among the OECD nations -- and introducing a state-run unemployment assistance program, which is currently nonexistent in Korea, could help tackle the problem. A separate survey by Statistics Korea also showed last week that a majority of the jobseekers tend to concentrate on similar positions.According to the survey, a total of 633,000 aged between 15 and 29 as of May this year were preparing for jobs. Of them, 34.9 percent said they were getting ready to become public servants, a rise of 6.9 percentage points from the previous year.Only 18.9 percent said they were looking for jobs in companies, meaning less than two out of 10 youths were willing to enter the business sector.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","finished his second internship ,his second internship ,year old university graduate ,his second internship at ,second internship at big",['Park Jin - hyung'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38804799  0.50565553

(Yonhap)The suspect has flatly denied the police’s accusation, repeating that she does not know about the case. The suspect, only identified by her surname Park, was at the scene, but didn’t call the police when she saw her neighbors collapsing after sipping the toxic drink, according to investigators. The North Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency probing the case on Friday afternoon detained her and charged her with murder.The six seniors lost consciousness while foaming at the mouth and were immediately taken to hospital for treatment after sharing the soft drink which was later found to contain insecticide. Two died and four others fell into critical condition. One woman later regained consciousness. Park became a key suspect after investigators found a capless bottle of a health drink containing insecticide, the same substance used in the poisoned soda, at her residence on Friday.Police also found other bottles of the same drink inside her residence that had the same expiry date as the health drink containing the toxic substance. The 1.5-liter soda bottle shared by the neighbors had a cap from the health drink on it, raising suspicions that Park had put the insecticide in the soda bottle but mistakenly changed the lid.Adding to suspicions, Park was the only one who didn’t drink the contaminated soda at the time, according to the police. When her neighbor offered her the soda, Park refused, saying that she was already full. Police secured other evidence through the National Forensic Service that detected the pesticide in the suspect’s clothes and the handlebars of her electronic scooter. The suspect, meanwhile, reiterated that she was being framed by someone else who put the contaminated bottle near her house. A motive for the suspected murder has not yet been made known, but the police said she might have had a grudge against one of the victims. Investigators have tried to give Park a lie detector test. But the suspect refused, asserting her innocence, they added. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","elderly woman in poisoning ,poisoning her six neighbors ,drink containing pesticide tuesday ,woman in poisoning case ,containing pesticide tuesday during",['the Daegu District Court'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47757402  0.01386314

The total number of people diagnosed with MERS in South Korea remained unchanged at 186.   Ministry officials said the country may be able to declare an end to the MERS outbreak if it continues to see no new infections.   However, over 560 people still remain in isolation as suspected cases following possible exposure to the MERS coronavirus.   Since the country reported its first case on May 20, nearly 16,700 people have been in isolation for possible infections. So far, 16,102 of them have been released after showing no symptoms of MERS for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days for the disease.   Out of those diagnosed, 125 have been discharged from hospitals following complete recoveries.The remaining 26 were still hospitalized as of early Friday, according to the ministry.    Authorities, meanwhile, said as of midnight, KyungHee University Hospital in Gangdong, southeastern Seoul, will be allowed to resume normal operations after no new MERS cases have been reported there in the past two weeks. Several hospitals around the country were ordered to partially suspend treatment or were closed outright, after multiple cases of MERS were reported among patients and visitors. Restrictions on most have since been lifted.   MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is still fairly new to humans. The disease has claimed over 530 lives globally, posting a fatality rate of over 36 percent.   In South Korea, the fatality rate remains at 19.3 percent, with most people succumbing to MERS having underlying medical conditions.   There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease that was first reported only in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.

The family members want compensation for physical and mental damages caused by the virus outbreak, said the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice, a Seoul-based advocacy group for citizens’ rights. It is the first legal case being filed by virus victims’ family members.The plaintiffs claimed that the government and hospitals failed to block the spread of the virus and kept crucial information on MERS patients confidential, all while being aware that MERS was infectious. The government also violated its duty to protect the public from the danger, they added. “The MERS crisis clearly proves that the state’s epidemic control system and the private hospital management system have collapsed,” said CCEJ Secretary General Ko Gye-hyun. “I hope the lawsuit not only protects the victims' rights, but also tightens the government’s responsibility for health and antivirus measures.” The 173rd patient, who contracted the virus from the 76th patient in a hospital in the eastern capital, died two days after she was officially diagnosed with MERS. “If the quarantine system was well prepared, there wouldn’t have been a super-spreader and my mother wouldn't have to get infected,” said the son of the 173rd patient in the press conference Thursday.The bereaved family members of the 173rd patient and 45th patient will seek 100 million won ($88,000) and 300 million won in compensation, respectively, the civic group said. The quarantined family members will seek 6.7 million won in compensation. The amounts to be compensated were determined based on the actual income of the victims, it added. The CCEJ said it would consider filing additional compensation suits as more requests were submitted from those affected by the MERS crisis. The Welfare Ministry said that it does not have any particular subsidy plans for the MERS victims, aside from 13 million won of financial support for funerals and cremations. As of Friday afternoon, no additional cases of MERS had been reported for five consecutive days, keeping the number of confirmed cases at 186.

Myohyang in North Pyongan Province, north of Pyongyang.Lee's planned visit has won much attention amid high prospects that she may meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.But Kim said nothing has been decided over whether Lee could meet with the North's leader.The North proposed that the ex-first lady arrive in the country by plane in consideration of her age and health conditions, he added.The planned visit comes amid chilled inter-Korean ties as the North has sharpened its verbal attacks against the South following the opening of a U.N. field office in Seoul tasked with monitoring Pyongyang's dismal human rights records.The North warned that Seoul will face catastrophic fallout in inter-Korean ties due to the U.N. move.Lee's late husband was the architect of the ""sunshine"" policy that actively pushed cross-border exchanges and reconciliation. He held the first inter-Korean summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2000.Lee first expressed her wish to visit the North last October to provide knit hats, scarves and clothes to North Korean children, but she had to postpone her trip due to cold winter weather.She sent a wreath of flowers in December last year to the North to mark the third anniversary of the death of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il. In response, the North's young leader said in a letter that he was ""looking forward to having Lee in Pyongyang once the weather got warmer in 2015.""In April, the peace center made a request for a prior contact over Lee's visit, but the North rejected it, citing ""complex inter-Korean circumstances.""

Her death came 12 days after another victim died on June 24.Choi Geum-seon, who had been suffering from sepsis and pneumonia since 2012, died at Shinhwa Hospital in Yeongdeongpo, Seoul, Sunday. She was 89.Born in Pyongyang in 1925, Choi was kidnapped while she was on her way to visit her friend’s house in her hometown at age 16 in 1941. She was eventually sent to Harbin, China, to work as a sex slave for Japanese soldiers who were stationed there.   Choi Geum-seon, another South Korean victim of Japan’s sex slavery during World War II, died Sunday. (Yonhap)She eventually escaped after being enslaved for about a year and returned to Pyongyang. But she chose not to return to her family as she was afraid of being caught by the Japanese again. Instead Choi moved to Gyeomipo, which has since been renamed to Songnim in today’s North Hwanghae Province of North Korea, to work as a waitress at a cafe. It was in Gyeomipo where she met her future husband. She married him in 1944, six years before the Korean War began, and moved to Seoul with him in the same year. Choi is survived by her husband and their adopted daughter, according to the Gender Equality Ministry.Choi is the seventh South Korean victim of Japan’s wartime sex slavery to die this year. Last month, Kim Youn-hee, another victim who was forced to work as a sex worker in Japan, died of old age at 83. Scholars estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and China, were forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II.

Her husband was confirmed to have caught the disease on June 12, and was discharged Thursday after making a full recovery.According to the officials, the woman began showing her first symptom, a fever, on Thursday, 21 days after being isolated from her husband on June 11. The disease was thought to have a maximum dormancy period of 14 days. After her husband was confirmed to have been infected, she was quarantined but was released after 14 days.“It is likely she acquired the virus from her husband, and the symptoms belatedly showed up after her cancer treatment compromised her immune system,” Jeong Eun-gyeong of the MERS special response team said. If this is the case, the disease would have manifested about a week after the accepted maximum incubation period. While there have been similar cases of belated symptoms, the authorities have maintained that there is no evidence that the state-approved incubation period is inaccurate, and the patients are likely to have been belatedly diagnosed. But the three-week gap between her husband’s isolation and the manifestation of her symptoms raised the possibility that she may have been infected by MERS at Samsung Medical Center in Gangnam district, southern Seoul. Last Monday, she visited the Samsung hospital to receive cancer treatment, three days before first expressing symptoms.“We believe there is no possibility that patient No. 186 was exposed to medical staff infected with MERS. ... We are conducting further investigation on (her being infected via) other medical staff or patients, but such a possibility is low, for now,” Jeong said.If the latest patient turns out to have been infected at SMC, she will be the 91st person to have been infected at the facility. The hospital ― considered among the best in the country ― has accounted for nearly half of the 186 MERS cases in the country.As of Sunday, 15 of 16 MERS patients that were being treated at the facility had been transferred to other hospitals, and one was discharged after making a full recovery.Jeong explained that the extensive number of hospital medical staff who were exposed to MERS patients, and subsequently removed from duty, overburdened the remaining staff. As of Sunday, 12 members of the SMC staff were infected, while over 900 were being tested for infection. While the authorities did not say that the latest measure was intended to penalize SMC, it effectively removed the hospital from the frontlines of the MERS outbreak. The recent MERS outbreak has put the hospital’s capacity to deal with infectious diseases into question. The hospital was recently revealed to have failed to supply its staff with sufficient protective gear to, which is required in the handling of infectious diseases.As of Sunday, 37 of the 186 patients diagnosed with MERS had been hospitalized, with 12 in an unstable condition. Another 116 have fully recovered and been discharged. The MERS death toll stood at 33 for the fifth straight day.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn urged the Health Ministry to swiftly provide financial support for hospitals who have suffered from the MERS outbreak. The government on Saturday announced it would allocate 16 billion won ($14.2 million) to support the hospitals.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","year old cancer patient ,50 year old cancer ,saturday is the wife ,old cancer patient who ,year old cancer",['south korean'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.07507288  0.69776493

A list of the MERS-affected hospitals is daily updated and available on the ministry's website.  Meanwhile, the health ministry said another nurse at the Samsung hospital has tested positive in an initial test.  The person's diagnosis is pending on the outcome of a second test, which is expected later in the day, according to ministry officials.  In addition to those diagnosed, 2,238 people are currently in isolation as of Thursday for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients.  The number dropped from 2,451 on the previous day. So far, some 13,821 others have been subject to isolation as suspected cases.Those subject to isolation are released after they show no symptoms of MERS for more than the known maximum incubation period of 14 days and test negative for the disease.  MERS is a viral respiratory disease whose symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. It had claimed over 400 lives throughout the country since it was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.  The fatality rate of the disease had been tallied at above 40 percent until the outbreak here, but in South Korea the fatality rate remains at around 18 percent.

Nine years later, the president of Busan Port Authority, Lim Ki-tack, has been elected to head the United Nations maritime body. Lim Ki-tack (Yonhap)The 58-year-old veteran is the first South Korean to take the secretary-general position of the International Maritime Organization, the U.N. agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution.“I first will take on my role to seek healthy growth of the world’s marine industry and set rules as the head of an U.N. organization,” Lim said.On Tuesday, Lim was chosen in a secret ballot vote of the 40-member IMO Council. He beat out five other candidates, from Cyprus, Russia, the Philippines, Denmark and Kenya, for the position.Lim’s four-year term will start on Jan. 1 and run until 2020, replacing incumbent Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu.Lim has nearly four decades of experience in the maritime industry and began attending IMO meetings as part of the South Korean delegation in 1986. He was named the chairman of the Subcommittee on Flag State Implementation from 2002 to 2004. Lim served a three-year tenure as the deputy permanent representative to the IMO starting in 2006. While serving in this capacity, he was in charge of all IMO work for South Korea.Headquartered in London, the IMO’s primary purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory framework for shipping with 171 member states and three associate members. South Korea joined the organization in 1962. Its areas of work include safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical cooperation, maritime security and the efficiency of shipping.South Korea has been consolidating its position as the world’s biggest shipbuilder, making the IMO’s influence on the country inevitable. “As the world‘s No. 1 country in shipbuilding and No. 5 in shipping, South Korea has been fostering the maritime industry under the IMO’s international standards,” Lim said. For instance, South Korean shipbuilding companies benefited from the IMO’s new rule introducing double-hull requirements for oil tankers, as they received a great number of orders for new tankers. IMO is the source of approximately 60 legal instruments that guide the regulatory development of its member states to improve safety at sea, facilitate trade among seafaring states and protect the maritime environment. It also adopted some 1,800 resolutions. “I plan to expand South Korea’s role in the international maritime realm and foster the country’s global reputation and its economy,” Lim said.

A similar visit is expected to be made soon for talks on the itinerary.  The ministry said in a report to the National Assembly that it plans to closely cooperate with the Kim Dae-jung Peace Center to make Lee's envisioned visit a success.  ""The government plans to provide necessary support for the visit,"" the report showed.  North Korea has intensified its verbal attacks against South Korea following the United Nations' establishment of a field office tasked with monitoring the North's dismal human rights situation. Pyongyang has said Seoul will face catastrophic fallout in inter-Korean ties due to the office opening.  Touching on inter-Korean cooperation, the ministry said it plans to propose a pilot run of a train that would travel along railways that link the two Koreas if talks between the two sides are resumed.  Seoul plans to restore the section of a disconnected inter-Korean railroad on its soil by 2017. The move is part of its ambitious goal to re-connect the Gyeongwon Line that once ran from central Seoul to the North Korean eastern city of Wonsan before the Korean Peninsula was divided 70 years ago.  South Korea hopes to eventually link its rail network to Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway via North Korea under President Park Geun-hye's Eurasia initiative that calls for logistics development among Eurasian nations by linking their railroads.

Two more patients have been discharged from hospitals, raising the number of recovered patients to 93. This means more than half of all infected individuals have regained their health so far in Korea. No additional deaths were reported Monday.The nation’s index MERS patient, who was officially diagnosed on May 20 after visiting three different hospitals prior to his diagnosis at the Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul, was also released from the quarantine facility Monday. It is believed that he spread the virus to some 30 others. The 68-year-old is currently being treated at a general medical facility.  A health care worker at Hallym University Medical Center, one of MERS-affected hospitals in Seoul, is taking a break after caring for MERS patients on Monday. (Yonhap)While the outbreak is once again showing signs of losing steam -- only three cases have been reported from June 24 through Monday, while 13 cases had been confirmed from June 20-23 -- the government announced a set of new preventive measures to deal with infectious diseases in the future. The Health Ministry is to expand the coverage of national health insurance for patients with infectious diseases, as well as those who are required to be isolated with negative room pressure in hospitals. The cost of installing the negative room pressure system will also be covered by the state-run health insurance, said Kwon Deok-cheol, a senior official at the Health Ministry’s MERS response headquarters. Negative air pressure rooms require a quarantine technique that prevents cross-contamination from room to room in medical facilities. It requires using a special ventilation system that produces negative pressure to make sure air flows into the isolation room but does not escape from the room. The system is normally used to quarantine patients with airborne contagious diseases including tuberculosis, and has been used to isolate confirmed MERS patients in Korea since last month.“It costs a lot to install negative air pressure rooms, and it also costs a lot to maintain them in good condition,” said Kwon. “Through this MERS outbreak we’ve realized that there is a severe shortage of negative pressure rooms nationwide and many of the already-existing ones haven’t been maintained properly. Starting very soon, the cost of installing and maintaining the system will be covered by the health insurance.”Kwon also said that all hospitals soon will be required to separate their emergency care units and special properties for patients who need to be isolated. All medical facilities will also be regularly evaluated on their safety practices on patients with contagious diseases. Hospitals will earn incentives or penalties according to their evaluation results, Kwon said.“All of the new preventive measures are to be finalized and confirmed in July,” said Jeong Eun-kyung from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. “We plan to support MERS-affected hospitals that have been shut down first. We may allocate more budget to help more hospitals in the future.”Some 90 medical facilities nationwide, including the Samsung Medical Center, have been affected by the outbreak. Some hospitals are still being monitored as potential MERS patients remain in their incubation period. More cases may be identified from these facilities, authorities said. The incubation period for those who were exposed to the virus at Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul ends on July 6. The Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, where about 90 patients with kidney diseases are currently being treated in isolation, will be monitored until July 10.  By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","monday afternoon the virus ,virus has killed 32 ,billion won 14 million ,killed 32 and infected ,afternoon the virus",['South Korea'],29,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.75036812  0.5635137

A trade union for part-timers hold a placard reading ""Part-timers are also laborers."" (Yonhap)Korean labor law requires all employers, regardless of their size, to distribute a contract to their employees for both parties to fill in. The contract stipulates wages, working hours and holiday arrangements, among other things. According to the survey, 53.5 percent of the respondents did not sign a written contract when they started their part-time jobs, with most of them just verbally agreeing to working conditions. Of them, 65.4 percent said that they did not sign a contract because their employers did not bring up the issue while 18.9 percent found it unnecessary and 15.2 percent were not aware of their duty to write a contract before offering their labor. Ha Ji-won, 21, was a temporary worker who only made a verbal contract before starting a job at a convenience store in Seoul. “My boss made no mention of signing a contract when I was hired,” said Ha, a university student in Seoul. “She just verbally and vaguely informed me of working hours, hourly pay.” “When I asked my employer whether I can sign a written contract, she seemed very upset.” Another poll of 597 companies by Alba Cheonguk from May 20-27 shed light on employers’ lack of awareness about settling working conditions in written form when hiring temporary workers. Only 47.6 percent of the companies said they should and would sign a contract, with nearly 49 percent being unwilling to do so.

(Yonhap)As of Friday afternoon, one additional case and two more deaths were reported, bringing the total confirmed cases to 181 with 31 deaths. The fatality rate reached 17.1 percent. Of the infected, 35 patients are hospital-related workers, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the total cases. Four of them are SMC doctors, the authorities said. The ministry said that further spread by the latest confirmed patient is unlikely as the doctor has been isolated since June 17. The insufficient protective measures for medical staff is suspected to be the cause, they said.“Until June 17, the protective clothing of SMC staff had apparently been insufficient. The ministry has reinforced the measures since then,” the quarantine officials said. While the government has recommended the medical facilities to provide D-level protective equipment for medical staff, SMC only provided protective clothing called VRE -- which leaves the neck and ankles exposed -- until June 17, they added. As more and more medical staff are being exposed to the virus while treating the MERS patients, fresh concerns are growing over staff shortage at MERS-hit medical facilities. At a public hospital in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, 18 staff have been quarantined and 39 other workers are in self-isolation after a nurse was confirmed with MERS. Meanwhile, the 10th MERS patient who was being treated in China has fully recovered and left the hospital, the Health Ministry said. The 44-year-old caught the virus last month from his father who was infected from the very first MERS patient at a local hospital. Being unaware of his symptoms, he left for Guangzhou on a business trip via Hong Kong on May 26. Three days later, he was diagnosed with MERS and hospitalized. The patient’s medical cost was shouldered by the Chinese government, the authorities said. The Korean government has also covered the treatment cost for a Chinese who was infected here. The returning date of the Korean patient will be kept confidential, citing privacy, they added. Also, two MERS-hit hospitals in Daejeon were cleared from the cohort isolation measures earlier in the day, the city said.

The 70-year-old, however, had never been informed about the exposure by the authorities, and therefore was never put under quarantine. Health care workers carry a suspected MERS patient at the Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)She started experiencing MERS symptoms on June 10, and visited a number of medical facilities in Gangdong district of Seoul, including am otolaryngology clinic, before she was hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul on June 18. By that time, she had already developed pneumonia, a disease that can seriously deteriorate a MERS patient’s condition.She was eventually admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit on June 20, and was officially diagnosed with MERS on June 22. She died on Wednesday, just two days after she learned of her MERS infection. Critics say the late caregiver could have been able to recover from the disease if she had been diagnosed earlier, especially since she did not have any preexisting medical conditions. Margaret Chan, the director-general of World Health Organization, stressed the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of MERS last week. “It is important for us to know that early treatment, you know, present yourself early during illness, would give you a better chance and better prospect for survival,” she told reporters in Seoul. The Health Ministry explained that the late patient’s client, who was treated at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong’s emergency unit on June 5, did not report her caregiver’s visit to the facility to authorities. “Because the client never told us, she didn’t learn about the late patients’ existence until later,” said Jeong Eun-kyung from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Health Ministry. “The client said she didn’t say anything about who accompanied her to the hospital, because she ‘simply assumed her caregiver would be all right as she had always been healthy.’ We acknowledge that we should have handled the particular situation earlier, but such circumstances made it difficult.”In order to prevent such cases from happening again, the Health Ministry said it will make it mandatory for medical facilities to keep a record of all visitors to their emergency care units, including those who accompany the patients, starting Thursday. Authorities predict that some 2,135 people may have been exposed to the virus as the 173rd patient visited numerous medical facilities while showing MERS symptoms before being hospitalized. They are urging those who visited the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul from May 17-22, Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic (223 Sangil-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul) from June 10-11, Bon otolaryngology clinic (391 Godeok-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul) on June 15 and Gangdong neurosurgery clinic (45-24 Myeongil-dong Gangdong-gu, Seoul) on June 16 to let their doctors know that they may have been exposed to the virus should they seek medical help for any symptoms or diseases.The individuals are also asked to report to the authorities immediately should they experience MERS-like symptoms, including a high fever, coughing or shortness of breath, by calling 120 or contacting the nearest public health center.As of Thursday afternoon, 77 patients were being treated at hospitals, while 15 of them were in unstable condition. Seven more people had been discharged from medical facilities on the same day, raising the number of recovered patients to 74. Some 90 hospitals nationwide have been affected by the outbreak. Among the 180 confirmed patients, 34 of them are health care workers, 64 are those who visited inpatients in medical facilities and 82 are those who were exposed to the virus while being treated for their preexisting medical conditions at hospitals. The largest portion of them -- 21.7 percent -- are in their 50s, followed by those in their 60s and 70s.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","virus died just two ,the outbreak her death ,syndrome virus died just ,died just two days ,respiratory syndrome virus died",['Seoul'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63838041  0.82407916

Executing the most mundane task of giving the children an allowance is becoming more of a feat each day.(Yonhap)Kim is one of the estimated 5 million low-wage workers who have been pleading for a drastic hike in the minimum wage next year to receive “what they deserve” for their labor. According to government statistics, 1 in 4 wage workers in Korea is “working poor,” suffering from in-work poverty, with 2 million of them being paid less than the minimum wage.Korea joins the legion of economies that toils in the recurrent debate over the efficacy of minimum wage in encouraging low-wage workers to become self-sufficient.Business leaders and economists here view it as an obstacle to economic recovery, while unionized workers see it as a key to economic growth. The Korea Employers Federation has argued that the minimum wage has risen too rapidly and it needs to be stabilized, voicing concerns over possible job losses. On the other hand, the nation’s largest trade unions ― the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Federation of Korean Trade Unions ― have maintained that the hike would tackle the nation’s income inequality and spur consumer spending.Since the government adopted the minimum wage in 1989, the Minimum Wage Council, a trilateral committee of labor experts, employees and employers, has set the minimum wage through discussion. This year, the discussion began on June 2 to decide the minimum wage for next year with an aim to reach a conclusion by June 29. After the committee turns in its consensus proposal, the government will officially make the rate public in August. But the labor circle and business bloc have continued to clash over the extent of the increase, casting a shadow over the passage of the proposal for next year’s minimum wage within a legal deadline. The labor unions have demanded a 79 percent rise from the current minimum wage at 5,580 won to 10,000 won, while employers have campaigned for a freeze.“The higher minimum wage is necessary to narrow the income gap and guarantee a basic standard of living for low-wage workers, which is also key to boosting the domestic economy,” the Federation of Korean Trade Unions said in a press release, calling on the business leaders to withdraw its proposal for a freeze. The union claimed that companies have unfairly benefited from the low minimum wage, citing that household income only increased by 5.7 percent on average when companies’ profits rose by an average of 9.8 percent from 2001-2013. Yi Jung-ah, a researcher at local socioeconomic think tank Institute For New Society, also backed the claims. “The pay raise will lead to economic growth in the long run by giving the low-income workers purchasing power as Korea’s growth model is wage-led, not profit-led,” Yi told The Korea Herald, citing a report by the International Labor Office released in 2012. In the report, the ILO categorized Korea’s economy as a wage-led growth model, meaning that it is more efficient for Korea to drive economic growth by raising workers’ wages rather than helping companies make profits. “Through research, I found that the poor tend to spend rather than save when they get extra money,” Yi said. “This means that the minimum wage increase could be the most powerful way to spur domestic spending here.” The increase can also prompt the employers to reduce working hours per person, which could create more jobs in the market, she added. But the employers association has protested the unionized workers’ proposal, saying that such drastic increase in the minimum wage could pose a formidable threat to small and medium-sized enterprises that are already faltering amid prolonged economic downturn. “The labor unions’ suggestion of a 70 percent jump in the minimum wage is unrealistic,” So Han-sub, an official from the Korea Federation of SMEs, told The Korea Herald. “The government has already raised the minimum wage too much and too quickly for the past decade, despite worsening business conditions, taking a toll on employers.” he said.The minimum wage has risen by an average of 8.8 percent from 1,865 won in 2001 to 5,580 won this year, with inflation increasing by 2.9 percent during the same period. “Labor is the biggest cost for small and medium-sized employers,” he said. “If all the companies go bankrupt (due to the wage hike), where would workers find a job?”According to a survey of 429 SMEs by Korea Employers Federation and Korea Federation of SMEs, more than half of the companies responded that they would lay off workers or not recruit new employees if the minimum wage were to increase. The surveyed companies also responded that 67.3 percent of their employees take home more than 1.6 million won per month, including bonuses and overtime pay, nearly 50 percent more than the monthly minimum wage. Choi Chang-kyu, an economics professor at Myeongji University, also thinks that the raised minimum wage has deterred companies from creating new jobs due to growing costs, resulting in fewer jobs for the young. “The shortage of jobs for the young is partially due to the constantly raised minimum wage,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “When the government intervenes in the labor market and sets the minimum wage higher than the market demands, the labor market stops the young from entering the labor force.”The unemployment rate for the young stood at 9.3 percent in May, significantly higher than the overall rate of 3.8 percent.Putting aside the effect of a pay raise on the domestic economy, another focal point in the wrangling between the labor and business bloc is whether to cover living costs of laborers’ families in the minimum wage. “It is not realistic for workers to live on the minimum wage in Korea while supporting their families,” Kim Jong-jin, a researcher for Korea Labor & Society Institute, told The Korea Herald. “The minimum wage is a part of social welfare policy to tackle income disparity and ensure a basic living standard for the marginalized,” Kim said, opposing employers’ perception that workers should be paid in accordance with the amount of work they put in. According to OECD data, a Korean single parent with two children at a minimum wage job in 2013 would need to work 58 hours a week to earn 50 percent of the median household income in Korea and get above the poverty line. The 58 hours ranks as the third most, behind the Czech Republic and Greece, among 25 OECD countries that have adopted the minimum wage system. Based on the data, the labor unions have claimed that the current minimum wage is far lower than the amount of money needed to support a family. The current minimum wage, which translates to 44,640 won a day and 1.16 million won a month for those who work eight hours a day, makes up 70 percent of the actual living expenses for a single household and only 32 percent of the living wages for a three-member household, according to labor unions. This means that it is “impossible” for one person in family to support the rest of its members, they said. But economics professor Choi noted that raising living conditions for workers and distributing wealth is the government’s job to do, not that of companies. “The government appears to pass the responsibility to take care of Koreans on to companies,” Choi said. “Rather than putting the burden on employers, the government should encourage them to create more jobs and put more people back to work.”While the management and labor circle are bickering over the extent of the wage hike, more focus should be on the social and economic structures that distress SMEs in the first place, the researcher Kim pointed out. “Beyond discussing how much to raise in the minimum wage, we should think about why SMEs are under pressure to keep their costs to a minimum in the first place,” Kim said. “It is not the minimum wage spike that puts a strain on small companies,” he said. “It is the unfair business practices between conglomerates and themselves that threaten their businesses.”Despite the government’s pledge to curb family-owned conglomerates’ power and foster smaller businesses, large companies have been accused of exploiting SMEs, which are often their suppliers, by cutting costs or pushing them out of business with their economies of scale. Kim Dong-kyu, an owner of cafe Bom Bom in southwestern Seoul, agreed. “In the short term, it could be difficult for us to cope with the rising costs to hire part-timers, but in the long term, I also think that the minimum wage should increase,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “What we (small businesses) fear more than the minimum wage increase is conglomerates who are expanding their businesses into every street, threatening small and independent shops,” he said. But behind the intensifying feud over how much to raise the minimum wage may be a more systematic problem: a lack of legal institution that allows the management and labor circles to “reasonably” discuss the issue. “The dispute over the minimum wage between laborers and business leaders repeats every year, with labor unions going as far as to stage strikes and protests,” Park Ji-soon, professor at Korea University Law School, told The Korea Herald. For the same statistics and data, the labor and business bloc have used different measurement methods, which often result in different understandings of the status of the current minimum wage in global rankings and the effects the wage hike would have on the local economy. “There should be a more systematic framework and common indicators to be used when setting the minimum wage,” Park said. “Such an important policy for the public good should not be a subject of political bargaining.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","mother raising two teenage ,single mother raising two ,wage is never enough ,minimum wage hike kim ,teenage sons often work","['Kim Ok - joo', 'Seoul', 'Kim']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68923342  0.35945404

Both the mother, who was told of her full recovery from MERS on Tuesday, and her baby are doing well, they added.The 39-year-old is the world’s first MERS patient to have given birth to a healthy child, while also having recovered from the virus at the same time. The woman became Korea’s 109th MERS patient on June 11. Meanwhile, Seoul reported three more MERS cases Tuesday, bringing the number of confirmed patients to 175. However, no death was reported on the same day, while four more people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. One of the four recovered individuals is the 14th patient, who is believed to have infected some 80 people while staying at Samsung Medical Center. As of Tuesday afternoon, Korea’s MERS fatality rate remained 15.4 percent. The woman, who was an inpatient at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, was exposed to the virus while visiting her mother, who was admitted to the same hospital’s emergency center on May 27 for acute indigestion. At the time, the nation’s 14th MERS patient, who is considered a “superspreader,” was staying at the hospital’s emergency unit. Her father also accompanied the woman’s visit to the emergency unit. A patient and her daughter reunite 14 days after the intensive care unit of Eulji University Hospital in Daejeon was put on cohort isolation upon the death of a MERS patient. The unit was released from isolation Tuesday. (Yonhap)While pregnant, she became one of 85 people who were infected with MERS at the hospital, along with both her mother and father. Since her diagnosis on June 11, she had been staying at the hospital while being treated for her MERS symptoms, mainly mild muscle pain. According to Samsung Medical Center, she had already been asymptomatic since Monday, the day before she gave birth. According to Dr. Kim Jong-hwa, who performed the woman’s cesarean section, the woman had been preparing for a natural delivery, but had to undergo the procedure not because of MERS but as she abruptly developed a pregnancy complication. Her condition, placental abruption, happens when the placenta starts to come away from the inner wall of the uterus prior to delivery. All of the health care professionals who participated in the procedure wore protective gear to prevent any possibility of infection. Right after the delivery, the baby was tested for MERS infection and the results came out negative. On the same day, the mother was officially told that she had made a full recovery from MERS.“We are just very happy that both the mother and the baby are healthy,” said Dr. Kim in a statement.As of Tuesday afternoon, 54 people have recovered from MERS, while 27 have died. A total of 94 individuals are currently being treated under quarantine. Among them, 16 are in unstable condition.The number of those who are quarantined for possible infection dropped to 2,805 from 3,833 the day before. The Health Ministry said those who are quarantined at home are now banned from taking domestic flights on top of going overseas to prevent the spread of the outbreak. The ministry is also allowing health care workers at a number of hospitals to treat their outpatients by telephone. The facilities include Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong in Seoul and Asan Chungmu Hospital in Cheonan, Chungcheong Province. “This is only a temporary measure as these hospitals are currently banned from receiving outpatients,” said Kwon Deok-cheol from the Health Ministry. “No telephone treatments will be allowed once these hospitals go back to normal and start to receive outpatients as usual.”Kwon also confirmed that the 173rd patient, a 70-year-old caregiver, visited three different medical clinics before being hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul, where she was eventually diagnosed with MERS.The three facilities are Bon otolaryngology clinic (391 Godeok-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul), Gangdong neurosurgery clinic (345-24 Myeongil-dong Gangdong-gu, Seoul) and Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic (223 Sangil-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul). Those who visited Mok Cha-su internal medicine clinic from June 10-11, Bon otolaryngology clinic on June 15 or Gangdong neurosurgery clinic on June 16 are asked to let their doctors know that they may have been exposed to the virus should they seek medical help for any symptoms or diseases.To prevent possible infection, the Hallym University Medical Center also has been banned from performing any surgical procedures, as well as from receiving new patients and visitors.

Jo Kum-hyang and Rim Sol stepped into the limelight in November after respectively carrying out a solo take-off and landing exercise with the subsonic MiG-15 chasers, prompting the young ruler to laud them as “phoenixes,” the media said.Kim called for the cultivation of female aviators during a pilot rally in Pyongyang in April 2014, a rare directive in the extremely male-centered society. He had since instructed his aides to teach Jo and Rim the skills to fly hypersonic jets. Observing their operation of the MiG-21, a Russian fighter with a speed of around Mach 2.0, Kim expressed delight, calling them “flowers of the sky.”  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is seen congratulating and posing for photos with the regime’s first female pilots of supersonic jets during flight training. (Yonhap)“They conducted their first solo flight (of the supersonic jet) readily and neatly despite unexpected circumstances,” the official Korea Central News Agency said, without elaborating. “(Kim) referred to them as a mirror and example that practically showed how all the soldiers follow through on the party’s training guidelines.” The communist country’s female air wing was reportedly launched in 1993, but most of its members have been flying old, propeller-powered aircraft. Among the executives who accompanied the leader were Hwang Pyong-so, director of the Korean People’s Army’s general political bureau, and O Kum-chol, vice chief of the KPA general staff, the agency noted.

Since the authorities confirmed the first case of a patient with the virus on May 20, the nation has fallen into a deeper state of panic with each passing day, pushing the people to change their life patterns to best prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario ― the virus being transmitted to the general community.From school buses filled with children and teachers donning masks, to empty streets in the evenings with many grown-ups canceling dinner gatherings in order to return home as soon as possible, a growing number of South Koreans are fast adapting themselves to a new environment. Washing hands frequently and avoiding the public areas as much as possible have become a “must” daily ritual for many, not just because of the government’s repeated guideline but also because of people’s voluntary sense of self-protection raised to block the virus’ spread.The most affected area of society is the nation’s medical sector, with people refraining to visit if not suffering from life-threatening illnesses.  A woman walks on a street in Myeong-dong, a popular area for both local shoppers and foreign tourists, in central Seoul, Saturday. (Yonhap)After it was announced that nearly all MERS-confirmed patients were found to have caught the virus at medical facilities, non-MERS patients who need to see doctors on a regular basis refuse to visit the medical facilities. “My mom hasn’t seen the doctor since MERS hit the country, although she really needs to go for her kidney problem. She says she won’t go until the government officially announces that the virus is subsiding,” said 28-year-old office worker Yoon Hee-sik. “Some have joked that there will be more deaths from avoiding doctors than by MERS.” Both small and large hospitals have seen a drop in outpatient visits, regardless of whether they were hit by MERS. “Our number of patients fell by 20 percent in a month. No matter how much effort we put into cleaning and sterilization measures, they just do not visit,” said an oriental medical doctor in the capital who wished to remain anonymous. Many tended to avoid wedding ceremonies, especially who raise toddlers or are pregnant, citing the virus concerns. If necessary, some show up in protective masks. “Although I’m worried about the virus, I couldn’t miss my sister’s wedding this weekend. So I wore a mask throughout the whole ceremony,” said Jeong Eun-young, who is seven months pregnant. Other business sectors have also suffered from the aftermath of MERS.According to a survey conducted on some 650 restaurants by the Korea Food Service Industry Management Institute, average sales in early June plummeted by nearly 40 percent compared to before the MERS crisis.“Group reservations sharply dropped. The main source of my business is group dinners but many regular customers have canceled,” said a 29-year-old surnamed Song, who owns a restaurant in Gangnam, Seoul. As people tend to call off group dinner plans, the number of drunk driving accidents has also dropped. According to data by the National Police Agency, the number of drunk driving accidents fell to about 600 cases in the first half of this month, down 41 percent than the same period last year. The police have suspended drunk driving crackdowns near MERS-hit hospitals as part of its efforts to support virus-containment work. “Even without crackdowns conducted in June, the drunk driving accident rate dropped, which indicates that the public concerns over MERS is serious,” said Rep. You Dae-woon of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. On the other hand, the food delivery business has seen a sharp rise in sales. According to the food delivery application Baedal Minjok, the number of app users surged by 23 percent on June 13-14 compared to two weeks ago. The tourism industry, which was firstly hit by MERS, still faces difficulties. Jejudo Island was most recently hit, after the 141st MERS patient was found to have toured the island despite having some symptoms. While the quarantine authorities immediately isolated those who closely contacted the patient, and took preventive measures, public concerns remained. The number of Jejudo tourists on June 19-20 declined by 13 percent compared to last year, according to the Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Tourism Association. The flight booking rate between Seoul and Jejudo halved while the accommodation reservation rate plummeted by 40 to 50 percent, it added.The overall tourism industry, however, is seeing a gradual recovery. The growth in travel cancellations to Seoul is reportedly slowing as the virus outbreak subsides. According to the state-run Korea Tourism Organization, about 1,800 foreign travelers called off their trips to South Korea on Friday, only up 1.43 percent from that of the previous day. The figure is lower than the number of cancellations Wednesday, which exceeded 3,700, rising by 3.15 percent from the day before. From June 1-18, a total of 123,390 foreign travelers canceled their trips, with the majority from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. While the KTO said that the foreign tourists who booked flights in July and August seem to be cautiously watching the situation in Korea, it projected that the number of tourists could tumble by up to 30 percent this month.

73,73,73,LGBT parade to go on despite opposition,"When South Korean police barred the local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community from holding a parade in downtown Seoul two weeks ago, gay rights activist Woo Ji-young was saddened, but hardly surprised.“I already expected that the police would not allow the gay pride parade, but could not help but feel frustrated about the reality,” Woo, a secretary general at the Korea Queer Festival Organization Commi...","When South Korean police barred the local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community from holding a parade in downtown Seoul two weeks ago, gay rights activist Woo Ji-young was saddened, but hardly surprised.“I already expected that the police would not allow the gay pride parade, but could not help but feel frustrated about the reality,” Woo, a secretary general at the Korea Queer Festival Organization Committee, told The Korea Herald. In her eyes, sexual minorities’ rights in Korea are largely undermined, attacked by Korean political leaders whose concerns are mainly conservative Christian groups that give them votes. “Sexual minorities do not matter for them,” Woo said. On May 29, the festival committee applied for a permit to hold a gay pride parade scheduled for June 28 at Seoul Plaza, central Seoul. The next day, the police rejected its application, citing traffic disruptions and possible clashes with opponents during the parade. But the Seoul Administrative Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of the LGBT activists, invalidating the police ban on the pride parade, a decision that drew fierce protests from anti-gay groups. “Assemblies can be prohibited only when they pose a direct and clear threat to public order,” the court said in the ruling. “Banning assemblies should be used as a last resort when there are no options left.”The LGBT activists, which had denounced the police decision as “politically motivated,” welcomed the court ruling. “The ruling carries a lot of weight, meaning that sexual minorities should also be able to voice their opinions in our society as members of a democratic country,” the Korea Queer Festival Organization Committee said in a press release. Chang Suh-yeon, an attorney for Lawyers for a Democratic Society, also viewed the court ruling as a decision to respect minorities’ rights to be free and fairly treated, noting that the ban did not have legal basis in the first place. “The police law allows them to restrict a right to stage a parade, citing traffic disruption, but the upper law, the constitution, stipulates that a right to demonstrate must be protected, especially when demonstrations are held peacefully,” Chang told The Korea Herald.(Left photo) Participants attend the opening ceremony of the Korea Queer Festival 2015 at Seoul Plaza in downtown Seoul on June 9, holding up cards that say “We become stronger as we connect.” Protesters, meanwhile, hold a rally opposing the event in front of Deoksugung Palace near the plaza earlier in the day. (Yonhap)However, anti-LGBT groups, mainly conservative and Protestant groups, expressed their disappointment about the ruling. The Korean Association of Church Communication said in a press release that allowing such a large-scale parade in Seoul would expose the public to Middle East respiratory syndrome. With the virus engulfing the nation, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon should cancel the event, considering “public sentiment” and “common sense,” it said. Christian groups booked out the likely venues for the parade, which LGBT groups see as a tactic to stop the event. They also camped out in front of Namdaemun Police Station to block the parade organizers from applying for a necessary permit. When the Queer Cultural Festival opened on June 9, anti-gay groups staged protests alongside the festival participants, holding signs with slogans like “Stop Same-Sex Marriage” and “Gays Out: Homosexuals have no human rights.”Last year, Christian activists disrupted the parade held in Sinchon, northwestern Seoul, by lying down in the street.The main reasons behind their vocal opposition were “social costs” and “the Bible’s teachings.” “According to the Bible, homosexuality is a sin. It is morally and ethically wrong,” an official from the Korean Association of Church Communication told The Korea Herald. “But most of all, homosexuality could increase unnecessary social costs.”“Those who made a personally wrong choice should not put a burden on our society,” he said, adding that the government would end up spending more to support patients infected with AIDS. “And why do gays have to take to streets at the center of Seoul to be naked and show their sexual identity when there are kids and students watching them?” he added. Sexual minorities still live largely on the fringes of Korean society as the majority of Koreans remain intolerant of homosexuality, with a Gallup poll ranking Korea at 69th among 123 nations in terms of gay-friendly countries.According to a 2014 survey of some 2,000 Koreans aged 19 or older by the local think tank Asan Institute for Policy Studies, only 23.7 percent of respondents had little or no objection to gays, meaning that the majority of Korean adults still remain somewhat hostile to homosexuality. The intolerance was notable especially among those in their 50s and 60s, with only 13.8 percent and 7.1 percent tolerant of homosexuals, respectively.But the negative perception about gays will likely change over time with a generational shift as the survey showed that nearly half of those in their 20s were OK with homosexuals, up from 26.7 percent in 2010. Following the court ruling, the gay pride parade, the final event of celebration for sexual minorities, will take place as scheduled on June 28 in the center of Seoul. The sexual minorities and their supporters will march across central Seoul for about an hour, starting from Seoul Plaza. The organization expects that more than 30,000 people will participate in the event. “By holding the parade at Seoul Plaza, a space for all citizens, we hope to reach out to the public,” LGBT activist Woo said. “We don’t want to hide. We want to show to the world that we are also living as a member of this society.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","gay pride parade but ,local lesbian gay bisexual ,the gay pride parade ,lgbt parade to go ,barred the local lesbian","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'Woo Ji - young', 'the Korea Queer Festival Organization Commi']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29268542  0.57857704

Crowded families of 5 to 10 people survive on rice porridge and onions each day. In late May, Jane Pearce, the country director of the United Nations World Food Program, visited the camp and went inside one family’s tent as part of her regular field trip.Jane Pearce, country director of the United Nations World Food Program. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)“The temperature inside was over 65 degrees Celsius, and obviously being distressed, they started yelling and complaining,” Pearce told The Korea Herald on Wednesday. “I tried to calm them down. I told them, ‘I will do everything I can to help. I am going to Korea, Japan, Australia and Belgium to ask for assistance.’” “Then they all stopped,” Pearce added. “The women grabbed and kissed me. Despite the misery in their lives, this is the spirit of the Iraqi people ― warm, strong, resilient and proud.”Pearce came to Korea last week to raise awareness of the humanitarian crises in Iraq, and raise funds from the Korean government. The U.N. staff is reaching out to the international media to keep Iraq on the global agenda, she said. The Australian director has worked with the WFP for over 20 years, serving assignments in Zaire, Rwanda, Tanzania, North Korea and Iraq. Ravaged by decades of wars with Iran and the U.S., and fight against the Islamic State and the Levant, the Iraqis are struggling to establish the most basic normalcy in their lives, explained Pearce. Out of the 36 million people of Iraq, 8.2 million are in need of immediate humanitarian aid. People have opened their homes to their displaced compatriots, and the government has provided food, shelter, water, health care, education and money to over 3 million displaced citizens. Iraqi children from the Baharka camp for internally displaced persons in city Erbil in northern Iraq. (Mohammed Al Bahbahani / WFP)“We don’t really see an end to it. The crises in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Ukraine, Nigeria, South Sudan, Nepal and other parts of the world have completely stretched our money and manpower,” Pearce said. “It is already 50 degrees Celsius in Baghdad, and the temperature is rising. Unless we get an immediate injection of cash, we will have to start shutting down up to half of our operations.”Due to lack of funding, the WFP has already started cutting rations by half to 800 calories a day. To deliver the “bare minimum” of service to keep people alive, the U.N. organization needs $160 million for the next six months, while the global humanitarian community needs $500 million, said the director.The new Iraq government is working hard to harmonize ethnic and religious groups and reconstruct the nation, but it simply cannot cope with the scale of the catastrophes and chaos, stressed Pearce. One-third of the country in the northwestern provinces of Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al-Din is controlled by the ISIS terrorists, who have committed rape, torture, enslavement and killing by beheading, crucifixion, suicide-bombing and live-burning. The survivors of the violence are suffering from depression and trauma, and female suicides have risen sharply, according to the WFP. “The crises are multiplying at a time when the funding is drying up,” Pearce underscored, adding that there are now more displaced people around the world than at any time since the Second World War. “The number has increased year after year after year,” she highlighted.The Korean government has been highly supportive through the international community and the WFP, the director noted. Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Korea International Cooperation Agency, Korea donated $31 million to the WFP last year.The WFP and Korean government hold annual consultations to strengthen the partnership. The Korean government aims to bolster its multilateral assistance alongside the bilateral contribution through the KOICA, the MOFA said in a press release.Pearce said that foreign aid workers are well protected by the U.N. security forces, and do not feel unsafe in their operation. She travels between Baghdad and Sulaymaniah, where the ISIS does not pose a direct threat. Baghdad remains a heavily fortified area, a part of the “Green Zone” where the weapon is not cocked, unlike the rest of the country, which falls under the “Red Zone” with weapons readied at all times.“I have the greatest job in the world,” Pearce said, adding that despite being emotionally draining, her work is also “incredibly rewarding.”“I remind myself why I have to work 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, for months on end. I try to connect with the people by regularly visiting them. I would not do anything else.”By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)","onions each day ,desert for over year ,onions each day in ,and onions each day ,degrees celsius at midday","['Iraq', 'Jane Pearce', 'the United Natio']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12307815  0.96475756

It sparked concerns about its capacity to properly deal with the MERS situation, after the country’s first student patient was confirmed earlier in the day.Although the ministry released a press release confirming that the teen patient -- a 16-year-old high schooler -- is attending a Seoul-based high school, the SMOE said it was not even sure of the relevant facts.The officials said they learned about the student patient by inquiring at the health center in Gangnam-gu, southern Seoul, where he was diagnosed with the disease. One SMOE official said that she learned other details of the teen patient in question through media reports that were collected in official documents -- which were used in turn to brief the media.“I looked it up in the news.

The ministry tells us the information about the patient,” said a high-ranking official from the Education Ministry.There have been concerns that such monopoly of information could be a recipe for disaster, as the local education office -- which has the authority to cancel classes at times of high risk of contagion -- is left in the dark about the MERS situation in schools.Under the current system, health authorities alert the patients with their diagnosis. Each student is to report his or her case to the school, which in turn reports it to local education offices. But there is no regulation that mandates students to report one’s case to the school, meaning the school -- and consequently the education offices -- runs the risk of not keeping accurate track of a possible MERS outbreak among its students.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","student patient the seoul ,seoul education office left ,dark about mers student ,infection of teenager ,about mers student patient","['the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'the Education Ministry', 'Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27158308  0.35690442

The 44-year-old Korean man flew to Hong Kong on May 26, a day after his father was diagnosed with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus in South Korea and subsequently went to the southern Chinese province of Guangdong by bus. He was confirmed to be infected with the virus last week and has been treated under quarantine at the Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital in Guangdong.The state-run China Daily newspaper said, ""The South Korean patient in China is still in serious condition."" It did not say where it got the information. On Wednesday, the Guangdong Health and Family Planning Commission said the Korean patient's lungs had not worsened and his vital signs were relatively stable. South Korea reported its first MERS case on May 20. Since then, more than 1,600 people have been quarantined and four people have died from the virus in South Korea. Song Tie, deputy director of the Guangdong's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Chinese newspaper that the likelihood of more outbreaks in China is low due to tight disease control. ""Based on the current monitoring results, it is nearly impossible for new MERS cases to appear in China unless there are new imported ones,"" Song was quoted as saying. ""But we are concerned about the situation in South Korea.People travel frequently between the two countries for business or travel in large numbers. We hope South Korea can make public as soon as possible the detailed information of its MERS spread, such as where the epidemic points are and whether it has spread to communities,"" Song said. MERS is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the World Health Organization. The virus, which causes a fever, cough and shortness of breath, has infected more than 1,100 people and more than 400 people have died from it, WHO said. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the virus.

There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.The lack of treatment for the disease is apparently adding to what many medical experts here have called groundless fears, despite a steady increase in the number of people diagnosed.The five new confirmed cases included an Air Force chief master sergeant, which represented the first MERS case among members of the military.The 45-year-old servicemember was in the same hospital as the first MERS patient, but health ministry officials said it was more likely to be a case of tertiary transmission of the disease from another person who had contracted the MERS coronavirus from the first patient at the hospital.Such speculation is based on the fact that the man began showing symptoms of MERS past the maximum known incubation period of 14 days for the disease since his last possible contact with the first patient on May 17, they noted.The four other cases are also believed to be tertiary transmission cases.Tertiary transmission of the disease means any person diagnosed with MERS can transmit the disease, making anyone who has come in close contact with any of the patients subject to quarantine.Previously, the government had only isolated some 100 people who had come in close contact with the first patient.Since the first tertiary transmission case was confirmed Tuesday, the number has shot up to more than 1,600 as of Thursday.The health ministry is conducting a DNA test of the MERS coronavirus to see whether there has been any mutation of the virus that could explain what it believes to be an unusually fast and wide spreading of the disease that had only affected 1,142 people in 23 countries since it was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.The outcome of the test was expected later Friday.The ministry said a team of experts from the World Health Organization was set to visit the country, possibly next week, to check for any reasons for the spread of the disease in South Korea, which it said is showing different patterns and speed from the spread in Saudi Arabia, where more than 1,000 confirmed cases have been reported since 2012.Despite repeated claims from the government that the disease is not out of control and appeals to the people to carry on with their daily lives, more than 1,160 schools, including some 400 kindergartens and a dozen colleges, have gone into a temporary shutdown out of fears over the disease.

The government’s decision to keep secret the list of hospitals holding MERS patients worsened public anger. The confirmation of two tertiary infections early Tuesday exacerbated the public’s fear.The ministry’s failure to contain MERS will add to pressure on Moon to resign, local analysts said.“This is a full-fledged political crisis, not to mention the obvious health concerns,” said Lee Jun-han, a professor of politics at Incheon National University.“If someone in Hong Kong or China falls victim to MERS, this could escalate into an international incident that invites negative attention on Korea. Moon will likely be compelled to resign after the crisis,” Lee added.Health and Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo. (Yonhap)A Korean man suspected of having MERS traveled to Hong Kong late last month. Officials there confirmed the man of having MERS, and have quarantined over 80 people who may have caught the virus from him.President Park Geun-hye named Moon, then a senior economist at the Korea Development Institute, a public think tank, as her welfare minister in December 2013, primarily to drive through Park’s civil service pension reforms, which aimed to reduce the pension system’s reliance on public funds.Moon finished that task last month, when the parliament approved reductions in annuities to former civil servants. The reform came after weeks of controversy centered on Moon, as he had likened opposition demands that social security be widened without tax increases, to “piracy from future taxpayers.”Moon’s critics, including hard-liners in the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, had demanded the minister’s resignation, calling Moon’s comments “provocative” and “undermining of parliamentary debate.”“Moon was viewed as a Park loyalist by defending the president’s reforms against the opposition,” Lee said. “But he is viewed as a policy failure right now due to MERS,” he added.Professor Kim Men-geon at Kyung Hee University said despite mounting pressure, Moon may continue to keep his job.“There was pressure on Moon to resign then ... but I think that there is the chance that the president will keep Moon as her minister (after the MERS crisis ends),” Kim said.Considering the president’s multiple failures to draw public support for nominees to senior Cabinet posts, she will likely oppose holding “yet another” confirmation hearing, Kim added.Park’s Cabinet nominees have attracted negative political opinion during their parliamentary confirmation hearings. “Remember that President Park kept her chief of staff, Kim Ki-choon, in his post for months, despite continued public calls for him to resign,” Kim said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","patients worsened public anger ,of tuesday the disease ,tuesday the disease ,public anger the confirmation ,mers patients worsened public",['Moon Hyung - pyo'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46051612  0.24469575

She suffered from a mystery lung-related disease for more than a decade. “When the symptoms first showed years ago, doctors couldn’t figure out the cause. She received pneumonia treatment because the symptoms were similar. But her condition didn’t get better,” Lee recalled. It was around the time she gave birth to their second son in 2001, he told The Korea Herald.In 2011, the couple finally found out that she was one of the many victims associated with a toxic humidifier disinfectant. The health authorities discovered that there was a “significant association” between the use of the humidifier disinfectant and lung-related diseases, especially among children and pregnant women.  Victims of the effects of humidifier disinfectant hold a campaign in front of the Houses of Parliament in London on May 19. (Yonhap)Lee’s family used Oxy Ssak Ssak, a liquid humidifier disinfectant produced by British company Reckitt Benckiser, every winter from 2001 to 2010, he said. Oxy Ssak Ssak, which was only sold in Korea from 2002, had a market share of about 80 percent in Korea among 20 similar other brands. All products were later withdrawn from the local market.As of now, more than 500 Korean users of humidifier disinfectants are reported to have been affected, with 221 confirmed to have suffered lung damage, the Korean authorities said. Of them, 92 died of lung-related diseases. The civic groups argue that the official death toll should be 142, as victims of other types of diseases need to be included. Lee and other victims’ families are now gearing up to launch a legal battle against the disinfectant’s manufacturer. The group of victims’ families and activist group Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health vowed Wednesday to seek legal action against the company over the deaths of more than 100 people. “We are currently discussing the case with two British law firms. The lawyers said civil and criminal suits are both likely,” ACCEH director Lim Heung-kyu told The Korea Herald. The victims’ families and Korean activists visited the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters earlier this month to urge the company to take responsibility and issue an apology. They claimed that the company falsely advertised its products as safe even though the disinfectant contained toxic substances. The Korean Free Trade Commission has also confirmed that the Berkshire-based company was guilty of wrongly promoting its product as “safe for humans.” In response, the headquarters only provided a document, asking them to talk to the Korean branch of Reckitt Benckiser, the victims’ group said. The Korean branch office, however, has also remained silent on the issue despite the results of the government’s official inquiry. Regarding the lawsuit, it refused to comment, simply saying, “We have at all times sought to act in good faith and in the best interests of all parties. We have no comment on the legal action.”So far, most of the victims’ families have not received compensation, either from the government or the company, except for coverage for the medical costs from the government. They filed a lawsuit against the government for negligence in product monitoring but they lost the case earlier this year. The local court ruled that the state could not take responsibility for the deaths as there was no evidence that authorities knew of the harmfulness of the disinfectant in advance. The Environment Ministry, however, recently designated Asan Medical Center in Seoul as the main hospital to look for a causal link between the chemical exposure and the illnesses as part of efforts to further confirm the health impacts of the chemicals, officials said. AMC will also monitor the health records of the disinfectant victims and their families and take charge of their health care and treatment, they added.

She never drinks tap water, citing an unpleasant chemical smell and safety concerns. Worried about her family’s health, she has installed a water purifier at home instead. “There’s a weird smell in tap water. How can you trust tap water that comes through old underground pipes? It’s always better to be safer,” Han said. Han is part of the majority of Koreans who are reluctant to drink tap water, and prefer to use a water purifier or purchase bottled water at home.According to a survey conducted by the Environment Ministry on 12,000 individuals in 2013, only about 10 percent responded that they drank water directly from the tap, whether it is boiled or not. About 55 percent said they drank tap water only after boiling to ensure safety. Elementary school studentsdrink tap water at their school in Seoul. (Seoul Metropolitan Government)More than 30 percent of those surveyed responded that they distrust the quality of tap water because of concerns over old water pipes and water tanks. About 28 percent of respondents said they were worried about sanitation at reservoirs. But only about 55 percent answered that they were willing to drink tap water if all such concerns were resolved.Despite emphasis from experts who stress that Korea’s tap water quality is among the best in the world, public distrust over the quality of tap water has been prevalent for quite some time.According to a United Nations’ report in 2003, Korea’s water quality ranked eighth in the world, with its high-tech water treatment facilities and management. Finland topped the chart, followed by Canada and New Zealand. The U.S. took the 12th spot, the report said. To ensure water safety, the Korean government monitors tap water quality around the clock against a minimum of 59 criteria, including checks on residual chlorine levels, pH and various types of bacteria. Along with the mandated monitoring criteria, municipal governments impose their own higher water standards at their own discretion, with over 150 criteria. For example, Seoul City monitors 163 variables while Busan looks at 260, officials said.  Children drink tap water in this stock photo provided by Seoul Metropolitan Government.This is not only above the World Health Organization’s recommended level but also more detailed than other countries, they said.In the U.S. and Japan, the number of water quality criteria monitored is around 111. The tap water drinking rate, however, is much higher than in Seoul. As of 2013, 82 percent of Americans and 78 percent of Japanese replied that they drank tap water. In New York, about 80 percent of residents drink tap water despite concerns about old water pipes (most of which are more than 100 years old) and chlorine use, the officials explained.For instance, more than 4 milligrams per liter of chlorine is added to water in New York for germ prevention, while Seoul keeps the minimum amount at 0.2 milligrams per liter. But this, which often leads to stronger chemical smell, seemingly does not deter New Yorkers from drinking water from the tap. Americans have acknowledged that a small amount of chlorine does not pose health issues and is an essential substance for disinfection, thanks to the government’s efforts to raise public awareness of this, the officials explained.Despite the authorities’ efforts to maintain the high quality of tap water, the public has preferred to drink water filtered through water purifiers or purchase bottled water. Some critics pointed out that such public distrust was triggered by the infamous phenol leak accident that prompted water scare across the country in the early 1990s.In 1991, an undiluted solution of phenol was leaked twice from an electronic component factory in Daegu into the Nakdonggang River. The accident caused extreme odors in the region’s tap water, and serious headaches and vomiting among residents who drank it. “Once a water accident happens in one region just like the phenol leak, it causes nationwide fear as water circulates the country, no matter how well the government responded to the accident. People who raise children especially react sensitively to water accidents,” said Chung Deuk-mo, the director general of Waterworks Research Institute, an affiliated organization of Seoul Metropolitan Government. Along with the phenol leak, aged underground pipes added to the water distrust following several reported cases of red water, experts said. As part of the efforts to guarantee pipe sanitation, the government has worked on replacing water pipes with new, rust-proof ones. “Those pipes aged over two decades are recommended to be replaced. Water flows through pipes upon pressure. Because massive pressure hits the pipes every day, the pipe connections can be twisted, chipped off or even rust,” an official from the Environment Ministry told The Korea Herald, wishing not to be identified.About 180,000 kilometers of water pipes are installed underground across the country, with 70 percent having been laid, replaced or improved in the last 20 years. About 30 percent are awaiting replacement, with most of them in private housing. Replacing the pipes at private housing is at each homeowner’s discretion, officials said. As pipe replacement for an individual home costs around 2 million won ($1,800), many residents have been reluctant to take the responsibility, citing cost burden. To encourage people to replace their pipes, city governments have offered subsidies for those wishing to replace them. In the case of Seoul, the city expanded the subsidy from 50 percent to 80 percent of the cost in an aim to complete the replacement by 2020, officials said. The capital has also completed more than 96 percent of the public water pipe replacement, due to be finished by 2018, with about 470 kilometers remaining, they added.While various factors have led to public distrust, one of the prevalent reasons that Koreans avoid drinking tap water is their sensitivity toward the unpleasant taste that derives from chlorine, experts said. “Many people tend to feel the unpleasant smell and taste from tap water because of chlorine. But chlorine is essential to ensuring water safety as it prevents bacteria propagation,” said water expert Lee Yoon-jin at Konyang University in South Chungcheong Province.In order to have better tasting drinking water while avoiding safety concerns, many Koreans have installed water purifiers at home, thinking that smell-free water is likely safer. The scale of the water purifier market is around 1.5 trillion won a year, Seoul officials said. Experts, however, underscore that purified water is actually not safer than the tap water. “Water filtered through purifiers may seem safer but it can actually lower the water quality unless the filters are regularly replaced. The interior cleaning of purifiers is systematically not easy, and the purifier’s faucet can increase bacteria propagation as it is exposed to the air,” said environment engineering professor Choi Suing-il at Korea University in Seoul. In 2013, more than half of 100 water purifiers in Seoul were found to have had substandard drinking water, the capital’s random inspection report showed. A few were reported to have had about 110 times more germs than average, with one even having colon bacillus, the city said. “All water purifiers contain activated carbon to remove chlorine, which is the source of the chemical smell that many dislike. As the germ-fighter substance is eliminated, the water is naturally exposed to various bacteria and germs,” Choi added. The more serious problem of water purifiers is that some types of water purifiers even eliminate all the important nutrients contained in tap water, experts said. “Because tap water is sourced from rivers, such as the Hangang River, it contains various minerals such as calcium and magnesium, with around 20 to 30 milligrams per liter,” a Seoul City official said.Some express health concerns over the chlorine use but experts highlight that a small amount is harmless.“Chlorine is a chemical, therefore it can be harmful to health if one is over-exposed. One study showed that it can be detrimental if people are constantly exposed to chlorine over 3,000 ppm over a long period. But unless more than 1,000 milligrams per liter or 1,000 ppm is added to the water, there’s no need to worry,” said Kim Dong-keun, the general director of Citizens Network for Tap Water, adding that bacteria contamination of water due to a lack of chlorine could be more harmful.The government, meanwhile, continues to put efforts into promoting the safety of tap water.Seoul City, for instance, announced last month it would provide free-of-charge quality tests for tap water at some 300,000 homes and improve their water supply facilities. It has also signed up for an insurance to compensate citizens who suffer damage from any water pollution.The city has been providing bottled tap water since 2001, branding the products under the name Arisu in 2004 to rehabilitate its image.In March this year, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon joined a network of some 72 government organizations and civic organizations to only use tap water by installing Arisu drinking fountains at all of its office buildings.Civic groups stress that achieving the cleanliness of tap water and enjoying it is a basic right of the public. “Improving the tap water credibility and expanding the culture of drinking tap water is crucial. Having safe water is not only a basic public right but also part of welfare. People should realize the importance of the cheapest, yet the most vital, benefit to their daily lives,” said Kim.

That’s about it.”Lee, who is also a practicing dentist, has been serving as the head of the KOFIH since 2012. His organization is the only South Korean public agency that provides health care support to North Korea. Some of its ongoing projects include establishing a health screening center in the Gaeseong Industrial Complex for North Korean workers, as well as supporting North Korean tuberculosis patients in its northern free-trade city of Rason. Lee Soo-ku, president of Korea Foundation for International Healthcare, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul on Wednesday. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)In 2008, the agency completed its renovation of the Onjeong Community Hospital in North Korea’s Goseong County. The hospital, which is responsible for about 5,000 people living in the county, now has fully-equipped facilities including a dental clinic. But Lee said South Korea was still not doing enough to support North Koreans who are in need of quality health care, especially pregnant women, tuberculosis patients, and children suffering from chronic malnutrition.“Many experts estimate that about 8 percent of the entire North Korean population is suffering from tuberculosis,” he said. “As many already know, a lot of North Koreans are malnourished. Those who suffer from malnutrition are especially vulnerable to TB. And because anti-TB drugs can cause a number of adverse effects, such as drug-induced hepatitis, taking the drug can be especially painful and difficult for malnourished patients.”Lee said because of malnutrition and scarcity of medicines, the number of North Korean patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is rising. MDR-TB is a form of TB infection caused by bacteria that are resistant to at least two of the most powerful first-line treatment anti-TB drugs. The condition, which is much more dangerous and difficult to treat than TB, is often caused by the TB patient not taking the medication properly, or stopping his or her treatment due to expense or scarcity of medicines.“This is why I suggested establishing a health screening center at the Gaeseong Industrial Complex. If 8 percent of the entire population is suffering from TB, I assumed there could also be patients among those who work at the complex,” he said. “There are some 54,000 North Korean workers working at the complex, along with about 800 South Korean workers. But the size of the clinic for North Korean workers is about one-fifth size of the one for South Korean workers. “Supporting North Korean TB patients cannot be done by simply sending anti-TB drugs,” he added. “What is needed is a solid residential and medical facility that can quarantine MDR-TB patients, TB-screening equipment for prompt detection of infectious patients and stronger measures to combat malnutrition in the country.”North Korea’s health care system, which emphasized free cost and preventive care, fell apart during the “Arduous March” ― a great famine that accompanied the country’s economic crisis from 1994 to 1998. According to a number of North Korean defectors interviewed by the KOFIH, a lot of doctors in the North aren’t paid enough or paid at all, and therefore aren’t motivated to do their jobs. Many of them are involved in illicit drug sales.Because patients are assigned to a specific doctor in the region by the regime, they are not allowed to see other medical professionals even if they are not satisfied with the treatment they get from their designated doctor. As a result, those with money bribe the doctors that they would like to see, while the impoverished are often left with no health care options.Some of the most vulnerable to the current system include pregnant women. As of 2010, North Korea’s maternal mortality ratio was 81 women per 100,000 live births. South Korea’s ratio was 16, while Japan and China’s ratios were 5 and 37, respectively. According to KOFIH’s 2013 data, less than 10 percent of North Korea’s obstetricians and gynecologists have been trained in newborn care, and no family doctors in small regional clinics have been trained in emergency obstetric and newborn care, childbirth and general gynecology. Data also showed that small regional clinics’ medical equipment for childbirth were in poor condition. More than 70 percent of emergency obstetrical kits at the clinics either were either in poor condition or could not be used, while 68.3 percent of equipment needed for intravenous therapy were also in poor condition. Also, 68.3 percent of the sterilizers were in poor maintenance. Poor sterilization of medical equipment can lead to infection of patients in the facility. In North Korea, 15 percent of women who die due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth die from sepsis, a whole-body inflammation caused by an infection. To foster experts on North Korean health care, the KOFIH has been running a special educational program for activists and health care professionals since 2013. Lee stressed that humanitarian support for North Koreans should not be affected by inter-Korean relations. Some of the KOFIH’s projects were suspended after the North’s 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan.“President Park Geun-hye said she’d expand humanitarian support for North Korea during her recent Dresden speech and I thought she was taking the right approach,” he said. “We should think of giving health care support to North Korea as preparation for the two Koreas’ unification.”He said one of the most critical issues was malnutrition of North Korean children. “A lot of North Korean children are experiencing so many health problems because of malnutrition. And one of them is iodine deficiency,” he said. “Lack of iodine can severely affect a child’s brain and intellectual prowess, which can lead to developmental disabilities. If we don’t do anything about this, there will be more social costs to tackle this issue in the future, especially after reunification.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","international healthcare visited dental ,president of the korea ,dental facility in north ,is also practicing dentist ,dentist has been serving","['Lee Soo - ku', 'the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare', 'North Korea', 'KOFIH']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41685158  0.76210231

While she currently has no signs of the brain disease, Kim recently visited her doctor to find out if there are any options available for an early diagnosis. “Dementia is a terrible disease,” Kim said. “After losing my own mother to the very disease, I wanted to be proactive and minimize my risks as much as possible before it is too late.”Her doctor suggested Kim get a FDG-PET scan, a medical imaging technique that produces a 3-D image functional process in the body. The test, which uses a small close of a radioactive drug to show differences between healthy and diseased tissue, is used to make a diagnosis for dementia management or prognosis. According to the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, the test has a 79 percent chance of correctly identifying those with dementia, and a 60 percent chance of correctly identifying those without the disease. The test, however, is expensive and currently not covered by the national health insurance program. The cost of a single scan ranges from 600,000 won ($550) to 1.2 million won.  Senior citizens are encouraged to exercise regularly, as physical inactivity is known to be a major risk factor for dementia. (Yonhap)While Kim is still willing to undergo the scan, most Koreans ― 68.8 percent ― are reluctant to receive the test mostly because of its cost, according to the latest study by the NECA. Meanwhile, the number of dementia patients increased by 12.8 percent from 2013 to 2014, from 38,217 to 43,974. The cost to treat the patients increased by 18.8 percent in the same time period. Last year, Koreans spent 1.17 trillion won to treat the brain disease, while about one-third of total medical cost ― 19.4 trillion won ― was spent on treating the elderly who already account for 11.9 percent of the total Korean population. While the elderly population is rapidly increasing, dementia is considered one of the most serious threats to the country’s future economy. Health authorities predict the number of people with the disease will exceed the number of those who are aged 65 or older by 2024, and that it will cost some 43.5 trillion won to treat by 2030. Experts say early diagnosis is important as it allows a person to get the maximum benefit from available treatments and provides an opportunity for clinical trials or studies. “Those who are aged 60 or older, and those who have close family members who have suffered dementia are encouraged to take the FDG-PET scan,” said Seo Seong-woo from the NECA.“From our research, 60.6 percent of the surveyed individuals said they are willing to participate in clinical trials and 88.3 percent said they would start receiving any available treatments immediately once they are diagnosed with the disease.”The government has been making a number of efforts to prevent the disease, including banning on-campus drinking and introducing workout programs for the elderly. According to the Health Ministry, a heavy drinker is 7.42 times more likely than a person who does not drink to develop dementia. Also, physical inactivity is considered one of the major risk factors for dementia, as indicated by more than 80 percent of the elderly spending their leisure time watching TV. For Kim, spending 1 million won for her FDG-PET scan is worth it not only for herself, but also for her children. “I spent 1.2 million won a month for the last two years of my mother’s life, as she was staying at a residential medical facility for the elderly,” she said. “I believe doing everything that I can to prevent or delay the process of the disease would save more money in the end. It’ll be less of a burden ― both financially and emotionally ― for my children as well.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","housewife lost her mother ,her mother to dementia ,year old housewife lost ,old housewife lost her ,mother to dementia three","['Kim Seon - hwa', 'Kim', 'Dementia', 'Kim']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88385475  0.1758367

Kim Kyok-sik died Sunday of respiratory failure at the age of 77 after suffering from an unidentified cancer, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the communist party's official newspaper.South Korean officials said he is believed to have led the North's torpedo attack on a South Korean warship in March 2010 and the shelling of Yeongpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea eight months later. He was in charge of the 4th Corps in Hwanghae Province near the western border with the South at that time.The deadly sinking of South Korean naval corvette Cheonan killed 46 sailors. The North's shelling of the border island left four people including two civilians dead, the first North Korean artillery attack on home soil since the 1950-53 Korean War.The two Koreas are still technically at war as the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Kim was named as the North's armed forces minister in October2012 before being replaced by Jang Jong-nam in May 2013. Later, he was tapped as the chief of the KPA's General Staff.The People's Armed Forces Ministry is equivalent to South Korea's Defense Ministry and is placed under the control of the communist country's top policy-making body.The Ministry of Unification declined to comment on Kim's death but added that there is no change in the Seoul government's stance over the need to keep its punitive sanctions against North Korea following the warship sinking.Since May 2010, South Korea has imposed sanctions on the North by banning economic and cultural exchanges to punish the North's torpedoing of the warship.

I just love them. I cannot specifically describe the reason,” the 57-year-old scholar, who heads the Holoce Ecosystem Conservation Research Institution in Hoengseong, Gangwon Province, told The Korea Herald. “When you see their colors, it’s indescribably beautiful.”Lee Kang-woon, director of the Holoce Ecosystem Conservation Research Institution in Hoengseong, Gangwon Province, poses during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)His affection for insects has transformed him into one of the country’s leading scholars in the fields of entomology and biodiversity. Beyond his individual research, he has also strived to raise awareness about rare insect species and nurture future entomologists. In 1997, Lee bought 73,000-square-meter swaths of forest in the province and established the insect research institution. He has exhibited about 4,300 species of insects. At a series of laboratories in the institute, some 900 types of insects are being raised. The director named his institution after “Holocene,” referring to the fourth period of Cenozoic era ― from 15,000 years ago up to now ― to highlight the urgency of preserving biodiversity.Lee is conducting a number of projects with six researchers at his institute, with the aim of developing endangered species and analyzing the characteristics of each insect. One project includes a study on matching larva with their host plants. Information about which host plant feeds which larva has been unknown. “Insects spawn only on certain plants they choose. Once hatched, the insect lives without parents’ help. Parents then live on the pod and essence of the plant,” he said. “Naturally, insects of parents and children never compete for food.”For more than a decade, he has discovered the relationships of about 600 types of larva and their respective host plants. “The study suggests that natural enemies of plants are insects. Plants spout out various chemical substances to battle against insects, and those substances make the bitterness that we taste from the plants,” he added. “Without insects, we cannot enjoy the good taste of plants and vegetables.” Along with the project on larva and host plants, the entomologist has carried out a long-term study on global warming effects on the ecosystem through insects. As the emergence of insects from pupa to butterflies change according to different temperatures, Lee recorded this data for five types of butterflies for eight years to look into whether their life cycle is affected by climate change. “Once you understand the ecology of insects, the global warming impacts are recognizable. Just as flowers tend to blossom earlier, the hibernation period of insects is getting shorter,” he said. Of all the ongoing projects, his top priority has been preserving endangered species such as the Apollo Butterfly, dung beetles and giant water bugs. Starting with only two Apollo Butterflies, Lee has so far reproduced 500 of the butterflies over the past several years. While raising them, he discovered an interesting characteristic three years ago.“It was a cold day when the temperature dropped to around minus 27 degrees Celsius. Surprisingly, one hatched out from the egg in the cold weather. I found out that there is an intracellular freezing substance in the Apollo Butterfly,” he said. “I’m sure this substance can be beneficially used in our life someday.”In a different laboratory, he breeds giant water bugs in a large water tank. Most of the bugs have vanished due to the use of pesticides, Lee said. He spends around 40 million won ($37,000) a year on just feeding them as they only eat large fish. Outside of the institute’s building, the director also raises two cows because their excrement is essential to breeding the nearly extinct dung beetles. “What feeds dung beetles is not the cow’s excrement but the grass in it. Because most cows are forced to eat fodder and not grass these days, dung beetles have not been able to survive,” Lee said. All of these preservation efforts have been possible as HECRI has been designated a “non-habitat preservation institution” by the government, Lee said. Only those with designation can legally undertake the work of increasing the number of endangered insects or animals. As of this year, about 20 organizations are allowed to artificially raise and reproduce endangered species to prevent extinction, the Environment Ministry said. Lee has also been working for 16 years on publishing an illustrated book about some 500 types of larvae, one of the most in-depth in the world, he said. Larval research has not been globally active as it takes a long time and larvae drastically transform during growth, making it difficult to follow the full life cycle ― other studies have focused on only full-grown insects, not larvae. Thousands of types of larvae are still unidentified in Korea, Lee added. “Knowing the characteristics and identities of larvae is important because their substances they have can serve as useful resources,” he said. “Moths have always been killed by pesticides in the agricultural industry. If we know the characteristics of each type of larva, it will help farmers effectively target them with a small amount of pesticide.” The illustrated book is expected to be completed by next year. Lee’s organization is also open to those who want to experience nature and get a glimpse into the insect world. Lee has run on-site biodiversity classes for students since 1997, usually during school vacations. Upon reservation, private classes are also available year-round. The HECRI director was awarded the Camellia Medal of the Order of Civil Merit last year in recognition of his efforts into preserving endangered insects and raising awareness about them. It marked the first time an insect expert received the award. He previously won three other awards including the best environment award from Gangwon Province in 2004. What drives him is not just a love for insects, but also a sense of responsibility as tight budgets and an insufficient labor force sometimes pose challenges. “For me, running HECRI has been a sense of duty for the public. I need to raise both insect experts and endangered species for the country. My only hope is to save as many endangered species on the peninsula as I can,” Lee said.

Hong Joon-pyo’s stellar legal and political career is facing uncertainty as he faces a prosecutorial summons Friday as a key suspect in a burgeoning graft scandal.The prosecution said Wednesday that it would summon Hong on Friday morning at 10 a.m. to question him over allegations that he received 100 million won ($93,000) from late Keangnam chairman Sung Woan-jong in 2011. Hong is the the first of the eight political heavyweights involved in the high-profile bribery scandal to be questioned by the prosecution.Hong will also sit face-to-face with his junior prosecutors, a drastic turn of events for the former star prosecutor who gained respect and fame after investigating a number of crime rings and brought corrupt high-profile figures to court in the 1980s-1990s.The prosecution decided to call in Hong after the authorities obtained testimony from Yoon Seong-mo, the former vice president of Keangnam Enterprises, who claimed that he was the one who carried the political funds to the former four-term lawmaker four years ago. Hong was then running for chairman of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo. (Yonhap)But almost every day, the sharp-tongued governor has intensely resisted authorities’ attempt to press him over the graft allegation. He denied his involvement in the alleged bribery and counterattacked the prosecution, claiming that the officers may have controlled Yoon and fixed his testimony. During the four rounds of interrogations, Yoon testified that he delivered the money to Hong on Sung’s request. Yoon said the then-GNP lawmaker was with him when he gave the money to Hong’s aides, according to the prosecution. The governor tried to water down the claim, raising fresh speculation that Yoon has been making inconsistent testimonies. Hong claimed Yoon’s memory was not accurate because he delivered Sung’s money to many politicians. The bribery allegation escalated after Sung was found dead in an apparent suicide last month with a memo in his pocket that listed the names of eight politicians and the amount of money he claimed to have delivered to them. Hong’s name was listed next to the amount of 100 million won. Hong also argued that the prosecution would not be able to take Sung’s memo or voice recordings as key evidence in court as they are not credible. The prosecution appears confident about the case as authorities have also interrogated Hong’s aide to cross-check Yoon’s testimony. For the prosecution, the outcome of summoning Hong is crucial as they are also tasked to reveal the truth behind the scandal that involves President Park Geun-hye’s close confidants including former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and incumbent Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee.But the question remains on how the prosecution could indict Hong on bribery charges with a lack of concrete evidence to prove him guilty. Pundits said it would not be easy to bring the ex-prosecutor to court as he knows the process well.Hong rose to social stardom as he probed a slot machine gambling case and the politicians behind the illegal underground business in 1993. He also investigated high-profile cases such as the labor-management dispute of Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1987 and organized crime in the early 1990s.He earned his first parliamentary seat in 1996 and served in various high-level posts in the GNP including party chairman, floor leader and Supreme Council member. He was elected as governor in a by-election in December 2012 and was reelected to the post last year.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","faces prosecutorial summons friday ,prosecutorial summons friday ,prosecutorial summons friday as ,graft scandal the prosecution ,he faces prosecutorial summons","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo ’s', 'Hong', 'Keangnam', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Hong']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25645161  0.52659291

Students with different backgrounds, competence and skills ask different questions. This is a benefit for (students’) work in classrooms,” Dommers told The Korea Herald.Han Dommers, head of the education promotion department at EP-NufficHe explained that having an international classroom can be beneficial in several aspects, such as students are given an opportunity to meet people from other countries and work with them at the early stages of their lives ― the knowledge and network they build helps students pursue professional goals in their later lives.“You gain an interest in the country. When you do business, you know what kind of multinational staff the country has, what they can do there and where to find business,” he said.Dommers added that Dutch people historically understood the importance of the international experience, speaking from his own experience as a former diplomat. Rising as a global force in the 17th century through international trading, Dutch people appreciate the value of understanding and connecting with people from other countries. Even today, a foreign visitor asking for directions in the streets of the Hague can encounter at least a dozen Dutch people ― fluent in English ― eager to help.“I think we’re very open. When people from other countries visit, we are very hospitable,” he said. “The other day, someone wanted to see where Prince Henrik lived and we ended up just talking about the royal family.”Dommers also said Dutch people are not afraid of making mistakes when they speak in English, which is another reason behind their relatively high English skills.“We know we cannot speak perfectly because it’s not our native language. But that is okay because if you don’t speak, you don’t learn. You don’t connect (with people from other countries),” he said.The international aspect of Dutch education is reflected in the country’s some 2,100 higher education study programs and courses conducted in English, the most in continental Europe. This has helped to attract students from across the world to the Netherlands, which in turn has helped to prove the value of an international classroom. “International classrooms in particular can present challenges, because you have people from different backgrounds and cultures,” he said. “You don’t have time to learn everything, so if you talk with people from other countries it is always helpful.”But diversity in education is not just confined to working with classmates of different backgrounds. Dommers said students need to be pioneers to uncover the different aspects of the education. He said they should not be afraid to ask questions and challenge lecturers about their classes and not be content with just being fed the same information.As such, Dommers said the recent rise in online education ― such as Massive Open Online Courses ― have both benefits and shortcomings.“It is still important to meet each other and interact. When you ask questions via the Internet, it’s two-dimensional,” he said. He added that student-teacher interaction, critical to students’ developing creativity, is limited online.Despite its shortcomings, online education can help students with less financial means receive an education at a foreign university. The challenge is how to create ways for students to reap the benefits of an international classroom through the Internet.More open interaction with other students is one thing that some Korean students can work more on, Dommers said. But he also said he was impressed with the diligence and intelligence of Koreans when he worked with them, and Korean students in the Netherlands can help develop a foundation for connecting the two countries in the future.According to Dommers, this “public diplomacy” is a more abstract advantage of diverse education. By maintaining contact and understanding with each other, students from different countries can bring the two countries closer, he said. “What I like about Korean students is that they can become ambassadors for the relationship between Korea and the Netherlands,” Dommers said. “Of course, we need formal ambassadors for diplomatic relations. But in this era, we also need people from other countries who now work and live here to be ambassadors in other things in life.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","diversity helps improve education ,interview diversity helps improve ,universities across the netherlands ,at the student lounge ,herald interview diversity helps","['Nyenrode Business Universiteit', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands', 'Dutch', 'Han Dommers']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80314147  0.46841684

She finally secured one after 50 failed attempts to even get her resume through the first stage of the job interview. Her efforts included months of listening to special Internet classes and crammed studies for Chinese upon tips that some companies offer merits for multilingual skills. “As more companies opt to hire experienced workers, it seems that the doors for newbies seem to get narrower and more crowded,” Lee said.More than a million inexperienced jobseekers like Lee, have been facing growing competition from experienced candidates for their first jobs, as Korean companies increasingly prefer the latter amid mounting economic uncertainties.According to one of Korea’s biggest job search engines Saramin, one in four job postings on the site were geared toward skilled workers only. Only 5.5 percent of the jobs were posted for inexperienced jobseekers. About half of the total job openings were for both university graduates and those with experience. Companies in certain industries including IT, construction, manufacturing, chemical, design and media have been more actively seeking skilled employees, the tally showed.“We prefer to hire people with work experience of less than five years since they can use their skills at work right away,” said Kim Ji-hoon, who manages human resources at a Seoul-based manufacturing company. “The experienced take only a few months to achieve results while it takes at least a year for companies to train new employees and make sure they adjust to the corporate culture,” he added. For companies, hiring university applicants is part of a long-term investment strategy to nurture future leaders. But the deepening economic downturn deters them from recruiting students, Kim said. Yoon Ji-soo, who delayed her graduation to look for a job, said the situation was “frustrating.” “I can feel that experienced workers have a competitive edge in the job market,” said the 23-year-old, who majored in politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.“It is an irony that the companies want experienced workers but at the same time favor young job applicants. We all need somewhere to begin our career, don’t we?” she said. Lee Chang-won, director at Wage and Job Research center in Korea Labor Institute, pointed out that the companies’ preference for skilled employees could increase and prolong the youth unemployment situation, especially during the economic slump.South Korea’s youth unemployment rate stands at 9.2 percent, according to the latest official statistics, much higher than the overall unemployment rate of 4 percent. The real unemployment rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and those employed part time, is over double that at 21.8 percent. However, in the long run, it is positive that more jobs are available for experienced workers, according to Lee.“The increase in labor mobility is necessary to reduce the skills-job mismatch,” the director said. “The society just needs more trainee systems and internship programs to help young job seekers to gain work experience.”By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","after 50 failed attempts ,nearly three years trying ,crammed studies for chinese ,the job interview her ,three years trying to","['Lee Hyun', 'chinese']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33731264  0.33003384

Upon her return, she is expected to find a replacement for Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, who last week offered his resignation after being accused of receiving money from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong. Seven others from Park’s administration and the ruling Saenuri Party were also embroiled in the scandal, which is a major blow to Park. Lee has already relayed his duties as premier to Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan, and Park is expected to accept his resignation shortly after her return home, according to officials.Finding Lee’s replacement appears to be a daunting task, considering the past nomination fiascos that have ailed the Park administration: Three out of five prime ministerial candidates were felled by scandal prior to even taking office. Observers like politics professor Choi Young-jin of Choong-ang University have speculated that Lee’s successor is likely to be a politician with a neutral image to procure support from both ruling and opposition parties.Cheong Wa Dae is reportedly working on finding the next candidate for the premier, although some speculate the actual announcement may come after the parliamentary by-elections slated for Wednesday.Finding Lee’s replacement, however, appears to be the tip of the iceberg as Park faces a bitter struggle to regain the public’s trust.Some of those suspected of receiving money from Sung include people who were in charge of finance at Park’s election campaign during the 2012 presidential election, sparking suspicion the money was used as an illegal election fund.The main opposition New Politics for Alliance has defined the scandal as an illegal election funds case and suggested an independent parliamentary investigation. The party also protested against the ruling party’s “attempt to throw the blame” to the opposition by highlighting questions behind Sung’s special pardon by former President Roh Moo-hyun.“The integrity and legitimacy of Park administration is completely compromised, yet it continues to water down (the scandal) by dragging the opposition along instead of investigating the eight involved,” said NPAD leader Moon Jae-in. He added that Park is the “direct beneficiary” of the alleged transaction since the money supposedly given by Sung was used as election funds. “Park and Cheong Wa Dae must step away from commanding the investigation, and guarantee a fair probe,” Moon said. The Saenuri Party attempted to diffuse public frustration over the weekend.“The president will issue an apology of some form concerning the scandal during the investigation process,” Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters Sunday.Kim also said the next prime minister should be someone that could “bring the people together.”Upon her return, Park is expected to boost her political and social reform drive to overhaul the labor, education, public office and finance sectors, but she is likely to be cold-shouldered by the opposition, with intensifying protests from the involved parties.The government has so far warned stern punishment for those participating in last week’s strike against the government’s pension plans, a key element of Park’s social reform.Park’s approval rating dropped 5 percentage points to 34 percentage points immediately after the scandal, according to Gallup Korea. The president’s most recent approval rating ― announced Friday ― went up slightly to 35 percent.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","recent graft scandal ,fallout from sung scandal ,of recent graft scandal ,recent graft scandal that ,tour monday is expected","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Wan - koo']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55350029  0.33923632

""They said last week they'd be in touch later after dealing with some complicated issues. They said the invitation to Lee still stands.""  Kim was referring to a letter addressed to Lee by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in December. Lee had sent a wreath of flowers across the border to mark the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. In the letter, Kim Jong-un wrote that he was looking forward to having Lee in Pyongyang once the weather got warmer in 2015.  Kim Sung-jae said that because Kim Jong-un may be visiting Russia early in May for Moscow's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, sometime later in the month will be better suited for Lee's trip.  ""If we don't hear back from our North Korean counterparts later this month or early next month, then we will contact them again,"" Kim Sung-jae said. ""Since Kim Jong-un himself extended the invitation, I don't think we'll need to discuss whether (Lee) will meet with him.""  Lee had first expressed her wish to travel to North Korea for humanitarian purposes when she met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye in October. Park then indicated she would approve such a trip once a formal request is made. North Korea also gave her a green light.  Any trip by South Koreans to North Korea requires the South Korean government's approval along with the North's consent. The two technically remain in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.  Lee, 92, made her last trip to Pyongyang in 2011 to attend the funeral of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. She met with the younger Kim then.  Kim Dae-jung is popular in North Korea for his ""sunshine"" policy of actively pushing cross-border exchanges and reconciliation. After holding the first inter-Korean summit with the then North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in 2000, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the same year.  Lee joined her husband on that trip to Pyongyang.  Lee's move comes amid high inter-Korean tension over South Korea's joint military exercises with the United States.  South Korea completed Foal Eagle, its annual joint military exercise with the U.S., last week, as North Korea renewed its yearly threat of retaliation over what it claims is a rehearsal for a northward invasion.  With Foal Eagle out of the way, optimists expect the two Koreas to seek ways to ease tension. Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, Seoul's point man on Pyongyang, said at a recent press briefing that he was counting on ""more progress"" in the inter-Korean relations after April.  The Koreas, though, have at least one outstanding thorny issue: a wage row at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex.  They've been embroiled in the wage dispute since North Korea in March unilaterally increased the minimum wage by 5.18 percent to $74. South Korea hasn't accepted the move, saying that the North violated a prior agreement that calls for the two sides to jointly set the wages. The annual increase has been capped at 5 percent.   The two Koreas on Friday agreed to hold further talks on the issue.

As his behavior became distracting, Kim told him numerous times to stop. The student responded by pounding on the desk and swinging his pen with his fingers.Alarmed by the student’s behavior, the teacher consulted with the parents, only to find out the teen was addicted to the Internet. “He was an introvert who didn’t have many friends in school, and both of his parents were working. As an only child, he would spend a lot of time alone at home,” Kim wrote in a report submitted to an NGO specializing in education and youth rights. Students learn about the danger of Internet addiction at a middle school in Seoul. (Yonhap)“Unlike many teens who are addicted to online games, he was actually addicted to online chatting. He said when he was offline, he was constantly worried about what his friends, all of whom he met and interacted with online, would be talking about without him in the chatrooms. Most of his social activities were taking place in cyberspace, and being offline made him feel extremely anxious and isolated.”The student is one of a growing number of South Korean teens who are addicted to the Internet and smartphones. According to the latest government data, the number of teenagers who are at risk of Internet or smartphone addiction has been rising over the past three years.As of last year, 29 percent of all teenagers were at risk of smartphone addiction, while 12.5 percent were at risk of Internet addiction disorder. Data also found that children of double-income families and single-parent households are most likely to develop media addiction.“Most addictions are not just caused by what people are addicted to. For example, game addiction is not solely caused by the game itself. There is always something else,” said Cho Hye-jin, who has met teen Internet addicts at the National Information Society Agency. “A lot of the times, teen Internet addicts have problems with their relationships with their family members or friends. It can also be related to a lack of parental presence or attention. Very often, they start by using the Internet, games and SNS as a way to indulge their social or emotional needs (that are not being met by their parents).”Symptoms of Internet addiction can have extremely negative effects on teenagers and their lives, experts said. Signs of addiction include difficulty waking up for school, feelings of anxiousness when they are not online including shakiness and moodiness, sleep disturbance and having trouble completing tasks at school and home. The addiction may also lead to isolation from family and friends.One of the teen smartphone addicts currently being treated at the National Information Society Agency physically attacked her parents when she had her smartphone taken away. The middle school student threatened to commit suicide if she did not get her phone back, and repeatedly claimed that she would be bullied at school if she did not constantly participate in KakaoTalk group conversations. The teen was eventually taken to the agency after her parents thought she was spending too much time alone with her phone.“Children who are addicted to the Internet have a high chance of missing out on normal teen life and experiences, which are crucial for the successful transition into adulthood,” said Kim Sung-byuk, who oversees media policies for teenagers at the Gender Equality Ministry.An unhappy childhood or teenage years may also lead to addiction. A man in his early 20s was treated at the National Information Society Agency last year for online game addiction. Growing up, he was often emotionally abused by his stepfather, while his mother was negligent. When he was bullied as a teenager by his classmates, he was not convinced that his parents would help him, so he endured the abuse without telling anyone. However, he received good grades and eventually enrolled in a university, but soon afterward he became addicted to online games. Before seeking help at the agency, he had been skipping all of his classes to play games in his room alone. He claimed it was the only way for him to “relieve stress and communicate with the world.”“The key is to find out exactly what caused the addiction, rather than simply getting rid of what the person is addicted to,” said Cho from the agency. “Banning games from game addicts won’t solve the situation. Once the real cause of the addiction, such as family problems, is solved, the addiction usually goes away naturally. This is why parents of teen addicts are also encouraged to receive therapy, because they can very often be the cause of their child’s addictive behaviors.”Meanwhile, the number of double-income families keeps increasing in Korea. As of 2013, there are more than 5 million double-income households, accounting for 43 percent of all households in the country. Psychiatrist Jeong Yu-sook from Samsung Medical Center said a lack of parental presence, combined with smartphone overuse, may generate undesirable consequences for children and teenagers. “It just takes away their chance to socialize as young children,” she said. “When a person is not socialized enough as a child or a teenager, they have a higher chance of developing personality disorders, such as narcissistic personality disorder.”A high school teacher, who only wanted to be identified with her last name Oh, feels today’s hyper-connected culture inevitably affects the way Korean teenagers socialize with one another ― but not necessarily in a positive way.“I’ve seen my students using KakaoTalk for occasions that require you to do it in person or at least through a phone call,” she said. “They’d break up with their boyfriends or girlfriends by sending a single text message. They’d cut off all contact with someone they didn’t want to be friends anymore ― by just ignoring texts and not texting at all ― instead of explaining in person why they wanted to end the relationship. This concerns me about our next generation.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","school math teacher noticed ,middle school math teacher ,school math teacher ,math teacher noticed ,internet addiction few years","['Kim Seon - jung', 'Kim']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.02225518  0.25518659

Inside its 13th-century castle estate, students from all over the world discuss issues of international business. Nyenrode was founded by Dutch industry leaders such as KLM, Shell and Philips in 1946. Since then, it has focused on showing students how to cope with dynamic, real-world challenges instead of simply transferring knowledge.“It’s not about theory ― it’s about practice. Can you use that theory tomorrow? This is why we invite a lot of our alumni and top entrepreneurs to also teach here,” said Misa Dzoljic, a rector magnificus and the CEO of the school. His title alone offers hints at the school’s principles of “for and by business.”Potential applicants of the Nyenrode Business Universiteit’s MBA program pose at the University campus. (Nyenrode Business Universiteit)Entrepreneurship along with leadership have always been one of the university’s key values, he explained, but it is just as important for future leaders to be responsible. While it is important for leaders to seek profit for their organization, Dzoljic explained that leadership and entrepreneurship without stewardship can be “devastating” in the business world. Balancing leadership and entrepreneurship is essential in ensuring that people take responsibility not only for stakeholders but also for the future generations he said.Bob de Wit, professor of strategic leadership, pointed out that social responsibility is one of biggest changes for today’s companies. He took the example of Nike, a behemoth in the field of sports products which became embroiled in a scandal over child labor.De Wit pointed out that students from the University of Oregon ― which had a close relationship with the company ― worked to form a governance organization that monitored its activities to ensure that it acted socially responsible. “Only on the basis of meeting the society’s needs, you can be profitable,” he said.Nyenrode has made plenty of efforts not to become outdated in a rapidly changing society. As part of such efforts, it has emphasized practical learning and firsthand experience in the business world. In the course of practical learning, students are challenged to understand, analyze and come up with the ideal solution for the challenge at hand. Last month, an “MBA Weekend” for potential applicants of the school’s international MBA program took place. During the weekend, students participated in one of the program’s classes where they were to provide business consultation for a newly appointed fictional company leader dealing with an embezzlement case.In the animated discussions that ensued, they presented various options including firing the corrupt officials, sending them to a lower position, conducting an internal probe and even leaking the case to the press.“If I was the CEO in this situation, I would’ve stopped the presentation and said that’s enough,” said Christo Nel, program director of the full-time international MBA and executive MBA programs, during one of the presentations. His issue was not that the ideas were bad, but the dragging first minutes of the presentation.Speaking from his experience running a business consulting firm, Nel explained that the CEO would not sit through a presentation where the content is what he or she already knows.“Students are required to move from merely understanding the problem to deeply analyzing and coming up with execution plans,” he said. “This is the key thing that management and organizations want. They want people who can not only analyze the situation, but also come up with recommendations on how to (address) it.”Also for lecturers in MBA courses, it is important to understand that teaching everything one knows is impossible, Nel said. The main thing is to select key pieces of information needed to stimulate students’ learning.“We want to create people who are critical thinkers, analysts, decision-makers and executioners of plan,” Nel explained.In the course of training for such qualities, students are asked to self-evaluate their goals, merits and motivations, explained Victoria Bressers, the school’s adviser for careers and personal development. In addition, students are also motivated to become leaders.“As a student, you learn to work in groups, and you don’t always work with people you get on well with. Students learn how they work best and how they can get the best out of other people, because that is (the) quality of a leader,” she said.While discussion-based lessons are relatively common in education today, perhaps one of Nyenrode’s most distinctive offerings is its “Meet the CEO” sessions, in which participants of the international MBA programs visit organizations to interact with the CEO and his or her team. Desiree Van Gorp, Nyenrode’s associate dean of degrees programs, explained that such a method allows students to get a better feel for the industry and learn which issues are at stake in the actual field.“The idea is to have students get different experiences working with many different companies,” she said. “They also get to see what the CEOs are like and how they got to where they are right now.”Students are also given an opportunity for practical application of their knowledge while building their network at the professional level. The point, however, is not to just acquire experience, but to make plausible solutions for the organization related to problems it may be facing. “It demands a lot from the student. You don’t just sit there ― you are really required to deliver.”Dzoljic explained that the university has been keeping a close relationship with the business world. He added this is why many of the faculty members retain positions outside the university.“We encourage, sometimes demand that they (the faculty) are practicing outside, so they know what is going on outside these beautiful walls. This is very important for students because they will see immediately when (professors) are just teaching out of books,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","only private university resides ,dutch capital of amsterdam ,century castle estate students ,country only private university ,only private university","['dutch', 'Amsterdam', 'Breukelen', 'Vecht', 'Nyenrode Business Universiteit', 'Du']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8053239   0.59501338

The main opposition, New Politics Alliance for Democracy, also vowed a low-key campaign. “We will refrain from singing campaign songs and shouting political slogans. We will wear yellow ribbons in honor of the victims of the Sewol sinking,” said an official from the opposition party. The election is scheduled to take place on April 29 and will fill four seats in Seoul, Gwangju, Incheon, and in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. Three seats in Seoul, Gwangju and Seongnam were vacated by the Unified Progressive Party’s dissolution by the Constitutional Court in December. A seat in Incheon is also being contested as the incumbent lawmaker lost his seat after he violated election laws. Constituents in Seoul’s Gwanak-B and Gwangju’s Seo-gu have traditionally favored liberal parties. Since the 13th general election in 1988, liberal party candidates have won every election in those districts. On the other hand, constituents in Incheon and Seongnam have voted for conservative parties in recent years. Political experts said the coming election will be influenced by graft scandals surrounding deceased businessman Sung Wan-jong, who claimed he gave illicit money to high ranking government officials. “The latest events could work in favor of the NAPD,” said Lee Jung-hee, political science professor of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “But that doesn’t mean the NAPD will be assured of victory. The opposition would be making a mistake if it tries to politicize the scandal and assume that people perceive them as being clean or approve of their (offensive),” Lee said.By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","to slow start thursday ,this month by election ,slow start thursday ,left 295 people dead ,slow start thursday as",[],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49220008  0.57798028

Kim Sang-min of the ruling Saenuri Party held a forum on Tuesday on the Park Geun-hye administration’s “half-price” college tuition policy. In a self-styled pat on the back, they deemed it a “mission accomplished” and talked about future challenges. Their “celebration,” however, seemed to leave many college students perplexed. They asked how the government could deem their job complete when actual tuition costs remain largely unchanged, let alone cut in half as promised by Park as one of her key presidential campaign pledges.According to Korea Higher Education Research Institute, the average tuition for private and public colleges in 2014 were 7.34 million won and 4.18 million won, respectively, compared to 7.39 million and 4.19 million in 2012 when the policy officially kicked off. “What has changed? My friends and I still pay pretty much the same amount for tuition,” said a student surnamed Yoo at Ewha Womans University.Such disparity in perception stems from the fact that the governmental policy, while called half-priced tuition, is actually about reducing the financial burden for tuition by repressing tuition hikes, encouraging colleges to expand their scholarship programs and increasing state-funded scholarships for students from low-income families.According to the ministry, the annual college tuition at all public and private colleges reached about 14 trillion won in 2011. The state scholarship program for 2015 is earmarked at 3.9 trillion won, while the colleges’ overall scholarships account for 2.4 trillion won, and the accumulated amount of tuition cuts between 2012 and 2015 is expected to be about 710 billion won. This adds up to about 7 trillion won, half of the 14 trillion won, thus halving the financial burden on class fees for students, at least according to the ministry. Mission accomplished? Hardly.The 2.4 trillion won in school scholarships is a key factor in the policy. But the colleges were already providing 1.8 trillion won worth of scholarships in 2011, independent of the half-price tuition policy.While the actual increase is only by 600 million won, the ministry was seen to be highlighting the total amount of 2.4 trillion won, leading many to misperceive the actual scope of government-led measures as bigger than it actually is.“(The ministry) is just basically playing with words here. By definition, additional acquirement (of scholarships) should be separated from the already existing ones,” an official from the KHERI pointed out.Apart from the contentious use of the term “half-price tuition,” there is also no guarantee that colleges nationwide would continue to refrain from raising tuition fees.Earlier this year, Ewha announced that it would raise its tuition by 2.4 percent, the maximum amount set by the government this year. But after an unscheduled visit by Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea, the university abruptly announced that it would freeze the fees, sparking suspicions that Hwang’s visit may have pressured one of the priciest universities in Korea to alter its plans. This raises another question about the policy’s sustainability: Will the minister have to pay a special visit to each university and college every time it decides to defy the government guidelines?In its earlier report, the KHERI has pointed out that the cut-price tuition policy depends largely on the colleges’ efforts. Even Hwang himself has acknowledged that securing various sources of funding to supplement the policy was crucial to keeping it running.The KHERI official also pointed out that the ministry has drastically cut the budget for “type 2” scholarships. The type 2 scholarship is provided as an incentive for colleges that choose not to raise tuition.“Right after the type 2 was introduced, the average tuition at private and public colleges dropped by 4.7 percent and 3.9 percent. But after the budget cut, the cut rate dwindled noticeably,” he said. According to the KHERI, the tuition cut rates at the colleges dropped to 0.3-0.5 percent below those in 2013-2014. There has even been talk about abolishing the type 2 scholarship altogether, but experts have raised concerns that it will lead to a series of tuition hikes.How long can the Education Ministry repress overall tuition hikes? If the colleges choose not to comply, what would be its countermove? Is it even plausible as a long-term plan?The “success” of the half-price college tuition policy comes with multiple strings attached ― ones that the government has to address before touting its “accomplishments.” By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","leave many college students ,held forum on tuesday ,many college students perplexed ,half price college tuition ,college students perplexed they","['the Education Ministry', 'Kim Sang - min', 'Saenuri Party']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50207961  0.53672963

Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo attends the interpellation session at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Yonhap""I will resign from my post if facts are clearly found that (I) received the money,"" Lee said before attending a session at the National Assembly.Lee is one of eight heavyweight politicians listed on a ""bribery list"" left behind by Sung, who once served as a one-term lawmaker.The memo showed won figures written next to the names of six out of eight politicians, indicating that they had received money.No won figures were written next to Lee's name or that of President Park Geun-hye's current chief of staff, Lee Byung-kee.Still, Sung claimed in a newspaper interview published Tuesday that he gave 30 million won ($27,000) in cash to Lee while Lee was running for a parliamentary seat in April 2013. Sung had the telephone interview with the newspaper just before his suicide.""I have not even taken a penny from the former chairman Sung,"" Lee told reporters on his way to work.The bribery allegation came a month after Lee declared an ""all-out war"" on corruption, saying the government will mobilize all its resources to root it out.The presidential office said it is taking a wait-and-see attitude on Lee's alleged bribe-taking, citing a prosecution probe into the corruption scandal.Lee said Monday that he will appear before prosecutors over their ongoing investigation into the scandal, if asked.The prosecution has launched an investigation into the corruption scandal involving some of Park's close aides.The eight politicians include Park's two former chiefs of staff -- Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon -- as well as her current chief of staff, Lee Byung-kee.

104,104,104,Stress takes its toll on young parents,"Every morning at Sungwon Daycare Center in Seongsu-dong, Seoul, when children exchange their hellos, the routine is to go around asking each other how they feel. “I am sad,” says one of the 5-year-olds in the classroom. “Why?” the whole class asks him.“Because my mom came home late last night.

I couldn’t see her before going to bed. And when I woke up this morning, she already left for work.”“It’s OK! It’s OK!” the kids tell him loudly with impish grins, as the teacher consoles him. “Going to work doesn’t mean your mom doesn’t love you. I’m sure she misses you at work right now.” Parents participate in a reading session at a state-run child care center in Gangil-dong, Seoul on March 11. Seoul City has designated every Wednesday of a second week as an open child care center day for better interaction between teachers and parents. (Yonhap)At Sungwon, one of the state-run day care centers, children arrive as early as 7:30 a.m. and stay as late as 9 p.m. Many of them are children of double-income families, whose parents don’t have any extended family members to help with child care. As of 2013, there are more than 5 million double-income households in Korea, accounting for 43 percent of all households in the country. With an increasing number of women in the workforce, along with poor work-life balance, more young parents are said to be suffering from parental stress, which inevitably reflects on the well-being of their children.Park Chun-hwa, one of the day care workers at Sungwon, said she’s been witnessing a growing number of children with behavioral and developmental problems ― many of them apparently resulting from the lack of interaction with their parents. One of the kids she’s taken care of, who was 3 years old, hadn’t been toilet trained and arrived at the center wearing diapers on his first day.“I would train him during weekdays, but he’d return the next week in wet diapers again,” she told The Korea Herald. “Being busy as a working parent is one thing. But there are also responsibilities that all parents should be fulfilling.”For a 30-year-old working mother surnamed Jung with a 4-year-old son, the biggest challenge about child care is the sense of helplessness. With both her parents and in-laws living about four hours away from Seoul, Jung currently sends her child to a day care center, where he spends about eight to 10 hours a day. “On top of the stress from work, the worst feeling is this sense of living in the dark,” she told The Korea Herald. “I’m supposed to be in charge of child care but very often I have no idea if I’m doing it right. My son was a late talker, and I was devastated thinking it was my fault (because I couldn’t quit my job for him). I would constantly think I may be doing something wrong and it would make me anxious, guilty and even depressed.”Overseas studies have long shown that personal stress influences a parent’s behavior toward their children. Parents who are financially struggling or having marriage stress have a higher chance of abusing ― or neglecting ― their children, according to a 1991 study by Michigan State University.Along with stress, social isolation of a parent because of having to raise a child alone has also been linked to child abuse and neglect, according to a 2002 report by the World Health Organization. On top of poor work-life balance, the limited number of public day care centers has been a problem for many parents in recent years. While the state-run facilities ― known for their quality programs and cheaper tuition ― have been popular among parents, very few have benefited from the service because of their scarcity. As of 2012, public day care centers only accounted for 5.2 percent of all day care facilities in the country, according to Korea Institute of Child Care and Education.But ultimately, healthy and constructive child care depends on individual efforts by the parents, experts said.Choi Yoon-sook, the president of Sungwon Day Care Center, said it was important for parents to actively seek help for parental stress if needed and educate themselves on child care. Physical and mental well-being of a parent, as well as their awareness and knowledge, are important for their child’s development, she said.“Children are a mirror of their parents,” she said. “If a child is not paying attention when someone else is talking, the chances are his parents don’t pay attention to him when he tries to talk to them.”Choi said a significant factor in parental abuse is that many of the abusers mistake violence as a way to discipline their children. In Korea, the number of child abuse cases increased by 44 percent last year from 2013, with 80 percent of the abusers being parents.According to the 2002 WHO report, many child abuse survivors develop a number of psychological problems, including anxiety disorders and depression as well as feelings of shame and guilt.“This is why educating parents is important,” she said. “I really think there should be more support and educational programs for young parents.”For working parents with limited time, Choi said it’s about quality not quantity. “Try to give your full attention to your child every day, even if it means just 30 minutes a day,” she said. “You have to be consistent. The point is to do it every day and build trust over time. This eventually lets your child know that you care in spite of your busy schedule.”An Hui-jean, a professional counsellor, advises parents to put their spouses before their children, as “happy marriages produce happy children.” Most Korean families have traditionally been child-centric, she said, meaning many parents would sacrifice their marital or personal happiness to support their children. “Your first priority should be your spouse and yourself, not your children ― always,” she said. “Marriage, not children, is the foundation of a family. Studies have shown that those who were raised by content parents who put their marriage first are happier than those who grew up in child-centric homes led by unhappy parents or parents with marital conflict.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","mom came home late ,young parents every morning ,parents every morning ,morning at sungwon daycare ,parents every morning at","['Seongsu - dong', 'Seoul']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30914047  0.6024335

She and her husband, a retiree in his late 60s, spent almost 200 million won ($182,000) for his wedding and housing, thinking they were still financially safe with their personal savings and private pension payments. But things turned difficult for them when Kim’s mother, 80, was diagnosed with dementia three years ago. In spite of the medical treatment paid by the couple, Kim’s mother’s condition quickly worsened ― to a degree where she could not recognize her own children. Kim, who suffers from her own health problems including osteoporosis, is thinking of placing their mother, who currently lives with Kim, in a residential medical facility for the elderly. “I thought my husband and I were well prepared for our post-retirement years, but I’m not sure anymore,” she said. “I don’t want my mother to stay at an ill-equipped facility, but the ones that I like cost about 1.3 million to 1.5 million won a month. My husband is diabetic and I have osteoporosis. We don’t have major health issues, but I’m just constantly worried about our finances because I don’t know what will happen next.”Kim is one of more than 6.8 million baby boomers (those born 1955 to 1963) who are entering their 60s this year. The government predicts that medical costs for the elderly will continue to rise as the boomers’ population begins to grow older, thereby doubling the current elderly demographic ― those aged 65 or older ― to more than 7.2 million.“It is certainly worrisome because the cost for the boomers increased by 31 percent from 2010 to 2014, which is more than the cost for those currently aged 65 or 74 increased in the same time period, at 20. 3 percent,” said an official from the Health Ministry. Last year, about one-third of total medical costs ― 19.4 trillion won ― was spent to treat the elderly, who already account for 11.9 percent of the total Korean population. The cost increased by 10.4 percent from the year before, mostly due to the increased number of those aged 75 or older who sought medical help for dementia and cerebrovascular diseases, according to the latest government data. While the cost for those aged 65 to 74 increased by 20.3 percent from 2010 to 2014, the cost for individuals aged 75 or older rose dramatically by 69.9 percent in the same period. Among patients aged 75 or older, the cost to treat dementia increased by 138.4 percent from 2010 to 2014, while the cost to treat Parkinson’s disease rose by 204.5 percent in the five-year period. Shin Hyun-chul, a researcher at the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, said while many baby boomers today are supporting their parents ― mostly aged 75 or older ― with their medical costs, it is unclear if they would be able to receive support from their children if they become ill in their later years. “All we know for sure is that the cost will be huge to treat baby boomers,” he said. “But we don’t know who is going to pay for it.”Experts say both the physical and mental well-being of the elderly is already at risk. According to the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, almost 70 percent of all senior citizens either lived by themselves or with their spouses. The average monthly income for a single elderly person was 799,400 won, which is less than half the country’s average household income at 3.53 million won. About 35 percent of their income was from national pension payments, while 23.8 percent came from their children. Only 27.8 percent of their income was from their own work.Korea’s elderly suicide rate was 81.9 for every 100,000 in the population in 2012, the highest among the OECD. According to data from the National Assembly Budget Office, 73.6 percent of senior citizens from 2006-2012 thought of killing themselves the most when they faced financial difficulties or illnesses. The poverty rate for elderly households was 49.3 percent in 2013, according to Statistics Korea.Almost 90 percent of the elderly were also suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure, while one-third were either depressed or obese as of last year. Physical inactivity is considered one of the major risk factors for dementia, as indicated by more than 80 percent of the elderly spending their leisure time watching TV. The Health Ministry expects that the number of those with dementia will exceed those who are aged 65 or older by 2024.Professor Lee Geum-yong, who specializes in welfare programs for the elderly at Sangmyung University, said the government should develop preventive measures to combat aging-related diseases, especially dementia. “I think the only actions we can take are preventive ones, as we can’t stop the baby boomers from growing old,” he said.Studies have shown that an appropriate lifestyle, including a healthy diet, regular exercise and an active social life, can delay or prevent brain disease. “Local health and welfare centers should take on that role. Senior citizens should learn to socialize with others and exercise regularly. They should also be introduced to more recreational activities, so they can avoid drinking or just spending their time alone at home.”Even for many millennials, their parents’ post-retirement years are some of their biggest worries. “I don’t know if I should even get married, because once I start supporting my own kids, I wouldn’t be able to support my parents,” said a 27-year-old who wished to be identified only as Park. Her parents do not have a lot of retirement savings and the only income they’d have as retirees would be national pension payments. Park currently works as an intern at a large conglomerate and does not support them.“Once, my mother told me that her generation is the last generation to support their parents and the last to be ‘abandoned’ by their children. I don’t think she understands the situation of today’s labor market. What she said makes me sad and anxious (to get a full-time job) at the same time.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","year old housewife ,her son wedding four ,58 year old housewife ,year old housewife sometimes ,old housewife",['Kim Nan - hee'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84041607  0.41876158

With a water tower built by the Korea International Cooperation Agency, she is now able to focus on her study, dreaming of becoming a math teacher one day. Now, her family and some 3,200 villagers no longer suffer from diarrhea, skin irritations and water-borne infectious diseases. “Since the arrival of the borehole, we’ve been enjoying its good, positive impact as we no longer have to go to faraway wells. I love going to school without having to worry about water,” Sow said. Belly Namary is one of the 12 towns with a collective population of about 100,000 that are basking in the transformation in their lives, powered by enhanced access to water. The facility is capable of storing 150 tons of water, hoisted from aquifers 300 to 400 meters below the surface. The water is available for 300 CFA francs (50 cents) per ton, which means an average family of 20 people pay around 1,500 to 2,000 CFA francs a month. The funds are spent on repair and maintenance, officials say. KOICA initiated the project in 2010 with a budget of $5.5 million, including the installment of generators and pumps, training local engineers and managers, and public education on sanitation.  Students cultivate crops at a model farm built by the Korea International Cooperation Agency at a technical high school in Thies, Senegal. (KOICA)“The water tower marks the first-ever system in Belly Namary’s 230-year history in which the residents are capable of drawing water in their own neighborhood,” said Jung Rak-myeong, director of Dongbu Engineering, which is in charge of the project in Senegal.“We had provided necessary training for five months until the end of March so that locals can operate the system on their own.” While France, Japan and other donors opted to dig larger wells in urban areas, KOICA turned to rural communities to shore up water supply and agricultural development, the mainstay of the country’s economy, in line with the Senegalese government’s request. Dakar aims to install 300 water towers throughout the country by 2017 and increase access to potable water from the current 66 percent to 82 percent in rural areas and 100 percent in cities over the next five years. “The main difference with other donor countries is that Korea has an advantage in that once it decides, it goes quickly and implements; in some cases we end up waiting three years before the work begins,” said Diene Faye, secretary of state for rural hydraulics, in an interview with visiting Korean reporters. “They are also flexible and open such as when forecasting problems and preparing for and adapting to them ... We appreciate their commitment to capacity building as well.” Most residents of Belly Namary make a living by working in 64 plantation fields raising cows, sheep and goats, which requires a constant flow of water. But its absence had forced many to wander from place to place, while others traveled on foot for up to four hours every day to often-contaminated traditional wells. To cater to the urgent sanitation needs, KOICA set up model toilets and shower facilities in several households and provided hygiene education, according to Song Ki-jeong, representative of KOICA’s Senegal office. With the program nearing an end, the grant-aid agency plans to launch another $5 million project in the coming months in which it will erect 10 boreholes for three years. “In the past, water shortages were a big problem, especially feeding animals,” said Oumou Nariel Sow, a housewife. “We couldn’t prepare for meals, girls could not go to school and animals died. With the borehole, we’re able to enjoy good quality water ― animals are healthy and people look better.” In Thies, some 57 kilometers east of capital Dakar, KOICA supports agricultural development by setting up an automatic irrigation system and teaching cultivation techniques at a model farm built within a technical high school. The institution, Lycee d’Enseigne­ment Technique et de la Formation Professionnelle, offers high-quality vocational education in areas such as electric engineering, electronics, architecture and automobiles to about 1,100 students. Some 100 of them are agriculture majors and after graduation a majority will go to college or land a job at state agricultural agencies.“I was deeply touched when students came out to look after their crops out of their regular class hours,” says Lim Seung-hwi, a 24-year-old KOICA volunteer. “Thanks to the automation, the students no longer have to spend most of the two-hour class watering the plants and can learn other useful knowledge.”The $30,000 program is designed to raise agricultural efficiency, crop yields and eventually revenue. Lim teaches new farming tools and introduces tools and how to use them, including food processing and fertilization techniques, says Name Ndack Dior Sarre, an 18-year-old student. “Irrigation is crucial to the sustainable management of water and plant nutrition. Before we started the automatic scheme, farmers had given water by hand, which resulted in lots of water wasted and greater physical labor,” says Daour Sene, principal of the school. “With agriculture being the main source of income here, the main goal of this project is to teach promising farmers and scale up the farming area from here all the way to Darka, while raising the self-sufficiency of vegetables at home and exports.” On a sunny day afternoon, the lush leaves of lettuce and other salad greens were flourishing. Onions, carrots and tomatoes were among other staples, but the type of crops depend on the demand from the area, with mango and papaya being newly tested. Albeit small in scale, the project is aimed at contributing to Senegal’s efforts to boost food supplies around the country and lay the foundation for secondary and tertiary industries, KOICA’s Song said. Senegal President Macky Sall has unveiled a vision to foster competitive, diversified and sustainable agriculture. The Accelerated Program for Agriculture in Senegal, or PRACAS, focuses on pushing up self-sufficiency in rice and outputs and exports in groundnuts, fruits and vegetables, increasing rural incomes and expanding jobs.Dogo Seck, General Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment, expressed hope that Korea’s knowhow and assistance will spur the drive. He said he has found similarities between PRACAS and the Saemaul movement, a 1970-80s rural reform initiative, such as the significance of human commitment. “To realize PRACAS, we’re working on how to mobilize labor in agriculture in partnership with Korean corporations,” he said in an interview. “I believe we can take some lessons from Saemaul’s success in Korea to apply similar solutions for socioeconomic development in Senegal.” By Shin Hyon-hee, Korea Herald correspondent (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","girls in her rural ,her 14 member family ,math at school with ,water for her 14 ,an obligation for girls","['BELLY NAMARY / THIES', 'Nariel Sow', 'Belly Namary', 'Senegal', 'French', 'Kor']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24751398  0.13672407

After months of an agonizing search for an alternative, a 38-year-old father of 1-year-old twins made an “unthinkable” decision to become a stay-at-home dad for the next year.Lee Dong-hoon joined the pioneering 4.4 percent of fathers in the country that spurned conventional thinking and took a leave of absence.The day he became the “mom,” he saw his wife ― who felt guilty about leaving her children behind, but excited to get back to “real world” ― return to work after a yearlong spell of maternity leave.As he turned around, two sets of twinkling eyes stared back at him, as if to say, “So what can you do for us?”A month has passed, and he is sure he is now quite good at it. Sometimes better than his wife.Jeong Min-seong, a father on paternity leave since last June for his 19-month-old son, also says he is quite confident now, as he feeds his boy, bathes him, takes him to day care, and does pretty much what all mothers do.“Although I’ve got the hang of it now, I do worry whether I fail to give him the delicate care that his mom could provide.”What helped him was a gathering of other fathers on paternity leave. “Although we have nothing else in common, sharing tips helped prevent the so-called ‘child care solitude,’” he said.For Lee, the day goes by unbelievably quickly, yet ironically slowly. Half the time he is feeding and cleaning after babies with astonishingly large stomachs and clumsy fingers. Sometimes the children’s grandmother or the aunt stops by, which he says is like finding an oasis at a desert.“I won’t say it’s not hard. But I also cannot say which is harder, going to work or taking care of the babies. ... It’s a different kind of hard,” he said.What was more difficult was the process of making the decision to switch roles. His friends told him he must be crazy, while his parents and in-laws remained in fraught silence.It meant he was putting an abrupt halt to his 11-year-long career, a frightful scenario for the older generation.The decision, however, was inevitable. “The only other option was to have the kids stay at the day care center for 12 straight hours every day, which still would have required us to hire help and juggle schedules among the grandparents.”His colleagues at work were surprisingly supportive, as they knew, many from personal experience, how hard it is to balance work and raising children. For many of them, he was a source of envy as they relied on their parents to take care of their own kids, like the 64.5 percent of dual-income households nationwide, according to Statistics Korea figures from 2014.A 40-year-old father of two surnamed Park, agrees the atmosphere has changed slowly yet significantly since he took his paternity leave three years ago.“Back then, it was hard even to broach the subject. Now, I see more of my male subordinates discuss it openly and the company being more understanding, thanks to outpouring media reports on dads’ new roles and expanding government support for paternal child care,” Park said.The government has been pushing to urge more fathers to take paternity leave, largely as part of the efforts to fight the country’s low birthrate. A company that refuses to grant paternity leave would face a penalty of up to 5 million won. Last year, a total of 3,421 fathers took paternity leave, compared to 2,293 a year before. While still small, it marked a 49 percent year-on-year increase. “I don’t think my case represents the changing role between a man and a woman, but rather, the changing priorities in life. Earning money for the family is no longer the biggest contribution to the family, but to be more family-oriented,” Lee said.The reality, however, is still at a baby’s step. Of the fathers on paternity leave nationwide, 53 percent of them are employed at large companies with at least 300 employees according to statistics from the Employment Ministry, meaning workers at smaller workplaces are still neglected by the system. Asked whether they would recommend other dads to take the leave, all three said, “definitely.”“You get to see a world that you could not see. It’s the best decision I made,” Park said.As the minority man in the still overwhelmingly feminine world of child care, Lee does still have to fight small battles each day.As he proudly takes a walk with one of the twins in a stroller and another on his back, people watch him with looks of half-pity and half-curiosity. He is the only man in the daily child care class that his toddlers attend, and it is near impossible to find a men’s restroom with a diaper changer.“It doesn’t faze me though. If I let it bother me, I wouldn’t have made the decision in the first place.”Already his “sacrifice” is paying off. His wife, who had nagged at him for most of the past year, has turned noticeably affectionate. His children learned to say “appa” (daddy) before “eomma” (mommy). He gloats as he watches his wife prod the twins to say “eomma.” Finally, peace has arrived.

Cho, however, said she “would like to apologize to victims. I regret my wrongdoings and ask for clemency,” as the judges gave her an opportunity to express her feelings.  Former Korean Air executive Cho Hyun-ah (Yonhap)During the first trial hearing of the so-called “nut rage” appeal case at Seoul High Court, Cho’s attorney reiterated an earlier argument that air carriers’ movement on landing strips is not included in the flight route under the current law.The 40-year-old de facto heiress of Korean Air was found to have ordered crewmembers of a flight from New York to Seoul on Dec. 5, 2014, that was taxiing to return to the airport gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport.Cho’s attorney claimed the nation’s aviation-related laws have ambiguous stipulations on the flight route ― whether or not the landing routes at airports are interpreted as a flight route.The attorney further asserted that a flight’s movement of 20 meters on land is not supervised under aviation security law, asking for the court’s mercy.In February, Seoul Seobu District Court found her guilty on several counts ― forcing flight route deviation, obstructing aviation safety and assaulting two cabin crewmembers physically and verbally.The court, however, dismissed the charges raised by the prosecution that Cho obstructed the duties of Korean Air executives, employees and inspectors from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation immediately after the incident.Prosecutors said Cho tried to destroy evidence of her behavior in the plane by abusing her authority as the vice president.Cho has been in prison for more than 90 days since she was taken into custody on Dec. 30.Park Chang-jin, the cabin manager who was deplaned by Cho, backed up several of the charges during his testimony at the district court trials. Cho was reportedly dissatisfied with the way Park’s junior attendant served her macadamia nuts ― in a bag and not on a plate.Meanwhile, the district court also handed down a jail term of eight months to a Korean Air executive director. In addition, a Transportation Ministry official was given a suspended prison term of six months, with probation for one year.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","heiress pleads for mercy ,violated law banning passengers ,korean air heiress pleads ,victims regret my wrongdoings ,she violated law banning","['Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'Cho', 'korean Air']",29,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.02031249 0.08942646 0.35258463],Kim Yon-se,Social affairs,4,2015,"court however dismissed the charges ,she violated law banning passengers ,appellate court wednesday to reverse ,court also handed down jail ,former vice president of korean","['Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'Cho', 'Korean Air', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Seoul High Court', 'Cho', 'Korean Air', 'New York', 'Seoul', 'John F.

Cautiously peering around, the woman appeared lost until she heard a familiar language from the other side of the room.“May I help you?” said 44-year-old Chinese worker Chen Jhi-hong in her mother tongue. The woman rushed to Chen as though she had found a savior. Chen asked for help in changing her home address for her registration. After a smooth process carrying out the task, the woman left feeling satisfied and protected. Three women from multicultural backgrounds help a foreign resident at Seongdong-gu Office in eastern Seoul. (Seongdong-gu Office)Chen is one of three Korean-speaking workers with non-Korean backgrounds at the office. She provides administrative support for foreign residents. Interpreting and translating in her mother tongue for expats, she serves as an important connection between the Korean community and Chinese residents. Adjusting to Korean society was not smooth for Chen, like many other expats in Korea.Chen came to Seoul in 2003 after marrying a Korean man. At first she struggled with cultural barriers and lost confidence when she was engaging in social activities.“I stayed home until my son was able to go to kindergarten. One day, my 5-year-old cried, saying his teacher seemed to dislike him. I wanted to ask the teacher what was going on but I couldn’t because I had not learned Korean,” she said.After that incident, she put enormous effort into studying Korean. Reminiscing about the difficulties she faced in the past, Chen has worked at the Seongdong-gu Office since last year in the hopes of helping others with similar hardships. “Whenever Chinese people thank me, I feel touched. It makes me realize that I can do something meaningful for others,” she said. “I’m so grateful to be here.” As successful as Chen’s job may be, her opportunity to help is still a rarity.As of January, 19 foreigners worked for the Seoul Metropolitan Government, including at district offices. Of the 25 district offices in the capital, seven have hired 10 foreign workers. Among them, only four are marriage immigrants with multicultural backgrounds, with three working at Seongdong-gu Office and one at Songpa-gu Office. The employees are hired as contracted workers and are yet to secure regular positions, according to the city.Like Chen, Kim So-yeong from the Philippines also benefited from the opportunity to help, which she attributes to her Korean-language skills. She was naturalized as a Korean citizen after marrying a Korean in 1997.To make a living for her two daughters, Kim first worked at a private company and academy before moving to the Seongdong-gu office in 2011. The 43-year-old Filipino is in charge of supporting English-speaking foreigners. “Many expats visiting here to ask me about job recruiting opportunities. I hope there are some training programs in which foreigners can learn useful skills and acquire certificates,” she said. Letiphuonghni from Vietnam works with Kim. She heard about the job two years ago from the Multicultural Family Support Center, which is run by the government. She mainly deals with interpretation and translation for Vietnamese residents. The 28-year-old adjusted relatively easily to her new environment. “Although the language difficulty still bothers me sometimes, I enjoy living here. I love Korean food and the transportation system here,” she said. “Even though I cannot see my family in Vietnam, everything is good here.”While she appreciates her job at the office, she still sometimes faces prejudice. “Even though there are a lot of multicultural families with Vietnamese roots here, some still view me with prejudice. I wish they see me with open-mindedness as just another Korean,” she said.

It also reflected changing norms in a traditionally patriarchal Korean society.“Amid a rapid rise in individualism and sexual openness, perceptions of marriage and sex are also changing,” the judges said at the hearing. While the court stoutly maintained that adultery was unethical, it said the law had to adapt to changing values among members of its society, including attitudes to love and sexuality. Divorce in South Korea, which is rooted in Confucian principles and patriarchal gender roles, was not too long ago considered unthinkable.Before the country’s recent industrialization, “families and households were the primary units of … economic activity,” according to Noriko O. Tsuya and Larry L. Bumpass, editors of “Marriage, Work and Family Life in Comparative Perspective.”“Women, and to a lesser degree, men depended on the ensuing family relations and kin network, and conjugal and parent-child relations were considered unbreakable, lifelong commitments,” wrote professors Tsuya and Bumpass.With the rise of individual wage earners displacing family-based production, “the once sacred notions of marriage ... and obligations to one’s family (gave way) to individual well-being and self-satisfaction.”The shift from collectivistic values to individualistic self-identity is illustrated in the rise of the “love marriage” in place of the conventional arranged marriage that were traditionally family alliances, “the joining of two ancestral lineages,” according to “Culture and Customs of Korea,” written by Donald N. Clark. Koreans are now marrying later and choosing to have fewer or no children, according to census data. The fertility rate has rapidly declined since the 1970s and reached a record low in 2005 in the country with the lowest birthrate among OECD member states.The crude divorce rate also increased sevenfold from 0.5 per 1,000 in 1975 to 3.5 in 2003 before declining to 2.6 in 2005, which nonetheless surpasses the rates in EU countries and Japan, according to Statistics Korea. Premarital sex is almost universal, though out-of-wedlock childbearing remains extremely low at 1-2 percent of all births, according to a 2009 study by Lee Sam-sik from the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. Accompanying these trends is a steady increase in socioeconomic gender equality. The female labor force participation rate, which comprised one-quarter in 1970 and rose to one-half in 1996, is currently at 55.6 percent, though it remains lower than the OECD average rate of 61.8 percent.“We cannot ignore the intensifying debate in this changing society that free engagement in sexual self-choice is being considered with regard to self-respect and the pursuit of happiness,” said the Constitutional Court on Feb. 26 on the petition against the adultery law.But the judges drew attention to the “undeniable fact” that the anticheating law had historically protected women, who were economically disadvantaged, giving them important leverage to secure compensation and alimony in the case of divorce.The Constitutional Court, however, cited other more recent laws in the civil court that now guarantee custody without gender prejudice and help protect underprivileged women in place of the adultery law. In fact, the adultery law was often used by husbands as a resort for revenge and to acquire financial benefit over “temporarily wayward housewives,” according to the court.Since the law, which punishes adultery for up to two years in prison, takes effect only when and for as long as a spouse presses charges, “the adulterer and his or her lover’s legal fates (hung) completely in the partner’s hands.” The most high-profile such case was in October 2008, when legal debate and public interest over the 1953 statute reached its peak. Korean actress Ok So-ri filed a petition against the adultery law, following her husband actor Park Chul’s lawsuit against her for having an extramarital sexual relationship with his friend, an operatic pop singer. Ok’s lawyers said the statute had “degenerated into a means of revenge” and that it constituted a “serious violation” of its citizens’ right to sexual freedom. Justice Kim Hee-ok said during the legal hearing that the adultery law “punished an act that ought only to be criticized ethically.” The Constitutional Court came one vote short of overturning the law. Ok and her lover were sentenced to eight and six months in prison, respectively, suspended for two years. For the most part, however, incidents of adultery were not prosecuted in criminal court. The Constitutional Court cited figures showing that less than 10 percent of reported adultery cases resulted in prison sentences as proof that the adultery law was “markedly weakening” as a punitive resort. Though about 30 percent of 2,000 surveyed men admitted to having extramarital sex, over 20 percent of those who committed adultery faced legal penalties, according to the Korean Women’s Development Institute in 2014. The Constitutional Court ruled that the adultery law was “completely ineffective” in saving marriages, which had often already broken down by the time the cases reached the criminal court, and that there was “no existing positive research” supporting its deterrent effect. Seven of the nine judges declared that “the sustainment of marriage should be entrusted to the free will and love of spouses,” rather than the state, which should be “less intrusive and controlling” over individuals’ right to self-choice. South Korea was until February one of only three non-Muslim Asian countries, along with Taiwan and the Philippines, to criminalize adultery.

The 35-year-old had no income at the time and was relying on a state subsidy to take care of her son. It took her a year and a half to win the case, with the court ordering her ex to pay her 300,000 won ($270) every month.Kim’s uphill battle, however, continued, as her ex-boyfriend cut off all contact shortly after the verdict, leaving Kim still empty-handed.“I didn’t want to go through that lawsuit ever again. ... It was the most stressful thing I’d ever done,” she told The Korea Herald. “What is worse is that all that stress was for nothing.” Kim is one of some 390,000 single parents in Korea who have never received child support from the other parent. In 2012, 83 percent of all single parents in the country said they were never paid child support. Of those, only 4.6 percent filed a lawsuit. Even among those who won their cases, 77.4 percent said they did not receive support from the other parent, in spite of a judgement from the court. As of 2014, 77.3 percent of all Korean single parents were women. In order to tackle the problem, the Gender Equality Ministry will begin the operation of an agency on Wednesday to support child-rearing single parents by enforcing child support payments. Those who utilize the agency’s services will be able to sue the other parent for a child support order for free and hire a collector to collect overdue payments. The agency will also help parents track down the other parent should they cut off contact to avoid payments. “The main goal of this newly launched service is to provide a safe environment for children of single-parent households and guarantee their access to necessary resources,” said Park Bok-soon, a scholar who participated in the foundation of the agency. Korea’s lack of late child support payment penalties, as well as enforcement, are linked to the country’s high overseas adoption rates, as well as the low income of single-parent households. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.According to government data, the average monthly income of single-parent households was 1.72 million won, which is less than half the average of all households in the country at 3.53 million won. Meanwhile, it costs about 5 million won to file a lawsuit to get child support. Shannon Doona Heit, a Korean adoptee and a Seoul-based activist, said the establishment of the agency was a “step in the right direction as far as ensuring the rights of unwed mothers to be able to raise their children.”“I think (Korea’s high overseas adoption rate) has been a combined problem of lack of paternal responsibility, both time and money, as well as lack of support from the government,” Heit said.“Knowing they are unable to enforce child support from the father, knowing the discrimination they’ll face in the workplace, knowing the lack of government support, many women feel adoption is their only realistic option.”The Korean government currently offers a monthly allowance of 150,000 won for domestic adoptive parents for child care costs, but 100,000 won for single parents including unwed and divorced mothers. Even for mother Kim, having to raise her son alone was the biggest challenge. The beauty industry worker was forced to take multiple part-time jobs to support her baby while she stayed at a single mothers’ shelter. Before taking her current job, Kim’s monthly income was unstable, ranging from as little as 300,000 won up to 1 million won. “I thought maybe it was better for him if I just gave him up for adoption,” she said. Kim pursued her lawsuit with the support of the state-run Korea Legal Aid Corporation, which is collaborating with the Gender Ministry for the newly launched service. Kim’s experience, however, was not positive, as even her own lawyer suggested that she withdraw the case and “persuade” her ex’s family instead. “The lawyer once told me to visit my ex’s parents on traditional holidays with the baby,” she said. “He said once they see the baby, maybe the families would change their mind and decide to support him. If that was the case, I wouldn’t have filed the suit to begin with. “This is why the lawsuit was so stressful. ... Imagine a lawsuit where you have to persuade your own lawyer.”Kim Eun-hee, a Daegu-based activist for single parents’ rights, said laws should be further fortified to impose a criminal penalty for overdue child support payments. The activist said she witnessed a number of single mothers being threatened by fathers of their babies. One mother, for instance, withdrew her case after her ex-boyfriend’s mother verbally attacked her for “ruining her son’s reputation,” and threatened to take custody of the child. “The new service seems promising, but I’m not sure how much of a change it will bring,” she said. “From our personal experiences, we doubt that civil punishments would do much.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","unwed mother sued her ,an unwed mother sued ,unwed mother sued ,sued her ex boyfriend ,mother sued her ex","['Kim Sun - young', 'Kim']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69884664 -0.23746285

The news was quickly followed by reports concerning other celebrity couples. Lee Min-ho (left) and Suzy. OSENAs related stories poured out, other headlines got less attention. Among such stories included news concerning former President Lee Myung-bak. On Monday, The Herald Business, a sister paper of The Korea Herald, raised concerns that the Korea Resources Corp. may have given some companies favorable treatment in extending more than 280 billion won ($254 million) in loans, citing information provided by Rep. Kim Je-nam of the minor opposition Justice Party.According to data Kim acquired from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the state-run company provided 29 companies with more than 282.2 billion won in low-interest loans during the five years of the Lee Myung-bak administration. During his term, former President Lee Myung-bak emphasized the need to develop natural resources overseas, and his so-called “resource diplomacy” has since become a subject of parliamentary investigation, as many of the massive investments led by Lee ended up with huge losses. Entertainment industry officials have since told various news outlets that using celebrity news to cover up political issues is unheard of. But major celebrity news have been broken in similar timing to controversial news concerning hot-button political and social issues in the past.The timing at which the news of Lee-Suzy couple was released appears to have fed the conspiracy theory.

Although the view is often photo-worthy, the experience has become less and less pleasant in recent years, as a thick smog of ultrafine dust blurs out what otherwise had been an arresting contrast of blues.“I always carry a protective mask in my bag to wear whenever the ultrafine dust advisories are issued,” she said. Korea is indeed more dust-shrouded than ever. Students learn how to wear protective masks at Gangseo Elementary School in western Seoul last week. (Yonhap)Along with yellow dust from China in spring, ultrafine dust or particulate matter 2.5 ― particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ― have become a major threat to public health. Last year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government issued ultrafine alerts 11 times, triple the number from the year before, city officials said. The capital also saw an average ultrafine dust concentration of 25.2 micrograms per cubic meter in 2012, which is more than double the safe level advised by the World Health Organization, according to the Environment Ministry. In the same year, other major metropolitan cities such as New York, London and Paris reached only around 15 micrograms per cubic meter. Health concerns are escalating as PM-2.5 can lead to much more serious health problems than other larger particles.“Ultrafine dust is so small that it not only causes respiratory problems but also enters the circulatory system unlike other types of dust,” said Kim Woon-soo, a senior research fellow at the Seoul Institute.While China has generally been blamed for the murky air in the case of yellow dust, the significantly lesser-known cause of the ultrafine dust comes from home, experts say.Recent studies have found that the majority of PM 2.5 here originates from within the peninsula.In 2013, ultrafine dust from China only accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the total, the government’s data showed. The rest was triggered by local coal-fired power plants and diesel cars. Ultrafine dust from coal-fired plants According to Greenpeace East Asia in Seoul, about 60 percent of ultrafine dust came from coal combustion in 2011. Of this, emissions from coal-fired power plants accounted for 3.4 percent. While the PM 2.5 emission amount from the plants seems minimal, experts noted that other emissions from the power facilities are secondary sources of ultrafine dust. Yeongheung Coal Power Plant in Incheon (Greenpeace)“When coal is combusted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are emitted as gases. But the problem is that these gases turn into nitrate and sulphate after chemically reacting with other substances, becoming secondary particles of PM 2.5,” said environmental health professor Lee Jong-tae at Korea University. “It is believed that the secondary ultrafine dust accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the total ultrafine dust.” According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s data in 2009, 41 percent of the ultrafine dust was composed of the secondary products created in the air. With both the primary and secondary pollutants coming from the coal-fired facilities, Greenpeace has estimated that ultrafine particles could be responsible for up to 1,600 deaths a year.The death toll could reach 2,800 by 2021 if the government pushes ahead with the construction plan for additional coal-fired power facilities, the global environment organization said. As of January, Korea has been running 53 coal-fired power stations with a generation capacity of 26,273 megawatts, supporting 40 percent of the nationwide electricity usage.Having limited options for natural energy sources, the government has mainly relied on coal-fired plants, citing the low-cost and simple operation process. As part of the state’s electricity supply scheme, 24 additional plants are either under construction or will be built in six years. “While other countries are putting efforts into reducing the coal usage, the Korean government is anachronously perceiving the situation despite how more people are dying early because of the increasing coal-fired power stations,” claimed Greenpeace campaigner Son Min-woo. Environmentalists argue that the government should at least tighten the monitoring regulations over the coal-related power stations to protect the public health as well as the environment. Under Korean environmental law, all facility owners are mandated to keep the emission level of harmful waste under a certain limit. If the limit is exceeded, the facility in question can face a shutdown.But coal-fired power stations have never been forced to close regardless of the emission level, due to several legal loopholes, the activists said.According to the Clean Air Conservation Act, the facilities that excessively released pollutants can be exempt from suspension if the punishment is likely to “substantially” impede the livelihood of the country’s residents, national economy and public interest. The Environment Ministry, instead, imposes a fine up to 200 million won ($178,000). The decision of whether to shut down the facility solely depends on the authority of provisional governors or city mayors, the Environment Ministry said. “The current regulation only serves as a special favor for the coal-fired power plants,” campaigner Son said. “The state needs to strengthen the anti-emission rules so that the facilities actually work on reducing releasing pollutants.” Diesel cars ― another culprit of ultrafine dust While coal is considered one of the main sources of ultrafine dust, vehicles -― diesel cars in particular ― are also known to attribute to the phenomenon. “Compared to other types of cars, diesel vehicles release much more PM 2.5 and other pollutants such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon,” said Korea Environment Institute senior researcher Kang Kwang-kyu.The Environment Ministry’s recent data showed that diesel cars emit about 30 times more ultrafine dust than other vehicles. The WHO has also confirmed that diesel exhaust fumes can cause cancer. Acknowledging the health risk, the Environment Ministry and some municipalities have put efforts into reducing the number of diesel cars for a decade while encouraging the diesel vehicle owners to equip the cars with pollutant-reducing devices.In yet another paradoxical move, however, the government announced last year that it would introduce diesel taxis starting this September in a bid to alleviate financial difficulties of cab companies.Under the plan, the Transport Ministry will provide fuel subsidies for 10,000 diesel cabs every year. Currently, only LPG taxis drivers are eligible for financial assistance.“Compared to private vehicles, the driving mileage of cabs is eight to 10 times longer, which means that running one diesel taxi is equivalent to riding eight to 10 cars. In other words, allowing 10,000 diesel cabs will be the same as having pollutants from 80,000 to 100,000 cars with much more PM 2.5,” said Song Sang-seok, secretary-general of Network for Green Transport.Faced by public concerns over the negative environmental impact, Seoul City said it would not implement the government’s initiative to increase the number of diesel taxis.The Environment Ministry also said it would tighten the monitoring measures over pollutants from diesel cabs, a move experts derided as being wasteful and ineffective.“Throughout the past decade, the government injected trillions of won to improve air quality. While one side of the government is attempting to save the environment, the other side is putting those efforts to waste,” Song said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","year old office worker ,river in seoul ,work every morning 29 ,old office worker kim ,river in seoul on","['the Hangang River', 'Seoul', 'Kim Soo - hyun']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.90684402  0.50689381

Two years ago, the divorced father of three was diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia, a rare brain disease with no effective treatment.Unable to move and work and with no viable help from his families, he relied on government-certified nannies to take care of his kids -― aged 10, 7 and 5 ― in the evenings and on weekends when they are out of school and a state-run day care center.But things have gotten much more difficult for Seok this year as the Gender Ministry cut its budget for the child care program by 458 million won ($418,360). With the cut, families with children aged 3 months to 12 years can now utilize the service for a maximum of 480 hours a year, compared to the previous 720. This means a daily nanny can only stay for an hour and 33 minutes a day.“I need nannies to come in every day because of my medical condition,” Seok told The Korea Herald. “But after the budget cuts, my nanny can only stay for less than two hours a day ― which is devastating. The weekends are the worst ... They are just at home with me, but I literally cannot do anything for them.”Since the Gender Equality Ministry established the program in 2007, the number of households who use the service increased dramatically from 6,000 to 54,362 in 2013. This year’s budget cut is expected to deal a blow to such households as well as nannies hired by the government for the service.For Jeong Seoum-gyul, a 36-year-old working mother in Daegu, the limited hours of the program have turned into a financial burden. The part-time school teacher who also works at a car washing service had been relying on nannies to take care of her 29-month-old daughter.While the daughter stayed at a day care center, nannies were Jeong’s only resort when she worked from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. at a car wash with her husband every morning.Now, because of the limited hours of the service, Jeong feels she is only left with terrible options.“I either have to quit my job at the car wash or hire a nanny from a private company to take care of my daughter starting at 4 a.m., though I don’t know if any nanny (from a private company) would be even willing to work at 4 a.m.,” Jeong told The Korea Herald.“Either way, I would have to spend at least about 600,000 won ($533) more every month. For people like us who have to make ends meet, that’s not a small cost,” Jeong said. What disturbs Jeong most, she said, is that the government decided to cut back the program without warning.“I wish they at least had told me in advance so I could have planned ahead,” Jeong said.“They told us the decision very abruptly without offering any alternative options for us. It feels almost as if I’ve been conned by the government.”The ministry explains that the latest budget cut was due to “overlapping” child care programs offered by other ministries. The Education Ministry, for instance, offers an after-school child care service where schools look after children of working parents after classes are over. The Welfare Ministry, for its part, provides special child care services for babies aged from 6 to 36 months.“Parents still tend to prefer having nannies take care of their children at their homes instead of placing the children at day care centers,” Gender Minister Kim Hee-jung had said in last year’s National Assembly meeting. She criticized the Strategy and Finance Ministry for citing similar programs as a way to downsize the budget.The Gender Ministry said it would continue to seek ways to expand the program.“We acknowledge that some may find the things (resulting from the budget cuts) difficult,” said Song Young-gwang from the ministry. “We’ll continue to have discussions to tackle the issues.”Meanwhile, the government’s budget curtailment is also affecting the nannies, who have already been struggling with low wages, weak job security and the government’s unilateral decisions on employment terms. As of February 2014, a total of 13,889 have been hired by the government for the child care service.Among many welfare workers hired by the government, nannies working for the child care program earn the lowest wages ― 6,000 won ($5.30) an hour. Those who care for the elderly earn 7,425 won, while those who work for people with disabilities make 8,810 won.Although the government raised the nannies’ hourly wage from 5,500 won to 6,000 won this year, the workers were informed in September that they would no longer receive extra stipends for transportation. Up until September, the workers were given 1,000 won to 1,500 won per commute.Lee Kyung-seon, a nanny based in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, now spends about 100,000 won additionally every month because she no longer receives the transportation allowance.“I make 12,000 won to care for a child for two hours, and I spend 4,000 won on transportation. So in the end, I am only making 4,000 won an hour, which is lower than the minimum wage ― 5,580 won,” she told The Korea Herald.Observers said the government’s decision overlooks the Labor Law, which states in Article 94 that an employer must consult with the majority of workers when amending rules of employment, and seek their consent if the rules are to be modified unfavorably for workers.The workers say the Gender Ministry informed them of the cut via text message.“Transportation cost is just one of many problems,” said labor attorney Kim Min-cheol. “The nannies must be given a total of 15 days of vacation every year by law. If they don’t get these days off, they should be paid extra. But I know many nannies who didn’t know the vacation time even existed.“The government as an employer cannot go against the nation’s labor law,” he added. “This should be fixed.”Kwon, a nanny in Gwangju, said she only learned about the country’s Labor Standards Act last year, after almost eight years of working as a government-certified caretaker. After the transportation allowance cut, she commutes by walking, which takes about 40 minutes each way.“It was extremely shocking and disillusioning to find out that the government, not even a private company, does not follow the labor law.”The government has been stepping up efforts in recent years to provide a better welfare and support system for mothers nationwide, in an effort to fight the declining birthrate and aging society.Despite President Park Geun-hye’s renewed emphasis in February on the need to tackle the population crisis, parents say they still suffer from inconsistent policies that fail to fully reflect reality.Korea’s birthrate stood at 1.18 child per woman last year ― the lowest in the OECD. An inadequate number of state-run child care facilities as well as poor work-life balance for double-income married couples have been considered some of the key contributing factors.The government predicts that the nation’s military would be short of 84,000 soldiers by 2030, and almost half of the entire population will be 65 or older by 2100 at the current birthrate.Jeong, the working mother in Daegu, said she and her husband recently decided against expanding their family.“It seems like having a second child is a privilege for those who have money and resources,” she said.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","divorced father of three ,year old single father ,care cuts devastate parents ,the divorced father ,old single father","['Seok Gwang - soo', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.98087186  0.1279263

Wearing a ritzy yellow jacket, the president appeared excited about her nine-day trip onboard Air Force One last Sunday, telling reporters that she would generate a “second Middle East boom” for South Korean companies making inroads into the oil-rich nations, and that was why she was “diligently” traveling around.Park’s spontaneous speech appeared to show the trip meant a lot to her. Indeed, the four-nation tour, her first overseas trip this year, was widely viewed as an opportunity for the president to reclaim the people’s attention. A series of political scandals as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance have damaged her credibility. Her lack of communication with the public only boosted her authoritarian image. Last month, her approval ratings plummeted to below 30 percent, the lowest rating since she assumed office in early 2013.To restore public confidence, Park spent the first two months of this year conducting a partial Cabinet reshuffle and reorganizing the presidential office. And just two days before she left for the Middle East, Park replaced her chief secretary ― the last piece of puzzle to complete her new lineup. She was definitely ready for a fresh start.Then something unexpected happened during her overseas trip, again.Mark Lippert, the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to Korea, was attacked by an ultraleft South Korean activist. Pictures of Lippert’s face covered with blood dominated news coverage both in Korea and the U.S. just when she was ready to show off her illustrious sales diplomacy that helped Korean firms inch closer to the nuclear plant project, worth $2 billion, in Saudi Arabia.Korean officials in Abu Dhabi responded fast, delivering Park’s reaction to the knife attack. But it was obvious that they had been taken aback by the news, knowing that Park’s sales diplomacy would lose steam.This is not the first time that one of her overseas trips has been overshadowed by unforeseen accidents.On her first trip to the United States in May 2013, then-presidential spokesman Yoon Chang-jung sexually assaulted a Korean-American hired to help the Seoul delegation in Washington.When Park was visiting China in June the same year, minutes recorded during the 2007 inter-Korean summit were disclosed, putting the country in a deep ideological turmoil. A rebellion conspiracy involving a progressive lawmaker as well as a scandal involving an ex-top prosecutor’s son born out of wedlock stirred controversy during her trip to Russia and Vietnam in September 2013.She was also pressed to apologize over backtracking on a welfare pledge during the APEC summit held in Indonesia and to withdraw her nomination of prime minister-designate Moon Chang-keuk over his pro-Japanese past remarks during her trip to Central Asia last year.In October, the ruling Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who has been regarded as Park’s bittersweet rival, generated controversy when he proposed a constitutional amendment during her trip to Italy.Despite her efforts to start afresh, the jinx on her overseas trips continued with the knife attack on the U.S. envoy this time.According to local pollster Gallup Korea, her approval rating rose 4 percentage points, much lower than expected, from last week to 37 percent, probably due to the Middle East trip. Respondents answered positively on her work and diplomacy skills, which have produced notable economic achievements.For South Korean presidents, a trip to the Middle East has often provided a dramatic turnaround during their terms.The late former President Roh Moo-hyun made a surprise visit to the Korean troops in Iraq in 2004 when there was political division over Korea’s extension of its troop deployment there. Meanwhile, Park’s predecessor Lee Myung-bak signed a landmark $20 billion nuclear plant deal with the United Arab Emirates in 2009, which opened the door for Korean firms to make inroads into global markets with domestically developed technology.It is too bad that no amount of planning could have prepared Park for yet another unfavorable event.By Cho Chung-un, Korea Herald correspondent(christory@heraldcorp.com)","last sunday telling reporters ,overseas trips continues doha ,her nine day trip ,the president appeared excited ,last week wearing ritzy","['Park Geun', 'south korean']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56925476  0.59937787

""So it was all this professional objective or professional goal, I think, if I had the chance to actually visit. And so I did.

The year 2015 marks the 70th anniversaries of Korea’s liberation and the 95th anniversary of Yu’s passing in prison.The official naming ceremony will be held at the end of April, when the submarine will be unveiled, the Navy said.Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. is constructing the submarine, which will be delivered to the Navy in November 2016 following test runs.According to the Navy, the submarine will be deployed in anti-vessel and anti-submarine operations. It will be equipped with an indigenous submarine-launched cruise missile, called the Haeseong, with a range of 1,000 kilometers, along with torpedoes.The Navy said the sub’s maximum underwater speed is 20 knots, and it can travel between South Korea and Hawaii without refueling.The diesel-powered submarine will be operated by Air Independent Propulsion, which bolsters the vessel’s submerged endurance and allows the crew to carry out underwater missions for up to two weeks without access to atmospheric oxygen. Yu is an iconic symbol of the March 1 independence movement.The Japanese arrested the teenager and sentenced her to seven years in prison, where she died at age 18, apparently due to harsh torture.The Navy has named its earlier Type 214 submarines after former military heroes and independence fighters. Most recently, the fifth sub in the class was dubbed “Yun Bong-gil,” after the patriot who killed two high-ranking Japanese officials and wounded several others by hurling a bomb during the birthday celebration of the Japanese emperor in 1932 in Shanghai. Yun was later executed. (Yonhap)","independence fighter new submarine ,fighter new submarine for ,fighter new submarine ,1920 female student activist ,new submarine for the","['the south korean Navy', 'Navy', 'Yu Gwan - sun', 'Japan']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14794269  0.21434264

Four medical staff in Seoul were confirmed to have been infected with the virus in September last year by a 68-year-old woman who was suffering from severe fever due to thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, a fatal disease contracted through tick bites. Hospital sources suspect that the virus was transmitted while the staff were conducting cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the patient, officials said. She died of blood poisoning one day after she was hospitalized. While all staff were quickly cured under treatment, one medial resident had to be hospitalized for a week with serious symptoms, they said. This first case was belatedly reported to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the health authorities said. The syndrome, which causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea and multiple organ failure, has been found to have a fatality rate of around 10 percent. No direct vaccines have been created so far. Korea has had a higher fatality rate from the tick-borne virus since 2013. Of 36 confirmed patients in 2013, 16 died from tick bites ― a fatality rate of 47.2 percent. From January to August last year, 10 of 24 patients died from the tick virus.While SFTS fears gripped the country at the time, the health authorities had only warned of tick bites, not of secondary infection. Human-to-human transmission was thought to be nearly impossible. Five cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported in China, with three cases involving intrafamily transmission, the authorities said. Stern precautionary measures should be taken when a suspected case of the virus infection is reported since it can be transmitted through blood or respiratory secretions, experts said.Doctors advised people to wear long clothes when spending time in the wild and to wash their clothing as soon as they return home.

More than 800 micrograms leads to a yellow dust warning.  People are advised to stay indoors when yellow dust advisories or warnings are in place. When going outside, they are advised to wear protective glasses and yellow-dust masks.  As of 8 p.m., Seoul's atmospheric concentration levels of ""particulate matter (PM)-10"" pollutants recorded 692 micrograms per cubic meter.  PM-10 refers to airborne particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter. Epidemiological evidence indicates that exposure to such pollutants causes cardiac and respiratory problems, according to experts.   Originating from the deserts in southern Mongolia and northern China, the dusty air flew into the Korean Peninsula on a strong wind over the weekend, according to experts.  ""With yellow dust advisories or warnings in place in central and South and North Jeolla provinces, yellow dust is being observed in most parts of the nation except South Gyeongsang Province,"" a meteorologist at the KMA said.

There, the virus’ worst epidemic in history continues to unfold. Dozens of new patients pour every week into the Goderich treatment center in the suburbs of the capital Freetown. The 100-bed hospital, run by Italian relief group Emergency, is hardly able to keep track of patients’ names, let alone their progress. Short of hands, doctors and nurses from around the world work double shifts, scrambling to spare yet another life. The seemingly never-ending deaths of her patients, many of them small children, traumatized and dismayed the 31-year-old seasoned critical care nurse. What helped her pull herself together, she says, was the camaraderie of the international staff, her sense of mission and her newfound awareness of the power of life ― even at the edge of death. Capt. Lee Tae-heon, a Navy surgeon, attends a patient at the Ebola treatment center in Goderich in the suburbs of Freetown, Sierra Leone. (MOFA)“Before our duty came to an end, I was taking a final tour around the facility and bumped into a security guard who survived Ebola after being cared for at another center in Lakka,” Hong said in a recent interview.“I offered my congratulations but he seemed so gloomy. It turned out that he was the sole survivor in his six-member family; his parents, brothers and sisters had all died. “Hearing that he was slowly recovering and trying to rebuild his life with a new job in Goderich, I felt sad but also gained strength, realizing that we could have a positive impact on the patients and their families.”Hong’s team ― the first of its kind to respond to an overseas epidemic ― included nine other surgeons and nurses from the military and the private sector. They were discharged on Feb. 15 following a 21-day mandatory quarantine program after serving for about 30 days in the West African country starting Dec. 27. The outbreak is reported to have killed at least 9,400 people worldwide since last March, according to the World Health Organization. Seoul has pledged $5.6 million to help contain the pandemic through the U.N., the WHO, UNICEF and other organizations.A third batch of staff is scheduled to begin medical activities at Goderich on Monday following training in the U.K. and elsewhere. Its scale was downsized in line with the ongoing fall in new confirmed cases. During the interview, most of the seven participants appeared young, vigorous and aglow with a feeling of achievement. All of the members are well and showing no signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, they said. Lt. Col. Oh Dae-kun, a 39-year-old Army surgeon, said the best day was when the number of deaths was exceeded by the number of those who were dismissed from the hospital. “Probably all of us must have been quite shocked by the ill patients and some other factors there. But that did not turn into something that overwhelmed us ― I believe that the positive, worthwhile things we went through during our stay outshone the difficult parts,” he added. The participants had to fight not only the opposition of their families and friends over the risk of contracting the virus, but also rampant public fears of the spread of the deadly disease in order to press ahead with their choice to go. Health experts and diplomats also expressed concerns over what they called a “panic-like” scare that prompted the government to bar the entry of Guinean officials slated to take part in a telecommunication conference, a Seoul university to revoke its invitation for Nigerian students and Korean Air to temporarily halt flights to Nairobi. Shin Hyoung-shik, who led the squad and is director for infectious diseases at the National Medical Center in Seoul, said the toughest moment was when a team member was sent for monitoring in Germany after the worker’s finger was scraped by a needle while collecting blood from a patient. The official was eventually declared uninfected and returned home.“Frankly I initially thought the quarantine scheme was not so scientifically established,” the 51-year-old doctor said. “Having stayed here for three weeks, however, I came to believe that it is a realistic one that prevents confusion to a certain degree. If I had caught a cold at home after returning, there would have been lots of confusion.” With a growing need for Korea to take a bigger role in global issues, many team members called for sustained efforts to improve the country’s capability and better prepare for a possible future crisis at home and abroad. Officials from the foreign, defense and health ministries are also exploring ways to capitalize on the latest mission and contribute to Sierra Leone’s reconstruction, including partnerships with international agencies. “There have not been sufficient studies on Ebola because there were not many cases around the world,” Shin added. “Through this experience, we should expand our capacity in terms of both research and treatment to help respond to any future outbreak of infectious, fatal diseases whether they be in Africa or Latin America.”Oh, the military doctor, echoed Shin’s view, stressing the significance of intra-agency collaboration in tackling a major emergency, and technology in upgrading the country’s response. “As a soldier, I couldn’t help but think of chemical warfare with North Korea given the security situation on the peninsula and how to improve the operation of mobile hospitals and management of patient data,” he said.“The WHO’s central role in the Ebola outbreak could also provide lessons to us especially in the wake of the Sewol ferry disaster ― we can take a page from it in setting up our own control tower for crisis management and developing comprehensive manuals and guidelines.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","patients pour every week ,after ebola patients ,ebola medics recount mission ,the virus worst epidemic ,look after ebola patients","['Sierra Leone', 'Korea', 'Goderich', 'Freetown']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61962962  0.54267848

Most are elementary schools located in the smaller fishing or farming communities, with poor education infrastructure.Another 130 schools have just one new student. A branch of Yeonam elementary school in Ulsan had just one first year student in 2013 and 2014, but failed to recruit anyone this year. A total of 11 elementary schools had less than 10 first year students for 2015, according to Ulsan Metropolitan Office of Education.South Jeolla was the hardest hit region with 47 schools without freshmen this year, as against 16 in 2014. According to officials, 11 schools in the area have just one student, which means they are likely to shut down soon.Last year, 17 schools in the area were shut down and seven more will face the ax in March.In January, Gangwon Provincial Office of Education announced it would grant additional recruitment for 68 high schools with low freshmen retention rates. But a total of 19 schools in the province failed to get even one applicant.“Such a low retention rate is due to both the growing trend of people leaving rural areas and the overall number of students declining. We have no choice but to work on improving our education programs to attract more students,” said a GPOE official.Korea is expected to have around 1.59 million middle school students this year, according to local private education firm Haneul Education, which will be 120,000 less than last year. The firm, citing Education Ministry data, noted that it was the biggest-ever decline in that particular category. The number of high school students declined by about 20,000.But the number of elementary school students is projected to be similar to last year, which shows that the students-to-seniors ratio in rural areas is also to blame. In 2013, only 6.9 percent of the population in Gangwon Province has 14 or younger, a significant decrease from 11.4 percent in 2003. In the same year, senior citizens jumped from 26.3 percent to 36.8 percent.

Despite my unconventional career background, I felt this was my last opportunity to follow a new career path. I studied children’s education and psychology at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul before heading to the UAE to work for Emirates Group. I spent eight years flying as a cabin crew member and two years as a senior trainer at Emirates Group Training College in Dubai. It is difficult to move away from 10 years in the aviation without reeducation. I started to think about the steps I would need to take for a new career. I was convinced that an MBA would present new opportunities that I wanted, but before selecting a school I had to consider my options ― what I wanted to do with an MBA, what I need to do, and which school would help me pursue my dream.First, I decided I wanted to become a brand manager in a leading luxury company. Then, I needed to combine the leadership skills I had developed from my previous job with the business and management skills I would gain from an MBA. Listing these skill sets helped me decide the subjects I wanted to focus on, and create timelines for summer internships and job interviews. Finally, I realized studying in France would provide the best route to my dream job. Why? France is the home of luxury, and Paris is at its heart. HEC Paris offers leading courses associated with luxury, in addition to rigorous academic programs and exchange opportunities all over the world. Due to the school’s relationship with other top management schools around the globe, I had the opportunity to study abroad at HKUST in Hong Kong, to develop my understanding of the Asian luxury market.There’s also the invaluable alumni network. I received advice from alumni in the luxury industry ― including Jun Ji-hyun, the country general manager of Balenciaga Korea at Kering Group and Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of L’Oreal ― regarding job searching, interviews and networking skills. Thanks to them, I was hired as a consultant for L’Oreal Paris to work on their digital innovation project during the summer. Living in Paris also helped me expand my horizons and understand different cultures. The language barrier was quite challenging at times, but there was still a real sense of community. I benefited from learning the language, which helped me understand the culture of the country. Having an open and tolerant mindset helps to be a part of a multicultural family here.Through studying abroad, I met amazing classmates. Though everyone had different dreams, we worked together to help each other accomplish them. I will always remember the many late nights spent working together on team projects or sharing a glass of wine. Learning to collaborate with more than seven different nationalities has definitely helped me to become a strong team player and, more importantly, to become a better leader. I know these people will be a valuable network for the rest of my life.By Kwon Yu-jung Kwon is graduating from an MBA course at Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris this month.

A few months before the delivery, she had been forced to marry the man who raped and impregnated her.“That was the norm at the time,” Noh Geum-ju told The Korea Herald.“When you get pregnant as an unmarried woman, you have to marry the father of your baby.

A few months before the delivery, she had been forced to marry the man who raped and impregnated her.“That was the norm at the time,” Noh Geum-ju told The Korea Herald.“When you get pregnant as an unmarried woman, you have to marry the father of your baby. Other options were unthinkable.”Her unhappy marriage was filled with extreme financial difficulties, to the point where she was forced by her husband to sell her blood. But nothing was worse than learning that her family members secretly sent her 11-month-old son for adoption to give Noh an “easier life.”When she finally tracked down the hospital where her son was taken ― which was affiliated with adoption agents ― it had been abruptly closed. After crying for days, she descended into depression with frequent suicidal thoughts. “I didn’t know who I was anymore. I wanted to kill everyone, including myself,” she said.Noh, who currently heads Dandelions ― a group of Korean birth mothers ― still suffers from the trauma. She reunited with her son, who had been adopted to the U.S., in 2005, but the reunion did not make up for her 29 years of loss. Every March, her son’s birth month, Noh falls physically ill.On top of the language barrier and shock ― Noh had been thinking her son was adopted to a Korean family ― it was especially heartbreaking to learn that her son was struggling financially, she said. “I still feel sad and angry,” she said. “I feel guilty that I couldn’t raise him on my own, and I am sorry again that I can’t do much for him even today.”Trauma in secretsSouth Korea remains one of the largest exporters of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. This means there are also about 200,000 Korean birth mothers -- and some 200,000 birth fathers -- who were separated from their children by international adoption, which brought millions of dollars to local adoption agencies here in the 1980s.About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.There have never been government support programs for birth mothers who put their children up for adoption. There is also little research by local scholars on the impact of overseas adoption on Korean birth parents.“Our support programs are focused on mothers who choose to raise their children on their own,” said Lee Hyun-ju, head of adoption measures at the Welfare Ministry.Yet overseas studies have shown that many birth parents, like Noh, continue to mourn the loss of their children throughout their lifetime. This is an ongoing issue. Nearly 3,000 Korean babies were sent for overseas adoption from 2010 to 2013.Even 12-20 years after adoption placement, about three-quarters of birth mothers continued to experience some feelings of loss and grief, a U.S. study found. The study also found that the mothers who tended to experience more longstanding grief were those who felt pressured into placing their children for adoption against their will or lacked opportunities to express their feelings about surrendering the baby.Kim Eui-jung, a psychiatrist at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, said sorrow and depression, anger, guilt and denial are common among birth parents as they mourn their loss, and even after reuniting with their children. “Korean culture places a lot of emphasis on maternal instinct and mothers’ sacrifice, and as a result, we see many of them being too attached to their children,” Kim said. “They often see their children as their own possessions or an inseparable part of themselves, rather than as independent beings. And for one reason or another, the Korean birth mothers ended up relinquishing what many other women cherish the most. This puts them in a very isolated situation in Korean society. For this reason ― although there should be more research on this topic ― I assume Korean birth mothers may have emotional reactions that are unique and may not be experienced by birth mothers in other countries.”Secrecy surrounding pregnancy and adoption ― as most Korean birth mothers had been single parents ― can also make it challenging for the mothers to seek support, another reason behind the limited research into their experiences, Kim said.“A key component to anxiety and depression are feelings of powerlessness,” Kim said. “If a birth mother was pressured or forced into placing her child for adoption, reunions and post-reunion days can be more overwhelming and difficult for her. She may even choose not to meet with the child at all, because it can be too painful for her to confront her past.”Birth mother Noh said she often felt misunderstood throughout her life, as many people, including her close friends, viewed her loss as her choice.“What can you really expect from the government when even your close friend tells you, ‘You know, I had a very difficult life, too ― but at least I didn’t give up my own children like you did’?” she said.Loss and guiltOn Aug. 12, 2005, the day of her labor, Choi Hyeong-suk stayed in her room as long as she could, enduring contractions ― she was somehow trying to delay her delivery by not going to the hospital until it was absolutely necessary.“I was terrified of going to the hospital,” Choi, who now heads an organization for unwed single mothers, said. “Going to the hospital meant giving birth to my baby, and that meant I’d have to say goodbye to him. I had decided to send him for adoption to the U.S., but I was absolutely terrified of being separated from him.”Choi, an accomplished hairdresser at the time, had broken up with the father of her son, whom she now raises by herself.Her family did not want her to face hardships as single mother, and told her to place the baby for adoption ― for the sake of both the child and herself. While pregnant, she stayed at Ae Ran Won, a shelter for unmarried and pregnant women, until she gave birth. Just about eight hours after her delivery, she signed the final adoption papers and her son was taken away from her. “I was told to say the last words to my newborn,” Choi said. “I told him, ‘baby, you should go now.’ What I told him that day still hurts me deeply. I still avoid saying ‘go now’ to my son, even when he’s going to school.”After placing the baby for an adoption, Choi left the hospital immediately, feeling as if she did not deserve any medical care after relinquishing her own child. “At the shelter, there were mothers staying with their babies ― and all I could hear was their noises,” she said.“I thought I was losing my mind and could not stop crying. I called the adoption agency the next day and told them I wanted my son back.”After two weeks of waiting, Choi had her son back. Almost a decade has passed since then, but the two weeks of separation still affects Choi. Like Noh, Choi also gets sick every August ― her son’s birth month.“I get so ill I can’t even get up,” she said.Choi still keeps in touch with a number of women she met at the shelter, one of whom sent her son for adoption to Australia. The woman gave birth to her child about a month before Choi did. One time, the friend ― who believes her son will visit her one day ― asked Choi to ask overseas Korean adoptees a question on her behalf.“She told me to ask them, ‘would you be happy to learn that your birth mother is living a happy life when you reunite with her?’” Choi said. “She said she didn’t want her son to think she was happy separated from him for so many years when they reunite in future. But she also thinks her son wouldn’t be too comfortable to learn that she’s unhappy and miserable.”While Choi thinks keeping her child was the best decision she’s ever made, living as a single mother in Korea hasn’t been easy. Her hair salon went out of business after it became known in her neighborhood that she was an unwed mother. Her son has been bullied at school for having a single parent. Still, Choi thinks overseas adoption should be the last resort. “It is a temporary solution to a permanent problem for both adoptees and birth parents,” she said. When Choi was pregnant, American adoptive parents visited the shelter to meet with pregnant women who were considering placing their children for adoption. The couple shared their family photo album with the soon-to-be mothers, which included many photos of their daughter ― whom they adopted from Korea. In the photos, their daughter was taking swimming lessons and playing the violin in a pretty dress. “After looking at the album, I thought it would indeed be better for my son to be adopted,” said Choi, who also interacts with adoptee activists.“I was also told by many that it was the best to send my son to the U.S., because there are a lot of Korean adoptees there, and there is no racism in America. Most of us at the shelter thought what we were told were true. Many didn’t really know what racism even meant.“Many think birth mothers ‘make a choice’ when they put their children up for adoption. But when you are repeatedly told to give up your child when you lack resources and knowledge, can you really call that a choice?”‘We are victims, too’The Korean government currently offers a number of support programs for Korean overseas adoptees, including Korean language programs and support for birth family searches. The number of overseas adoptees who return and live in Korea is also increasing, according to the state-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.Kim Mee-sook, a researcher at the think tank, said there should be support programs for birth mothers as well, especially foreign language courses and counseling sessions. This would eventually improve their relationship with their separated children, she said. “It’s normal for birth mothers to feel angry and guilty, and they should have an outlet to let it all out,” she said. “Sometimes things don’t go well after the reunion because of such unresolved feelings, and also simply because they don’t know anything about each other and how to continue the relationship with the language barrier. But I think these things can be helped with support of experts.”Meanwhile, Dandelions, the group of birth mothers headed by Noh, has only about 40 members. Among them, about five show up at their gatherings regularly. “It’s hard for birth mothers to unite because many keep their stories a secret, while suffering from feelings of guilt,” said Noh, who opposes transnational adoption.“There are about 200,000 birth families who have been separated from their children in this country. Among 200,000 of them, I only ask 100 ― not even 1,000 ― to come forward and speak their experiences. We need healing and solidarity. In many ways, we are victims, too.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","korean girl gave birth ,year old korean girl ,unthinkable her unhappy marriage ,old korean girl ,her first child few","['korean', 'Noh Geum - ju', 'the Korea Herald']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5595687   0.24054201

The incident has sparked public outrage, and President Park Geun-hye instructed officials Tuesday to implement a set of measures to root out child abuse. In a policy report to Park joined by the ministries of culture, health and welfare, environment, labor and gender equality, the education ministry said the government will convene a meeting of society-related ministers later this week to discuss comprehensive measures to prevent child abuse at nursery schools. Measures will likely include tightening the procedures of selecting and nurturing nursing teachers and improving their working conditions and welfare.The education ministry also plans to revise laws to toughen punishment by shutting down any nursing school if child abuse is found there and the perpetrator and the facility's director would be permanently banned from the business.The government seeks to increase the national number of kindergartens with security cameras to 90 percent from currently 80 percent.The education ministry further said it will encourage teachers' colleges nationwide to require students to take personality tests during the admission process, based on a law on the promotion of personality education that was introduced end of last year.During the report, the culture ministry said it will make aggressive efforts to increase exports of Korean content industry products this year. For this, the government will launch a civilian-government organization that would orchestrate the ongoing nationwide efforts to keep afloat the Asiawide popularity of Korean TV dramas, pop music and films possibly in March.Along with this, the ministry will set up a copyright protection agency to effectively deal with pervasive copyright infringements at home and abroad.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it will increase the coverage of the national health insurance for patients of four most serious diseases, including cancer, cardiac disorder and cerebrovascular disease.The authorities will also continue efforts to lower people's medical expenses by reducing the percentage of doctors who are available only upon request with additional fees at large general hospitals and increasing the number of rooms for insured patients. The Ministry of Environment reported that it will put this year's policy priority to resolving four major environmental problems that directly affect people's everyday lives-- fine dust, water-bloom, toxic substances and foul odors.The government plans to enforce a national fine dust alert system this year in an effort to help protect vulnerable citizens from possible health-related issues caused by exposure to high-density air pollution, according to the ministry.Fine dust is defined as particles smaller than 10 micrometers, and if inhaled, it can cause various respiratory problems and undermine the body's immunity.The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said it will build national facilities to provide necessary aid to working parents who have to juggle work and home commitments.

Under the influence of cocaine, the trio of friends ransacked the house, stealing jewelry and money.Splitting cash found in a purse, ""we each got about $100. I also picked out a gold chain, small, like for a child, with a crucifix pendant,"" Prieto said in his confession.Several days later, one of the brothers gave him ""a couple of earrings and a couple of necklaces"" which he pawned for $140.In an unusual move, Prieto did not appeal his death sentence to the US Supreme Court.One accomplice, a minor at the time, was sentenced to life in prison.

The previous system to determine household wealth was based on income and assets like real estate and cars, without taking into account factors such as pensions, financial assets and debts.Starting this year, the previously excluded factors will be included in the wealth evaluation, said an official from the ministry’s Scholarship and Financial Aid Division. “As a result, we will be able to prevent the benefits from going to students from wealthy families and instead concentrate the financial aid on the people in need,” he said.Potential beneficiaries will be sorted into 10 groups based on their household wealth, and all but those in the two highest wealth brackets will be eligible for the program.About 1.2 million students ― a little less than half the total number of college students in Korea ― have benefited from the program, the officials said. They said a similar number of students are expected to receive scholarships this year, but more money will be handed out.Some 1.54 trillion won ($1.43 billion) will be provided in scholarships for the first semester of this year, up from 1.37 trillion won in 2014. The maximum amount of money a student can receive is 4.8 million won, which is earmarked for those in the lowest bracket. It is also possible for students who are not granted a scholarship to challenge the decision. “Previously, we could not make inquiries about … household wealth. But the recent law revision has provided legal grounds for us to do so,” the ministry official said. The inherent problem with the new system, however, is that it may potentially penalize families who have financial assets, but do not have sufficient monthly income. In some of the cases provided by the ministry, students had moved across three or four groups. The ministry did not release information on how many households would be placed in the different wealth groups due to the changes.Applicants for the program can find out which wealth group they fall under on the Korea Student Aid Foundation’s website starting Tuesday, and will personally be notified of the results between Tuesday and Thursday. Those wishing to challenge the results will have two weeks to do so.The state scholarship program has been the backbone of President Park Geun-hye’s “half-price tuition” policy. She has claimed that through the 3.9 trillion won pumped into the program and other government subsidies, along with 3.1 trillion won in financial aid from the ministry, the burden of college tuition will be halved.

But recently, Korean workplaces have been experiencing some major changes, including a generational shift and an increase in female representation.“The younger generation is more outspoken and not shy about expressing their opinions to their seniors,” said a director at a media company who wished to remain anonymous. The attitude is somewhat new to him ― a 50-something baby boomer born raised under military-backed authoritarian governments in the aftermath of the Korean War. “When I was young, I obeyed my superiors, no questions asked,” he said.As the director pointed out, military culture has played a significant role in shaping the local corporate culture as more men climbed up the social ladder. In Korea, only men are required to fulfill military service. As these authoritarian leaders took up top positions in the office, the gap widened between the baby boomers and younger employees who were more influenced by democratic values. “Due to the hierarchical corporate culture, most office workers tend to refrain from speaking up or standing out,” a 26-year-old banker told The Korea Herald. The lack of such face-to-face communication has led the younger generation to flock to Blind, an anonymous gossip application launched in 2013. As the Korean version of Secret, a similar app launched in the U.S., Blind, has become a hit among young office workers seeking candid communication and sympathy at work. “Through this app, we can freely talk about our seniors, colleagues, work-related stress, salaries and even labor unions,” the young banker said. Access is offered only after the user is verified, and the posts are strictly encrypted for security, according to app developer Teamblind. “So far, most of the users are in their 20s and 30s,” noted Jung Young-joon, CEO of Teamblind. This means the app can provide a much-needed reality check for superiors, but may also perpetuate the generational gap, as seniors are less likely to join the conversation, according to critics. Gender discrimination is also gradually becoming less pronounced. Working in a society guided by Confucian values, Korean women have long been underrepresented in the business world. When Choi Kyung-hee, a 52-year-old banker, began her career at a bank 30 years ago, it was common for women quit once they got married or had a child. Furthermore, it was rare for women to land decent jobs in the first place, which explains the glaring lack of female executives today. Women make up merely 2 percent of executive positions at the 10 largest Korean corporations, according to data compiled by CEO Score in 2013. Things are slowly but steadily changing, Choi said. “In recent years, the gap between men and women has narrowed in terms of income and opportunities for promotion,” said Choi, who manages a bank branch in Seoul. The changes, however, do not appear to be equally felt among young women. “Women are still undervalued at work, and are forced to leave their jobs if they attempt to take maternity leave,” said Shim Soo-mi, 30, an office worker for an engineering company. “Realistically, the office culture will remain unchanged unless the men who are used to male-oriented ways retire.” However, some critics believe that as many women still leave voluntarily to have families, it is unfair to say that companies are not giving them a fair chance. A top-down office culture also has its merits, they say. “The military office culture is at times too rigid, but a strict chain of command can do wonders in times of crisis,” said one 40-something office worker.

However, not all families of the Sewol ferry sinking victims canceled their children’s smartphone numbers. Jeon Myung-sun is one of them. “I couldn’t cancel the number as friends of my son still call and send messages.

Supriyadi, the National Search and Rescue Agency's operational director.Intermittent underwater ping-like sounds were picked up Friday about a kilometer (half mile) from where the tail was located, but it was unclear if they were coming from the cockpit voice and flight data recorders located in the back of the Airbus A320, he said. It was possible the signals were coming from another source.He said no metal was detected at the ping location, but that the black boxes could have come loose from the plane. Nurcahyo Utomo, a National Commission for Transportation Safety investigator, said the sounds could not be confirmed.Meanwhile, Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan cracked down on five airlines Friday, temporarily suspending 61 flights, because they were flying routes on days without permits. Earlier, all AirAsia flights from Surabaya to Singapore, the path Flight 8501 was on when it went down Dec. 28, were suspended after it was discovered that the low-cost carrier was not authorized to fly on Sundays. Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan also sanctioned nine more officials for allowing the plane to fly without permits, bringing the total to 16.  The discovery of the plane's tail earlier this week was a major breakthrough in the slow-moving search that has been hampered by seasonal rains, choppy seas and blinding silt from river runoff. Officials were hopeful the black boxes were still inside. They are key to helping investigators understand what caused the crash.The last contact the pilots had with air traffic control, about halfway into their two-hour journey, indicated they were entering stormy weather. They asked to climb from 9,753 meters to 11,582 meters to avoid threatening clouds, but were denied permission because of heavy air traffic above them. Four minutes later, the plane dropped off the radar. Four additional bodies were recovered Friday _ two of them still strapped in their seats on the ocean floor – bringing the total to 48. Officials hope many of the remaining corpses will be found inside the fuselage, which has not yet been located by divers. Several large objects have been spotted in the area by sonar.

What do you think of Japan’s prospects for a greater security role?Sohn Yul: What we need to consider first is the shift in economic power in Northeast Asia, given that a change in economic power could lead to one in military strength. In 2010, China’s economy ― in terms of the gross domestic product ― has surpassed that of Japan. Only five years have passed since then, but Japan’s GDP is now half that of China. Many analysts also forecast that China will overtake the U.S. in GDP terms around 2020.But there is a “military-power lag,” considering that Japan’s naval power is still greater than China’s. Although China’s defense spending is double that of Japan and its economy is far bigger than Japan’s, Japan is still ahead of China in terms of its maritime defense capabilities, enabling it to cope with naval threats from China over the dispute surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. In this vein, the U.S. military preponderance is expected to continue for some time even after China’s economy surpasses that of the U.S.Analysts estimate that the U.S.’ military and technological preeminence would continue over at least the next 15 to 20 years. This tells us that a critical shift in the balance of power between the U.S. and China in Northeast Asia may not occur in that span of time. Then, on the premise that there would not be any critical power shift, Japan may want to continue to capitalize on the U.S.’ preponderant military position and its alliance with the U.S. to ensure its security. The odds appear to be very slim that Japan’s economy would rapidly rebound, and in particular, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic stimulus drive, called “Abenomics,” seems to have almost failed or lost traction, which presages a wider economic gap between China and Japan ― a situation that would force Japan to continue to rely on its security alliance with the U.S. So, back to your question of Japan’s military buildup, we can envision a Japan pushing for heavier armament within the confines of the U.S.-Japan alliance, and there will be a strategic perimeter beyond which the U.S. does not want Japan to move, and Japan could hardly exercise its military power beyond that perimeter.Sohn Yul (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)KH: Can you elaborate on the scenarios in which Japan might go beyond that strategic perimeter?Sohn: The situations may involve Japan offensively responding to any disputes with China, intervening unilaterally in affairs on the Korean Peninsula, and even seeking military hegemony in Asia and nuclear armament, and so forth. The U.S. wants Japan to be stronger, but it wants its ally to remain a second Japan ― which is under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and does not undermine its strategic interests. From the U.S. strategic standpoint, Japan should not pursue an inordinate military power to break the peaceful mood between the U.S. and China, and it should not exercise its military power in a way that would hurt the security balance on the Korean Peninsula. But what we should carefully watch is the Sino-Japan relationship. China has started to perceive Japan as an adversary and vice versa. Japan, thus, wants to strengthen the alliance with the U.S., and be more active in defending itself. And in this process, there could be a military conflict or competition between China and Japan, although the Sino-U.S. relationship would continue to remain stable. Against this backdrop, a variable of the Abe government’s identity comes into play. The government has shown revisionist views on history on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has pursued status as a normal state. Under the U.S.-Japan alliance, there are limits to what Japan can do ― and of course, as well as much room for Japan to maneuver within the alliance ― and I believe it would be very difficult for Japan to become a militarily dangerous state. But given Tokyo’s identity, the intensity of the tension between China and Japan could increase.KH: Prime Minister Abe scored another big victory in the Dec. 14 lower-house elections, which showed that Japan’s opposition and civil society failed to keep Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party in check. Concerns here are the victory could provide momentum for Abe’s nationalist security agenda, which may further worsen Seoul-Tokyo relations. What do you think about this?Sohn: As I said, the experts’ projections are that the U.S. military preeminence will continue for at least the next 15 to 20 years. Thus, Japan will remain under the U.S. military leadership. Then, the question is whether Tokyo would continue to step up its ultranationalistic drive. For those who have closely watched Japan’s domestic situation, that scenario seems unlikely. If we analyze the election outcome, we can better understand its underlying implications. The voter turnout was tallied at 52 percent in the December election, the lowest rate in the post-war period. Does that signify the widespread voter apathy? Should a vast majority be apathetic about politics with a small class leading the entire nation, this would be a case of fascism. Thus, it may not be the case. According to a post-election survey by Japan’s Asahi Shimbun, it was the public distrust toward political circles that caused the lowest voter participation. Over 60 percent of the respondents who did not vote said that they did not believe any political parties would adequately represent their interests. As these people harbor deep discontent towards politics, they could move to reject the Liberal Democratic Party, should the ruling party perform poorly or should a capable alternative opposition party emerge. This means public backing for the LDP is quite weak. Secondly, we can examine the 72 percent of the respondents that said they supported the ruling party because the opposition parties were not attractive (not because the LDP was attractive).Thirdly, in the election, the number of lower-house seats for the Next Generation Party ― an ultranationalist party that has splintered off from the right-wing Japan Restoration Party ― had been reduced to only two from 19. This indicates voters do not want to see ideological contentions. Fourthly, we also need to check the increase in the number of seats for the Japan Communist Party to 21 from 8. Of course, Abe’s election strategies helped clinch the victory, but the underlying circumstances show that things are not necessarily propitious for Abe. After all, voters showed through the election that although the performances of both the ruling and opposition parties were far from satisfactory, they would like to give their confidence to Abenomics. Thus, voter support could disappear rapidly should Japan’s economy fail to perform well.I may sound too pessimistic. But Japan’s economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, and should it continue negative growth, things will turn very unfavorable for Abe. Without economic improvement, Abe would face a very challenging political landscape for him to push for his ideological security agenda. that said, I think Abe may strive to strike a balance between ideology and pragmatism. Therefore, I would not be too pessimistic about the prospects of the relationship between South Korea and Japan. KH: Do you think U.S. President Barack Obama feels that Abe’s nationalist stance is excessive, although Obama may feel thankful ― to a certain degree ― for Abe being more active in sharing the U.S.’ Asian security burden?Sohn: What worries the U.S. would be Japan’s historical revisionism, given that it could also mean the denial of history concerning the Pacific War (including Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor). Basically, the chemistry between Obama and Abe doesn’t seem to be good: Obama used to be a grassroots figure leading civil activism and carries progressive characteristics, while Abe was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and rose up the political ladder on the back of his illustrious political pedigree.In terms of strategic interests, Obama may feel thankful to Abe for sharing its security burden and playing an active role in keeping China in check. But on the other hand, Obama may feel (uncomfortable) as Abe continues to cause friction with Seoul over history issues, and also trigger unnecessary tension with China when the U.S. wants to maintain a stable relationship with China. After all, Abe has pushed Korea toward China, which has caused the U.S. to step in and urge Japan to keep its apologies for its wartime wrongdoings. KH: South Korea appears to be facing an increasingly tricky diplomatic position as the strategic competition between the U.S. and China emerges. What is the way forward for Korea?Sohn: So now, we are talking about South Korea’s strategic position amid the Sino-U.S. rivalry. Basically, the U.S. and China are working to forge a new type of the great-power relationship in which they respect each other’s interests and favor a stable relationship. Thus, they are not caught in a fight or anything. But what about their relationship in this region? They are pursuing a stable, peaceful development of their relations, but things may be different in this region where there is a strategic competition over the Korean Peninsula and over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.During the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping put forward neighborhood diplomacy principles of “qin cheng hui rong” ― meaning the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in conducting its “periphery diplomacy.” In another session in December, he talked of the “big-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics,” and he put China’s relations with its neighbors first in his speech, then the diplomacy for the new major-power relationship and then for developing countries. Xi also talked of a “community of shared interests and common destiny with neighboring countries.” This indicates China is stepping up its periphery diplomacy, and South Korea appears to take a very crucial position (in Beijing’s diplomacy). While calibrating its approach toward its neighbors, China may consider which neighbor it should give more strategic weight to. And I guess South Korea’s strategic value is high (for China) as it is connected to the U.S. and Japan. Thus, China may seek to get South Korea on its side considering that Korea is in a special position while China seeks to shape a new regional order or architecture. But what’s worrisome is that this also indicates that South Korea could fall into a very embarrassing diplomatic position. If so, how should Korea deal with this?Like I said on the premise that there will not be a critical shift in the balance of power over the next 20 years, the current major-power relationship will go on, and that said, South Korea doesn’t need to take sides. There are some who say Korea should take a side, but this would only reduce the strategic space and diplomatic options for Korea. What matters is how we can contribute to the reshaping of an East Asian order. Does South Korea have any alternative about that, when China wants to construct a Sino-centric order with the U.S. striving to maintain the existing order? Korea should find that alternative. What is fortunate though is that the major powers are not yet caught in any military struggle or confrontation. The key is thus to create an order in which small and middle-power states are not forced to take any side, and all countries can peacefully coexist. To create that order, we need to come up with an idea ― not an idea to make a Korea-centric regional architecture, but an idea to forge a harmonious regional order. There has been talk of competition between the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership and the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and between the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asia Development Bank led by the West and Japan. But we need to think about a way to forge an architecture in which those competing entities can coexist rather than compelling states to choose between the major powers.KH: The Park Geun-hye government has been pushing for its Northeast Peace and Cooperation Initiative, under which it wants to build regional trust by cooperating first on non-political, soft issues such as disaster relief and nuclear safety, and then gradually moving on to tougher security and political issues. Do you think this “functionalist” approach will be viable for this region?Sohn: Not really in the short-term. This should be a long-term vision, and we never know how much time it would take to build the kind of regional trust the initiative seeks to foster. Like you said, this is aimed at nurturing a culture of multilateral dialogue and cooperation through cooperating first on soft issues and then on “high-politics” issues. This, after all, boils down to whether the “spillover effect” can occur from the soft issues to the hard issues. The concept of this spillover effect is part of the European integration theory and this occurred in the European context. For the spillover effect, European integration theorists put forward three crucial conditions: First, the soft issues should be so vital that the security and political issues not impede cooperation over those soft issues. Seoul talks of soft issues including disaster relief and climate change, but these are not life-or-death topics that would leave regional states with no other option but to cooperate on security issues. Secondly, there should be deep interdependence or interconnection among those soft issues to create the spillover effect. But this interdependence seems to be weak when it comes to the soft issues Seoul has raised. And the last condition is about the social background or environment. To foster the spillover, the regional environment should be pluralistic, civil society should be strong, and there should be transnational networks of interest groups and experts.

Freedom, he says, has been worse. In the year since police emancipated the severely mentally disabled man from the remote island farm where he had worked for eight years, Kim has lived in a grim homeless shelter, where he has been preyed upon and robbed by other residents. He has no friends, no job training prospects or counseling, and feels confined and deeply bored. “I want to go back,” Kim, 41, said during a recent interview in the shelter near Mokpo, the southwestern mainland port that is the gateway to dozens of salt islands where a months-long investigation by The Associated Press found that slavery still thrives, an open secret among locals.  “I feel trapped here,” he said. Kim's plight illustrates the continuing failure of one of Asia's richest countries to help workers who have been enslaved on the farms _ often people with mental or physical disabilities. Three other disabled ex-slaves also told the AP that they wanted to return to the salt farms because of their misery and sense of aimlessness in the crowded homeless shelters that officials placed them in.  On the farms, they said, they at least had a fixed daily routine, a job they became skilled at and a sense of purpose. An official on Sinui, one of the salt-farming islands, confirms that at least one ex-slave has returned to a farm. Activists and officials suspect there are many more. While the initial reports on slavery shocked many South Koreans and led to a nationwide investigation last year, “Society continues to fail in providing basic help for our most vulnerable members even after they were pulled out of slavery on the islands,” said Choi Jung Kyu, a lawyer whose office represents 18 former slaves. “Our society is treating the victims worse than the salt farmers did.” Salt farmers often describe themselves as doing society a favor by taking in the homeless, the disabled, the uneducated and those who can't get jobs anywhere else and whom the rest of the country would like to forget. They also acknowledge a harsh economic reality.  “It would be extremely difficult to run a salt farm without disabled people,” said Park Jong-won, 69, a salt farm owner on Sinui Island who recently received a suspended sentence for exploiting a mentally disabled man for profit. “Normal people wouldn't work at salt farms even if we begged them.”  Prosecutors had sought a prison term for Park, but an appeals court showed leniency in part because it said Park provided the victim with “food and a place to stay.” Revelations of slavery involving South Korea's disabled on island salt farms have emerged five times in the last decade. Last year's government probe found more than 100 workers nationwide who'd received no, or scant, pay. A later investigation by police and activists found 63 more such workers in the islands, three quarters of whom were disabled. The investigations began after Seoul police went undercover to rescue a disabled man who had written to his mother to say he was enslaved on a salt farm. That man, Kim Seong-baek, is expected to testify Wednesday in a Seoul court as his former boss appeals a 3{-year prison sentence.  Kim Seong-baek, now living in Seoul, has no desire to go back; he says even looking at salt disgusts him. But several other recently freed slaves interviewed by AP say they feel more hopelessness and fear than relief about their lives away from the salt farms. Most of them were homeless before being lured to salt farms by illegal job brokers hired by farm owners. Kim Jong-seok, the former slave languishing in the homeless shelter near Mokpo, said that his ex-owner, who is being investigated for abuse but hasn't been arrested, recently visited and asked if he'd work for him again for about $90 a month.  Lawyers helping the victims said they are alarmed that some disabled ex-slaves are in regular contact with their former masters, but add that the law does not prohibit it. Others released from slavery also struggle to fit into society.  Han Sang-deok was freed by police last year after 20 years working without pay on a salt farm on Sinui, the same island where both Kims had been exploited. Until his release, not once did the 64-year-old mentally disabled man leave the island, Han said in an interview at a cafe in Mokpo.  Asked about his relationship with the farm owners, Han says: “I just worked. I was there on my own. I went to work, I slept. Like that.”  Han, whose relatives had thought he was dead for two decades, pauses for a long time when asked about his future plans, finally saying, “I don't know what I should do.”  Kang Seong-hwan, an official at the Sinui island ward office who is in charge of monitoring disabled workers, told AP that at least one salt farm slave had returned to his employer after being rescued last year. He said he has little actual power to check up on workers and suspects there are more cases of returned slaves because they have been essentially neglected after moving to shelters. Activists trying to keep tabs on freed slaves often track down victims only to hear them say that they have returned to the salt farms and do not want to be contacted again, said Huh Joo-hyeon, the director of an activist group in Mokpo.  Park Su-in, Huh's colleague, describes a system in which disabled workers on the islands become dependent on their owners for food and medical care, leading to exploitation. One disabled former slave she talked to didn't know the words “password” or “bank account,” yet he had a bank account, controlled by his owner, where his disability payments were sent. Amid short-lived public anger last year, regional government officials vowed to open an exclusive facility for the freed slaves and connect them with new jobs. The promises haven't been kept, and activists believe there's little chance they will be. Many of the ex-slaves are now in a bureaucratic limbo. Because they have been moved away from the islands in Sinan County, county officials say they can't help the victims and, besides, they don't have the space for them.  An official from the homeless shelter near Mokpo where Kim Jong-seok lives said freed slaves were supposed to stay there only temporarily, and wondered when Sinan County would take them back. The official, who refused to give his name because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly, said the facility barely has room for the homeless people in the area, and it's not their responsibility to provide job programs and counseling.   In some cases, guardians have been appointed to protect former slaves' interests. One ex-slave, Heo Tae-yeong, has a guardian who orchestrated his move from a Mokpo area homeless shelter to a residential facility for the mentally disabled in Gwangju.   Heo, who cannot read or count, worries that he will struggle in a new environment, but is excited about the idea of learning job skills in Gwangju. He hopes to one day work in a factory. When asked what he'll do with the money he earns, Heo takes a long drag off his cigarette.  He doesn't know. “I've never had any money.” (AP)","grim homeless shelter where ,grim homeless shelter ,in grim homeless shelter ,salt farms face misery ,robbed by other residents","['Kim Jong -', 'Kim']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71941715  0.05998132

One cow at a farm in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, had tested positive for the viral disease in the final examination, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said. The cow was found Monday to be drooling ― a common symptom of the disease. This is the first confirmed case of a cow with foot-and-mouth disease since 2012. Only pigs had been found to have been infected since the disease broke out again last month. The quarantine authorities stressed that it was unlikely the disease would spread to other cows at the farm. “Only one poorly immunized cow showed the symptom. Further transmission will be limited as all other cows at the farm showed a 94 percent antibody formation rate,” the Agriculture Ministry said. About 50 cows are being raised on the farm. Anseong was struck severely by foot-and-mouth disease from late 2010 to 2011. More than 207,000 livestock were slaughtered, causing losses of 40 billion won ($36 million). Meanwhile, a dozen more pigs were confirmed to have the contagious disease. The animals were immediately culled while other uninfected pigs were being monitored, the quarantine authorities said.The first case was discovered in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, on Dec. 3 and about 27,000 animals at 35 farms across the country had been culled as of Tuesday.As part of the efforts to contain the outbreak, the Agriculture Ministry vowed to strengthen the preventive measures. In the second sterilization measure to be taken nationwide, all livestock-related trucks will be subject to disinfection measures starting Wednesday.The ministry also toughened penalties for farm owners who do not follow the vaccination and disinfection measures.

Defectors based in the South have flocked to see the film at the center of an escalating international row thanks to its lurid depiction of the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.The United States claims that the film’s presentation of Kim ― whose family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades ― prompted Pyongyang to launch a massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures, the studio that made it.“Every defector I know has seen the movie,” said Kim Sung-min, who fled the North in 1996 and now runs the anti-Pyongyang Free North Korea Radio station.“We’ve talked a lot about this flick over the past week, and we simply did not understand why it gives foreigners laughs,” he added.Internet links to the film quickly circulated amongst the South’s 20,000-strong defector community after Sony reversed its decision to axe it late last month following threats to cinema-goers from the shadowy Sony hackers.But defectors have reacted to the movie with a mixture of shock and bafflement.It’s not just that its crass humor is largely lost on a North Korean audience ― it’s that growing up immersed in a personality cult, which gives god-like status to the ruling Kim dynasty, is not an experience that can easily be forgotten.Even for defectors who have been in the South for years, it is jarring to see Kim ridiculed as a Katy Perry fan who has a complex about his dad. “For me, it wasn’t a comedy ― more of a bombshell, because of the way it made fun of Kim Jong-un,” Park Sang-hak, who defected to the South in 1999, told AFP.But that is precisely the reason that Park, who leads a group of activists that regularly attempt to airdrop anti-Kim leaflets into North Korea, is planning to launch gas-filled balloons over the border carrying some 100,000 copies of the film on DVDs and USB memory sticks.

The losses were incurred after KNOC acquired NARL for the inflated price of $1.22 billion in 2009 although the due price was only around $941 million, according to the audit agency. Kang Young-won, the then-president of the state firm, hastily made the acquisition decision in order to boost its annual oil production performance, the audit agency said.The state auditor said that Kang was well aware of the prospect of a loss, but went ahead with the acquisition to attain yearly performance goals, adding that it had referred Kang to the prosecution on negligence charges. It is also urging the trade ministry to pursue a damages suit against the former president.“(KNOC) recklessly acquired the unhealthy refining firm without a sufficient review only to make up for its stagnant M&A; performance,” the audit agency said in a statement. Amid mounting losses, KNOC sold NARL to a New York-based merchant bank for just $3.5 million last year, citing unfavorable global refining market conditions as well as the prospect of further losses.The latest finding by the audit agency is expected to fuel the opposition political parties’ call for a parliamentary probe into former President Lee Myung-bak over his so-called energy diplomacy policy.Opposition parties and civic groups have claimed that massive amounts of state funds were wasted on overseas natural resources development projects pursued under the Lee administration.
