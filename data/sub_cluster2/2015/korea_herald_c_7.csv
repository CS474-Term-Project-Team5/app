But in August, she was cleared of the charges due to lack of evidence.  Last month, the 10 members of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra and Chung's secretary were booked on defamation charges against Park.  Police said they hope that Chung's wife will turn herself in to police for questioning.  Chung's wife is believed to have been staying in a foreign country since December last year.  Repeated calls to Chung's office seeking comment went unanswered on Sunday.  Meanwhile, the board of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra plans to hold a meeting on Monday to decide whether or not to extend its contract with Chung as the orchestra's music director by one more year.

1,1,1,Dispute rises over child care budget in South Korea,"The Education Ministry on Thursday threatened to file a lawsuit against municipal education offices that have been refusing to allocate their budget on next year’s child care allowance for children aged 3-5 with the claim that the central government must fully finance the program.　Backing the ministry’s stance, Choo Kyung-ho, head of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, also announced that the central go...","The Education Ministry on Thursday threatened to file a lawsuit against municipal education offices that have been refusing to allocate their budget on next year’s child care allowance for children aged 3-5 with the claim that the central government must fully finance the program.Backing the ministry’s stance, Choo Kyung-ho, head of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, also announced that the central government would take “every possible disciplinary measure” -- be it legal, administrative or financial -- to pressure the offices should they continuously refuse to cooperate. “All education superintendents are legally obligated to finance the free child care program,” said Lee Young, vice minister of education, during a press conference on Thursday, strongly urging the education offices to finance the budget as soon as possible.  Korean children celebrate Christmas Eve at a kindergarten in Seoul on Saturday. Yonhap“We are not going to tolerate them shifting their responsibility on the central government by using innocent parents as their hostage.”Among the 17 education offices nationwide, only 10 of them have set aside a budget for the “Nuri” subsidy program, which gives allowance that fully covers kindergarten and day care tuition fees for all children aged 3-5, albeit only for the first two months of 2016. Among the remaining seven, Sejong City and Gangwon and North Jeolla provinces have partially funded the programs by allocating their budget for children who will be attending kindergartens, but not those at day care centers. Four municipal education offices -- Seoul, Gwangju, and Gyeonggi and South Jeolla provinces -- have not set aside a budget for the program, meaning parents who live in those regions must start paying for their children’s kindergarten or day care costs starting January. According to the regional education offices, the Nuri program requires some 2.1 trillion won ($1.9 billion) to implement nationwide next year. The central government recently allocated 300 billion won to support the municipal offices to finance the program, but the education superintendents have stressed that they are still 1.8 trillion won short of making the allowance program possible for 2016.Just a day before the press conference, a group of education superintendents, including the Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon, gathered to express their frustration, publicly requesting President Park Geun-hye to meet with them in person to discuss the matter. Jang Huy-gook, superintendent of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education, who also represents all education chiefs nationwide, argued that day care centers are child care institutions, not educational institutions, and therefore regional education offices are only responsible for supporting kindergarten costs.“We have repeatedly told the central government that we are at least willing to finance the budget that is required for children who will be sent to kindergarten,” said Jang on Wednesday at the gathering in Seoul. “But day care centers are being regulated by the Ministry of Welfare, not the Ministry of Education. We believe that day care centers are child care institutions, not educational institutions. Therefore we think it’s reasonable for the central government, precisely the Welfare Ministry, to finance the Nuri allowance for parents who send their kids to day care centers, while we finance the program for those who send their children to kindergarten. It’s absurd for the central government to ask us to finance 1.8 trillion won while they’ve only given us 300 billion won.”The Education Ministry is not the only central government agency who is preparing a legal battle against municipal agencies. The Welfare Ministry also announced Wednesday that it would file a lawsuit against the governments of Seoul and Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, claiming the regional governments went against the law by setting aside a budget for special allowance program -- a monthly subsidy of 500,000 won -- for young unemployed Koreans without “consulting” the central government.Along with the Education Ministry, the Welfare Ministry also created controversy over its own child care subsidy program for infants aged 0-2 earlier this year. In September, it announced that it will charge households with full-time stay-at-home mothers for the currently free day care service should they utilize it for more than seven hours daily starting July next year. The revision, which the ministry claimed was “to better support double-income households,” was criticized by critics who called it misogynistic and discriminatory.

2,2,2,Petition against Japan normalization treaty dismissed,The Constitutional Court refused Wednesday to review a petition by a Korean woman who challenged the constitutionality of a 1965 treaty to normalize ties between Seoul and Tokyo on the grounds that the treaty limited individual rights to seek compensation for colonial-era forced labor.

The Constitutional Court delivers a ruling over the constitutionality of a 1965 treaty to normalize relations between Seoul and Tokyo on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Under the treaty, Tokyo offered Seoul $5 million in free grants and loans, and has thus argued that “all compensation issues” were settled with the treaty. This has triggered a series of lawsuits from individual victims and their families demanding separate reparations.Lee Yun-jae, the daughter of Lee Hwa-seop, mobilized by Japan for forced work in China in 1942, filed the petition in 2009, arguing that her family was not adequately compensated for her late father’s unpaid wages due in part to the treaty.Lee argued that a government panel established under a local act to support the victims failed to reflect the current value of the Japanese currency when calculating the compensation in 2008. She filed an administrative lawsuit to cancel the panel’s decision to offer Lee’s family 11.65 million won ($9,900) and applied for a constitutional petition against both the 1965 treaty and the local act to support the victims and their families.But the Constitutional Court refused to judge on the constitutionality of the treaty that it said would not affect the administrative legal case, and said that the local act was constitutional. It said that the calculation at the time, which reflected the rise in consumer prices, was based on “reasonable” standards.However, three of the nine judges voted against the local law, saying the government panel’s calculation of Lee’s unpaid wages did not correctly reflect the currency’s current value as it failed to take into account the economic growth rate.The court ruling drew keen attention as it could influence bilateral relations between Seoul and Tokyo amid ongoing negotiations over the issue of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.Tokyo has long argued that all legal compensation issues were settled under the 1965 treaty based on Article 2 that stipulates that the problem concerning property, rights and interests of Korea, Japan and their nationals had been settled “completely and finally.”But Seoul has claimed that the humanitarian issue involving former sex slaves was not on the agenda during the treaty negotiations, and that the sex slave issue should be handled separately.The Supreme Court rendered in 2012 that it is hard to conclude that the individual victims’ rights to claim compensation were removed due to the normalization treaty.Despite the 2012 ruling, Japanese firms that are engaged in lawsuits involving Korean victims of forced labor have refused to compensate the plaintiffs.

4,4,4,Postnatal care center sued for TB infection in South Korea,"Choi Young-doo, a father of two children, received an abrupt phone call from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August.

He was told that his second child, born in June, may have been exposed to tuberculosis while staying at a Seoul-based postpartum center for the first two weeks of his life.“It was just really absurd,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “I thought no one ever got TB in our country anymore.”Choi is one of 150 parents whose newborns were exposed to the virus by a nurse at the facility, a franchise postnatal center owned by DGRM Ltd., and who together filed a lawsuit against the center seeking financial compensation, following a criminal suit in September. Some 120 infants are believed to have been exposed to TB at the center from June to August.  A mother is holding her newborn at a postnatal center in South Korea. File photo/Yonhap.Following the phone call in August, Choi and other parents were invited to meet with health authorities at the KCDC. They were told not to worry. “I was told that the chance of my son being diagnosed with TB was like 1 in 1,000,” he said. But just about a week later, Choi’s newborn was diagnosed with latent TB (LTB), meaning the bacteria was in his body but inactive and causing no symptoms.  He was told by the doctor that his son still had to take antibiotics, as without treatment about 5 to 10 percent of those with LTB develop the TB disease at some time in their lives. “I was also told (from my doctor) that even if he takes antibiotics now, there is no guarantee that he won’t develop TB later in his life,” he said. “It just broke my heart. I was so angry at the medical authorities for letting this happen just a few months after the MERS outbreak.”As of Monday, 23 infants had been officially diagnosed with the disease, and 57 others, including Choi’s son, had been diagnosed with LTB.Each victim stayed at the facility for about a week. The nurse who infected the infants was told by her doctor in July that she may be TB-positive after taking a chest X-ray, but continued to come to work regardless.“The parents of the infants who have been infected by TB, and those whose babies have been told to take antibiotics to avoid developing TB later, deserve financial compensation from the center as they have so immensely suffered emotionally, especially with the side effects of the TB drugs,” the parents’ lawyer Lee Sung-jun said in the complaint. At most postpartum care centers, which are largely unique to South Korea, newborns stay in a separate room with other babies away from their mothers and are looked after by nurses on shifts. They are united with their mothers for breast-feeding and other bonding time. The schedule for the mothers, who often opt for the service for postpartum rest, includes body massages, facials, child care education classes and exercise sessions. The parents are each seeking legal compensation ranging from 1.5 million won ($1,300) to 8 million won for emotional and financial damages, especially for having to make their infants take tuberculosis medication that can be highly toxic to the liver.According to Yeyul, a law firm representing the parents, their infants have been taking Rifampicin, also known as Rifampin, an antibiotic to treat TB and LTB. The babies experienced the severe side effects of the drug, including vomiting, loss of appetite, blood in the urine and sleepiness. “My baby also experienced loss of appetite and diarrhea,” said Choi.Choi claimed that the owner of the postnatal center, the CEO of DGRM Ltd., never offered a proper apology to the parents. The CEO, surnamed Kim, had been scheduled to meet with the parents and the officials of the KCDC in October, but abruptly canceled his attendance just a day before the event. “He once told me, ‘It’s not like the babies are dead,’” Choi said. Choi also said that the KCDC’s early handling of the outbreak was extremely unprofessional. “As parents, we always kept in touch with one another,” he said. “So we knew that in September that at least 26 children were diagnosed with LTB.“But the KCDC announced that only 13 had been confirmed with LTB after their own investigation. It turns out they simply didn’t know some parents chose to spend their own funds to get tested by a different doctor who wasn’t recommended by the KCDC.” By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","sued for tb infection ,his second child born ,tb infection in south ,seoul based postpartum center ,center sued for tb","['the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Seoul', 'Choi', 'the Korea Herald']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17078978  0.33839986

Choi Yoon-hee, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for receiving bribes from an arms dealer in connection with the Navy’s purchase of multi-mission maritime helicopters.The joint investigation team for corruption involving arms procurement projects said that Choi is suspected of ordering officers to forge an assessment report to show that the AW159 Wildcat supplied by Agusta Westland meets the Navy’s requirements in 2012. The Navy had been pushing the project in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan corvette in 2010, in which 46 sailors and officers perished. Without any actual evaluation of the model, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration decided in January 2013 to buy eight Wildcat helicopters worth 580 billion won by 2016 and the process is underway. Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff YonhapThe investigators said Choi appears to have a close relationship with an arms dealer identified by his surname Ham. Ham has also been indicted for bribery.In exchange, Ham allegedly arranged a job for Choi’s close subordinate, while repeatedly offering fine dining to Choi’s wife.In exchange for the Navy’s final decision to purchase the Wildcat, Ham is also suspected of delivering 20 million won ($17,200) to Choi’s son, who has been preparing to open a business, in September 2014. Choi reportedly admitted that his son received the money from the dealer, but insisted that the exchange had no relation to him. Choi’s son claimed that he gave 15 million won back to the dealer.Two researchers at state-run defense institutes have also been indicted for receiving bribes from Ham in exchange for favorable assessment in arms procurement.Choi is the highest-ranking military officer to face trial over arms graft since 1996 when former Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho was questioned for being involved in illegal lobbying. Lee was not punished due to lack of evidence.The joint investigative team encompassing prosecutors, government officials and experts launched in November last year to zero in on arms graft cases have indicted 74, of whom nearly 20 have so far been sentenced to imprisonment. The accumulated volume of the indicted bribery cases exceeds 1 trillion won. Of the indicted, 11 are former or incumbent military generals. The team is originally slated to wrap up their work by the end of this month, but calls have been rising for an extension of their operation.

Lim was detained in February soon after he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission.Ban's possible trip and the North's court decision do not appear to be a ""simple coincidence,"" said Cheong, who has long followed North Korea issues.If the U.N. leader visits Pyongyang, chances are high that leader Kim Jong-un will grant Lim a special pardon as a ""gift"" for Ban, Cheong added.

The sentence is seen as an effort by the judiciary to break away from the long practice of giving light punishment to owners of family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, citing their importance to the national economy.  The judge further said it was his intention to clearly make sure that ""even chaebol who commit corporate crimes or evade tax for personal benefits or ignore law and order will be severely punished.""    The tycoon was sentenced to four years in jail and fined 26 billion won by a local court in 2013. In June 2014, an appeals court commuted the jail term to three years. The Supreme Court, however, returned the case to the Seoul High Court in September this year, asking it to reconsider its heavy ruling on Lee's breach of trust charges.  The top court said he should not be judged with the aggravated charges as the amount of losses caused by Lee's breach of trust cannot be calculated specifically.  Lee, however, was not immediately detained following the sentencing as the appeals court again accepted his request last month to suspend his three-year imprisonment until March 21 for hospital treatment. He has been in the hospital while awaiting sentencing in the retrial.  Lee, who has undergone a kidney transplant, claims that he suffers from multiple illnesses such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and kidney disease.  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited neurological disease characterized by the slow, progressive degeneration of the muscles in the feet, lower legs and hands.

They have been charged with copyright infringement and disrupting public duty. Out of the 105 who have been summarily charged, the professors who stole their peers’ work have each been fined 10 million won ($8,440), while the original authors face a 3 million-won fine.The officials have also indicted five publishing company employees on suspicion of taking part in the scheme.This is the first time that the authorities have staged a mass crackdown on the widespread “cover-swapping” sham, whereby scholars disguise an already-published book by another scholar as their own. The original author condones the process in order to maintain an amicable relationship with the publishers for future book deals, who in turn get to sell their inventory as new books.As local universities have policies against rehiring faculty members who have been fined 3 million won or more, it is likely that they will be banned from returning to their teaching posts.Prosecutors have notified the list of the indicted professors to their respective universities, and plan to expand the investigation by launching a special team dealing specifically with illegal activities related to research and studies.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","korean prosecutors indicted thursday ,prosecution indicts 179 professors ,indicted thursday 179 professors ,prosecutors indicted thursday 179 ,professors over copyright breach","['korean', 'Uijeongbu District Prosecutors ’ Office']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.12140403  0.40855026

The relevant bills are currently being debated at the National Assembly. After emerging from his hiding place at around 10:20 a.m., he paid respects at the main temple and held a press briefing in front of hundreds of labor activists, reporters, monks and Buddhist followers before being taken by the police. “The government made me the most wanted man in this country for fighting against labor market reform bills that enable (businesses) to fire workers more easily,” Han said, wearing a headband with the slogan, “Abolish the temporary workers’ system.”“The labor reforms (pushed by the government) crush the dreams of irregular workers,” he said. “Though I am detained today, I will continue to fight in prison and in court until labor market reform is stopped.”  (Yonhap)Some 30 labor union members gathered around the union chief Han holding up placards reading “Opposition to labor market reform, please protect 20 million workers’ lives.” The workers’ union has fiercely opposed the government’s push for labor policies that they said will give business more leeway to dismiss workers, extend hiring of irregular workers and cap the salaries of senior employees. The government pushed for the measures in the hope to boost economy and create jobs for the young. Han also expressed gratitude to the Jogyesa Temple that provided him with protection.“I decided to voluntarily leave the temple as I could not sit back and see the police forcing their way into the holy, religious place,” he said, lamenting the police’s attempt to raid the temple. Stepping up pressure on the indecisive main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, Han said the party should declare its stance to halt the labor market reform bill rather than weigh pros and cons at the negotiating table. In the Buddhist temple that is kept peaceful and quiet in most other times, some 2,000 uniformed police officers surrounded the religious venue to prevent possible clashes.As Han finished his speech, scores of temple officials formed a human chain to lead him into the waiting police van, while labor activists chanted “We are all Han Sang-kyun,” “President Park Geun-hye, step down,” and “Let’s resist labor market reform.” “I am okay. Why do you cry?” Han told a union member shedding tears. Walking down the road, he hugged some of the unionists that lined the way.  (Yonhap)The arrest came a day after the police suspended its operation to force their way into the temple to arrest him in response to monks’ repeated calls for a cease-fire at the height of intensifying tension on Wednesday evening. The monks said a raid would be considered an act of religious persecution.Several civic groups voiced opposition to Han’s detainment, lashing out at the government for cracking down on workers and thus undermining democracy.On the other hand, a separate crowd, mostly in their 50s to 80s, gathered inside the temple and condemned monks for protecting Han, who they accused of attempting to overthrow the nation. At Han’s request, the Jogye Order ― the nation’s largest Buddhist sect with several million followers ― has played a mediating role between the labor activist and the government since he took refuge there. The temple, along with Myeongdong Cathedral in central Seoul, has served as a shelter for political and student activists seeking refuge from police crackdowns in times of authoritarian rule, notably under the military-backed governments of the 1980s. As the Cathedral’s role as a shelter has since diminished, the temple remains virtually the sole haven for labor activists.But the temple has appeared reluctant to provoke the police, asking the labor chief to voluntarily leave the temple to end “the vicious cycle of violence.” The police were also seen hesitant in raiding the temple to arrest fugitives in the fear that it could trigger a public backlash. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","temple arrested by police ,chief leaves temple arrested ,leading illegal rallies at ,arrest the police officers ,arrested by police han","['Han Sang - kyun', 'Jogyesa Temple', 'the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions', 'Seoul']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48548925  0.13606051

The Gwangju District Court handed down on Nov. 30 a fine of 12 million won ($10,300) in consideration that a jail sentence could “heighten his chances of getting expelled” from his school, Chosun University.The case was thrust into the media spotlight this week and soon went viral on social media after the ruling that critics said showcased the justice system’s lack of recognition of the seriousness of domestic and dating violence. 123RFThe student, whose name was withheld, was released with the fine after physically abusing and choking his ex-girlfriend, who is also a medical student at the same university, while holding her captive in her own apartment for four hours on March 28. According to court documents, he broke into the victim’s place at 3 a.m., while drunk, accused her of taking his phone calls with “no manners” and slapped and hit her repeatedly.  The victim suffered two broken ribs in the incident, and had to receive three weeks of medical treatment. In an audio file recorded by the victim during the abuse and broadcast by a local TV network, the perpetrator threatens to kill her while the victim begs him stop beating her. Prosecutors had initially sought a two-year prison sentence, but the court only gave him a fine, saying the perpetrator “deeply regrets his wrongdoings” and “if he gets sentenced to any penalty heavier than probation, the medical student may face expulsion from his school.”Chosun University, meanwhile, held a committee meeting Tuesday -- more than eight months after the incident took place -- after receiving fierce public criticism when the case was reported in the media. The school announced Wednesday that it would expel the convicted student. “We are deeply sorry for all the trouble we’ve caused,” the school said on its Facebook account.Suffering from depression and anxiety disorder, the victim shared in a public online post in October that she had asked her school to arrange her classes so she and her attacker didn’t have to be in the same classroom. But her requests were rejected. When the perpetrator gave her a settlement offer, the victim asked him to leave the school temporarily until she graduated instead. He refused and eventually was indicted.“We want to ask the court,” said women’s rights group Korea Women’s Hot Line. “What is more important? Social justice or the perpetrator’s future as a medical doctor? A victim’s life or the perpetrator’s career opportunities?”Because the attacker did not receive a jail term from the Gwangju District Court while Chosun University did not expel him until recently, the victim was faced with a situation where she had to leave the school in order to avoid running into the attacker again. “Why should someone like him be allowed to become a doctor?” the victim wrote in her online post. “I’m the victim and I’m still the one who has to be scared and feel unsafe at school.”In the post, the victim also shared that although he had abused her frequently prior to the particular incident on March 28, she couldn’t break up with him because the attacker threatened to release privately recorded video footage of them.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","blasted for dating abuse ,beating his then girlfriend ,punishment on dating abuse ,dating abuse perpetrator medical ,college blasted for dating","['the Gwangju District Court', 'Chosun Unive']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40794471  0.0579134

Law firm Barun said it will ask West Virginia University to examine if the defeat device software was used in Volkswagen cars equipped with the new EA 288 engine. Researchers from the school had initially studied the emissions rigging that led U.S. environmental authorities to launch a probe.“We are requesting the examination from the U.S. school because the Korean authorities failed to find (the defeat device software in the new engine cars). The law firm will cooperate with the college in terms of technology and finding the software,” Barun said. The law firm is currently leading the class-action lawsuit for about 2,000 local Volkswagen customers against the German carmaker to nullify the purchase contracts and receive refunds. The details of the examination plan will be released next week, it added. Earlier last week, the Ministry of Environment confirmed that Volkswagen cars with the old EA 189 engine used the defeat device software to fake the emissions in order to pass the local emissions test. It ordered a recall for some 125,000 vehicles here and fined the carmaker a penalty of 14.1 billion won ($12.2 million). The ministry, however, said that it has not found evidence of the problematic device being used in the new EA288 engine-equipped vehicles, adding that a further probe is underway. The ministry launched a test in October on six models of diesel-engine Volkswagen vehicles -- two Euro 5 cars and four Euro 6 vehicles. Based on the Environment Ministry’s test result, the Transport Ministry will conduct three rounds of probes to look into whether the emissions rigging affected the fuel efficiency and safety of passengers, officials said.

(Kang Yong-suk’s blog)The “right to advertise,” despite the powerful support of the right to free speech, is now facing a new challenge. Kang Yong-suk, a TV personality and lawyer at Next Law, recently triggered the controversy with a poster of himself roaring “I sue you!” What was meant to be a witty ad was taken down shortly after concerns emerged that the ad could degrade the image of legal practice as simply a means of quick vengeance and moneymaking. “This is more about doctors and lawyers being seen as businessmen -- although the South Korean Supreme Court may disagree,” Kang wrote in his blog, adding that he would let Seoul Bar Association decide whether the poster -- allegedly drafted by his secretary and not himself -- breaches lawyers’ code of professional conduct. Kang’s office said it was preparing a second advertisement to replace the “I sue you” ad, “drafted with moderation.” The office acknowledged that the controversial advertisement reaped tangible effects, such as weeks of full booking of billable hours from new clients.  Kang Yong-suk, an outspoken television persona and partner of law firm Next Law, signs autographs on 100 of his controversial “I sue you” advertisement posters. (Kang Yong-suk’s blog)Kang’s case sheds a new light on the tactical part of the ethical standards for a responsible advertisement.Since 1998, the Supreme Court confirmed that the freedom to free expression applied to commercial advertisements, yet with restrictions. “The special characteristics of a commercial expression has stronger ramifications on viewers than a non-commercial expression, and therefore is subject to stronger regulation,” says Kwon Hyung-doon, professor of law at Kongju National University, in his lecture at the Korean Society for Media Law, Ethics and Policy Research in August. While the level of restrictions on commercial advertisements vary according to different cultures and government regimes, the most broadly accepted rules of responsible advertisement are those suggested by the U.S. Fair Trade Commission Act: truth in advertising, protection of minors, and refraining from overly provocative tactics and promoting harmful products. Advertisements should be truthful and have evidence to back up their claims. The U.S. authorities defines deceitful statements as those that are likely to mislead consumers who act reasonably under normal circumstances and that are likely to affect consumers’ purchase decisions. Even truthful advertisements can negatively affect children, by causing them to believe exaggerated statements or images, to develop negative self-images or to become attracted to products that can impede social development.The most subtle part of the advertising ethics these days, indeed, is advertising tactics. Subliminal advertising, emotional appeal and taking advantage of less educated audiences are strictly monitored by the Korean authorities. Despite the good-willed goals of the media post-monitoring regulations, mainstream media law experts suggest that the Korean advertising regulations need more clarification. Under the current broadcasting law, television commercials should not include “inappropriate,” or “excessive” expressions, leaving gray areas that are subject to interpretation.

32,32,32,Fixed bonuses part of regular pay: top court,"The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the fixed amount of performance-based bonus paid on a regular basis should be considered part of workers‘ regular wages, in a landmark ruling that effectively handed a victory to 1,025 employees of GM Korea in their legal dispute against the company.

South Korea’s top court upheld a ruling by a lower court that said GM Korea should include its monthly paid bonus and family allowance as part of the regular wages, which forms the basis for calculating each employees‘ additional allowances. The ruling marked the first time the Supreme Court reached a decision specifically on the performance-based salaries in relation to regular wages. The court had ruled in December 2013 that regularly paid bonuses should be regarded as regular wages. Korean law stipulates that regular wages are hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or contracted fees paid to a worker routinely, but there has been consistent dispute over whether it should also include regularly paid bonuses and allowances.Debate over the scope of regular pay was ignited in 2013 when GM chief Daniel Akerson requested President Park Geun-hye address the regular wages issue before the company invested an additional $8 billion into the country.The ruling Saenuri Party has been revising the labor law as part of labor reforms. The revised version excludes additional payments based on each employee‘s circumstance or performance. The Federation of Korea Trade Unions welcomed the court’s decision and called on the government and the ruling party to “immediately stop their push to expand the scope of excluded categories from the regular wages.”Thursday’s ruling is likely to have rippling effects throughout the industry, which has complained over possible surges in personnel expenses if the regular wages encompass the bonuses and allowances.The 2013 ruling, meanwhile, had said that an employee’s right to receive the unpaid wages may be restricted if the company’s operations would be greatly disrupted by the payment, leaving room for different interpretations over how to measure a company‘s anticipated hardship.Since 2006, GM Korea has been paying what is referred to in Korea as “accomplishment salaries,” a form of bonus based on the respective workers’ performance evaluation the year before. The bonus is set as high as seven times the amount of each employee‘s monthly base pay, and is handed out on a monthly basis.But when GM Korea excluded the accomplishment salary and other allowances when setting regular wages, employees filed a lawsuit against the company in 2007. GM Korea has said the bonus should be excluded, as it differs for each employee, but the workers said it is regularly paid and has a fixed rate.“Since the amount of accomplishment salary is already fixed in the year that they are paid, it should be included in the regular wages,” the court said in its ruling. It stipulated the criteria for regular wages as regularity, fixed rate and uniformity, and pointed out the bonus is paid to even first-year workers with no previous performance record.But the court remanded the case of including other allowances ― such as for insurance fees and vacations ― as part of the regular salary to the Seoul High Court. In a separate case on Nov. 2, Seoul High Court turned down five GM Korea workers’ lawsuit against the company to pay them extra fees that would have incurred if their past regular wages included regularly paid bonuses.It pointed out that paying the extra wages would cause great difficulties to the company, which had already suffered from an annual loss of 60 billion won ($52.3 million) from 2008 to 2010. But the court handed victory to 933 workers of Korea Southern Power Co. Ltd. on a similar request, pointing out that paying the additional wages would not force the company into hardships.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","court on thursday ruled ,its monthly paid bonus ,025 employees of gm ,supreme court on thursday ,victory to 025 employees","['the Supreme Court', 'GM Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'GM Korea']",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.10556637 0.3331618  0.1315964 ],Yoon Min-sik,Social affairs,11,2015,"the regular wages thursday ruling ,wages are hourly daily weekly ,025 employees of gm korea ,regular wages thursday ruling ,regular wages thursday ruling is","['the Supreme Court', 'GM Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'GM Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'korean', 'GM', 'Daniel Akerson', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Federation of Korea Trade Unions', 'GM Korea', 'Korea', 'GM Korea', 'GM Korea', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Seoul High Court', 'Korea Southern Power Co.

Choi Yoon-hee appears at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Choi, who ended his 42-year military career in October, is suspected of receiving bribes in return for selecting the AW159 Lynx Wildcat as the country’s new maritime helicopter in 2012, according to prosecutors. The prosecution is investigating whether Choi, who was then Chief of Naval Operations, was involved in the decision to purchase the AW159 Wildcat, which does not meet the required operational capabilities. After the purchase of the helicopter, it was revealed that Navy fabricated the documents on the AW159’s operational capabilities to help the Anglo-Italian company win the deal in exchange for kickbacks. So far, seven military officials were indicted on charges of forging documents on the helicopter’s capabilities. The summons came months after a rear admiral, surnamed Park, who was arrested for fabricating the assessment reports, accused Choi of having instructed him to do so. The investigators also suspect Choi of taking kickbacks from an arms broker, surnamed Ham. He allegedly gave 20 million won ($17,200) to Choi’s son, who was preparing to open his own business. The son, however, denied the involvement of his father in the transaction, according to prosecutors. The joint investigation team, comprised of government, military and prosecution officials, was launched in November last year as part of efforts to root out prevalent corruption in the defense industry, as a string of corruption cases came to light over the last year.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors office on tuesday ,chief quizzed over corruption ,summoned for questioning tuesday ,corruption claims former chairman ,italian company newly retired","['the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'anglo', 'italian', 'Choi Yoon - hee']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31535664  0.14382821

The plaintiff claimed she suffered mentally as President Park said Hwang distorted the brutal human rights situation in the North.The 41-year-old was indicted in February on charges of making flattering remarks about North Korea during the on-stage talk shows, in violation of the South's National Security Law. The law bans any activity meant to praise or propagandize North Korean ideals. Seoul remains technically at war with Pyongyang since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Hwang said Park's remarks, which were made when Hwang was under investigation by prosecutors, had a negative impact on the probe results.The court, however, said some of the remarks were simple opinions, which do not hold liability for defamation compensation, and others were based on facts which cannot be illegal.

A total of 22 members of civic group Countermeasure Committee for Public Livelihood said they filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen Korea CEO Thomas Kuehl for allegedly taking massive financial advantage by violating rules, and causing environment problems, thereby affecting the public health. This is the first time that a third party -- other than the automaker’s customers -- has launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen. “Due to Volkswagen’s trickery, (we) have been defenselessly exposed to category-1-carcinogen-designated diesel emissions nearly every day from its vehicles, which has increased the probability of getting respiratory diseases,” the plaintiffs said in the statement. “Although there may have not been any direct physical damage for now, (the company) must at least financially compensate for the psychological shock, anxiety and concerns about the potential health impact.” Separately, 44 members of the group filed a suit against a local car distributor for polluting the environment, seeking compensation of 300,000 won ($260) each, the organization said. Volkswagen drew global criticism in September after the carmaker admitted that it had cheated on its emissions standards compliance by installing software in some diesel-powered vehicles to pass the emission tests. Volkswagen Korea apologized to Korean customers and vowed to recall the problematic cars. Over 120,000 concerned vehicles have been sold in Korea, the German company said. The Korean branch of the global carmaker has faced a class-action lawsuit from nearly 2,000 customers who seek to nullify the purchase contracts and get a refund, according to law firm Barun, which is leading the lawsuit. The law firm has been filing a lawsuit every week upon requests from customers since late September. More are to join the collective legal battle, it added. The Environment Ministry launched its own test last month over whether the diesel engine Volkswagen vehicles here meet the emissions standard compliance under two tests -- outdoor driving test and indoor driving test. In an indoor driving test last month, the emissions of all the concerned vehicles recorded below the standard limit of 0.08 gram per kilometer, the ministry said.The outdoor driving test currently underway will last for more than a month. The results will be released next week, it added. Based on the result of the Environment Ministry’s test, the Transport Ministry will probe the association between the emissions and fuel efficiency, officials said. If the emission rigging is confirmed here, the carmaker will likely face a penalty along with compensation lawsuits.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","volkswagen over emissions scandal ,against volkswagen korea ceo ,sues volkswagen over emissions ,sued german carmaker volkswagen ,group sues volkswagen over","['korean', 'german', 'Volkswagen', 'Countermeasure Committee for Public Livelihood', 'Volkswagen Korea', 'Thomas Kuehl']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28767475  0.2575925

The Supreme Court said it would launch a special “one-stop” center under the Patent Court where the international intellectual property conflicts can be negotiated and resolved. “Mediation is crucial in patent cases, as they mostly deal with highly professional knowledge and sensitive issues involving confidential information of the concerned businesses,” the authorities said.The court will contemplate expanding the center as an international organ that encompasses Asian countries upon mutual negotiation in the future, they added. This is part of the top court’s efforts to improve the specialty of the Patent Court. In June, the top court launched a special task force called the “Intellectual Property Hub Court” committee to discuss plans to boost the Patent Court’s professionalism. Public voices have raised concern over improving the Patent Court’s professionalism as it frequently covers sensitive interest issues of global industries, especially the information technology sector and pharmaceutical businesses. Along with the mediation center, the top court vowed to lengthen the maximum work term of the patent court judges to six years to improve their expertise, up from the current two to four years. To better support judges’ technical deliberation, more than a dozen doctorate-degree patent experts will be recruited, the authorities said. Starting from January, the Patent Court will cover a wider range of intellectual property litigations, such as compensation suits and sales bans, as the patent lawsuit-related rule is modified. The court currently only deals with lawsuits over annulling the trial decision. Starting as early as February next year, the patent court’s trials will also be available in English, including testimony and pleas. Currently, all legal processes are conducted only in Korean. Foreign-language documents must also be submitted in Korean after translation. Earlier this year, the committee said it would establish an “international justice department” in order better support the legal accessibility of foreigners. English trials will be held only upon the agreement of the plaintiffs and defendants. Once introduced, Korea will be the first East Asian country to adopt an English-language patent lawsuit system.

However, he received a “not guilty” verdict for taking a total of 16 photographs containing women’s entire bodies, rather than specific body parts such as legs.From April to May, the man sneakily took pictures of body parts of women, mostly wearing revealing clothing, such as miniskirts or shorts, at the subway station almost every day. The police found a total of 58 photographs on his phone. Among them, 16 of the photos were of the women’s entire bodies, while the rest were of the bare legs of the women. According to Article 13 of South Korea’s Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment of Sexual Crimes, a person “who takes pictures of another person’s body, which may cause any sexual stimulus or shame, against the latter’s will by using a camera or other similar mechanism, or who distributes, sells, leases or openly exhibits or screens such pictures so taken shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or by a fine not exceeding 10 million won ($8,520).” A subway station in Seoul. YonhapIn explaining its decision to only punish the criminal for taking pictures of specific body parts but not entire bodies, the Seoul Northern District Court said it was illogical to interpret a woman in her summer clothes in the summer months as being a “body that may cause any sexual stimulus or shame,” as more women choose to dress casually and less conservatively. They said taking such pictures of a woman’s body as a whole is a matter related to portrait rights. However, Lee Soo-yeon from the Korean Women’s Development Institute said sneakily taking pictures of women, regardless of which body part, is problematic and should be banned. “Regardless of what it is -- the entire body or particular body parts -- secretly taking photographs of women is voyeuristic,” she said. “The government should do more to prevent such practices, by educating the public on why it is wrong to take pictures of someone else without that person’s consent.”Meanwhile, the Ministry of Gender Equality was criticized during the National Assembly inspection last month for its campaign ad against sexual harassment using smart devices in public transportation. The ad encouraged women not to wear miniskirts, or to cover their legs if they do, when riding the subway, but failed to denounce taking photographs of someone in secret, said Rep. Lim Su-kyung from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy. “Such ads are based on a notion that when a woman gets sexually harassed, she must have done something to deserve it. Now this is very problematic,” she said during the audit last month.

The officials said some 90 students who were below the cutoff grade were admitted to the school as a result.The SMOE decided to file charges with the prosecution against the school officials ― including the school’s chairman of the board Kim Seung-yu, a former chairman of Hana Financial Group ― in violation of the law on private education institutes.The special probe also found HAS guilty of violating the law in its hiring process, along with attempting to cover up a case of school violence that occurred in 2011. The academy also allegedly inked several illegal deals with an enterprise established by Hana Group officials.Korean law states that a deal worth 50 million won or more commissioned by a private education institute must go through a public bidding process, a rule the SMOE says the school violated multiple times.HAS is an autonomous private high school founded by Hana Financial Group in 2010. Autonomous private high schools are elite schools granted more leeway in admissions and curriculum in exchange for lower government subsidies. The school came under fire after a revelation by one of its teachers in August that it conducted admissions fraud under the direction of its principal. The SMOE launched a special investigation the following month into this claim.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office filed charges against the 67-year-old Chung for taking bribes and breaching his duties by causing financial losses to the nation’s biggest steelmaker, it said in a press briefing Wednesday morning. Chung Joon-yang (Yonhap)The prosecution also indicted other key figures -- former POSCO vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa, 63, and Dongyang Construction chairman Bae Sung-ro, 60 -- without detention for their involvement in embezzlement, bribery and breach of trust. The move came seven months after the prosecution launched a probe in March into POSCO’s alleged corruption upon a tip-off the steel giant had dubious deals with subcontractors, affiliates and high-profile politicians. Chung is suspected of masterminding dubious mergers and acquisitions deals during his term as chairman between 2009 and 2014, allegedly causing 159 billion won ($137.5 million) in losses to POSCO. In one example from 2011, he led the acquisition of a stake in plant equipment firm Sungin Geotec, owned by a close friend, for well over market value.  Chung also allegedly exerted undue influence in getting a family member a job as a high-level official at Kosteel, a partner company of POSCO. Kosteel has been suspected of helping POSCO evade taxes by doctoring transaction records and creating slush funds. Lee Sang-deuk (Yonhap) The prosecution additionally accused him of offering deals worth 1.2 billion won to small maintenance company TM Tech, run by a close aid of former President Lee Myung-bak’s elder brother Lee Sang-deuk.In return, the 79-year-old former ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker allegedly exerted influence on government officials to appoint Chung as POSCO chairman and to lift planning restrictions so the company could resume its construction of a new steel factory in 2011. He was indicted without detention on influence peddling charges. The prosecution indicted former POSCO vice chairman Dong-hwa for creating a slush fund worth $5 million in Vietnam during his term in the office and embezzling a total of 1 billion won. He allegedly took kickbacks including cash and golf trips from the subcontractor in return for granting it business deals. He also gave an executive position at POSCO to a high-ranking government official’s high school friend in early 2011.Bae Sung-ro, another key figure at the center of the corruption scandal, was indicted on charges of fraud. The former chairman of Dongyang Construction allegedly covered up his company’s financial records to win construction bids and loans from state-run banks. He allegedly received preferential treatment from POSCO leaders in exchange for kickbacks and creating slush funds for POSCO and its affiliates.As a result of the probe, the prosecution shed light on widespread corruption cases stemming from the formerly state-run POSCO’s heavy reliance on the government, its leadership’s cozy relations with politicians and lax management. POSCO, which was established under the rule of former President Park Chung-hee and run by the government since then, began its privatization process in 1998 in the face of the Asian financial crisis. Though POSCO was completely privatized in 2000, its operation and appointment of the chief executives have been greatly swayed by the government.“As POSCO doesn’t have a family owner, there were cases in which company executives with only a limited term colluded with politicians and gave favors to certain subcontractors (in connection with them),” an official from the prosecution said. But prosecutors came under fire for dragging out the probe over months without a visible outcome, possibly taking a toll on the steel giant’s business. Their multiple requests for detention warrants for Chung and Bae were rejected in the process due to a lack of evidence. The prosecution indicted a total of 32 people, mostly from POSCO and its subcontractors. Among them, 17 were detained. It plans to continue probing the six-term lawmaker Lee Byung-suk of the ruling Saenuri Party to see whether he was involved in the corruption case.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","former posco chairman indicted ,prosecution indicting former posco ,wednesday with the prosecution ,indicting former posco chairman ,chairman indicted without detention","['POSCO', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Chung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.17087941  0.25213549

58,58,58,Seoul mayor files suit against lawyer over rumors about son," Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon filed a defamation suit against former ruling party lawmaker and attorney Kang Yong-seok for spreading rumors on his son’s alleged military draft dodging, sources said Sunday.This is the first lawsuit raised by Park on behalf of his son Park Ju-sin, 29, against Kang, who has for years claimed the son fabricated medical records to dodge the mandatory military service. Seoul Mayor Park...","Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon filed a defamation suit against former ruling party lawmaker and attorney Kang Yong-seok for spreading rumors on his son’s alleged military draft dodging, sources said Sunday.This is the first lawsuit raised by Park on behalf of his son Park Ju-sin, 29, against Kang, who has for years claimed the son fabricated medical records to dodge the mandatory military service. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon (left) and lawyer Kang Yong-seok YonhapAccording to legal sources, Park filed for indemnification for damages worth 110 million won ($95,400) with the Seoul Central District Court. Park reportedly claimed that Kang “was consistently distributing false facts that myself and my son committed irregularities pertaining to the military service or that we have evaded conscription through illegal means.”He went on to say that such allegations have been confirmed false by the prosecution, the court and other state organizations and that he was seeking compensation for defamation and violation of personal rights.Park Ju-sin’s military service has been a constant subject of debate between the senior Park and conservative critics, leading to scores of legal suits and reexamination of the junior Park’s medical records.Park Ju-sin joined the Air Force in 2011, but was sent home four days later after suffering pain in his legs. The son was released from active duty after the Military Manpower Administration found him unfit due to a herniated disc.Park was specifically taking issue with comments made by Kang since June on several cable television programs that “suspicions surrounding Joo-sin remain unsolved.”In 2012, Kang claimed Park’s son fabricated his medical records to evade military service and publicly demanded another physical examination. Kang later resigned from his lawmaker’s seat when the Severance Hospital confirmed the same year that Park Ju-sin had the herniated disc and that it was a valid reason for his exemption.Park has filed defamation suits against 16 Internet users who raised draft-dodging rumors, some of whom Kang is defending as an attorney.A medical expert in radiology who had raised similar suspicions against Park Ju-sin is currently on trial.From news reports","seoul mayor files suit ,mayor files suit against ,his son park ju ,son seoul city mayor ,son fabricated medical records","['Seoul City', 'Park Won - soon', 'Kang Yong - seok', 'Park Ju - sin', 'Kang', 'Seoul', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1168352   0.2567142

(Yonhap)The police arrested 371 foreign nationals, of whom 27 were physically detained, for involvement in gambling and phishing scams during the two-month crackdown that started in September. In most cases, foreigners gambled for fun with their friends, without being aware it was illegal. But this time, police caught a professional criminal ring luring foreigners into large-scale gambling, according to the police.“Gambling or voice phishing with falsified bankbooks are not classified as severe crimes, but we decided to crack down on the crimes as illegal money can sneak out of Korea through these crimes,” an official from the National Police Agency said. Of the remaining 337 foreign nationals arrested, 194 were nabbed for severe violence, followed by 70 for gang violence, 61 for drug use and 12 for sex crimes, the police said. Most of the gangs form groups with friends or colleagues to collectively use violence for minor issues and are not unified enough to be called organized crime rings, the police said. The National Police Agency clamped down on foreign gangs in the first half of the year, either deporting or leading them to leave the country, according to the police. Out of 121 cases of robbery and assaults, 96 were committed against people of the same nationality. As those from the same country tend to gather together, they have more chances to argue or clash, the police said. Of the remaining 25 cases, 13 were committed against South Koreans, mostly in relation to delayed payments, and 10 percent were committed against foreigners of different nationalities, according to police. Most were unplanned, they added. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heralcrop.com)","police arrested 371 foreign ,arrested 371 foreign nationals ,month crackdown on gambling ,the police arrested 371 ,two months with gambling","['Korea', 'the National Police Agency']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51671344  0.27901718

He died on the way to a hospital.Lee was initially indicted on a murder charge in 1997 and sentenced to 20-year jail term, but later was cleared of the charge for lack of evidence. Prosecutors indicted Patterson on lesser charges, including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon. He received an 18-month prison term, but was freed in an annual amnesty in 1998. During the questioning, Lee found it difficult to recall the situation in which the murder took place in April 1997, but the Korean-American said in the courtroom that he saw Patterson suddenly turning to the victim and stabbing him. “When the murder took place, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands,” he said. “Patterson suddenly started to stab him. I turned around and I was shocked.“Cho was trying to hit the accused with his right hand, but Patterson stabbed him and kept stabbing him.” He admitted that there were only three people including Patterson, Cho and himself at the crime scene. But he continued to accuse Patterson of murdering Cho.He also took issue with the credibility of the past investigation records and how he was treated during the questioning by the police and prosecutors. “I have consistently asked for an interpreter, but they didn’t provide me with one,” he said. “I was interrogated without an interpreter, coerced and threated during the first investigation for 17 hours. They didn’t let me go to sleep.” Lee has actively sought his rights at the court, refusing to answer personal questions, pointing out the prosecution’s evidence is wrong, demanding more pieces of paper to take notes, and asking for explanations when he did not understand the questions. While Lee was giving his testimonies, Patterson, who appeared in a sky-blue prisoner uniform, calmly yet sternly stared at Lee and the translator in turns. The mother of the victim Cho also took the witness stand and asked the court to heavily punish her son’s murderer at the hearing.“Judges and prosecutors, please slap our son’s murderer with the heaviest punishment for our son who unfairly died,” Lee Bok-soo, 73, said in the courtroom.“I don’t know what to say in front of the man who killed my son as I am too furious,” Cho’s mother said with her voice trembling with rage. “They (Patterson and Lee) are just sitting there shifting blame and denying their crime, which made me think that it is exactly the same as the trial 18 years ago,” she said. “If they have a conscience, they should come forward and apologize. They are only human beings in disguise.”As the prosecution began showing pictures of Cho’s blood from the crime scene at the hearing, Cho’s mother expressed her discomfort and left the courtroom in the middle of it. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","murder case testified wednesday ,killing south korean college ,murder suspect 18 years ,trial as murder suspect ,murder case testifies korean","['korean - American', 'south korean', 'Arthur John Patterson', 'Edward Lee', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'Patterson']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39722276  0.36950344

He died on the way to a hospital.At the crime scene, there were only two other people apart from the victim -- Cho, Patterson and a Korean-American Edward Lee. Lee was initially indicted on a murder charge in 1997 and sentenced to 20-year-jail term, but later was cleared of the charge for lack of evidence. Prosecutors indicted Patterson on lesser charges, including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon.

They are only human beings in disguise.”“I think about what it could be if Joong-pil is still alive. I could have a meal with my son, look at his face and hold him, but I can’t,” she said, asking the judge to reveal who the real murderer was to ease her son’s pain. In the hearing, the prosecution pointed out that Patterson could face a jail term of up to 20 years as he is now an adult. When the murder took place, he was 18 years old. But Patterson’s lawyer refuted the claims, saying the prosecution misinterpreted Patterson’s testimonies and wrongly assessed the crime situation. Lee appeared at the court as a witness later in the day.

Overturning a lower court's ruling, the appellate court at Seoul Family Court last month granted a divorce to the man, whose identity was withheld, who was blamed for their shattered marriage, court officials said Sunday. The couple tied the knot 45 years ago but agreed to end the marriage 10 years later. Three years later, they reunited, but the husband soon cheated on the wife and had a baby out of wedlock.After 25 years of living apart from his family without any contact or exchanges, the husband initiated the divorce proceedings against his wife in 2013, but it was dismissed in the original trial.But the appellate court found no sufficient reason for them to maintain their legal relationship.""While being separated for the 25 years, their marriage has effectively ended,"" presiding Judge Min Yu-suk said in a ruling last month. ""The plaintiff has also financially supported his children with the wife, and she now is financially stable.""It is the first ruling after the Supreme Court allowed more exceptions in September while maintaining the country's ""fault divorce"" system, in which the spouse responsible for the breakdown of the marriage is not allowed to file a divorce lawsuit.In a 7-6 ruling, the top court said it is too premature to change the law in consideration of the country's social and economic conditions. But it expanded the scope of grounds for exceptive cases: when the spouse at fault is taking care of his/her partner and children enough to make up for the fault and when enough time has passed to make it meaningless to place the blame.

Mike Trotsky, vice president of air and missile defense at the U.S. defense giant, said at a news conference in Washington on Thursday that the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system ― which the company manufactures ― is a subject of “ongoing policy discussions” between the two countries. The event came days ahead of U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s trip to Seoul for annual ministerial security talks. Speaking at a parliamentary session, Defense Minister Han Min-koo brushed off the assertion as “groundless.” “The two governments have never talked about it,” he said. A Defense Ministry official also said Seoul’s position remained unchanged: That it will look into the issue after the U.S. makes a decision and requests consultations. “There is no discussion between the sides, whether formal or informal,” he said, adding that THAAD is not on the agenda for the Security Consultative Meeting scheduled for Monday. The Pentagon also echoed the ministry’s remarks, saying it has not reached a decision and thus no official talks have taken place between the allies. “We have made no final decision regarding the deployment of a U.S. THAAD unit to the Republic of Korea, nor have we had any formal consultations with the ROK government on this issue,” Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman, told Yonhap news agency. The unabated controversy over THAAD reflects Seoul’s dilemma deepened by North Korea’s growing missile threats and the stiff opposition of China and Russia, which view its deployment here as de facto participation in the U.S.-led global missile defense program that they say is directed at them.Trotsky stressed the defensive nature of the system, saying it would equip South Korea with multilayer defense and help counter North Korea’s threats. “Having those layers makes it extremely difficult for the enemy to deploy any one technique that would defeat all three systems,” he said.“It can’t be used in an offensive way. The entire system, from the hardware to the software, must have an incoming ballistic missile to launch an interceptor.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","friday dismissed lockheed martin ,on friday dismissed lockheed ,seoul dismisses lockheed claim ,friday dismissed lockheed ,ministry on friday dismissed","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry', 'Lockheed Martin ’s', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Mike Trotsky', 'U.S.', 'Washington']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26019964  0.36342865

It also took into account that the three abused Yoon to lesser degrees and tried to save him when the junior solider collapsed.Last year, the lower court sentenced Lee to 35 years for murdering Yoon, while other sergeants and corporals involved received between 10 and 12 years in jail for killing him as accomplices. Yoon died in April 2014 after allegedly being hit in the chest by fellow enlisted soldiers at their barracks while eating snacks. The military says the assault caused a piece of food to obstruct his airway, leading him to die of asphyxiation.The accused reportedly constantly bullied and beat Yoon in the month before his death, making him lick their spittle off the floor or eat toothpaste. They also forcefully prevented him from sleeping. The case shed light on the problems of bullying in the military and its abusive culture in the country where all able-bodied man must serve about two years as conscripts to deter aggressions from North Korea. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","soldier bullying death south ,retrial on soldier bullying ,on soldier bullying death ,soldier bullying death ,murder charge for sergeant","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Yoon Seung - joo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03321559  0.05007927

Yoo Woo-seong, 35, was indicted in February 2013 over allegations he collected detailed information on defectors in the South while working at the Seoul city government and relayed it to the North in breach of the country's National Security Law, which prohibits South Koreans from engaging in activities benefiting the North. Upholding a lower court's ruling, the Supreme Court found Yoo not guilty of charges he carried out espionage activities, citing a lack of admissibility in the testimony of the witness.The court, however, found him guilty of other charges including fraud and passport law violation and sentenced him to a year in prison with two years of suspension. Yoo was also ordered to forfeit some 25 million won (US$21,800) he gained with the status as a defector.Under South Korean law, Yoo, who held Chinese nationality in North Korea, cannot be acknowledged as a North Korean. After a Seoul district court acquitted Yoo in August 2013, prosecutors appealed the verdict and submitted Chinese immigration records on Yoo's visit to the North. But some of the documents werelater found to have been forged to frame Yoo.  In 2014, prosecutors announced the results of a two-month investigation into the scandal, concluding that the National Intelligence Service fabricated the immigration records.Later on Thursday, the court will announce the ruling on the officials who are involved in the forgery of the documents.

""If Volkswagen Group did not cheat on its emission tests, consumers would not have paid a large sum of money to buy the cars that failed to pass the tests,"" the plaintiffs said.Among the cars owned by the plaintiffs are the A4, the A5, the A6 2.0 TDI, the Q3 and the Q5 2.0 TDI equipped with EA 189 diesel engines, which are embroiled in the fake test scandal. Some Audi owners have joined Volkswagen users to sue the German automaker following the scandal, but it is the first time that Audi drivers have filed their own suit at home and abroad.  Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that Volkswagen used software that activates emission controls only when the car is going through official testing to fake test results and pass strict emissions standards.

The rear admiral, surnamed Kim, rose to fame for leading the Cheonghae Unit during its operation in late 2012 to rescue the sailors of the MT Gemini, a tanker owned by a Singaporean shipping company that had been taken captive by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. He reportedly faces accusations of overestimating food expenses to purchase liquor and pocketing some fuel outlays. Kim’s apprehension followed a raid at his office at the Navy headquarters in Gyeryong, South Chungcheong Province. “The military prosecutors are carrying out an investigation after arresting him in the afternoon on charges of embezzling food costs and other public money while serving in the Cheonghae Unit,” the ministry said in a statement. In recent months, the Navy has been reeling from a series of graft scandals involving former and incumbent senior officials, triggering public criticism and calls for sweeping reform amid North Korea’s continued maritime threats.A pangovernmental panel in March indicted a retired rear admiral and a retired commander on charges of manipulating documents regarding the evaluation of a substandard part of a naval salvage ship, named Tongyeong, to help a foreign defense contractor win a procurement deal. Former Chief of Naval Operations Hwang Ki-chul, who served from 2013-15, was also arrested that month on charges of peddling influence to allow the firm to secure a contract to supply a part of the same vessel.

Kang Tae-yong, Cho’s No. 2 man in the pyramid scheme, was caught by the Chinese police at his apartment in Jiangsu Province on Saturday, seven years after he fled to China to avoid the police probe.“We expect Kang, who is a key suspect, to give us decisive clues in investigating the fraud case,” an official from the Daegu District Prosecutor’s Office said.  Kang Tae-yong (Yonhap)Kang is known to be the right-hand man of Cho, the mastermind behind the pyramid scheme who allegedly died of a heart attack in China. Kang took charge of finances and lobbying prosecutors, police officers and political tycoons, asking them for leniency in the probe. He is also suspected of embezzling tens of billions of won in company assets. Kang fled to China, along with Cho, in 2008 as the police began investigating the company’s fraud scheme. The International Criminal Police Organization issued red notices for both of them, marking them among the internationally most-wanted. Cho Hee-pal (Yonhap)Cho allegedly conned up to 50,000 people out of an estimated 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) by running 10 leasing companies to lure potential investors with false promises of high returns on their capital. Korean victims claim the total damages amount to 8 trillion won. The fraud case, which has dragged on after the key suspects escaped to China and Cho was reported as dead, will likely gather momentum as Kang is expected to be extradited to Korea as early as this weekend. With Kang’s return, prosecutors plan to look into whether Cho died as reported, possible bribery involved in the scam, and alleged embezzlement. Victims believe that Cho is still alive, living a life of luxury under a fake identity in China. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","korea largest ever fraud ,arrested in china three ,largest ever fraud case ,pyramid scandal the prosecution ,the prosecution said monday","['South Korea ’s', 'Cho Hee - pal', 'China', 'Kang Tae - yong', 'chinese', 'Jiangsu Province', 'China']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07898576  0.49436024

Lee, 36, who recently returned to Korea, will accept the prosecution’s request to testify as a witness in the trial set to begin Thursday, his father said in an interview with a local news outlet. The father said Lee is willing to take the stand to get “the wrong path” set straight. Patterson, 35, was extradited to Korea on Sept. 23 to face a new trial on charges of stabbing Cho Joong-pil to death in 1997 at a Burger King restaurant in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by expats residing in Seoul.  (Yonhap)Lee and Patterson, both teenagers at the time, accused each other of murdering Cho, who was found on the restroom floor with several wounds to his neck. Cho died on the way to a hospital. Patterson was in Seoul as his father was a civilian worker for the U.S. military, which has maintained a large presence in South Korea to deter North Korean aggression since the 1950-53 Korean War. In what many see as a botched probe, the prosecution initially indicted Lee on a murder charge, with an appeals court sentencing him to 20 years in jail. But Lee was later acquitted of the murder for lack of evidence in the retrial ordered by the highest court. Patterson, on the other hand, was indicted on lesser charges including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon. He was handed down 18 months in jail, but freed in a special amnesty move before finishing his term in 1998. A year later, prosecutors launched a new probe into the murder case, viewing Patterson as the prime suspect. But Patterson fled to the U.S. as the government failed to renew his travel ban. The long-forgotten case was brought back to the spotlight with the release of a 2009 film on the murder. Amid mounting public calls to extradite Patterson, prosecutors indicted him on a murder charge in 2011 after the 35-year-old man was caught in the U.S. Patterson had attempted to delay extradition by submitting multiple habeas corpus petitions to U.S. courts until his petition was finally rejected and he was extradited to Korea. Now, eyes are on the Patterson case amid the public furor as South Koreans remain largely sour toward crimes committed by foreigners, especially those involving the U.S. military. In accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement signed between South Korea and the U.S. in 1966, American soldiers and those working for them here are not subjected to Korean jurisdiction.The case also rekindled a debate over what many see as the incompetence of the police and prosecutors who accused the wrong person for the murder in the first place. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","new murder suspect arthur ,murdering south korean college ,trial of new murder ,of new murder suspect ,itaewon murder trial seoul","['Seoul', 'korean - American', 'Edward Lee', 'south korean', 'Arthur John Patterson', 'Korea']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32156739  0.10366406

Lee, together with his accomplice who was indicted in August, demanded 50 million won ($41,500) in exchange for stopping the attack, but did not succeed in extorting the money, prosecutors said.He is also suspected of extorting some 4.5 million won from other small and medium-sized businesses by launching similar cyberattacks.The 39-year-old is also charged with infecting over 10,000 computers with malicious codes and opening an illegal gambling site in 2008.Until 2011, when he returned to South Korea, Lee had been living abroad to escape investigation.A DDoS attack most often involves flooding websites with large amounts of data, rendering the targeted servers unusable by obstructing their communication with users' computers. The attacks generally involve multiple personal computers infected by a virus, allowing individual hackers to drive more traffic to the targeted site.

Lee Sang-deuk, a former six-term lawmaker, appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at around 10:20 a.m., two years after he completed a 14-month jail term on charges of receiving kickbacks from local savings banks.  (Yonhap)This time, the former ruling Saenuri party member is accused of pressuring a senior official at POSCO to offer business deals to one of its subcontractors, TM Tech, of which one of his close aides is a major shareholder.TM Tech, established in late 2008, reported 17 billion won ($1,450) in yearly sales on average, mostly through these deals with POSCO. A large portion of the dividends Park received from TM Tech, worth 2 billion won, is thought to have been used to fund Lee’s political campaign.In return, the 79-year-old former lawmaker allegedly exerted influence to help POSCO resume its construction of a new steel factory in 2011, which had been suspended in 2009 due to planning restrictions. The prosecution also suspects Lee of peddling influence in appointing Chung Joon-yang as former chairman of POSCO in 2009. Lee, however, has flatly denied all the accusations.“I don’t know why I am even here. I cannot answer your questions,” Lee told the press before entering the prosecutors’ office on Monday morning.The prosecution considers seeking an arrest warrant to detain him on charges of taking bribes if the allegations were confirmed. The summons is the latest in a string of probes into POSCO and its subcontractors and subsidiaries over suspicious deals and creation of slush funds between 2009 and 2014. Investigators have focused on investigating whether the steelmaker was granted favors during the previous Lee administration as part of his drive for “energy diplomacy.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","ex president lee brother ,former six term lawmaker ,brother of former president ,scandal the elder brother ,former president lee myung","['Lee Myung - bak', 'POSCO', 'Lee Sang - deuk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29287639  0.61084253

According to Saenuri Party Rep. Ha Tae-keung quoting the National Intelligence Service’s report, two servers in charge of managing the PCs of Seoul Metro were hacked in July last year, allowing unauthorized access to 213 company computers. Of them, 58 were found have to been infected with a malicious code, resulting in the leak of 12 work documents.The NIS concluded that the hacking was conducted by the Advanced Persistent Threat, the same attack method used in the hacking of major broadcasters and banks in Seoul in March 2013. Pyongyang was suspected to have been the culprit then. The NIS, however, said it could not find the first point of hacking and the source of the code, citing insufficient log files, officials said.Seoul Metro said the leaked documents were not security-sensitive but related to human resources and internal management of the state-owned company. Seoul Metro is in charge of running Subway Line Nos. 1-4.Seoul Metro also stressed that the hacking did not affect subway safety as the central control system is run separately in an enclosed type of network server. As part of the efforts to improve the server safety, Seoul Metro formatted all PCs last year and strengthened the security measures.Seoul Metro has seen a rise in cyberattacks in recent years. As of last month, over 350,000 cases were confirmed this year, which is nearly equivalent to last year’s total figure, Seoul officials said.

Kim also said that the hotline was first installed during the former Kim Dae-jung government.The NIS believes that Kim apparently broke the law banning former and current NIS employees from revealing state secrets that they got informed of while performing their official duties. The law also bans an NIS employee from publishing a book concerning his or her NIS duties without the permission from the incumbent NIS chief. Kim recently published his memoirs regarding the 2007 inter-Korean summit, but he reportedly did not get NIS permission.In 2011, Kim faced an indictment for revealing state secrets in his contribution to a Japanese monthly. The indictment was suspended later. As the controversy escalated, Kim reversed himself, saying that Roh and the former North Korean leader did not have any telephone talks.“I just meant that there was a hotline through which the leaders of the two Koreas were able to exchange their views promptly. But they did not ever hold any direct talks over the phone,” he said during a symposium hosted last Friday by the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation.Park Jie-won, a lawmaker of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, called on Kim to show “restraint,” saying that he would step in should Kim continue to make “unnecessary” remarks. Park served as the chief of staff for former President Kim Dae-jung.“He (Kim) should have behaved as (former) NIS chief if he had really led the organization,” Kim said in his Twitter posting. “He should repeatedly exert restraint.” The former NIS chief’s revelation about the inter-Korean hotline during the liberal Kim and Roh administrations highlighted the current lack of top-level communication.With the former Lee Myung-bak government adopting a strictly reciprocal policy toward the North, bilateral relations chilled. The cross-border tensions further deteriorated as Pyongyang launched a set of deadly attacks including the sinking of the corvette Cheonan in 2010.Since the Park administration was launched in early 2013, high-level exchanges have rarely occurred. The two sides are now seeking to arrange and institutionalize cross-border talks, but uncertainties for the talks have increased as Pyongyang is expected to launch provocations such as a long-range rocket launch this month.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","2008 former nis chief ,spy agency to file ,disclosed in media interview ,complaint against former chief ,media interview that roh","['NIS', 'Kim Man - bok', 'Kim Man - bok', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32321876  0.32322577

Hours before he committed suicide, he claimed that he had handed illegal funds to Lee, as well as seven other figures, in a phone interview with a local daily. Under the Korean law, politicians are banned from accepting contributions of more than 100,000 won.Lee on Friday denied accusations made by the late Sung at the Seoul Central Court. “Who can believe that someone would hand over illegal funds to another at a crowded campaign office?” he said.

The case will be handled at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The National Tax Service said William Park is well-qualified and has extensive experience in handling investor state disputes at the ICSID.Besides selecting the 68-year-old scholar, the government has picked local law firm Kim & Chang, as well as New York-based Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, to represent its position. Park has acted as an arbitrator on 17 ISD cases at the ICSID, the tax service said, adding Park also heads the London Court of International Arbitration, is the editor-in-chief of the Arbitration International academic journal and has authored the highly respected book titled the Income Tax Treaty Arbitration. ""The government is committed to actively countering arguments made by Hanocal,"" it stressed. Hanocal maintains that slapping taxes on the sale of shares violates the ban on the double taxation convention agreement between South Korea and the Netherlands. The government views Hanocal as a mere ""front company"" with no real authority, it said.""Because IPIC is the real beneficiary of the sale, it is the government's belief that all actions regarding taxes must follow bilateral rules in place between South Korea and the UAE,"" said a source, who declined to be identified. He said under Seoul-Abu Dhabi rules charging taxes is justified.Hanocal, meanwhile, picked Gary Born as its arbitrator and U.S. law firm Wilmer Hale for the case.

Officials said 388 other cases are being investigated at the moment.“There has been a steady increase in child abuse cases and legal actions taken against offenders on the heels of growing social awareness and intolerance for such actions,” an agency official said.In 2001, there were 2,105 cases of child abuse confirmed by authorities, but this rose to 5,581 cases in 2007 before reaching 6,791 in 2013 and spiking to 10,027 last year.At the present pace, there is a chance that the total number of child abuse cases in 2015 will surpass last year’s total.According to the report, 47.6 percent of child abuse cases involved the father of the child, followed by 29.8 percent for the mother, with stepparents or both biological parents accounting for the rest. Slightly over 6 percent of the abusers were teachers and day care workers, including those hired by kindergartens. Of the kind of abuse endured by children, physical abuse ranked No. 1, followed by mental abuse, neglect and sexual abuse.Of the all cases involving child abuse, legal action was taken against 27 percent of the offenders, up 12 percentage points compared to all of last year, it said.From news reports","hospitals to report child ,seoul government said wednesday ,child abuse cases medical ,said wednesday the ministry ,report child abuse cases","['Seoul', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'Cabinet']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24164198  0.3173922

Arthur John Patterson. (Yonhap)“It’s not right that they (the family of the victim) have to keep going through the pain over and over and over, but it’s not right that I’m here either. I still shocked that I’m even here,” the 36-year-old suspect told the swarm of journalists staked out at Incheon International Airport.In 1997, prosecutors indicted Lee on charges of stabbing the victim to death, while accusing Patterson of carrying a weapon and eliminating the evidence by getting rid of the knife and burning his bloodstained clothes. Patterson, 18 years old at the time, was staying in Seoul as the dependent of a civilian worker with the U.S. military. The Supreme Court, however, acquitted Lee in 1999, citing a lack of evidence. Patterson was sentenced to a 1 1/2-year prison term in 1998, but was granted a special pardon on the Liberation Day of the same year. Patterson left the country the following year when prosecutors failed to extend his travel ban on time.The investigation was heavily criticized as prosecutors reportedly failed to properly question the suspects despite key evidence, due to a language barrier, while the Status of Forces Agreement prevented widespread questioning of other relevant witnesses including their friends.The case was resurrected when a film, “The Case of Itaewon Homicide,” based on the murder was released in 2009, stoking widespread public furor. The prosecutors relaunched the probe and this time pointed to Patterson as the real suspect.Lee, who left for the U.S. after his acquittal, reportedly returned to Seoul several years back and vowed to support the reinvestigation. His current whereabouts are as of yet unconfirmed.In December 2011, the prosecution indicted Patterson for murder and set into motion the extradition process. While the U.S. law authorities allowed the extradition in October 2012 after the suspect was caught in collaboration with American investigators, Patterson submitted multiple habeas corpus petitions. He also requested the suspension of the extradition measure. The U.S. appeals court, however, ruled that his extradition to Korea was valid in May this year. His retrial request was also dismissed in July. Patterson did not request an additional suspension for extradition, which enabled Korean investigators to persuade the U.S. authorities to extradite him last month. An extradition suspension measure has to be applied for within two months of the court’s latest decision. Five Korean officers of the Justice Ministry flew to the U.S. on Monday to bring him to Korea. Patterson was immediately taken to the Seoul Detention Center upon arrival. He is expected to stand trial no later than next month, officials said. A public defender has been assigned to Patterson, they said.

The amount is enough for hundreds of thousands of people to take at once, prosecutors said.   Under the directions of the gang member, a 60-year-old South Korean who authenticates meth in China allegedly received the drugs from a Chinese person, whose identity was withheld, in July.   The drugs were then brought into South Korea through a crew member of a 7,000-ton cargo ship, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors, together with the Incheon Main Customs and National Intelligence Service, arrested the three one by one based on the information that a crew member was planning to smuggle the drugs into the country.   Prosecutors said they were looking into a possible connection with a Japanese gang and chasing after local smugglers in collaboration with the Japanese authorities.

About 180 workers were also fired, many of whom filed a lawsuit against the automaker, demanding they be reinstated. A lower court, however, did not recognize the legitimacy of the strikes and ordered the union to take responsibility for 60 percent of the loss incurred by them, estimated to be 5.5 billion won.Kim Deuk-jung, head of the Ssangyong Motor union, claimed the ruling seems to unfairly represent the company's interest.

He had an affair with another woman and had a child with her in 1998. The man left his marriage home in 2000, started living with the other woman and eventually filed for divorce in 2011.Seven of the 13 sitting judges said that it was premature to introduce no-fault divorce that acknowledges a divorce requested by the person at fault. The court explained that Korean laws already enable the spouse at fault to be able to seek divorce through a divorce settlement, the most common form of divorce in the country. In 2014, 77.7 percent of all divorce cases were finalized through settlement.The court said that such leeway provides the spouse at fault the ability to seek divorce for the sake of his or her right to pursue happiness. Consequently, winning divorce through a no-fault system is not required.It added that while countries that have introduced the no-fault divorce system have a set of legal tools to protect the counterpart and their offspring from facing harsh situations after divorce, Korea has yet to secure such protection.

This support demonstrates the deep and enduring friendship between our peoples,"" she said.   Adams declined to comment on ""the motivations of the attacker or the reasoning behind the verdict.""   Kim, 55, was immediately arrested at the scene. As he was hauled away, he shouted opposition to joint military exercises that were underway between South Korea and the U.S. at the time, echoing calls from North Korea, which denounces such drills as a rehearsal for invasion.   Prosecutors pressed additional charges that Kim also violated the anti-communist National Security Law that bans any acts benefiting North Korea. But the court acquitted him of those charges, saying it is difficult to recognize Kim posed threats to the country's existence or liberal democracy.   Prosecutors said they would appeal the acquittal.

Prosecutors earlier said that Kim attacked the envoy following the North's accusation that South Korea-U.S. joint military exercises are war rehearsals for an attack against the North, adding that books and other materials confiscated from Kim's home support North Korea's strategy to communize South Korea.""While some of the defendant's arguments coincide with that of the North, such as opposing the military exercises, they are ideas that have been often claimed by the academic circles and civic groups in the country,"" Judge Kim said, adding the claim does not pose a direct threat to the country.Regarding the books and documents confiscated from Kim's house that supported the North, the court said the amount was only marginal. ""Kim had been studying reunification at graduate school.Considering the huge amount of materials on the two countries' traditional cultures found at his place, Kim does not seem to have kept the pro-North Korean documents to benefit the North,"" Judge Kim added.

The highest court sent the case back to the lower court, taking issue with the amount of the money Lee misappropriated and the ordinance applied to his crime – the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. The prosecution charged him in accordance with the aggravated punishment law, accusing Lee of having forced CJ Group’s Japanese branch to give a joint guarantee in a dubious real estate deal with a property manager, Pan Japan, in 2007. Lee was suspected of having purchased property in Tokyo, Japan, under a false name using secret overseas funds funneled through Pan Japan, causing more than 30 billion won in financial losses to the company.But the court said that his crime should be subjected to the Criminal Act, rather than the aggravated punishment law on economic crimes, as the exact profits from the shady real estate deal cannot be calculated.When the Criminal Act applies to his crime, Lee could face a sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to 15 million won. But the aggravated punishment law could hand him down a life imprisonment or jail term of more than five years. As the court accepted Lee’s request to suspend the imprisonment for hospital treatment, he will stand trial without physical detention. Lee underwent a kidney transplant last July, but allegedly suffered from multiple side effects. He is currently staying at the Seoul National University Hospital.Following the ruling, CJ Group expressed relief, saying that it hopes to see the prison sentence for Lee reduced or suspended in the upcoming retrial. “Given Lee’s frail health, we are relieved that the chairman secured a chance to lower his prison term,” a spokesperson for CJ said. “We expect the lower court to make a verdict in line with the highest court’s intention.”Lee, a nephew of Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee, took the helm of Cheiljedang, the precursor to CJ Group, in 2002.

Chung and Jeon are known to be friends.Also, engineering firm Dongyang Construction is suspected of creating slush funds for POSCO and its affiliates while winning bids for about 10 overseas projects placed by POSCO since 2009, prosecutors said. The chairman of Kosteel Co., which buys steel slabs from POSCO to make wire rods, is suspected of helping the global steel giant evade taxes by doctoring transaction records. The Kosteel chairman is also known to be a close friend of Chung.

Their estimated prices range from 3.5 million won ($2,901) to 5.5 million won per piece.They were part of art pieces that the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation seized from Kim Min-young, a former chief of the now-bankrupt Busan Savings Bank.The paintings on silk, symbolizing the Big Dipper and several other stars in the sky, were created in 1861 at Pyochung Temple in Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province, before being enshrined at Beomeo Temple in Busan.They are presumed to have been smuggled out of the country during the chaos of the Korean society in the 1950s and 1960s.The Overseas Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation and the temple acquired three of the paintings at the Koller Auktionen in Switzerland for 78,500 Swiss francs (94 million won) in June. The paintings were enshrined the next month at a museum of the Beomeo Temple in a ceremony to mark their return after nearly 50 years.The Chilseong paintings that will be in next week's auction have the same letters that appear to be the name of a donor in a red square box at the bottom center of each painting for inscribing the archival record as the two paintings from Switzerland.""The paintings on sale are identical to the ones that returned from Switzerland in terms of the overall composition of a picture and style,"" said Jeong Woo-taek, an expert of Buddhist paintings who works for Seoul's Dongguk University.

The 26-year-old, surnamed Kim, was murdered by her 24-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly killed her while drunk after she tried to break up with him. The boyfriend, only identified by his surname Lee, impersonated Kim on social media for two weeks after killing her and disposing of her body.According to Rep. Jeong Yong-ki of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of murder cases among dating partners has been on the rise in Korea since 2012, from 99 to 108 last year. In the last three years, the number of victims like Kim totaled 313. A research also showed that 40 percent of the Korean women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. (123RF)The murder cases accounted for 11.9 percent of all crimes committed by the victims’ romantic partners against them, including stalking, physical violence and rape. The rate is particularly high considering the total number of murder cases in Korea only accounted for 1.69 percent of all violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- in the same period.“This means two people are being killed by their romantic partners every week,” Rep. Jeong said.According to Korea Women’s Hotline, a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence, at least 114 Korean women were killed by either their husbands or boyfriends last year, while at least 95 women survived after being seriously attacked by their spouses or romantic partners. Almost 90 percent of women who participated in the NGO’s research last year said they had been either physically or emotionally abused while dating or during courtship. From 2011 to 2013, some 20,500 individuals were arrested for dating violence. According to the police, Kim had also reportedly endured serious dating violence for about a year until she tried to end things with Lee. According to local news reports, Lee would often break into Kim’s house without consent for “not picking up his calls” and physically abuse her. Lee later confessed to the police that he killed Kim “in a fit of rage” when he learned that Kim wanted to break up with him. Kim and Lee had met as teacher and student at a private English institution in Busan, where Kim had been teaching upon returning to Korea after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany.Kim’s story overlaps with experiences of many women who participated in researcher Lee Hwa-young’s study for Korea Women’s Hotline. Many suffered abuse, assault and rape when they tried to end the relationship.One of the victims had been dragged to a motel room against her will and raped there by her enraged boyfriend, right after she told him that she wanted to break up with him. Another victim had been guilt-tripped and emotionally abused after she tried to end things with her boyfriend. “He told me that I’m being a terrible person (by trying to break up with him) to his mother as well, because he already told her that we are getting married and our breakup is going to hurt and disappoint her badly,” the victim told researcher Lee in her study.Another victim was stunned by what a police officer told her after she reported her ex. She also had been stalked and physically abused by her ex after breaking up with him. The officer reportedly told her: “You shouldn’t have been so harsh when you broke up with him.”According to Safe Harbors of the Finger Lakes, an American support organization for victims of violence, there are some characteristics that are common to abusers of dating violence. One of them has to do with gender role expectations. Many individuals who abuse their romantic partners tend to have certain ideas of how men and women should act, largely following the stereotypical ideas of male dominance and female passivity. The abusers also may have difficulty expressing feelings, abuse alcohol and be “protective of their romantic partners to the point of controlling that person,” according to the organization. Local experts say that popular culture and sex education are some of the biggest -- and often negative -- influences in gender role expectations among Koreans, which sometimes cause problematic consequences in relationships.“For example, there are so many Korean TV dramas that show its male protagonist forcing a kiss onto his love interest, while the woman just docilely accepts it,” researcher Lee from Korea Women’s Hotline told The Korea Herald. “Many men, especially teenagers, may think this is normal and acceptable behavior. It does not only apply to men. While men may think it’s acceptable to kiss or touch someone against the person’s will -- or it’s not ‘manly enough’ or ‘cool’ to even ask the woman for consent -- young women may think they should just remain silent even if their dating partner does something they don’t want or like, or keep their wants to themselves and wait until the man makes the move.”Meanwhile, the Education Ministry’s recently issued -- and heavily criticized -- guidelines for sex education famously stated that “date rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want commensurate compensation from the woman.” Lee’s research also showed that 40 percent of the women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. The largest portion of them, 60 percent, said it was because the abuse was not “serious enough” to end the relationship. Rep. Jeong said the government needs to be more involved in combating dating and domestic violence. Introducing heavier penalties for stalking, which often leads to more serious forms of abuse, can be one of the ways to improve the situation, according to civic experts. In Korea, the heaviest penalty a stalker can face is a fine of 100,000 won ($83).Since 2012, two bills have been proposed to introduce heavier punishment for stalking, but are still pending at the National Assembly for approval.

(Yonhap)Seoul High Court on Friday suspended the sentence of Seoul education superintendent Cho Hi-yeon, who was accused of conducting a smear campaign against his rival candidate in last year’s election.The ruling would allow him to retain his post if confirmed. If a person whose sentence has been suspended commits no further offenses for two years, his or her charges are expunged under Korean law.While the appellate court found Cho partially guilty of spreading false rumors against opposing candidate Koh Seung-duk, it said Cho’s actions had little effect on the outcome of the election. “(Cho’s actions) were to verify (Koh’s) qualifications as a public official, and cannot be regarded as malicious propaganda aiming to defame him,” the court said in its ruling.After the ruling, Cho told the reporters that the ruling showed that appropriate accusations concerning a candidate’s qualification should be respected. But he added that his actions should have been more prudent, and offered an apology to Koh. The prosecution, on the other hand, vowed to appeal the case, saying it could not comprehend how the court came to such a decision.Cho had been accused by local prosecutors of spreading false rumors about Koh’s children having U.S. green cards to derail his campaign during their race for the capital’s top educator post. In April, a lower court ruling had fined Cho 5 million won ($4,189) for violating the election law, which would have stripped Cho of his post if upheld. Cho’s legal representatives had claimed that his accusation did not play a crucial part in the election, and that Koh’s own family feud was what made him lose.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","friday suspended the sentence ,of seoul education superintendent ,court on friday suspended ,seoul education superintendent ,seoul education superintendent cho","['Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon', 'Seoul High Court', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Cho Hi - yeon']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01640351  0.28991294

He had constantly denied his charges but later admitted the allegations after investigators analyzed the surveillance camera footage. In November, prosecutors suspended the indictment based on the jury’s decision on the condition that he would receive psychiatric assessment. Investigators found that he had “sexual predilection disorder” that made him release his anger or stress in an inappropriate manner, adding that he needs several months of treatment.Kim previously applied for registration to the SBA in February this year but withdrew it later as the association requested him to submit the medical treatment records.

Under SOFA, which governs the legal status of some 28,500 U.S. troops stationed across the southern part of the peninsula, South Korea can primarily invoke judicial power when a serviceman is implicated in crimes, except while on duty. But authorities here have frequently not exercised it, opting to hand over the cases to the U.S. The Lawyers for a Democratic Society, better known as Minbyun, raised a suit calling for the Justice Ministry to release all the cases since 2001 that the U.S. requested South Korea to transfer, as well as their results. The ministry has kept the data undisclosed, citing diplomatic relations. A lower administrative court decided in December that a revelation of the information is unlikely to infringe on critical national interests because it concerns “operation and management of an existing system” and many records and statistics are already available. Overturning the verdict, the Seoul High Court said there is a “considerable” possibility that the exposure of all demanded data will affect the relationship with Washington and harm national interests. Yet it allowed the release of information on a 2012 case in which seven U.S. military police officers arrested in handcuffs three South Korean civilians near their base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, citing that the prosecution had already made most of it public. “With SOFA being an accord that the two countries forged taking into account the distinctiveness of U.S. troops here, as well as diplomatic ties, in the face of the inter-Korean confrontation, the requested information has its implications, even though it may merely mean statistics,” judge Hwang Byung-ha said. “There are also concerns that North Korea or its sympathetic parties could take advantage of the information.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","appeals court ruled tuesday ,court ruled tuesday that ,court ruled tuesday ,tuesday that the government ,28 500 troops stationed","['U.S.', 'South Korea', 'SOFA', 'U.S.', 'South Korea']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27817002  0.51071078

Prosecutors said Monday they are looking at the schedule to call in the 67-year-old chairman for questioning. (Yonhap)The summon comes six months after the prosecution launched its probe into POSCO’s alleged corruption cases including suspicious mergers and acquisitions, tax evasion and setting up slush funds. Chung is suspected of masterminding dubious M&A; deals during his term as chairman between 2009 and 2014, which allegedly caused great financial loss to POSCO. The most controversial case involves Sungin Geotec, from which POSCO purchased shares in 2010 well over market value. Chung will also be questioned whether he played a role in giving Dongyang Construction overseas projects initiated by POSCO during his term. The prosecution suspects the subcontractor of having created slush funds for the steelmaker and its affiliates in return for the deals. Chung also allegedly exerted undue influence in getting his relative a job as a high-level official at Kosteel, a partner company of POSCO. Kosteel has been suspected of helping POSCO evade taxes by doctoring transaction records and creating slush funds. If the allegations are proven to be true, he could face breach-of-duty charges. An official from the prosecution said that Chung could be summoned for one more grilling session given the amount of evidence and testimonies to look into. The probe has dragged on as the court rejected prosecutors’ multiple requests for arrest warrants for former POSCO vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa and Bae Sung-ro, ex-chairman of Dongyang Constructions. The probe into POSCO came in line with the prosecution’s widening investigation into the former Lee Myung-bak administration’s “energy diplomacy,” which encouraged Korean companies to take part in overseas projects to secure energy resources. But the resource drive has faced criticism for allegedly wasting taxpayers’ money, with some funds thought to be lost in corruption.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","affiliates prosecutors said monday ,months after the prosecution ,summon former posco chairman ,prosecutors said monday ,old chairman for questioning","['POSCO', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36794087  0.47293574

Then, the group convinced the victims to transfer money to the account, saying it was necessary for the process.The group was found to have delegated different roles based on teams, such as a team in charge of obtaining the cash cards and a team focused on withdrawing money.""Considering the committed crimes were done systematically with hierarchical order within the group, the crime syndicate charge can be applied,"" Judge Yeom Kyung-ho said.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office indicted the 29-year-old suspect, whose identification was withheld, on charges of allegedly providing fake immigration documents to 12 job-seeking Egyptians and supporting them to enter fraudulently as refugees. He and his Korean accomplice were found to have received up to $10,000 per person in return, they added. Of the 12 illegal entrants, nine applied for the refugee status by falsely stating they were fleeing their country to avoid persecution. The other three disappeared immediately after arriving here, investigators said. This marks the first case in which a refugee broker was caught here.Under the Korean refugee law, refugee status can be granted to foreigners who are likely be persecuted on account of nationality, race, religion, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. After joining the U.N. Refugee Convention in 1992, South Korea became the first Asian country to enact an independent refugee law in July 2013.Since the refugee law went into effect, the number of refugee status requests per year has tripled to about 3,000. By July, the year’s number had already exceeded 2,600, they added.The Korea Immigration Office suspects that over 80 percent of the refugee status-seekers are fake, the authorities said.“The number of Egyptian refugee status applications is on the rise, with the majority seeking jobs here. Many cases are found to be those abusing the refugee law that does not force deportation against their will,” immigration office officials said. Foreigners under fears of persecution are allowed to apply for refugee status at an airport or seaport upon arrival. They are also allowed to work here if the refugee screening takes over six months. Various benefits are also provided, ranging from education and job training to medical services. As the government has tightened the refugee screening, the acceptance rate plummeted from 20 percent to around 4 percent in recent years. This year, only 51 foreigners or 1.9 percent were accepted as refugees, officials said.

Seoul Central District Court ruled the 45-year-old was innocent based on a unanimous jury decision. Under the law, the jury’s decision is not legally binding but the court is required to respect it. Jeon was suspected of attempting to rape her lover after he ended the relationship by drugging him and tying up his legs and arms last year. She was the first woman to be charged with attempted rape after the criminal law was expanded to apply not only male offenders but also female attackers in June 2013. She was also accused of hitting him with a hammer when he woke up. While Jeon, who reportedly suffers from a mild intellectual disability, admitted that she had given the defendant a sleeping pill, tied him up and hit him with a hammer, she claimed that she did not attempt to rape him. She added that hitting him with the hammer was an act of self-defense, claiming that he had habitually abused her.The nine jury members made a unanimous decision in Jeon’s favor, saying that her accuser’s testimony was not credible enough. Her accuser, for instance, gave detailed testimonies of the situation despite claiming to have been drugged. The court also took into account that it would be difficult for Jeon, weighing 44 kilograms, to have lifted the drugged defendant upright as he had claimed.Prosecutors will decide soon whether to appeal, the authorities said.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","attempted rape woman charged ,acquitted of attempted rape ,rape woman charged ,rape her lover after ,rape woman charged with","['Korea', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'Jeon']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40786937 -0.11779589

Han Myeong-sook of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy for bribery, effectively concluding a five-year-long legal battle between the nation’s first female prime minister and the prosecution.The 71-year-old Han, who served as the nation’s second-in-command from 2006 to 2007, was indicted in 2010 for allegedly receiving some 900 million won ($760,000) in illicit political funds from a 53-year-old man who ran a local construction company.Han Myeong-sook (Yonhap)She was cleared of the charges in a preliminary trial in 2011 after the witness reversed his testimony about giving the kickback, which was the key evidence behind Han’s indictment. But the Seoul High Court in 2013 overturned the decision and sentenced her to two years imprisonment in addition to paying 880 million won in restitution, saying despite the apparent flip-flop testimony, circumstantial evidence points to Han being guilty. Han appealed the verdict.In its ruling, the Supreme Court said it was reasonable to believe that Han had received the money, given that her sister had used part of the funds -- a 100 million won check -- to lease an apartment. The ruling will strip Han of her seat in the National Assembly, as well as bar her from running for a parliamentary seat for the next 10 years. She will also become the first South Korean former premier to be put behind bars. “I will comply with the ruling, but regrettably cannot accept it. The law, which should be fair, is being swayed by those in power,” Han said in a news conference at the National Assembly. Han and other members of the opposition have accused President Park Geun-hye’s administration of gunning down her political rivals, particularly those who had been in the inner circles of former President Roh Moo-hyun.“I hope the political retribution that started with President Roh will end with Han Myeong-sook,” she said. NPAD leader Moon Jae-in expressed his regret about the ruling and added the party is certain that Han is innocent. “There is no one who gave the money, or received the money, yet the court concluded (she was) guilty. This is very far from the justice and common sense widely accepted by the people,” he said at the news conference.He said most of the ruling party politicians accused of receiving bribes from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong were cleared of charges, saying that both the prosecution and the court is being pressured by those in power. Moon also vowed that his party would go all-out to reform the legal system to make it free from outside influence. Current law stipulates that justices of the Supreme Court are pointed by the president with parliamentary consent. Han’s downfall is likely to be a major setback to the already-wavering NPAD. Including her, 10 of its incumbent lawmakers are being probed, indicted, or under trial. Earlier this month, former NPAD floor leader Park Ki-choon was arrested for allegedly receiving illegal political funds. Kim Han-gil, former chairman of the party, is also set to be summoned by the prosecution for his supposed connection to a corruption case.Reiterating that the administration was using the legal system to bring down Park’s political rivals, Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the floor leader for the NPAD, said that the recent corruption probe is “a suppression of the opposition” by the government, vowing that his party would fight on.The ruling Saenuri Party, however, said that the prosecution and the court are acting solely based on law and principle, and that the opposition’s claims of an oppression are merely excuses for its wrongdoing. Han, formerly a prominent women’s rights activist, was named the country’s premier by former President Roh Moo-hyun in 2006. She also served as the leader of the Democratic United Party, a forerunner of the NPAD, in 2012.

She added that she would seek to annul the city’s plan to use the revenue for a project encompassing areas outside Gangnam-gu without “due process of gathering opinions of the autonomous district.”In June, Hyundai Motor Group offered the city 1.7 trillion won ($1.1 billion) as a public contribution fee after it bought the 79,345-square-meter site in Gangnam-gu from Korea Electronic Power Corp. for 10.55 trillion won. The stakeholder must pay the public contribution fee to change the legal use of the land. Hyundai has requested the city to change the purpose of the land use from “general residential” to “commercial.”Hyundai has proposed to build a 115-story headquarters and a 62-story hotel and convention, in line with Seoul City’s pledge to turn the neighborhood into a MICE zone, referring to meetings, incentive tours, conventions and exhibitions.To further develop the project, the city has said it would expand the plan by developing the adjacent Jamsil Sports Complex area in Songpa-gu. Gangnam-gu Office has opposed it, claiming that the use of contribution fee should be prioritized on Gangnam-gu, as the land comes from the district.The city argues that the MICE project included both districts from the start regardless of the Hyundai’s contribution fee, and that the plan is not finalized.Seoul City also stressed that the amount of the public contribution fee had not been settled as the talks underway with Hyundai are to be concluded by year-end.

The Daegu High Court found the 49-year-old not guilty of robbery and rape charges, citing lack of evidence, in the case investigated 13 years after the crime was committed. “The testimonies made by eyewitnesses have many contradictory points, making them not valuable as evidence,” the court said.  The Sri Lankan man charged with robbing and raping an 18-year-old South Korean girl enters the Daegu High Court on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The court did not rule out the possibility that the Sri Lankan raped her alone or with accomplices, given that the man’s sperm was found on the underwear of the victim, named Chung Eun-hye. But even if the Sri Lankan committed the crime, he cannot be punished due to the expiration of the 10-year statute of limitations, the court added. The Sri Lankan was suspected of taking Chung, who was intoxicated and on her way home from university, to an expressway overpass in Daegu to rape and rob her there with two others in October 1998.The two suspected Sri Lankan accomplices to the crime returned to their country in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Chung died after being hit by a 25-ton truck. At the time, the police had obtained her underwear some 30 meters away from the scene, but concluded the case as only a death by car accident. The police reopened the probe in 2011 after it found that the Sri Lankan’s DNA matched the semen found on Chung’s underwear. The DNA result came after the Sri Lankan was arrested in a separate prostitution-related case. The prosecution set up a task force and focused on proving his guilt, securing testimony on how the Sri Lankan first met Chung and what happened right before the victim died in a car crash.The lower court acquitted him of the charges, citing insufficient evidence. The prosecution had sought life imprisonment. The victim’s family, meanwhile, expressed outrage over the verdict and the direction of the probe that ruled out the possibility of a third suspect.The family has claimed the prosecution had unreasonably pushed for the investigation to “justify” its accusations against the Sri Lankan despite uncertainty over who committed the crime. “We don’t even have the energy anymore to protest the way the investigation was conducted,” a family member told local news media.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","rape case south korean ,robbery and rape charges ,rape charges citing lack ,korean appeals court tuesday ,lankan in rape case","['south korean', 'Sri Lankan', 'korean', 'Daegu High Court']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00590991  0.3548156

The events include an art exhibition, a chorus performance, a peace-themed concert and a program in which overseas Koreans can learn about unification issues.“We will not be able to hold any joint events on Liberation Day itself as the North has been passive in making progress in the discussions to arrange the events, even as we’ve tried hard to forge conditions to enhance bilateral relations,” a senior official at Seoul’s Unification Ministry told reporters on condition of anonymity.Late last month, the North rejected the South’s call for dialogue to discuss the holding of the joint Aug. 15 events, while unilaterally demanding that South Korean civic groups join Pyongyang’s separate events.South Korean civic groups have been pushing to hold with North Korean partners a soccer match, a youth walkathon, joint prayer services, joint heritage exhibitions and academic forums on Korean liberation movements. But these events have been shelved with the North refusing to further discuss them.The North has also continued to spurn Seoul’s overtures for talks including the latest one last Wednesday, while demanding that Seoul scrap its plan to hold the forthcoming joint military drills with the U.S. and remove the so-called May 24 economic sanctions, which were put in place after the North killed 46 South Korean sailors in a torpedo attack in March 2010.Analysts said that after all, both sides were to blame for the failure to arrange joint events given that both lacked political will to push for the events.“Stuck in a war of nerves, both lacked the true will to push ahead with those events, particularly when there has been a deep distrust between them,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told The Korea Herald.“Unless the highest political leaders in both nations take special steps, it would be difficult to restore cross-border relations.”Despite the Seoul government’s “trustpolitik” approach toward Pyongyang, inter-Korean distrust has been deepening with peninsular security uncertainties growing. The Park Geun-hye government has continued to focus on applying pressure on the communist regime to renounce its nuclear ambitions and stop provocations, while its efforts for cross-border dialogue have been dismissed by the North as insincere.North Korea leader Kim Jong-un’s seemingly clumsy, unpredictable diplomacy has exacerbated inter-Korean tensions. His diplomatic ineptitude was highlighted as Pyongyang rejected the request by Lee Hee-ho, the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, to meet with him during her visit to Pyongyang last week, and abruptly canceled U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s planned visit to the North in May.

The 55-year-old has been indicted without physical detention.The three were in charge of evaluating the quality of three 1,800-ton submarines before the vessels were handed over to the Navy in 2009.They are accused of asking a Hyundai executive for employment twice in return for the smooth takeover of the submarines by the Navy. (Yonhap)","bribery charges three military ,officers indicted on bribery ,indicted on bribery charges ,on bribery charges three ,bribery charges three","['Navy', 'Lim', 'Air Force', 'Sung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07246108  0.31139305

(Yonhap)The South Korean government said Friday that teachers who knowingly conceal sexual violence in schools can face expulsion from their posts, in response to a recent sexual harassment case at a Seoul high school involving five teachers and over 100 victims.In an unscheduled meeting presided over by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the officials agreed to revise the law on education civil servants ― referring to teachers at primary and secondary education ― to beef up the punishment against sexual abuse. The revision will also include immediately removing a teacher accused of sexual abuse from his or her post, and mandating the school committee reach a decision on the punishment within 30 days, shortened from the current regulation of 60 days.Under current law, the school officials can remove a suspected sex offender from the teaching post only after he or she has been indicted by the authorities. The law was revised earlier in the year ― to become effective November ― to remove the supposed offender after a police investigation had commenced. But the nationwide furor that has sparked in light of the recent scandal pushed the government to further revise the law.“The reoccurring sex crimes at schools raised concerns among the public, especially parents, and we need to look into countermeasures that are thought to be too lenient,” said Hwang at the meeting. The government also will disqualify those convicted of sexual crime from applying to become public officials, teachers or soldiers. They can also be fired immediately upon being fined for sex crimes. The current law stipulates one has to receive a prison term to be fired.Officials said they are pushing for a particularly strict punishment against teachers, including ex post facto punishment. For example, if a certified teacher ― who received his or her license after the law revision is passed ― has been found to have committed sex crime in the past, he or she will have his or her license revoked.Sex offenders will also be banned from returning to a teaching post. Seoul police and education office are currently conducting an investigation into claims that five teachers at a Seoul-based high school were involved in multiple sexual crimes on female teachers and students at their school for over a year. Over two dozen teachers and students were reported to have been molested, while over 100 students were said to have been harassed. The school’s principal is among the five being probed by the officials, although he has repeatedly denied charges and claimed this is a set-up by those opposing him within the school.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","on school sex violence ,korean government said friday ,harassment case at seoul ,toughens on school sex ,recent sexual harassment case","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Sejong Government Complex', 'south korean', 'Seoul']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26922196  0.30477533

Sim Hag-bong in a statement. “I will faithfully cooperate with the police investigation to resolve all suspicions,” he said.The remark came a day after he denied an allegation that he raped a woman in her 40s at a hotel in Daegu last month. The woman, whose name was withheld, claimed that the lawmaker took her clothes off against her will and sexually assaulted her. She was nearly threatened to come to the hotel, where the lawmaker had already checked in, through constant phone calls he made, and told the police. The police were looking into the case, securing phone records between the two and the footage of surveillance cameras showing the two entering the hotel on June 13.The woman, however, has stoked the flames of controversy as she suddenly changed her statement. She said was not forced to have sex, and she doesn’t want him to be prosecuted. Shim, 54, is a first-term lawmaker representing Gumi-A Constituency in North Gyeongsang Province.Investigators said they would summon Rep. Sim as a suspect and question him as to whether he had attempted to threaten or cajole her into having sex.The case is the latest in a series of sexual scandals involving the ruling party lawmakers.In 2006, Choi Yeon-hee, former lawmaker of Grand National Party, the predecessor of the ruling Saenuri, stepped down from his post as party secretary-general after he was accused of sexually harassing a female reporter. Another former GNP lawmaker Kang Yong-seok also defected from the party for his raw sexual remarks of TV announcers. Earlier this year, former National Assembly Speaker Park Hee-tae was sentenced to a six-month jail term suspended for one year for sexually harassing a female caddie during a round of golf last year. “The Park Geun-hye government, (headed by) the first female president in the constitutional history, has been pushing to eradicate four major evils including sexual and domestic violence,” said main opposition lawmaker Rep. Yoo Seung-hee, reciting the list of former and incumbent Saenuri lawmakers who were implicated for sexual harassments. “It is pathetic to watch the governing party failing to keep its internal figures under discipline.”The Saenuri Party also vowed to sternly punish Rep. Sim and urged lawmakers not to defend him.“The Saenuri Party will take clear action to the lawmaker involved in the case. There’s no reason to defend him,” said Rep.

The practice, carried out in the 2005-2013 period, has been cited for directly impacting profits of existing special agent stores. The antitrust watchdog said such actions constituted an abuse of superior position enjoyed by AmorePacific vis-a-vis its special agent. The FTC ordered administrative corrections, slapped a 500 million won ($428,000) fine and referred the company and a key executive to the state prosecutors' office.Special agent stores, which only sell AmorePacific products under contract, account for some 20 percent of the cosmetic company's domestic sales and use its sales personnel to sell high end products such as Sulwhasoo.Sources said the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is looking into possible wrongdoing by AmorePacific and one of its former directing managers, who has only been identified by his surname Lee.The FTC claimed that Lee was directly involved in the reallocation of sale personnel and even called for the replacement of special agent stores that were underperforming.""We are carefully looking into all allegations made and records provided by the FTC,"" said an insider at the prosecutors' office.He said that Lee will be summoned for questioning in due course.The FTC said taking firm stance against unfair trade practices will send a clear signal to the business community that the government will clamp down on big companies that abuse their power to hurt its agents and dealers.

Kwon Eun-hee of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy was a police officer on a team that in 2013 investigated the National Intelligence Service's alleged online smear campaign to sway public opinion in favor of then ruling party candidate Park Geun-hye in the 2012 presidential election.In April 2013, Kwon claimed she had been barred by her superiors, including Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, from pursuing the case as far as she believed was appropriate, a comment that sent ripples through political circles and the state intelligence agency.The Supreme Court, however, acquitted Kim of charges of abusing his authority to influence the police investigation earlier this year, citing a lack of evidence and lack of credibility in Kwon's testimony.Some conservative organizations including Young's Liberty Union filed a lawsuit against Kwon in January 2014 for allegedly giving false testimony.""There is no change in the fact that there was suppression to hinder further investigation,"" Kwon told reporters before entering the prosecutors' office in southern Seoul. ""I am preparing all possible measures to reveal the objective truths including the relation between Kim and the NIS.""Prosecutors of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office said they are investigating whether Kwon gave false testimony on purpose to harm the former chief of the SMPA.

(Yonhap)According to the prosecution, Yeom offered to arrange for special care of Cho during her stay in jail after the lowest court sentenced her to one year in prison in February in the so-called “nut rage” case. The prosecution is probing whether Yeom bribed officials in prison, in return for treating Cho favorably. It is also looking into whether she really enjoyed special privileges while in prison. Cho, who was in charge of in-flight services of the nation's biggest airlines, served a jail term until May for violating plane safety after she ordered the taxiing flight bound for Incheon, with more than 200 passengers on board, back to the gate at John F. Kennedy Airport last December, taking issue with what she viewed as “poor cabin service.” Unsatisfied with the way a first-class flight attendant served macadamia nuts, Cho assaulted the plane’s chief steward, made him kneel and struck his hand with a folder.An appeals court freed her in May, handing down a reduced sentence of 10 months, suspended for two years. In relation to the brokerage case, investigators raided Yeom’s residence and the office of a high-ranking Hanjin Group official surnamed Seo, who allegedly introduced Yeom to Cho. Seo and Yeom have allegedly been in a close relationship since they first met in the aftermath of the Korean Air crash in Guam in 1997 that killed 228 people on board. Yeom was a representative for victims’ families back then.The now infamous “nut rage” case continues to persist despite Cho’s release, with the chief steward and the first-class flight attendant having filed separate lawsuits in the U.S. to seek financial compensation.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors on wednesday detained ,treatment in jail prosecutors ,jail prosecutors on wednesday ,southern prosecutors office detained ,prosecutors on wednesday","['Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'the Seoul Southern Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Yeom', 'Hanjin', 'Cho', 'Heather Ch']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23200029  0.29257926

The Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling last Thursday that results-based financial incentives for lawyers in criminal cases are illegal, invalidating contingency fee arrangements in the nation and going into effect immediately.“It goes against morality and social order to connect contingency fees for criminal cases with the results of an investigation or trial for a financial compensation,” the bench said. Judges deliver a ruling outlawing contingency fees for lawyers in criminal cases at the Supreme Court in southern Seoul on July 23. (Yonhap)The decision came amid efforts to stamp out shady practices in which former judges and prosecutor-turned-lawyers are said to make underhand deals with sitting judicial officers to draw favorable results for their clients. Since South Korea established its judiciary system in 1948, it has been the norm for clients to pay lawyers “success fees” based on the results, a practice lawyers’ organizations viewed as motivating the lawyers to do their best until the close of a case.The contingency fees for former judges and prosecutors have been especially high, propped by those facing a criminal investigation or trial in a desperate move to sway the ruling in their favor. But such a practice has been subject to criticism for what some see as encouraging former judges and prosecutors to meddle in the legal process, increasing the possibility of corruption.The nation’s highest court also said in its ruling that such practices undermined the rule of law and deepened Koreans’ distrust in the nation’s judiciary system.“We cannot deny that contingency fee contracts have created misunderstanding and distrust for Korea’s criminal justice system in a climate where many people still believe that money can solve everything,” the court said.The Supreme Court still allowed contingency fee contracts for civil cases, saying it does not violate the legal principles of private autonomy and liberty of contract. The court also stressed the public role of lawyers, saying their mission is to advocate social justice and human rights to uphold the rule of law in society. The ruling, however, enraged lawyers who argue that the court is falsely accusing even “innocent” lawyers of receiving “excessive” contingency fees. “The public distrust in the legal system is created by only a handful of ex-judges and prosecutors who are overpaid for their services,” the Korean Bar Association said in a statement.“The ruling will not only deal a blow to most of the lawyers having difficulties in finding work without the success fee system, but also to clients who will end up paying more overall, such as before a trial or when an investigation begins,” it added. On Monday, the organization asked the Constitutional Court to review the ruling, though the Korean law stipulates that it cannot reconsider rulings made by lower courts. “For the public good, the Constitutional Court should be able to revisit the controversial rulings,” Kim Hyo-eun, a spokesperson for Korean Bar Association, told The Korea Herald. “The ban on contingency fees has unconstitutional aspects that infringe on people’s rights.”The Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court have been at loggerheads over the scope of their judiciary discretion recently. The Supreme Court supports current regulations, saying the Constitutional Court cannot make decisions on the lower court’s legal interpretations. The Constitutional Court, however, has submitted a request for law revision to the National Assembly.Kim said that given such a situation, the association’s request for a review may not be taken up for the time being.Kim Bum-hoon, a lawyer who specializes in criminal cases, lamented that the Supreme Court made the ruling without knowing “the reality” in the legal industry at all. “Our clients demand the success fee system as they can pay us depending on the result they achieve from trials,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “It is reasonable for them, too.” “To be honest, I am not sure whether I can put as much effort now without financial incentives,” he said. “I am also a human being, you know?”With the ban on contingency fees in effect, change seems inevitable in the remuneration of lawyers as monetary incentives have been a major source of their income. “Lawyers will likely charge clients more for initial fees before a trial begins and receive money based on the amount of time they put in for the case,” Kim said, adding that he has already started charging his clients higher initial fees since the ruling was made. But The Good Law, a civic organization campaigning for Koreans’ legal rights, welcomed the ruling. “The decision came too late, but we believe that it will help promote the judicial order in the long term,” Hong Kum-ae, an official from the civic group, told The Korea Herald.“Some ex-judges and prosecutors make a few phone calls in the office without doing much and charge clients a huge amount of money as contingency fees,” Hong said.“It is obviously against the rule of law if one’s release from the prison can be determined by a lawyer’s influence,” Hong said. “To protect clients’ rights and uphold the rule of law, sentencing guidelines should be clear and predictable.” Still, the ruling is unlikely to root out the prevalent practice of former judges and prosecutors using personal connections to influence the probes and trials, lawyer Kim pointed out.“Behind Koreans seeking judges- and prosecutor-turned-lawyers is the expectation that ex-judicial officers can wield influence on serving judges and prosecutors for their interest,” Kim said. “Under the current legal system, people will continue to have such expectations and find other ways to get a favorable result.” Lee Heon-uk, a Seoul-based lawyer and member of the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy organization, agreed that the ban on contingency fees can hardly restore the public trust in the nation’s judicial system, let alone change the practice of preferring former judges and prosecutors. “The public distrust in the judiciary arises from the nation’s legal structure that gives excessive power to judges and prosecutors,” Lee told The Korea Herald. Under the current legal structure, judges and prosecutors who previously held high positions in the court and prosecution’s office often open a law practice after retirement. They are then often assigned to criminal cases in which they can exert influence.“Unless Korea puts in place rules that outlaw ex-judges and prosecutors from practicing law, it will never be able to overcome the public distrust in the judiciary system,” Lee said, calling for changes to the current judiciary structure. But Lee hailed the court ruling as a “stepping-stone” for broader reforms in the legal industry. “Despite drawbacks, it is meaningful that the Supreme Court attempted to put an end to the lawyers’ excessive profit-making practice and underlined their public role in society,” he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","court last week banned ,court ruling last thursday ,lawyer success fees rattles ,catalyst in eradicating corruption ,lawyers community fiercely protested","['South Korea ’s', 'the Supreme Court']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48200589  0.1702254

She reportedly said she had to endure the pain with ice packages and Tylenol until the plane touched down at its destination. Jang accused the airline of failing to provide appropriate medical help and causing physical and psychological stress.“I had been planning to continue my career in broadcasting, fashion and hair design, using my physical beauty as my strength, but that’s become impossible because of the hideous burns,” Jang said. “I can’t continue work at the bakery either because I have developed an extreme fear of working near 800-degree hot ovens.”Asiana has reportedly offered compensation of some 61 million won to cover Jang’s medical expenses.“(Upon the accident) the crew took appropriate measures such as disinfecting the wounds with the help of a doctor on board.

The KPIC is believed to have collected some 4.3 billion records from January 2011 to November 2014. Also indicted was the head of a company that supplies a program that organizes information of patients’ medical treatment for insurance purposes. The company allegedly supplied the program to 7,500 hospitals across the country and illegally acquired 720 million records of treatments and prescriptions from March 2008 to December 2014.Each of the two organizations are suspected of selling their data to a U.S.-based statistics company for 1.6 billion won ($1.37 million) and 330 million won, respectively. The U.S. company is believed to have statistically analyzed the information to figure out which medications are most frequently used. It then allegedly sold them to Korean pharmaceutical companies and made 7 billion won in profit.Investigators also found that SK Telecom, the nation’s top mobile carrier, illegally collected 7,802 prescription records from 23,060 hospitals by using its electronic prescription services. The company allegedly planted a module in the prescription program that sent the records to a separate server it ran, which were sold to local pharmacies for about 3.6 billion won.

But those who made the poster should compensate the woman, according to another ruling.  (Yonhap)The Seoul Central District Court rejected the 30-something woman’s appeal for financial compensation from five media outlets that published the poster containing the photo featuring her playing in the mud along with others, officials said. “Though the news outlets helped the photo go viral, it cannot be seen that the media used her photo for profit,” the court said.The decision came after the Supreme Court ordered the organizer of Boryeong Mud Festival and a photographer to pay 3 million won ($2,600) as compensation for violating her portrait rights, upholding the lower court’s ruling. In 2013, the woman filed a suit seeking 20 million won in compensation, saying the photo showing her sitting on someone’s shoulders with mud on her body could create an impression that she is “badly behaved.”The woman, who had participated in the festival three times, reportedly learned that the poster was being widely used, including on a subway, through her friends. The festival organizer, which released the poster to 140 media outlets and uploaded it on the website, made an appeal, explaining that it had used the photo to “promote the event for public good.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","woman appeal for financial ,woman for publishing poster ,an earlier ruling tuesday ,court rejected the 30 ,compensate woman for publishing",[],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31326395  0.08315033

Ahn Cheol-soo on Tuesday said he would request extensive information on the hacking software that had sparked public debate as to whether the nation’s intelligence agency used it to spy on its own people.The former CEO of an antivirus software company said in a press conference that he would formally ask the National Intelligence Service to submit some 30 documents, including all log files of the Remote Control System, software that has the capability to tap into mobile phones.“All information will remain in log files, including whether the computer in question hacked the target device and what was hacked,” Ahn said. He added that by analyzing the log files they would be able to find out the owner of the target device, which would shed light on whether any civilians were hacked or not.Ahn’s plans came amid an intensifying scuffle between the rival parties over the scandal.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy repeated its calls for a parliamentary hearing into the NIS, while the ruling Saenuri Party dismissed the call as a politically-motivated attempt.“Lawmakers have a duty to get to the bottom of the wiretapping allegation,” said NAPD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “The NIS must come out and accept a parliamentary hearing if they think they have never been involved with spying on civilians,” said Lee.  NPAD Rep. Lee Jong-kul (left) and NPAD Rep. Shin Kyoung-min. (Yonhap)But the ruling Saenuri party refused, urging the NAPD to stop inflating allegations, dismissing them as groundless. The ruling party asserted than the NIS had already given a plausible explanation on the wiretapping charges. Last week, NIS issued a rare public statement and denied the allegation that the agency had bugged civilians. In the statement, the agency said it never conducted surveillance operations against civilians and groundless allegations would compromise national security. “The NIS came forward and gave us a full explanation. As I understand, the NPAD should appreciate and acknowledge the agency’s attempt to explain itself. I think it is truly courageous,” said Rep. Cho Won-jin of the Saenuri Party. The wiretapping allegations surfaced when emails between suspected NIS agents and Italian software firm Hacking Team were leaked by unidentified hackers earlier this month. The email showed that the NIS had purchased hacking software with wiretapping capabilities. The NIS asserted that the software was never used for the surveillance of South Korean citizens, though it admitted it bought it in 2012. The agency pointed out that it used the program to enhance cyber warfare capabilities against North Korea.The explanation, however, was met with public skepticism due to the spy agency’s alleged meddling in the 2012 presidential elections. The NIS was accused of conducting a smear campaign against opposition candidate Moon Jae-in. The NPAD claimed that the NIS helped Moon’s rival, now-President Park Geun-hye, win the election. The public distrust only worsened after last week’s apparent suicide of an NIS agent suspected to have been involved in the agency’s deals with Hacking Team. He left a suicide note that said the NIS had not wiretapped ordinary citizens.(jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)","ceo of an antivirus ,the hacking software ,an antivirus software company ,nis hacking software the ,hacking software the main","['Ahn Cheol', 'the National Intelligence Service']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60444289  0.3417851

181,181,181,[Herald Interview] Only the beginning for Korea’s migrant workers’ labor movement,"When South Korea’s highest court recently made a ruling that migrants working in Korea illegally could establish a labor union, Udaya Rai, a head of the nation’s first migrants’ labor union, broke into a wide smile. 　The historic ruling came on June 25, more than 10 years after the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union launched a battle against the Korean government to win legal status.　“I was so deligh...","When South Korea’s highest court recently made a ruling that migrants working in Korea illegally could establish a labor union, Udaya Rai, a head of the nation’s first migrants’ labor union, broke into a wide smile. The historic ruling came on June 25, more than 10 years after the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union launched a battle against the Korean government to win legal status.“I was so delighted when I heard that the court finally legalized our union,” said Rai, head of the MTU, during an interview with The Korea Herald in his office in Seoul last week. “The victory is solely a result of the MTU’s years-long fight against the government to earn equal rights for migrant laborers here,” the 44-year-old Nepali said in fluent Korean.  The Supreme Court invalidated the Ministry of Employment and Labor’s ban on the union’s establishment, saying that people are entitled to basic workers’ rights to join and set up a trade union regardless of their immigration status. Udaya Rai, president of the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union, speaks in an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. (Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald)But the achievement didn’t come easy. In 2005, 91 foreign workers who led a sit-in protest in central Seoul from 2003 to 2004 to call for a stop to deportation of people working here illegally, founded the MTU and requested a permit from the government for its establishment.  But the Ministry of Employment and Labor rejected its application, taking issue with the majority of the union members being “illegal” workers.  “How can human beings be illegal?” Rai asked. “We were just unregistered, not illegal, and demanded our fair share of rights.”The MTU filed a lawsuit the same year. The lowest court ruled in favor of the ministry, saying that migrant workers illegally staying in the nation are not entitled to legal protection. But the appeals court overturned the decision in 2007, recognizing their rights as workers stipulated in the Constitution. The ministry appealed, but the case was stalled in the Supreme Court for nearly eight years. During that period, six MTU officials, including two presidents, were deported for their involvement in the labor movement. Last year, Rai officially became president of the MTU, which has some 1,100 members, replacing Michel Caturia, who left Korea for the Philippines in 2012. Now, the MTU has become the voice for some 553,000 migrant workers legally on the EPS visa and 208,778 people who are in the country illegally, mostly from Southeast and Central Asia. “When I started to work in Korea, it was common for foreign workers to suffer overdue payment, punishing working hours, beatings and discrimination,” he said. “It was wrong and I wanted to fight for their rights.” Rai, who used to farm in Nepal, made his way to Korea in 2003 under the Industrial Trainee System in search of a better life for him and his family. But the reality turned out not to be as expected. The Nepalese activist started to work as a trainee at a small manufacturing factory just outside Seoul in 2004, working 11 hours a day, except Sundays. After his Korean colleagues left work, Rai and other migrant laborers were forced to stay longer to clean up, only to receive 500,000 won ($430) four months later.“When I questioned my boss about such unfair treatment, he beat me and verbally abused me,” Rai said. He said that he had to flee several times from workplaces to escape inhumane working conditions. Korea started to receive migrant workers under the Industrial Trainee System in 1993 amid a shortage of low-skilled workers for the so-called “3-D” jobs -- dirty, difficult and dangerous labor -- typically in sectors such as construction, manufacturing and agriculture.But as the workers coming in through the system were managed as “trainees” and not as “workers,” the system was widely criticized both in Korea and overseas for human rights abuses, such as forced labor and confinement, the creation of a black market among agencies and poor working conditions. “As I was a trainee, not a laborer, I was not entitled to any rights to change jobs, join a union or receive compensation for industrial accidents from the government,” Rai said, calling it a “modern form of slavery.”Amid mounting criticism over the system, the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration introduced a new migrant worker scheme called the Employment Permit System, to reduce the number of foreign laborers who stayed in Korea illegally. Under the EPS, unskilled workers from 15 nations, mostly from Southeast and Central Asian countries, are allowed to enter Korea to work for up to three years if employers cannot find South Korean nationals to fill positions in manual labor. “At least, migrant workers are recognized as laborers in accordance with Korea’s labor law under the new system,” Rai said, referring to workers’ basic rights to strike, organize and collectively bargain.  “But the EPS is still business-friendly, not laborer-friendly, with employers monopolizing all the rights to hire and fire migrant workers.” For starters, the EPS laborers come here without knowing what their job is and who they will work for. Instead, only employers are given a list of job seekers from which they can choose. While EPS employers have the right to dismiss migrants without justification, those employed under the scheme have no right to quit or change jobs without a release form signed by their employers. Foreign workers who quit without permission are labeled “runaways,” facing arrest or deportation. “The employers have no legal duty to sign a release form for workers to change a job or renew their contracts to let them stay longer here,” Rai said, pinpointing the rules in the system that can lead to creating an “abusive” environment.  The EPS laborers, tied to their initial employers for three years, must leave Korea unless they extend their contracts. With little opportunity to make money at home, the migrant workers on the visa are coerced into putting up with exploitive conditions not to be fired, Rai noted.  The Korean government allows the workers to change jobs without approval from employers and receive overdue payment if they report the case to the Labor Ministry. But lack of fluency in Korean, complicated legal processes and fear of losing their jobs make it difficult for them to come forward. While the United Nation’s International Labor Organization hailed Korea’s worker scheme as “a better conceived, funded and implemented foreigner worker program than most in Asia,” Amnesty International slammed the program for making migrant workers vulnerable to “abuse” and “exploitation” in its 2009 report.Another complaint from migrant workers is a revised law, enacted last year, which requires employers to pay them the severance money after they leave Korea. The move is designed to deter migrant workers from overstaying their visas, according to the authorities.The system gave more leeway to the employers to abuse the system and dodge their legal obligation to pay workers severance, according to Rai. “The problem lies in the legal structure that forces migrant workers to keep quiet out of fear, but there is nothing we can do about the law aside from raising awareness of the issue,” Rai said, adding that the government is more responsible than employers for the situation. The migrants’ union has called for a change to the current EPS system, asking the government to issue a “Labor Permit” instead. “The proposed Labor Permit System would enable migrant laborers to choose and change jobs, invite their families and work here for longer than five years so that they can apply for permanent residence,” Rai explained.Currently, the government only allows the EPS laborers to stay for up to four years and 10 months, which Rai views as a ""gimmick"" to stop them from applying for permanent residence. Those who have lived in Korea for at least five years can apply for residency. Rai believes that the highest court’s ruling to legalize the MTU is not an end to its years-long fight, but only a new beginning. Despite the ruling, the Ministry of Employment and Labor is yet to authorize its establishment, demanding several changes to its union rules. The ministry argued that the union’s bylaws included politically-oriented clauses opposing the Employment Permit System and calling for people working here illegally to be given visas.Discrimination against migrant workers is also still rampant in Korean society. Rep. Kweon Seong-dong of the ruling Saenuri Party recently enraged migrant workers by suggesting that foreign workers should not be entitled to the minimum wage. The wage hike will benefit them “excessively,” he said. “I want to question the qualification of the lawmaker,” Rai said, lamenting that a lawmaker from a developed country like Korea could have such a backward perception. Korean public sentiment remains divided over migrant workers, with many accusing them of stealing jobs from low-income Koreans. But the MTU leader said foreign workers were “necessary” to support Korea’s export-driven economy amid the low birthrate and graying population. “There are already many factories that cannot operate without foreign laborers,” he said. Throughout the interview, Rai stressed “solidarity” among Korean and foreign laborers against capitalists who are only after profits. “Koreans and migrant workers are friends, not enemies,” he said. “We should join forces to fight against the employers and the government trying to reform the labor market (to make it flexible) for their sake.” “If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","seoul gyeonggi incheon migrants ,working in korea illegally ,korean government to win ,beginning for korea migrant ,korea highest court recently","['South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'Udaya Rai', 'korean']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40533546  0.32197082

(Yonhap)The Daegu District Court issued the warrant, viewing the senior as a flight risk and citing the possibility of evidence being destroyed. The 82-year-old woman, only identified by her surname Park, is suspected of poisoning her six neighbors with a soft drink containing pesticide last Tuesday during a community meeting at a small village in Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province.The suspect has flatly denied the police accusations, claiming that someone “viciously” framed her. The suspect was at the scene, but didn’t call the police when she saw her neighbors collapsing after sipping the soda containing insecticide, according to investigators. The North Gyeongsang Provincial Police Agency probing the case Friday afternoon detained her and charged her with murder.Two died and four others fell into critical condition. One woman later regained consciousness. Park became a key suspect after the police found a capless bottle of a health drink containing insecticide, the same substance used in the poisoned soda, at her residence Friday.The 1.5-liter soda bottle shared by the neighbors had a cap from the health drink on it, raising suspicions that Park had put the insecticide in the soda bottle, but mistakenly changed the lid.Police also found other bottles of the same drink inside her residence that had the same expiration date as the health drink containing the toxic substance. Adding to suspicions, Park was the only one who didn’t drink the contaminated soda pop at the time. The pesticide was also detected in her clothes and on the handlebars of her electronic scooter, according to the National Forensic Service.The suspect, however, maintained that she did not know anything about the health drink bottle found near her residence. She also explained that she had the toxic substance on her clothes after wiping froth from the mouth of one of the collapsed neighbors.Investigators tried to give Park a lie detector test, but the suspect refused without understanding what the test was for, according to police.They are currently questioning village residents to gather evidence and ascertain the motive for the crime, the police said. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","an arrest warrant monday ,woman involved in poisoning ,arrest warrant monday for ,poisoning case that killed ,arrest warrant monday","['Daegu District Court', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3233307  -0.02414828

The National Intelligence Service agent surnamed Lim, 45, was found dead Saturday in his car on a mountain road in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. He died of asphyxiation, according to officials in their autopsy report, concluding that he had killed himself. A three-page handwritten will was found on the car’s passenger seat.  A police officer shows s suicide note left by a deceased spy agent at Yongin Dongbu Police Station on Sunday. (Yonhap)“There was no monitoring of civilians or election affairs,” Lim wrote. The agent also wrote that he had “mistakenly” deleted files out of fears that they could cause misunderstandings over NIS’ counterterror operations and further tarnish the spy agency’s reputation. “I deleted the data about counterterrorism activities and secret operations on North Korea, considering that the NIS was more important than the possible impacts that can be caused,” he wrote.“This was my mistake based on bad judgement, but there is nothing to worry about concerning my actions.”Lim’s death added fuel to a deepening controversy that the spy agency used a hacking program bought from Italian firm Hacking Team to bug civilians’ smartphones. The spy agency admitted the purchase of the program but said it was used only to strengthen cyberwarfare capabilities against Pyongyang and to monitor people in foreign territories who had suspicious ties to the North.Lim, who was a veteran cybersecurity expert with more than 20 years’ experience, was the agent who bought and operated the Hacking Team software, according to Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party.The note was disclosed as the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy launched an all-out attack on NIS over its alleged illegal spying on civilians.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, a software mogul-turned-politician, claimed that the investigators should reveal the truth behind the agent’s death, citing that authorities were not clear about why the agent had killed himself.NPAD also raised skepticism that over 130 Korean Internet protocol addresses were contained in the log file that was found in the data leaked from the Italian company. “There were 138 local IPs (in the log file), and the number even reaches 300 when including the overlapping ones. The targets include mobile carrier KT, Seoul National University, the Korea Broadcasting System and even Daum Kakao,” said Rep. Shin Kyoung-min. Later in the afternoon, the NIS countered the opposition party‘s argument, saying the IP addresses had no relation to NIS’ operation but were assumed to be related to that of the Italian firm. The agency also vowed to restore the data by the deceased employee and release them to lawmakers upon their visit to the spy agency. The intelligence body is in the process of verifying what kind of data had been removed, it added. The ruling Saenuri Party, however, remained cautious about possible political strife over the hacking scandal, arguing that fact-checking must be done before reaching any conclusions.“Whenever suspicion is raised over the intelligence body, the political parties often raise skepticism first and pressure the agency. Verifying the facts in patience must be the first step,” said Saenuri Party spokesperson Rep. Kim Young-woo.

A huge portion of computer files at Keangnam headquarters was missing, and closed circuit televisions had been turned off, prosecutors said, alleging that Sung ordered a cover-up before his death.Sung was under investigation for embezzlement when he committed suicide.

Prosecutors are investigating whether Kim received bribery in exchange. In 2010, KORES suffered a loss of 11.6 billion won ($10.3 million) after buying a 1.5 percent stake in the Ambatovy nickel operation in Madagascar for 35 billion won.Under the plan by then-President Lee, KORES and a consortium of seven South Korean companies, including Keangnam Enterprises Inc., signed a deal in 2006 to invest a combined 1.9 trillion won in the Madagascar project for a 27.5 percent stake.Keangnam Enterprises, however, failed to meet the deadline to pay for its stake of 2.75 percent. KORES picked up the tab and paid an additional 17.1 billion won on its behalf in 2008, on the condition that the firm pay it back by mid-2009.But Keangnam Enterprises fell short once again, with KORES taking over 100 percent of its stake in 2010. At the time, speculation swirled that former Keangnam Enterprises Chairman Sung Wang-jong pressured the president of KORES to purchase the stake.""The decisions were made internally without going through any government report or approval,"" Kim told reporters before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul, adding that he will sincerely respond to prosecutors' questions.The deal between Keangnam and KORES is one of several shady transactions surrounding the so-called energy diplomacy pushed by former President Lee.

The statements came one day after NIS chief Lee Byung-ho told lawmakers that the spy agency had never used the malware to spy on private citizens. Lee said the malware had been used to monitor likely North Korean agents residing in the South. NIS chief Lee Byung-ho (Yonhap)The ruling bloc also remained in support of the NIS. Ruling Saenuri Party legislators called suspicious opposition lawmakers “instigators” seeking to initiate meaningless political fights.But the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy appears equally adamant that it will get to the bottom of the allegations, naming former presidential candidate Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo early Wednesday to head a special panel that aims to investigate the scandal.Ahn, NPAD chair Rep. Moon Jae-in and party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul early Thursday held a press briefing to demonstrate that hackers could download text messages from a victim’s smartphone in real time.“Even when the camera on a smartphone is not turned on by the phone’s owner, a hacker could use malware to turn the camera on without the owner knowing it,” Ahn said, as he showed the images from a smartphone being downloaded onto a separate computer monitor.Ahn, a former presidential candidate, is a software mogul who made millions of dollars by developing anti-malware.“Smartphones across the country have become instant monitoring tools for NIS agents trying to spy on ordinary citizens,” Moon added.Ahn and Moon are also widely believed to have been victims of an online smear campaign run by the NIS in the days before the 2012 presidential election. The NIS was accused of spreading unconfirmed rumors that Ahn and Moon were pro-North Korea figures, allegedly swaying public opinion in favor of Park Geun-hye, who won the election in December 2012.The public uproar over the ongoing scandal began earlier this week when local reports accused the NIS of wiretapping possibly hundreds of civilians using malware, citing the leaked emails between the intelligence agency and Hacking Team.“I hope that I can calm public fears over this scandal, just by beginning this probe,” Ahn said.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","hacking allegations south koreans ,amid hacking allegations south ,wikileaks revealed on twitter ,escalated thursday after allegations ,water amid hacking allegations","['South Koreans', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'italian', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Hacking Team', 'Milan']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33031851  0.52593118

Won Sei-hoon, a former head of the National Information Service.(Yonhap)“What we need to rule on is whether there was any political intervention or online smear campaign (led by Won) based on facts, but we cannot make a ruling as there are no confirmed facts,” the presiding judge said in the ruling.The lower court sentenced the ex-spy chief to three years in jail in February for violating the nation’s election laws by meddling in the 2012 presidential election campaign to help then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye win. The court found the 64-year-old guilty of “willfully” neglecting an online messaging campaign conducted by his agents to sway public opinion in favor of President Park and against her then-rival Moon Jae-in.The court recognized that 274,800 messages were illegally posted by his agents, who are required to refrain from political activities under the nation’s NIS law, after Park was nominated as a presidential candidate on Aug. 20, 2012.In the initial ruling, however, the lowest court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison, suspended for four years, clearing him of the election-meddling charge. It only confirmed his charge of breaching the NIS law by failing to remain politically neutral.The focal point in the verdict was whether to view the attached file on email messages of a NIS agent as evidence to systemically influence the election results. The email listed 269 Twitter accounts of NIS staff members.If the file is recognized as evidence, the number of messages posted to back President Park increases, which disadvantages Won in the ruling.

The government’s special joint investigation team said 63 officials, including 38 former and incumbent military officers, would face trials over allegations of fabricating documents or taking kickbacks while they were handling defense projects. The scale of the corruption was nearly 1 trillion won ($870 million), they said. The announcement came about eight months after the state launched a large-scale probe into irregularities in the defense acquisition programs. The joint investigation team was formed with over 100 prosecutors and military investigators, the largest joint probe scale in history. Of the 38 indicted military officers, the navy accounted for the most with 28, followed by the air force and army with six and four, respectively. Ten of the 38 were either former or incumbent generals or admirals, officials said. Document fabrication, property crimes and bribery were the most common charges.  The lack of a monitoring system, the exclusive military culture and moral laxity contributed to the corruption, investigators claimed.“As it has been confirmed that the arm project corruption was a systematic irregularity accumulated over a long period, (the joint probe team) will extend the probe to the end of this year to root out the deep-seated crime,” the investigators said.

Shin Kyoung-min said. “Hopefully before this week ends,” Shin said.“The malware was purchased by 35 governments worldwide and used in 97 law enforcement agencies,” Saenuri Rep. Lee Cheol-woo said. “The information became public because Hacking Team had been hacked themselves.”Local reports earlier Tuesday accused the NIS of obtaining malicious software and using it to hack the smartphones of at least two unnamed local citizens. The reports cited email records between suspected NIS agents and Hacking Team.The NIS allegedly purchased Samsung smartphones, produced and used locally, to send sample devices to Hacking Team in Milan each year. The Italian firm used the phones to provide technical assistance in designing malware that could infecct the phones and KakaoTalk, a popular messaging app.Email records available on WikiLeaks also allege that Hacking Team was in contact with Nanatech, a South Korean firm allegedly subcontracted by the NIS, since at least November 2010, suggesting the alleged illegal wiretapping could have been going on for years.Opposition lawmakers expressed disgust at the allegations.“This is a serious allegation that must be looked into by a parliamentary investigation,” minor opposition Justice Party Rep.

The Seoul Central District Court ruled that a woman, whose information was withheld, should pay 5 million won ($4,400) to her former junior female staffer as she breached the human dignity of the victim by making sexual jokes. The defendant was accused of sexually harassing the employee by asking “What did you do last night with a guy?” after seeing an atrophic scar on the victim’s neck on her second day of work.  The harasser also asked her victim whether she had ever delivered a baby before, saying, “Your hair looks just like that of a mother who gave birth to a child.”The victim reported the harassment to the company, but no measures were taken. She then quit the job.Four months later, the company punished the superior with a “reprimand” after the victim reported the case again to the company. While the defendant apologized to the junior worker later and the company offered to pay the victim a salary of five months, the victim took legal action against both her former superior and the company last year and sought 30 million won in compensation. The company had claimed that it was not accountable for the case, as it has periodically conducted anti-sexual harassment campaigns for employees. The court, however, held that the company did bear some responsibility, as the case involved a worker who was in charge of supervising other workers.

On Dec. 5, Cho forced a Korean Air flight departing from New York back to the gate because of the way her nuts were served -- in an unopened bag instead of on a plate -- and to have Kim's supervisor disembarked.The supervisor, Park Chang-jin, has said he is also mulling over a suit against Cho in the United States.

Last month they allegedly tricked her into logging into a fake website while posing as the prosecution office, then obtained her personal information, according to a spokesman for the Busan police.  The police are trying to confirm the media reports that Oh is Choe's nephew.The two suspects allegedly transferred approximately 39 million won ($34,000) from Shin's account to a fake bank passbook owned by Lee, identified only as a 47-year-old man.They lured Lee into lending his account in exchange for a 5 percent commission fee, the spokesman said, adding that Lee, who then was under investigation on charges of providing a fake bank account to another phishing scheme, reported the case to the police.Oh and his accomplice were arrested through a stakeout near a bank in Seoul.

Kang, who was later nicknamed “cream bread dad,” died on the spot. (Yonhap)“The victim’s jaywalking should be recognized as wrong, but the accused could have avoided the accident if he had been careful enough while driving, given that there were no major obstacles on the road,” the judge said in the ruling. The accident triggered a wave of public sympathy after it was revealed that Kang called his pregnant wife just before the accident to apologize for buying her a buttercream-stuffed bun, instead of a cake she asked for, because he didn’t have enough money. Kang’s story immediately prompted a nationwide hunt for the hit-and-run driver, which pressured Heo to turn himself in.The court recognized that the defendant had sincerely repented and the victim’s family also asked for leniency. But the judge handed down the prison term, taking into account Heo’s attempt to conceal his crime despite being aware that the police had tracked him.  The defendant claimed that he wasn’t aware of hitting Kang at the time. Heo admitted that he drove after drinking four bottles of soju, but the court cleared him of drunk driving for lack of evidence. The hit-and-run driver gave himself up nearly three weeks after the accident took place, which made it impossible to gather physical evidence of whether he was driving under the influence of alcohol.Last month, prosecutors sought a five-year prison sentence for Heo, accusing him of attempting to destroy evidence and failing to reflect on himself.  Upon the ruling, Heo expressed gratitude to the victim’s family for understanding his circumstances. It is not yet decided whether he will file an appeal, Heo’s lawyer said.

Choi Doo-yeong, 55-year-old president of the Local Government Officials’ Development Institute, was found dead early Sunday outside his hotel room in what Chinese officials later suspected was a suicide. He was staying in the region to handle affairs after the bus crash in the northeastern Chinese city of Jian last Wednesday that claimed 10 Korean lives.The bodies of the victims arrived in Korea on Monday around 1:05 p.m. via Incheon International Airport. Eight of the public officials’ bodies were sent to local government organizations where they each worked. The respective government bodies will take care of the funeral processes for the victims.The bodies of the two other victims, a public official and the tour agency official, were sent to their respective families on request.Choi’s body will arrive in Korea separately later this week, after his family has identified the body. With regard to Choi’s death, Chinese investigators said they ruled out homicide based on the autopsy results, testimonies of eyewitnesses and surveillance images.They also found his fingerprints on the window of his hotel room. Officials here said they were still baffled over why the government official allegedly chose to plunge to his death.“The Chinese officials cooperated (with Korean government) as best they could in terms of preserving the bodies and sending them back to Korea. There is no particular reason to believe that he was under immense pressure, and it’s far-fetched to connect the conflict (between Chinese officials and victims’ families) to his death,” said the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs.A search of his hotel room did not turn up a suicide note, but a memo with a large question mark, although officials said they were unsure of what it meant.A member of the Korean government team deployed to China told Korean media that Choi appears to have been stressed out by strife between the Chinese authorities -- who wanted the bodies cremated -- and the families of the deceased who wanted the bodies sent back to Korea. China eventually agreed the day before Choi’s death to send the bodies back.In an official briefing Sunday, the Home Affairs Ministry said while the families were unhappy with some aspects of the situation, such as the medical facility, there was no actual conflict.Despite the reports by Chinese authorities, the ministry has not ruled out the possibility that Choi merely lost his footing and fell. Last week’s bus crash killed nine Korean civil servants, a Korean civilian and the Chinese bus driver. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","suicide after china bus ,after china bus crash ,found dead early sunday ,bus crash in china ,suicide over the weekend","['south korean', 'China', 'Choi Doo - yeong', 'the Local Government', '’ Development Institute', 'chinese']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20548363  0.43720153

Diabetic and unemployed, she had been living in a tiny single room at a “goshiwon” -- cheap, dormitory housing mostly utilized by young students -- with her two ...","When Yoon Ji-hee, a 43-year-old single mother, divorced in 2010, the court had ordered her ex-husband to pay her 800,000 won ($711) as child support for their two children every month.But until March of this year, Yoon had never received anything from him. Diabetic and unemployed, she had been living in a tiny single room at a “goshiwon” -- cheap, dormitory housing mostly utilized by young students -- with her two teenage children.  Her eldest son, now 20, had been the sole breadwinner of the family, including for the monthly rent of 280,000 won. “For Yoon, getting the overdue child support was the only way to help her son and ease his burden,” said Cho Young-jong, a debt collector who helped with her case at the state-run Child Support Agency. Yoon is one of some 390,000 single parents in South Korea who had never received child support from the other parent. The latest government study showed that 83 percent of all single parents in Korea never received any payments in 2012. Of those, only 4.6 percent of them filed a lawsuit. And even among those who won their cases, 77.4 percent said they still did not receive any money, in spite of the court orders.As of 2014, 77.3 percent of all Korean single parents were women. Kwon Yong-hyun, Vice Gender Equality Minister (Center) poses for a photo during a ceremony celebrating the opening of a state-run hotline service specifically for single parents nationwide on Wednesday (Yonhap)To tackle the problem, the Gender Equality Ministry in March launched the Child Support Agency to support child-rearing single parents by enforcing child support payments. Since then, some 14,900 single parents contacted the agency for help, and 81 of them were able to receive their payments. The received payments totaled 226 million won as of last week.“In some cases, the payments brought extra positive changes and mutual understanding. It also brought closure to ongoing conflicts,” said Bae So-young, a lawyer who works at the agency. “One of the single mothers found out that her ex-husband had been refusing to pay the child support because he had been heartbroken about losing his right to see his children when they got divorced. So they made some compromises. He agreed to pay the child support, while his ex-wife agreed that he could gain his right to contact the children again.”Bae also had a client, a single father, who claimed that his ex-wife purposely cut off all contact with him to avoid paying him child support. But when Bae contacted his ex-wife, she told a completely different story.“The ex-wife told me that he had been stalking her all along, showing up at her work and her place. She said he had not been doing it necessarily because of the money, but because he had this unresolved grudge against her,” Bae said. “She claimed that she had to cut contact because she was just so scared of him. So through us they made an agreement. She agreed to wire the money every month, while he agreed to never call or show up at her place again.”Yoon, for her part, received 10 million won from her ex-husband with the help of debt collectors. With the money, she and her children were able to move into underground housing with two rooms and a living room. “Her daughter, who is in high school, is the happiest to get out of that goshiwon,” said the debt collector Cho.Yet Kim Eun-hee, a Daegu-based activist for single parents’ rights, said back in March that laws should be further fortified to impose a criminal penalty for overdue child support payments.The activist said she witnessed a number of unwed, single mothers being threatened by fathers of their babies. One mother, for instance, withdrew her case after her ex-boyfriend’s mother verbally attacked her for “ruining her son’s reputation,” and threatened to take custody of the child.Lawyer Bae also acknowledged that it is harder for unwed mothers to claim their child support payments. In order for an unwed parent to seek child support, they have to legally prove to the court that the other parent and the child are in fact biologically related. Once that has been done, they have to file a separate lawsuit to request for payments. The whole process can be as long as nine to 10 months, and costs about 5 million won if one proceeds with a private lawyer. Meanwhile, the average monthly income of single-parent households was 1.72 million won, which is less than half the average of all households in the country at 3.53 million won, according to government data.The biggest problem is that individuals can easily refuse to cooperate with the court’s request to take a DNA test under the current Korean law, said Bae. “The court currently does not have the authority to forcefully take their hair, blood or saliva samples for a DNA test,” explained Bae. “Doing so would be illegal and a violation of self-ownership.”Jeong Ji-ah, another lawyer who works at the agency, said many unwed mothers don’t know where the other parent lives or works, and this also makes their situation difficult. The state-run agency has access to the database of the National Health Insurance Service when tracking down the debtor’s place of employment. “It’s not that hard when the debtor works for a corporation,” said the lawyer.“But when they are running their own businesses, or works for a private company, it’s very hard for us to track them down. Many times their address or contact information aren’t available anywhere.”Lawyer Bae also explained that the current law also stipulates that a creditor of child support can request for personal information of the debtor at their place of employment. But it does not state that the debtor’s employer must comply with the request.Because of such difficulties, only three unwed mothers have decided to proceed to prove their child’s biological link to their fathers with the agency. The agency offers the legal service for free. “It’s not that many unwed mothers don’t want to do it,” said Bae. “Many times it’s literally impossible to reach the other parent. Law revisions can bring some positive changes to this.”Korea’s lack of late child support payment penalties, as well as enforcement, have been also linked to the country’s high overseas adoption rates, as well as the low income of single-parent households. About 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed, single mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.Bae said it is also necessary for single parents to work through their unresolved feelings against their ex-spouse. Before joining agency, Bae worked with a female client who filed a suit against her ex-husband for overdue child support. The ex-husband, a medical doctor, moved from one hospital to another to avoid collectors and the court’s letters. “My client was a working pharmacist so that was one of the reasons. Her ex-husband didn’t think she needed his financial assistance,” Bae said. “But another reason was that he still very much resented her, and on top of everything else, did not trust her. He didn’t think the money he gave would be spent on the children. Such cases are pretty common. It’s recommended to have closure to whatever issue a parent might have with the other parent before talking about child support.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","old single mother divorced ,year old single mother ,mother divorced in 2010 ,single parents still struggling ,old single mother","['Yoon Ji - hee', 'Yoon']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92463571  0.03166372

Hong Joon-pyo for violating the Political Fund Act by accepting illicit political funds from Sung, the deceased chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, it said in a press briefing Thursday afternoon.The charges were dropped against six other politicians ― ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo and incumbent Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and his two predecessors, Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon ― who were also suspected of receiving shady money from Sung, due to lack of evidence and the statute of limitations expirations, the prosecution said.Both Gov. Hong and ex-premier Lee expressed regret over the prosecution’s decision. Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo (left) and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo. (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald/Yonhap)“Lee’s truth is more powerful than anything, and he will strive to clear his charge,” Suh Joon-won, a close aide to the former prime minister, said on behalf of Lee. He also questioned the investigation process, which he claimed had not given Lee a right to defend himself. Hong said in a press release that he “deeply regretted” the decision to charge him with receiving illicit political funds. He said he had nothing to do with the late businessman, calling the prosecution’s actions “the result of political decision.” The indictment comes nearly three months after prosecutors launched the investigation into Sung’s claims that he offered illegal campaign money to eight politicians close to President Park. Sung took his life in April, leaving a hand-written note in his pocket that listed the names of the politicians and the bribe sums he claimed to have handed over, which triggered a public backlash against the Park administration. The prosecution said that it obtained circumstantial evidence that Sung offered 100 million won ($89,000) to Hong in June 2011, when the four-term lawmaker was running for the leadership of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party. Lee is suspected of having received 30 million won from Sung in April 2013 during his bid in the parliamentary by-election. He stepped down as prime minister on April 27 amid the spiraling graft scandal. In the press briefing, investigators said that they secured evidence that Roh Geon-pyeong, an elder brother of late President Roh Moo-hyun, accepted 500 million won in illegal political money from Sung in 2007 in return for granting him a presidential pardon by exerting influence on government officials. Sung was then sentenced to six months in jail, suspended for a year, on charges of embezzlement. But it decided not to indict the former president’s brother as the statute of limitations had expired. As part of the investigation, the prosecution also sent inquiry letters in late May to the six politicians listed in Sung’s memo other than Hong and Lee, requesting information on their affairs with Sung, as well as their roles at the ruling party in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election. Unsatisfied with the reports, prosecutors called in the ruling Saenuri Party’s three-term lawmaker Rep. Hong for questioning in early June over allegations that he took 200 million won in illegal campaign funds from Sung for then-presidential candidate Park in 2012. But the prosecution allegedly could not obtain any evidence. The prosecution expanded its investigation into the opposition bloc in late June, calling in Rep. Kim Han-gil, the ex-chairman of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy party, which the opposition party viewed as “politically motivated” to shield the Park administration. Investigators suspected Kim of accepting illegal funds from Sung, though he was not on Sung’s list. Prosecutors also accused Saenuri Party Rep. Rhee In-je of having taken bribes worth 20 million won from Sung just before the 2012 general election. Both Kim and Rhee have been asked to appear for questioning by prosecutors, but they refused, citing their “busy schedule” and “innocence.” The prosecution said that it would continue to investigate the two politicians for bribery.

Col. Jeff Slown, commander of the THAAD unit on Guam, said the public hearings are a requirement of the National Environmental Protection Act or NEPA process, according to a Pacific News Center report.  ""We're looking at the socio-economical aspects. We're looking at the environmental aspects, the cultural aspects, other aspects out there that we may need to be aware of prior to the Department of the Army, Department of Defense making a final decision on if we should bring THAAD out here on a permanent status,"" he was quoted as saying.  The commander was also quoted as saying that if the THAAD unit becomes permanent, the soldiers attached to the unit will be able to bring their families to Guam and really become part of the community and become contributing members to the island.  The Army deployed the THAAD battery to Guam in 2013.  The U.S. also wants to deploy a THAAD unit to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.  But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China and Russia see a potential THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests and have increased pressure on Seoul to reject such a deployment.  Seoul and Washington have maintained they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.

Both the ingredients look similar, but Cynanchum auriculatum Royal is strictly banned from use for human consumption by the Korean government due to its toxicity.Cynanchum wilfordii, called “baeksuho” in Korean, has enjoyed popularity among the middle-aged in recent years, for its medicinal effects that allegedly treat various geriatric diseases, strengthen the immune system and improve blood circulation.

The Supreme Court legalized the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union, invalidating the Ministry of Employment and Labor’s ban on its establishment. Members of civic groups hold a press conference to criticize the government for oppressing foreign workers’ human rights and reforming immigration law in front of the government complex in central Seoul on Jan. 4, 2008. (Yonhap)In the ruling, the court said the ministry’s refusal to allow the organization to found a labor union was against the Constitution, upholding a lower court ruling. The court ruled that illegal immigrants are entitled to joining and setting up a trade union though they do not have an official work permit, by recognizing anyone who offers labor and receives payment as a laborer in accordance with Korea’s labor law. The historic ruling, which will protect basic workers’ rights of illegal immigrants from now on, came 10 years after the organization filed a suit in 2005. In 2005, some 91 foreign workers based in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province set up a trade union and requested for a permit from the labor ministry. The ministry demanded the organization turn in its members’ registration numbers or passports to check their legal status in Korea, which was rejected by the MTU. The government then refused to accept the application, prompting the MTU to file a suit. The lowest court ruled in favor of the ministry, but the appeals court overturned the decision by saying that workers’ rights stipulated in the constitution should not be restricted unless they harm the national security and public order. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","court backs illegal immigrants ,illegal immigrants in korea ,ruling that illegal immigrants ,backs illegal immigrants union ,court on thursday upheld","['South Korea ’s', 'Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor ’s']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27807337  0.27750564

He is being interrogated in the presence of a lawyer,"" said a prosecutor.The summons came as part of the prosecution's investigation into a suspected ""bribery list"" left behind by Sung, the late chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Inc., who committed suicide in April.Prosecutors said they have obtained testimony from a former Keangnam Enterprises executive surnamed Kim that he had asked the elder Roh to help swing Sung's pardon.Previous administrations have granted special pardons to imprisoned business executives, politicians and other offenders at the end of a president's term to foster national harmony.The elder Roh, who was previously mired in a number of graft scandals and served a prison term on corruption charges in 2008, is suspected of receiving kickbacks from the late Sung.The memo retrieved from Sung's pocket after he was found dead showed sums of money written next to the names of a number of high-profile politicians, suggesting that they were bribed. The eight politicians in the memo include President Park's former and current chiefs of staff. The prosecution has said it will soon indict former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province, on charges of violating the law governing illegal political funds.Sung suggested in the memo that he had given the illegal political funds to six other people, including Hong Moon-jong, a ruling party lawmaker who had been in a key post in the Park camp, as well as Yoo Jeong-bok and Seo Byung-soo, the current mayors of Incheon and Busan.As part of the investigation, prosecutors said they will bring in Rep. Kim Han-gil of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy and Rep. Rhee In-je of the ruling Saenuri Party sometime soon.Kim allegedly took tens of millions of won from Sung while running for the opposition party's top position in May 2013.Rhee is accused of having received bribes from Sung just before the 2012 general elections.Rhee was part of the now-dissolved minor conservative Advancement and Unification Party when Sung served as the party's floor leader.Both Kim and Rhee have denied the allegations.

Kim Han-gil had accepted illegal funds from the late Sung Woan-jong. Kim was the first head of the newly minted New Politics Alliance for Democracy party in 2014, a party formed by combining progressive groups, mainly from the Democratic Party.Prosecutors say Kim accepted illegal funds from Sung days before the DP’s convention in May 2013 when Kim was elected as the party chairman. Kim denied the charges, which he called, “ridiculous,” later Tuesday.Prosecutors also suspect that Geon-pyeong accepted illegal money from Sung in 2007. Sung was given a presidential pardon that year after being convicted of embezzlement. Authorities say Sung may have handed bribes to Geon-pyeong to attain the pardon. Kim Han-gil (Yonhap)But critics accused the prosecution of fabricating charges for political reasons.“A few politically driven prosecutors are embarrassing the thousands of law enforcement officials working hard to make our nation safe,” NPAD whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul said. Lee added that the charges were part of an “authoritarian crackdown” on President Park Geun-hye’s opponents.Sung, the ex-chairman of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, took his life in April amid mounting bribery charges against him. But hours before his death he revealed a list of ruling bloc officials he had allegedly given bribes to, sparking a public firestorm against the Park administration.The list included former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, former Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo. Rep. Kim Han-gil and Roh Geon-pyeong were not included in that list.None have been convicted, but Lee resigned in April amid growing public suspicion that he had accepted illegal campaign funds from Sung during the April 2013 parliamentary by-elections.But the scandal quickly turned against the opposition, when allegations arose that officials in the Roh Moo-hyun administration had allegedly received bribes from Sung. Many leading figures of the NPAD began their political careers under the Roh administration.Prosecutors say Sung and Kim were close. Local media reported earlier this week that Kim and Sung had been scheduled to meet privately the night before Sung’s suicide. Prosecutors also accused governing Saenuri Party Rep. Rhee In-je of having received bribes worth 20 million won ($18,000) from Sung just before the 2012 general elections. Rhee was the chair of the now-dissolved minor conservative Advancement and Unification Party when Sung served as the party’s floor leader.

Moon Jeong-gu, a lawyer for the Seoul-based law firm Ahn & Chang, said Sunday that he filed the suit with the Seoul Administrative Court on Friday, accusing the government of failing to carry out a duty to protect its people by keeping key information from the public. “The government has a duty to disclose specific information such as hospitals where MERS confirmed patients stayed and the patients’movement for its people to be cautious for themselves,” Moon said.“The government kept the list of the MERS-affected hospitals confidential for 19 days after the first case was confirmed, exposing the public to the danger of infection,” he added. Saying that the information could contribute to public panic, health authorities declined to name the hospitals after the outbreak of the deadly virus began on May 20. It finally revealed the list on June 7 amid growing public calls for the information.South Korea has grappled with the spread of MERS since the nation reported its first case. The deadly virus has claimed 27 lives, with more than 172 confirmed of the disease as of Monday afternoon, though its spread appeared to show signs of abating. Korea has seen the biggest outbreak of MERS outside Saudi Arabia, where the virus was first discovered in 2012. Moon called the government’s response “belated,” pointing out that the information came when there were already 64 patients confirmed of the virus, five deaths reported and 2,361 people under quarantine. “The government deprived the public of rights to know, as the current law does not include any specific rules on how to share information on the outbreak of infectious disease and how the public can respond to it,” the lawyer claimed. Regarding the suit, Moon said that he is not seeking any financial compensation from the state, but wants to have the judicial branch confirm that the government failed to properly cope with the outbreak at the initial stage. “I wanted to leave the government’s botched response on a national record (to prevent recurrence of such a case),” Moon said. The legal procedure is expected to take about three to four months to reach a conclusion, he added.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","friday accusing the government ,lawyer for the seoul ,lawyer lodged lawsuit against ,court on friday accusing ,lawyer lodged lawsuit","['Moon Jeong - gu', 'Seoul', 'Ahn & Chang', 'the Seoul Administrative Court']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3162666  -0.07183502

However, more than 100 faulty parts have been found since then. The special investigation team -- comprised of government, military and prosecution officials -- is headquartered at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

Hwang officially took the nation’s second-highest post on Thursday after obtaining parliamentary endorsement.“Justice Minister nominee Kim Hyun-woong is the right man to establish the rule of law and to eradicate the corruption widespread throughout society judging by his professionalism and leadership built while serving various posts within the prosecution and the Justice Ministry,” said Park’s spokesman Min Kyung-wook. Kim Hyun-woong (Yonhap)Kim was nominated with approval from new Prime Minister Hwang on Sunday, he added. The new justice minister does not require parliamentary approval, but will be subject to a confirmation hearing.Kim 56, joined the prosecution in 1990 and served several major posts in the prosecution including director of the special criminal investigation team at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. He was also named vice justice minister in late 2013 and worked under then-Justice Minister Hwang for more than a year. Park may have tapped Kim, who is younger than the incumbent Prosecutor General Kim Jin-tae, due to limited options, observers say. The president may have wanted to keep the tradition of having the justice minister older than the top prosecutor, but ended up naming Kim to avoid criticism from the main opposition lawmakers questioning ethical misdeeds of other senior candidates hired by major law firms after their retirement from the law enforcement agency. Kim’s experience in special criminal investigations may also have influenced Park, as she has been pushing for massive reform drive aimed at rooting out wrongdoings in the public and private sector.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","recent political scandal ,president tapped as prime ,the seoul supreme prosecutors ,of recent political scandal ,next justice minister completing","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Hyun - woong', 'the Seoul Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Cabinet', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66820812  0.46247652

The Seoul High Court sentenced the 55-year-old professor, only identified by his surname Shin, to three years and six months in jail on charges of rape, upholding an earlier lower court ruling. Shin, who taught mixed marital arts at university, was indicted for taking a 19-year-old female student to a hotel after getting her drunk at dinner and raping her there in January 2014. Shin denied the charge, claiming that he did not have sex with the teenager. He said he had intended to take the drunken girl to a hotel to sleep, but ended up staying longer to brush her teeth as she started to vomit. He then fell asleep on the floor at the hotel room, he said.But the lower court sentenced him to a 3 1/2-year prison term, and said that he did not show any willingness to repent for his wrongdoing and continued to make excuses despite his social status as a teacher. Challenging the ruling, Shin filed an appeal, arguing that he was not able to feel sexual desire as he was taking medicine to treat prostatic hypertrophy and hair loss. The treatment came after he was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction, he said. But the upper court rejected his appeals, saying that the teenage victim made consistent statements about the circumstances under which she woke up due to Shin’s attempt to rape her. The court also added in the ruling that his medical situation did not prove it was impossible for him to have sex.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","professor convicted of raping ,professor rape sentence upheld ,convicted of raping teenage ,university professor convicted ,seoul high court sentenced","['south korean', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Shin']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29362679  0.25069338

The attempted murder charge does not stipulate a specific jail term, but it is expected that Kim could face a life sentence given the gravity of the crime, according to legal sources. In the preliminary hearings, the prosecution said that Kim’s attack could have killed the American envoy, considering the location of the envoy’s injuries and the knife used. But Kim’s lawyer maintained that he did not mean to kill, citing Kim’s crippled hands. Kim’s lawyer had asked the court to review the CCTV footage that filmed the scene to prove that Kim was not able to freely move his right hand.

The dispatching of workers took place from April 2013 through February 2014.""Homeplus made the fried chicken company pay for all expenses related to the dispatched workers, which is in clear violation of the revised 2011 subcontractor act,"" the corporate regulator said.The rule was set up to prevent big retailers from forcing smaller suppliers to cover the expenses of sales personnel, which was common practice in the past. Such measures unfairly burdened small firms that had no choice but to comply if they wanted to sell their goods at the retail chain.The FTC, moreover, said that Homeplus did not even ink a formal agreement in regards to the use of sales people it received from the fried chicken company.Homeplus has 140 large discount stores across the country and reported annual sales hitting 8.93 trillion won in 2014.

Kang's attorney asked for leniency, citing depression.  A psychiatric evaluation showed Kang's mental condition may not have been severe enough to cloud his judgment, said Judge Choi Chang-yeong at the Seoul Central District Court.  South Korea maintains the death penalty, though it has not carried out an execution since 1997.

The contracts were worth a combined 1.96 billion won.  ""Jeong deserves a severe punishment because his actions could have undermined our military's combat capability,"" Judge Choi Jae-hyeong said Tuesday at the Seoul High Court said, adding the 46-year-old also damaged the public trust in the military.  Choi, however, commuted Jeong's jail sentence from two years to one and a half years, considering he appeared genuinely remorseful and was motivated not by money, but his desire to maintain a good relationship with the parts supplier. He was also ordered to forfeit 280 million won.  The Tongyeong was found to be fraught with problems and unable to participate in rescue operations during the April 2014 ferry tragedy that killed more than 300 people.  Construction of the 3,500-ton ship began in 2012 after North Korea torpedoed the South Korean warship Cheonan in 2010. The aim was to enable the military to effectively carry out rescue operations and tow damaged vessels.

Hong Moon-jong for questioning on Monday over allegations that he received illicit campaign funds from deceased business tycoon Sung Woan-jong. Hong, 60, is the third political bigwig quizzed by prosecutors in connection with the high-profile graft scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s top aides. He was suspected of taking 200 million won ($178,000) in illegal campaign funds from Sung, late chairman of Keangnam Enterprises, for then-presidential candidate Park in 2012. Hong was serving as the chief of her election camp. The three-term lawmaker turned up at the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office at around 12:40 p.m. to respond to the summons. Asked whether he admitted to accepting the bribe, Hong curtly replied “No” and said he wanted the truth to be revealed.  Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong (center) answers questions from reporters before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office for questioning on Monday. (Yonhap)Prosecutors said earlier on Sunday that they will focus on interrogating why Hong met Sung on several occasions and whether he took illicit funds from the deceased businessman. The graft scandal surfaced after Sung claimed in a media interview that he offered campaign money to eight politicians close to President Park before committing suicide in April. The police found a hand-written note in his pocket that listed the names of the politicians and the bribe amounts he allegedly handed over. Hong’s name was written next to 200 million won. Investigators have already grilled former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo last month over the bribery accusations. The two political heavyweights are set to be indicted soon without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act, prosecutors said. The prosecution sent inquiry letters late last month to the remaining six politicians listed on Sung’s memo, requesting information on their relations with Sung, as well as their roles at the ruling party in 2012. The six include Hong, incumbent Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee, his two predecessors ― Huh Tae-yeol and Kim Ki-choon and Saenuri-affiliated lawmakers ― Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok and Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo.Hong is the first of the remaining six to be physically called in. The summons came after prosecutors found his explanations ― in the written response ― on the money flow and his movements unsatisfactory, prosecutors said. With the investigation process dragging on endlessly and the six politicians being probed only through written transcripts, the opposition bloc has blasted the prosecution for being soft on them to shield President Park’s administration.Two months on since the graft scandal broke, prosecutors announced that they will soon indict the ex-prime minister and governor without detention, with the whole process appearing to lose steam and interest from the public. But sources expect that Hong’s questioning will set the direction for the rest of the probe, and possibly speed up the investigation. Meanwhile, the court rejected the prosecutors’ request for the arrest of former ruling Saenuri Party official, identified only by his surname Kim, on Sunday night citing lack of evidence. Prosecutors had sought for the arrest on Thursday as part of the widening probe into Sung’s memo. He is suspected of receiving 200 million won in 2012 from Sung when he was the chief cospokesperson for President Park’s election camp. The focal point in the investigation on Kim was the timing of the delivery of suspected money. Investigators tried to find when he received the money from the late businessman and whether he delivered it to President Park’s election camp through Hong, who was holding a key post in the campaign office. But they tentatively concluded that Kim took the money in March 2012 ahead of the April parliamentary election and used it for his own campaign, not for the presidential election that took place in December. Kim applied for party nomination in the general election that year.

The man was diagnosed with MERS in China’s Guangdong province after he entered the country via Hong Kong last month.Amid growing fears about MERS in Hong Kong where nearly 300 people died in 2003 due in an outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, media criticism increased over Korea’s inept response to the outbreak of the virus. Indonesian visitors donning masks enter Korea via Incheon International Airport on Sunday, amid escalating fears over MERS. (Yonhap)Taiwan has raised its travel advisory level to yellow from gray. The yellow level is issued when a tourist is advised to take “special caution” and reconsider their trip to a particular area, while the gray level refers to a situation in which a tourist is advised to take a normal level of caution.To assuage public jitters about MERS that killed five of the 64 Koreans infected as of Sunday, Taiwan conducted anti-infection drills in some medical institutions on Saturday. During the drills, health authorities practiced transporting and quarantining a mock patient.The Taiwanese government also maintained close contact with some 300 Korean students within the country. They are also reportedly considering providing anti-infection masks to the Korean students who are to visit Korea for their summer vacation.Alerted by the increasing number of Koreans infected with MERS, Japanese health authorities have decided to conduct thorough medical checkups on all of the people including Japanese who will enter Japan from Korea. As concerns rose over the negative impact of the virus on the national image, the Seoul government vowed to strengthen cooperation with the international community to quickly and more effectively address MERS fears.“It should not been seen as a source of diplomatic tension. Rather, we should view this issue as a transnational one for which we should step up international cooperation,” an official of Seoul’s Foreign Ministry told The Korea Herald, declining to be named. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry, along with the Health Ministry, plan to hold a meeting with foreign diplomats in Seoul to explain the current situations surrounding the spread of MERS and Seoul’s efforts to contain the virus.The Seoul government also pledged to closely cooperate with the World Health Organization to investigate the spread of MERS in Korea.A team of WHO experts in virology, epidemiology and public health will launch a joint probe with Seoul officials on Tuesday to evaluate the infection situations and ascertain how the virus was spread here. Among the experts are those who previously handled the outbreak of MERS. The WHO team is led by Keiji Fukuda, its assistant director general for health security.Meanwhile, the number of tourists who have canceled their trips to Korea is on the rise, according to the state-funded Korea Tourism Organization.

Park was in charge of the Navy's budget and acquisition.He has become the first sitting general-level official to be arrested since the launch in November 2014 of a pan-governmental investigation team on corruption apparently prevalent among the nation's arms procurement officials.Several other current and former naval officers were earlier indicted for their involvement in the forgery of the relevant documents.The Navy has already come under fire over a string of bribery scandals.Chung Ok-geun, who served as Navy chief of staff from 2008-2010, was arrested in January on charges of receiving more than 700 million won from local defense firms.In March, former Chief of Naval Operations Hwang Ki-chul was arrested for allegedly peddling influence to help a firm win a deal to supply parts of the 3,500-ton salvage ship Tongyeong.

The girl died 40 minutes after arriving at the hospital.

The 31-year-old woman, only identified by her surname Kim, was apprehended in Jung-gu, central Seoul, on charges of damaging private property, according to Namdaemun Police Station. Kim allegedly spray-painted a heart-shaped image and Roman alphabet letters with an unidentified man on the wall of a building in Myeong-dong, one of Seoul’s busiest shopping districts, with tourists. During the police investigation, the German woman, who entered Korea in April to meet her parents, stated that the graffiti was intended to promote world peace. She does not seem to be affiliated with any organizations, police said. “We are tracing the man who ran away from the scene, but it is difficult to detain him due to lack of evidence,” police said. In Korea, painting graffiti on private property without permission can be punishable with a penalty of 7 million won ($6,300) and up to three years in prison. Those who draw graffiti on public property face a heavier penalty of up to 20 million won and 10 years in jail on charges. Seoul has seen more and more graffiti, with police suspecting foreign nationals of painting graffiti found only meters away from a police office in Myeong-dong. Last month, a 22-year-old Latvian and 27-year-old Spaniard were also detained after painting graffiti on exterior walls of subways running through Seoul, Incheon and Ansan from 2013 to April. Police vowed to expand its investigation into other foreign graffiti artists in Seoul.

The reclusive state called Park a “rare wicked woman” and “a loyal dog of a (U.S.) colony” in a white paper published Wednesday.“It is very regrettable that the North has defamed the head of state representing (South Korean) people,” said an official at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, declining to be named.“We call on North Korea to stop the slander that does not help the two Koreas reopen bilateral dialogue. We also call on it to respond to our calls for talks and move out onto the path of inter-Korean development and reunification.”Amid the exchange of harsh words, observers raised the possibility that the isolated country could set off provocations unexpectedly in a show of force and displeasure rather than coming forward for dialogue.The North has used blatant words to attack Park in a series of commentaries in its state media including the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the ruling Workers’ Party; the Korean Central News Agency; and the Minju Joseon, a newsletter for the North’s cabinet.On Thursday, Uriminjokkiri, a propaganda website run by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, criticized Park’s visit to the U.S., slated for June 14-18, saying that it would undermine the preparation of an inter-Korean ceremony in Pyongyang to mark the 15th anniversary of the so-called June 15 inter-Korean declaration.“(Park’s visit to the U.S.) will be a perilous gambling that puts the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region at risk,” the website said in its commentary.Meanwhile, Seoul’s chief nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kook and his U.S counterpart Sung Kim flew to Beijing Thursday to hold separate bilateral talks with China’s point man on North Korea’s denuclearization, Wu Dawei.Their trip to China came the day after they held a trilateral meeting with their Japanese counterpart Junichi Ihara in Seoul to discuss the escalating nuclear threats from the North.Their talks with the Chinese envoy are expected to focus on stressing China’s responsibility in addressing North Korea’s nuclear issue and coordinating a joint response to its enhancement of nuclear capabilities including the technology to develop an SLBM.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","pyongyang for slandering president ,slandering president south korea ,korea thursday for slandering ,slams pyongyang for slandering ,slandering its president park","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Pyongyang', 'Park', 'North ’s']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19947353  0.40713295

The Seoul High Court sentenced Cho to 10-month imprisonment, but suspended the term for two years.The ruling came five months after Cho, also known as Heather Cho, the eldest daughter of the airline’s chairman, was imprisoned for violation of aviation safety last December. The court handed down a reduced sentence, ruling that Cho did not cause a change in the flight path when she forced the taxiing flight back to the airport gate to deplane a chief steward in a rage over macadamia nuts. The lower court sentenced her to a one-year jail term in February. The 40-year-old could have faced up to 10 years in prison if she was found to have altered the flight path.  Cho Hyun-ah“Despite her problematic view and attitude, the accused did not seem to have the intention to threaten the flight’s safe operation,” said the chief judge Kim Sang-Hwan in the ruling.“Given the original ruling was made to protect passengers’ safety, Cho’s crime had only limited impact on the plane’s security and safe operation,” adding that the aviation law is meant to avert dangerous acts such as hijacking.But the court upheld her conviction by a lower court for assaulting the chief cabin crew Park Chang-jin and disrupting the plane’s operation with more than 200 passengers onboard. Prosecutors sought a three-year jail term for Cho, saying that she does not seem to feel sorry.She admitted to all charges except changing the flight’s course. Cho, who was in charge of in-flight service of the nation’s biggest airlines, ordered the chief steward off the flight from New York to Incheon at John F. Kennedy Airport after she was not satisfied with the way Kim Do-hee, a first-class flight attendant, served macadamia nuts ― in an unopened bag, not on a plate. Enraged by what she viewed as “poor cabin service,” Cho verbally abused the chief steward, made him kneel and jabbed his hand with a folder.The incident immediately triggered controversy over the long-held privileges of a handful of family-owned conglomerates that dominate the national economy, making it one of the most high-profile cases in Korea. On Friday morning, Cho made her appearance, wearing glasses with her hair tied up, at the Seoul High Court, filled with some 150 reporters and spectators. After the ruling, she bowed to judges, changed from her green prison uniform into black clothes and quickly left in a car without answering a flood of questions by reporters.The focal point in the verdict was whether the plane that moved about 200 meters at airport apron to return to the terminal gate could be seen as “flight route deviation.” Overturning the initial ruling, the upper court said that the aircraft’s movement on the ground is not part of the flight’s planned route, acquitting her of the charge. The judge also said that Cho seems to have deeply repented her past behavior and realized the damage she caused to victims since she began serving her term with other prisoners. “As she seems to be willing to apologize to victims, it is meaningful to give her another chance to make up for her behavior,” the judge said. “We also considered that she would have to live with social criticism.” The court also took into account that she has 2-year-old twins, never committed a crime before and stepped down from her post as vice president of Korean Air. But the victims appeared unwilling to accept her apology.The flight attendant Kim, who served the nuts in question, filed a petition to the court last weekend, calling for “stern punishment” for Cho. She claimed that the “nut rage” case led to “serious damage to her psyche and reputation.” She also filed a civil lawsuit in a U.S. court in March. The chief steward Park is also reportedly preparing to take legal action in the U.S. to seek financial compensation worth 50 billion won ($46 million).

After graduation, Pyo started as a police inspector investigating criminal cases at local police stations in South Korea. Pyo Chang-won, director of Pyo Institute of Crime Science (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)However, things were not quite what he had imagined. He was not making noticeable progress in investigations. Other veteran investigators told him, in apparent efforts to cheer him up, that he may have to spend another 20 years to develop his instinct and guts to solve the cases.“I didn’t want to wait for another 20 years,” he said. “Then I thought of Sherlock Holmes, believing that England could show me a different way,” he said, adding that the country developed techniques to solve cases based on a scientific approach for more than 200 years.Pyo then attended University of Exeter and earned both a masters and Ph.D. in police studies. After his extensive research and studies on criminology and investigative methods, he came to realize that it was not the scientific techniques that South Korea lacked, it was the system that ignored a neutral investigation open to all possiblities.“We often jump to conclusions that most of criminal cases involve people who are close to the victim, and start the investigation from there,” he said. “If it turns out that not one on the list was the real culprit, the case ends up as a mystery.”Pyo said his destiny as a criminal profiler started there: to start an investigation by assessing the evidence at a crime scene first, reconstruct the scene, make judgements on what likely happened and to find the truth behind the lies and the mystery left behind by a crime.He became the nation’s first profiler investigating high-profile cases on serial killers and unsolved cases while working as a professor at KNPU to teach criminal psychology and investigations. Pyo began receiving public attention after he appeared on local TV programs such as an in-depth investigative program “The Unanswered” where he interviewed as a profiler to offer his assessment of many unsolved criminal cases.The fluent, outspoken speaker with extensive knowledge of criminal cases and assessment of the mentality of criminals, soon wowed the audience. He also began to write columns on a wide range of fields including politics, culture and labor. Pyo become more and more open to express his criticism and analysis of controversial social issues that persisted through the Korean society, not only through the mass media, but also through social networking. But then in 2012, Pyo criticized the police for being passive in its investigation into the spy agency’s alleged interference in the presidential election.“I was deeply hurt by fellow police officers, calling me an internal enemy and betrayer,” he said. “I could have been stigmatized if I distorted the truth for my own self-interest, but I was not. I believed in the truth,” he said. As his remarks stirred controversy, he voluntarily stepped down as professor at the state-run university that year. Though the resignation was not something “intended,” Pyo said, it led him to embrace more, limitless opportunities. He became more active in writing, publishing more than 10 books including “Enemies of Justices (2014),” “Dignity of Conservatives (2013)” and “I want to live like Sherlock Holmes (2013).” He also appeared on several TV shows including “Sisa Dolgikgu” in which he hosted a number of live debate sessions on sensitive political and social issues raised in South Korea. Currently, he is the founder and the director of Pyo Institute of Crime Science, a civilian research and training lab, dedicated to educate young Koreans aspiring to become criminal profilers. He even got more exposed to the public, appealing with his image of charismatic, clear-headed, and self-made man by making the cover of fashion magazines.In his books, Pyo constantly compares the two groups of criminals ― from the upper class and the working class ― offering a view that not every criminal is treated equally.For instance, he tells the story of Chun Kyung-hwan, younger brother of former militant President Chun Doo-hwan, on how he was able to stay away from prison for years, citing health, despite charges of multiple frauds and tax evasion. Pyo also writes about Chung Won-seop, the owner of a local cartoon book store, who served 15 years in prison after he was forced to make a confession on killing a girl in 1972 although he didn’t. After 39 years, Chung was found innocent by the top court in 2011.“The reason why I make a comparison between the two groups is because this makes me sad,” he said.“Trust is the key to investigations and the jurisdiction process. I want to say that the public won’t be able to trust any law enforcement agencies or even the courts as long as they keep treating people differently in regard to their status in society.”Living as a critic is a difficult, tiring and unpaid task, he said, stressing that he wants to extend his belief in justice through a novel he has been working on.The versatile writer has recently finished his first fiction, a mystery novel written for children aspiring to become profilers like him. The book, to be released next month, tells the story of a boy named Seollok whose parents were murdered, and he becomes a criminal profiler investigating mystery cases.“I was tired of being at the center of disputes, watching people clash over their own interests,” he said.When asked about his future plans, Pyo said he is open to new things but he would dedicate himself more to writing ― something that could inspire next generations, probably like Sherlock was to him when he was young.“I want to do something promising and productive for the next generation, something that can help them pursue universal truth and cultivate the power that could penetrate the dark.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","solved mysterious murder cases ,brilliant detective who solved ,won 50 sherlock holmes ,odd but brilliant detective ,solved mysterious murder","['Pyo Chang - won', 'Sherlock Holmes', 'Pyo', 'London', 'Pyo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55838716  0.07223948

Hong Joon-pyo are to be indicted without detention on charges of violating the Political Fund Act, prosecutors said Thursday, a decision that the opposition bloc viewed as “too lenient.” The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office was set to indict Hong and Lee for illegally receiving political funds, making them the first two political bigwigs to be prosecuted in connection with the high-profile bribery scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s top aides. The prosecutors, however, reportedly decided not to detain the accused despite circumstantial indications that Lee and Hong allegedly attempted to sway the investigation in their favor by pressuring witnesses not to make statements against them during the questioning. The indictment came 38 days after prosecutors launched the investigation into the allegations that eight senior officials from the Park administration accepted illicit political donations from deceased business tycoon Sung Woan-jong. Lee and Hong flatly denied the accusations during their questionings. “We secured enough credible testimonies and circumstantial evidence to press charges against Lee and Hong by questioning Sung’s aides,” the prosecutors said, adding that their statements were specific and consistent.The main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy, meanwhile, took a swipe at the prosecution for taking a soft line on the accused.“The prosecution’s decision not to detain them is obviously in favor of the ruling party,” said NPAD floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul, reiterating his calls for a thorough probe into the six other politicians listed on Sung’s memo.

Park Yong-sung, the former head of Doosan Group and ex-chairman of Chung-Ang University in Seoul, is suspected of delivering about 100 million won ($92,000) worth of gifts and cash to Park Bum-hoon, who was then former President Lee Myung-bak’s top aide on education and culture. In return, the former Cheong Wa Dae official had allegedly pressured the Education Ministry to approve controversial projects pursued by the university, officials said.  Former Doosan chief Park Yong-sung speaks to reporters at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Friday. (Yonhap)Chung-Ang University was pushing ahead with a project to integrate its two campuses in Seoul and Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, in 2011. The plan was opposed by the Education Ministry as it violated a regulation that bans mergers between campuses more than 20 kilometers apart.But the prosecution believes that the ministry approved the plan later on under pressure from the former secretary. He was arrested last week for abusing his power to grant business favors.The businessman Park was also summoned as a suspect in the case, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said. The prosecution said it would decide whether to indict him after questioning.Authorities investigating the case said that Park offered donations and the lease for a shop in Doosan Tower ― a popular shopping center in central Seoul ― to two cultural foundations whose de facto owner was the former secretary. The ex-secretary was also the chairman of CAU before joining Cheong Wa Dae.Park is facing a prosecutorial summons for the second time in a decade. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, suspended for five years, on charges of creating a slush fund in 2005. In 2007, he was pardoned by the Roh Moo-hyun administration and returned to his position as chairman of Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction. He also started to serve as the chairman of CAU from 2008. He stepped down from all posts last month after his rough remarks sparked a controversy. The ex-chairman allegedly threatened faculty members who opposed the board’s plans to restructure the school, saying “it is not good manners not to strike someone’s neck when they have asked for it. I will strike in the most bloody and painful way possible,” in an email.The 75-year-old also resigned from the post of honorary president of the Korean Olympic Committee.He was credited for his contribution to the nation’s sports after being named a member of the International Olympic Committee in 2001. Park, the third son of Doosan Group founder Park Doo-byung, was named Doosan Heavy chairman in 2001 and also served as the chairman of Doosan Infracore and Doosan Group. Doosan Group is currently led by his younger brother Park Yong-maan.

Lim was apprehended Tuesday evening for taking two children’s clothes off and touching them at a children’s hospital in Seoul. Police are looking into whether Lim committed similar crimes elsewhere.The case raises concerns over the effectiveness of the monitoring system, as authorities failed to prevent the crime despite the sex offender was wearing one and under surveillance.The government introduced the system in 2008 to deter sex criminals from reoffending, despite the controversy that the system might infringe on the convicts’ human rights. Under the system, sex offenders are required to wear an electronic tag for up to 30 years after they are released from prison.If they try to destroy it or move outside a permitted area, probation officers are automatically notified. But the monitoring system appears to be ineffective in preventing repeat offenses, with the number of convicts destroying their electronic tags and committing sexual crimes growing in recent years. According to the Ministry of Justice, the number of sex offenders who reoffended while tagged rose from three in 2010 to 30 in 2013. In March, a 20-something man was captured in Daegu after committing sex crimes on three occasions with his electronic device on. A 30-something sex criminal cut off his anklet and escaped last month, though he was later apprehended in Seoul by the police. An official from Ministry of Justice admitted that it was difficult to monitor tagged offenders round the clock, especially late at night, due to staff shortages. “The Justice Ministry will step up monitoring and instruct those wearing the device to return home before midnight,” the official said.

Lee is the second of eight political heavyweights to be grilled over the burgeoning graft scandal.Before entering the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office, Lee apologized to Korean citizens “regardless of the reason” for causing concern. But the former premier reiterated his earlier position that he would face the prosecutorial summons to prove his innocence.“There is nothing that can defeat the truth. I will explain myself in detail to the prosecution,” Lee told reporters before entering the prosecution’s office. Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo arrives at Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday.(Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald)Lee's questioning lasted until 1:00 a.m. the next day. As he left the prosecutors’ office, he reiterated that he did not receive any money from Sung. He told reporters that he had “no memory” of a private meeting with Sung, which is when he is suspected to have received illegal political fund.Sung claimed that the former premier received 30 million won ($27,412) in illicit funds while running for a parliamentary seat in 2013. The revelation sparked a nationwide scandal that put the integrity of President Park Geun-hye’s administration in doubt. Despite claiming his innocence, the prosecution was expected to file charges against Lee this week for violating the political fund act. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, who was called in for questioning last week will be indicted on the same charges, according to legal sources.Besides Lee and Hong, six political bigwigs including Park’s aides and members of the ruling Saenuri party are suspected to have illegally taken money from Sung, the former head of Keangnam Enterprises.Prosecutors investigating the case are focusing on securing evidence and testimonies that the money was delivered to Lee during a private meeting with Sung at his election campaign office. Lee initially denied the allegations and claimed he was not even close to Sung. But the former premier came under siege after he was found to have had over 200 phone conversations with Sung in one year. He was also accused of lying as he made ambiguous and conflicting testimonies to the National Assembly. In light of Lee’s summons, his ruling party refrained from making public comment. But Rep. Kim Young-woo, the party’s chief spokesman, urged the prosecution to conduct a thorough investigation, saying “it would be the only way to carry out justice, and gain the trust of the people.Party leader Kim Moo-sung simply said he was “heartbroken,” and did not elaborate.The opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy urged the prosecution to get to the bottom of the corruption scandal. They have been stepping up the offensive against Saenuri for raising illegal election funds for the 2012 presidential election, when Park was a candidate for the ruling party.“(The NPAD) would like to point out to the prosecution that the investigation should not stop at Hong and Lee. Sung’s revelation is a suspicion cast on the highest powers,” NPAD spokesman Kim Sung-soo said in a parliamentary briefing. “People of Korea will never condone attempts to cover up such an unprecedented scandal by scapegoating a couple of people.”Although the prosecution is making progress in its probe on Lee and Hong, the question remains on who the authorities may target next. Unlike the two, the investigators have yet to acquire solid proof or testimonies on allegations of the other six, according to sources.The prosecution is expected to investigate a former Saenuri spokesman surnamed Kim, to whom a former Keangnam official Han has claimed to have given 200 million won.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","thursday over allegations he ,deceased businessman sung woan ,of eight political heavyweights ,he received illegal political ,on thursday over allegations","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'korean']",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.10013831 0.31550997 0.31269458],Yoon Min-sik,Politics,5,2015,"second of eight political heavyweights ,thursday over allegations he received ,saenuri for raising illegal election ,political funds from deceased businessman ,prosecution on thursday over allegations","['Lee Wan - koo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'korean', 'Lee', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Thursday.(Kim Myung - sub', ""the Korea herald)lee 's"", 'Sung', 'Sung', 'Park Geun', 'Lee', 'South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri', 'Sung', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Lee', 'Sung', 'Sung', 'the National Assembly', 'Kim Young', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Saenuri', 'Park', 'Hong', 'Lee', 'NPAD', 'Kim Sung - soo', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'Keangnam', 'Han', 'Yoon Min - sik']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.10013831 0.31550997 0.31269458]

The highest court confirmed the ruling by lower courts that delivered a not-guilty verdict to Kang Ki-hoon, citing the “lack of credibility” of forensic evidence. Kang, 51, was convicted in 1991 for helping a fellow activist Kim Ki-sul set himself on fire and jump to his death from a university building in Seoul, and ghostwriting Kim’s will in protest against the authoritarian administration of the then-president Roh Tae-woo. Though Kang denied the charges, he was sentenced to three years in jail after the National Forensic Service confirmed that he had written the suicide note. The 1991 ruling came when a rash of protests engulfed the nation, demanding more democracy and the resignation of Roh. In the case that later became known as Korean version of the “Dreyfus Affair,” it is widely thought that the authoritarian government framed Kang to sway the public opinion against the sprawling protest movement. Kang sought a retrial in 2008, a year after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a special committee established in 2005 to review past security-related cases, concluded that Kang did not write the note and prosecutors framed him. Strong opposition from the prosecution delayed the retrial for years, but the Seoul High Court finally acquitted Kang in February 2014, which was upheld by the Supreme Court on Thursday. The Seoul High Court, however, convicted him of violating the National Security Law, sentencing him to one year in jail and partially depriving him of civil rights including his right to vote for a year. As Kang has already served a jail term, he will not be put behind bars, the court said.

Seo was suspected of pushing and dragging his former actress wife Seo Jung-hee to the ground and strangling her during a quarrel in the hallway of their apartment in southern Seoul last year. “The wife’s injury was not light at all and the accused has not shown any regrets for his misbehavior,” the judge said. The case sparked controversy after the surveillance footage of Seo assaulting his wife was released through the media. After the assault, she underwent three weeks of medical treatment, officials said. The wife has testified in a trial that she had nearly a prisoner-like marriage for 32 years, creating a public stir. The 59-year-old clergyman claimed that his wife’s testimony was false and that she deliberately exaggerated the accidental case in an attempt to divorce with him.

He then shot himself to death. With an investigation underway into his motive, criticism has mounted over the military's lax regulations on training reservists despite its drive to maximize the personnel amid dwindling active-duty soldiers.The shooting range at the training camp has 20 shooting lines, but a mere six active-duty service personnel were there to control the reservists, with three senior officers staying away from the lines.Over the course of the attack, none of the instructors were able to take proper actions to stop him, according to Army officers.While carrying out the exercise involving loaded guns, the authorities also failed to provide reservists with key protective gear, such as bulletproof jackets.""Instructors are supposed to give bullets to reservists after making sure that their guns are properly fixed to the stand with a safety hook, but it is yet to be confirmed if the instructors failed to check it or if the shooter later removed the hook,"" an Army officer said. He refused to be identified. Though reservists are supposed to receive three rounds first for calibrating their rifle before getting another six for regular shooting, the authorities handed out a magazine with 10 bullets at one time, while allowing the trainees to skip ""the zeroing fire"" process of adjusting their sights. ""No fixed regulations exist on how many instructors are supposed to be there to control shooting drills, and many details on managing the training for reservists are at the discretion of a commander of each unit,"" Yang Wook, a senior researcher at the Korea Defense & Security Forum, pointed out. While serving in the Army, the shooter was classified as an at-risk soldier, such information was not properly informed to the reserve component unit, a system that effectively prevents any preliminary measures.As part of efforts to better manage the troops, the military classifies vulnerable soldiers into three categories -- A, B and C -- factoring in the results of enlistees' psychological consultations and their backgrounds, with A deemed the most vulnerable. Choi was a ""Class B"" soldier as he had difficulties in adjusting to military life.""It is almost impossible to expect tighter discipline among reservists and effectively control them. After all, they are already civilians and the service personnel who manage the training of reservists are thinly stretched,"" said Shin In-kyun, a military expert who runs the Korea Defense Network. ""Authorities need to take this incident as an opportunity to thoroughly review the overall system of managing the reserve forces who have been left in gray areas.""

Kim began serving the prison term in July.Kim later got his sentence reduced by two months for exemplary behavior, and had another month taken off the term as he checked into a halfway house after release, a place that is meant for reintegration of a person who has served in prison.""I'm so grateful and proud of my brother putting up with nearly 10 months of difficult time,"" Kim's sister, Yuri Lustenberger-Kim, told Yonhap News Agency by phone from Zurich, where she lives. ""I hope people around him will provide him with a lot of help and support so that he can chart a new life.""Supporters of Kim have claimed that his punishment was too harsh, considering the information he passed to the reporter is not highly sensitive nor based on concrete intelligence, but just common-sense information that anyone could discern. In March, Kim's lawyer demanded his immediate release, strongly accusing the U.S. Justice Department of a ""profound double standard"" after the department recommended only a misdemeanor conviction for a former CIA director charged with a similar offense.Former CIA Director David Petraeus was accused of giving classified materials to Paula Broadwell, his mistress and biographer, while he held the top job at the CIA, but the Justice Department decided to permit him to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.Petraeus was also charged with giving Broadwell several notebooks that contained highly classified information he had compiled during his time as a top general, including the identities of covert officers, war strategy and intelligence capabilities.

Some 30 investigators stormed into the head office of the Korea National Oil Corporation, the residence of its ex-president Kang Young-won and the Seoul office of investment bank Merrill Lynch on Tuesday morning to secure evidence related to the probe, according to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. The raid came amid allegations that state-run companies wasted a huge amount of public funds in the overseas projects, with some lost to corruption. An employee enters a security gate at the head office of the Korea National Oil Corp. in Ulsan on Tuesday. (Yonhap)KNOC was suspected of acquiring a Canadian oil company Harvest Operations and its major subsidiary North Atlantic Refining Limited in 2009 without properly analyzing their values as part of ex-President Lee’s “energy diplomacy.” KNOC allegedly paid 1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion) ― a lot more than the market price ― to acquire NARL without any value assessment. The state-controlled company, however, ended up selling it last year at about 34 billion won to tackle mounting company debts. Kang, then-president of KNOC, led the company’s dubious acquisition, allegedly causing a financial loss worth 1 trillion won to KNOC. Merrill Lynch was adviser to KNOC for the acquisition deal at the time.During Lee’s presidency from 2008-2013, the government encouraged Korean companies to take part in overseas projects to secure energy resources needed to boost economic growth, calling it “energy diplomacy.” While KNOC played a key role in pushing for the projects, some 86 companies allegedly took part in the resource drive. But the state audit agency, Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea, estimated in April that state-run companies, including KNOC, suffered losses of 3.4 trillion won by carrying out the projects.The investigation into the waste and corruption in the overseas development projects under the Lee administration appeared to lose steam as all eyes were on the high-profile bribery scandal surrounding late business tycoon Sung Woan-jong and President Park Geun-hye’s close aides who Sung claimed had bribed before his apparent suicide. But it will likely gain pace following the raid, sources said. As part of widening probe, there is also a possibility that the prosecution will call in Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan for questioning. Choi, who headed the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, a precursor to Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, allegedly made the final decisions on KNOC’s Canadian acquisition deals. By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)","energy projects prosecutors raided ,prosecutors raid state oil ,prosecutors raided on tuesday ,projects prosecutors raided ,raid state oil firm","['Lee Myung - bak', 'the Korea National Oil Corporation', 'Kang Young - won', 'Seoul', 'Merrill Lynch', 'Tuesda']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.13286997 -0.01489101

The banker, who had been in charge of accounts and mostly worked as a teller before taking leave, was asked to be an usher instead when she returned. Her own desk was gone, and as an usher she had to stand the whole time. When she confronted her boss after waiting for a month, he told her: “I don’t consider you as my employee. If you feel this is unfair, you should talk to Cheong Wa Dae.”The worker soon descended into depression, and was eventually hospitalized. She was fired as she did not return to work ― the victim claimed she was still too sick to work ― even after her sick leave allowance had run out. The court ruled her employer pay 20 million won ($18,272) in compensation for her emotional and career damage.Workplace bullying in South Korea is quite serious, and women workers are especially vulnerable due to poor work-life balance as well as the glass ceiling, according to a study by the Korean Women’s Development Institute. About 62.3 percent of all Korean workers have been bullied at least once at the workplace as of 2008, while 45 percent said they have witnessed workplace bullying as of 2012.Among the witnesses, 61.3 percent said the bullying they had seen was “very serious.” Also, 58.3 percent said they have had a coworker who left work after being bullied by their bosses or colleagues. Experts said female workers, especially those in contract positions, were more vulnerable to workplace bullying and sexual harassment than their male counterparts. Among the 360,000 who joined the temporary workforce over the past decade, 89 percent were women. According to the Korea Labor and Society Institute, female temporary workers earned only 36 percent of full-time male workers’ average salary last year. Last year, a female contract worker at an amusement park in Seoul filed a complaint to the human rights authorities at the city government, claiming she and her female colleagues were bullied by those in full-time managerial positions. The workers were all in temporary positions and were hoping to get full-time positions by the end of their contract. Their managers often threatened them by saying “not everyone can become full-time workers and you never know what would happen to you” whenever the women did not obey their requests.The managers also reportedly forced them to attend drinking sessions, where they were often sexually harassed while asked to pour drinks for their superiors. The bullies were mostly men, but a female manager also reportedly sexually harassed contract female workers. After organizing an independent investigation, the Seoul Metropolitan Government concluded that the worker’s claims were true. The managers eventually faced disciplinary action.“There is still little public awareness on what workplace bullying is and why it is a violation of human rights,” said researcher Koo Mi-young at the Korean Women’s Development Institute. “And since women are more vulnerable to this particular type of abuse, there should be more gender-based discussion about workplace bullying, sexual harassment, as well as discrimination.”Overseas studies have long shown that workplace bullying can lead to a number of health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder and even suicide. Also, coworkers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as severe stress, fear and emotional exhaustion, according to a study by the National Communication Association in the U.S. A bill to deal with workplace bullying was proposed in 2013 in Korea, but is currently pending in the National Assembly.

Hong Joon-pyo repeated his denial of corruption allegations Monday, claiming that the illicit money in question was not a bribe but his wife’s secret funds.Hong, currently being investigated by the prosecution for allegedly receiving 100 million won ($92,000) from deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong, claimed that the money came from a secret fund stashed away by his wife without his knowledge. The money is suspected to have been used during the 2011 primaries of Hong’s ruling Saenuri Party.Suspicions grew when the prosecution said Hong failed to explain the source of 120 million won in election funds. It also said Sunday that Hong and Sung’s aide surnamed Yoon ― who supposedly delivered the money ― had met in June 2011, contrary to what the governor had been claiming all along.Through a Facebook posting and a press conference, Hong said the 120 million won came from his wife’s secret fund, one that amounted to 300 million won at one point, which she kept hidden from him. He said his wife stashed away some of his earnings as a lawyer and the special allowance given to floor leaders of each party.“As a ruling party floor leader, I would get 40 million won to 50 million won each month. I gave the leftover funds to my wife, who kept them in a bank safety deposit box,” Hong said. He claimed that at the time, he had no knowledge about where the money came from and learned about the source only after the prosecution started an investigation into the graft scandal.“I believe that the prosecution is pressuring me by revealing the evidence to the public,” he said, adding he was willing to comply with investigations of the fund.The governor also denied the special investigative team’s accusations that he, his staff and Yoon had met at a building in the National Assembly in June, although authorities claimed they have acquired enough evidence.But the prosecutors said Hong’s claims were not convincing. They are expected to file charges against him for violation of the political fund act. The special investigative team is also conducting an investigation into an allegation that Hong’s aides attempted to contact witnesses related to the graft scandal in hopes of pressuring them not to give unfavorable testimonies against him.The prosecutors summoned Hong’s former aide ― a local university head surnamed Eom ― who is accused of asking Yoon to change his testimonies about the supposed illegal transaction between himself and Hong.Hong’s explanation about the money also raised eyebrows of the opposition, who argued that Hong should be arrested right away.“It appears more and more clear that (Hong) attempted perjury on top of trying to destroy evidence. If he had been a member of the opposition or an ordinary citizen, he would have been arrested 10 times over,” said Rep. Jun Byung-hun of the main opposition New Political Alliance for Democracy. Similarly, Rep. Lim Nae-hyun of the NPAD said if he had indeed given the operating expenses to his wife at his discretion, it should be considered embezzlement. He also held Hong responsible for not reporting 300 million won in assets to the authorities.Hong is one of eight politicians whom Sung pinpointed as receiving illicit political funds before committing suicide last month. The revelation sparked a graft scandal, in the wake of which former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo resigned.The prosecution is now likely to summon Lee this week to question him over allegations that he received illegal funds from Sung while running in the 2013 by-elections.

He was working at the Justice Ministry’s immigration office in southern Seoul. The prosecution launched the probe after the immigration office found out Kim’s wrongdoings during an internal inspection, officials said. During the prosecutorial probe, Kim reportedly contradicted himself. He initially said he falsified visa documents for the foreigners, but later went back on his words, saying that false information was “mistakenly” written on the documents. He is also reported to have denied accepting any bribes.Investigators also booked a 32-year-old female broker who had allegedly introduced Kim to foreigners seeking visa extensions. The broker, whose name was withheld from the media, purportedly retained a commission and handed over the remaining money she took from expats to Kim, they added. The prosecution has secured the evidence of money transfers between Kim and the broker, sources said. Meanwhile, the ministry discussed ways to toughen the punishments for those who falsify visa documents.Foreigners who provide false information for the stay permit will be sentenced to three years in jail or fined up to 20 million won along with deportation. Calls for a stronger penalty have mounted, as the maximum fine for falsely filling out the stay permit form was limited to just 500,000 won.By Lee Hyun-jeong  (rene@heraldcorp.com)","arrest warrant against seoul ,extensions officials said monday ,an arrest warrant against ,seoul southern district prosecutors ,cash for visa extension","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01215994 -0.09029085

The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office said they have filed for a court warrant to detain the 42-year-old mid-level worker at the southern Seoul unit of the Korean Immigration Service on charges of official document forgery and bribery.The immigration service is under the wing of the Ministry of Justice and it is the first time a member of the ministry is charged with illegal visa transactions.According to the prosecutors, the government employee, surnamed Kim, illegally renewed visas on 27 occasions in favor of some 20 Chinese and other nationals during the two-year period since early2013 in return for financial rewards worth 11 million won ($10,100). Kim's offences were first uncovered in an internal inspection of the southern Seoul immigration office and were later transfered to the prosecution.  Prosecutors have also booked a 32-year-old female administrative agent for brokering the visa-for-money transactions between Kim and foreigners. Kim has denied the bribery charges while claiming some of the irregular visa issuances were made by mistake, according to the prosecutors.

Hong Joon-pyo met a former aide of deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong that counters the politician’s denial that the meeting took place.Sung’s aide, surnamed Yoon, has claimed to have delivered illicit money from the businessman to Hong in 2011 when he was running for chairmanship of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party.An official at the special investigative team told reporters that Hong was confirmed to have met with Hong at the time of the supposed transaction.Hong is among eight politicians whom Sung claimed to have given illegal political funds to before his death last month. On Friday, he became the first of the eight to be questioned by the prosecution, after Yoon said he delivered 100 million won ($92,000) to Hong’s secretarial staff in June 2011.While Hong repeatedly denied the charges and insisted that he never met Yoon prior to November 2011, investigators said they acquired evidence verifying Yoon’s testimony to be accurate. “We’ve acquired all the solid proof (on whereabouts of Hong), so we don’t think there is any doubt about it,” the prosecution’s special investigative team on the case said.Contrary to Hong’s claims, Yoon told investigators that he met Hong and his staff at a building in the National Assembly in June. Prosecutors reportedly procured a photo of Hong’s party in the building at the said time. The investigators were to summon Hong’s former aide -- who worked as his secretary during a 2011 primary election of his party -- later in the day to verify the governor’s testimonies. The prosecution suspects Hong’s staff received the money while he was running for the leadership of the Grand National Party. They are strongly considering filing charges against him for violation of the political fund act. As part of an ongoing probe into a burgeoning graft scandal, the investigation is now expected to zero-in on former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, another of the eight who supposedly received money from Sung. According to sources, the prosecution is likely to summon Lee this week to question him over allegations that he received illicit political funds in 2013.Besides Hong and Lee, the so-called “Sung Woan-jong List” also includes three of President Park Geun-hye’s former and current chiefs of staffs, two mayors and a lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party. It sparked a graft scandal that saw the resignation of the prime minister -- who held office for just two months -- and the plummeting approval ratings for Park, coupled with attacks from the opposition on the administration’s integrity. On Saturday, the special investigative team grilled Sung’s aides including his driver and his secretary, who accompanied the chief of former Keangnam Enterprises when he is believed to have visited Lee’s campaign office in 2013. They also summoned a volunteer at the office who claimed to have witnessed Sung at the site.Sung claimed he handed Lee the money during the visit, according to an interview he gave a local newspaper just before his death.Lee has denied the allegations that he had a private one-on-one meeting with Sung, but his former driver told local media that he witnessed the two having such a meeting. The investigators questioned the driver -- identified by his surname Yun -- on Wednesday. The focal point of the investigation on Lee is when and how the money was handed over to the former premier -- if such a transaction had taken place at all. Initial investigation implied that the supposed transaction occurred on April 4, 2013, when the cited volunteer testified to having seen Sung at the campaign office. But further investigations dug up another potential date of April 7, when Sung visited a region in South Chungcheong Province near where Lee was conducting his election campaign. The prosecution is also probing the suspicion that Lee’s former aide -- surnamed Kim -- had called Yun and the volunteer to persuade them not to testify.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","alleged bribery the prosecution ,hong over alleged bribery ,bribery the prosecution said ,bribery the prosecution ,deceased businessman sung woan","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung ’s', 'Yoon', 'Hong', 'the Grand National Party']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21529524  0.23503986

Hong Joon-pyo was questioned Friday by the prosecution in Seoul over his alleged involvement in a high-profile graft scandal, becoming the first to be questioned among eight political heavyweights mired in the case.The bribery allegations have dealt a serious blow to Hong’s reputation as a “corruption buster” that he built while working as a state prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s. “I feel sorry for having caused public concern. I am here to offer my explanation (concerning the allegations against me),” Hong told reporters as he appeared at the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul. Hong is alleged to have taken 100 million won ($93,000) from late former Keangnam Enterprises chairman Sung Woan-jong in 2011. Sung, who was found after an apparent suicide last month, left a bribery list that included Hong and President Park Geun-hye’s top aides, such as her chief of staff Lee Byung-kee. South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo speaks to the press before entering the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office for questioning over his alleged involvement in a graft scandal Friday. (Yonhap)Investigators are considering filing a charge against Hong of violating the political fund act. Hong denied the charge.The prosecution suspects Sung handed illicit money in a shopping bag to Hong’s secretarial staff via a former executive of the construction firm in June 2011 when Hong was running in the leadership contest of the Grand National Party, the precursor to the ruling Saenuri Party. Investigators are examining whether Hong was aware of the money transfer to his secretary and whether Sung ever contacted Hong to talk about the provision of the illicit money.The prosecution is also investigating the allegation that Hong’s aides tried to pressure the former executive of Keangnam Enterprise, who allegedly delivered the money to Hong’s aides, into not making unfavorable statements about Hong during a prosecutorial interrogation.Hong also denied this allegation. The ex-Keangnam official, identified by his surname Yoon, has already been questioned by the prosecution four times. Investigators said they have secured “circumstantial evidence” to back the allegation that Sung handed the illegal cash to Hong’s aides.A prosecution official said the investigation into Hong’s allegations proceeded “smoothly.”“The probe proceeded smoothly as Hong brought a considerable amount of materials to refute the allegations against him,” the official said, declining to be identified.Political circles have carefully watched the graft investigation into Hong and seven other politicians, as the probe is expected to have a considerable impact over the political landscape, particularly ahead of the general parliamentary elections slated for April 2016.Hong’s fall from grace is also expected to affect the ruling party’s lineup of presidential hopefuls. Hong, the former chairman of the ruling party, has long been cited as one of the party’s potential contenders for the 2017 presidential election.Amid the ruling party’s struggle to minimize the fallout from the graft scandal, the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy has stepped up its offensive against its rival party, arguing that a thorough probe into President Park’s aides, embroiled in the scandal, should be conducted.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","corruption scandal south gyeongsang ,governor questioned in corruption ,in corruption scandal south ,high profile graft scandal ,questioned in corruption scandal","['South Gyeongsang Province', 'Hong Joon - pyo', 'Seoul', 'Hong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1492319   0.08339565

He was detained by South Korean authorities in 1990 for gambling in Macau. With the chairman's arrest, Dongkuk Steel has reportedly entered into ""emergency"" management mode with Vice Chairman Chang Sae-wook expected to take over the leadership tentatively in making major business decisions. Chang, a younger brother of the chairman, had led Union Steel Co., an affiliate of Dongkuk Steel, until he was promoted to the vice chairman post in January when it merged with the steelmaking giant.Observers said that the leadership vacancy might not result in serious business disruption, considering the younger brother's management experience. Some still raised worries that Dongkuk Steel might face a bumpy road in corporate restructuring, which has been spearheaded by the chairman. Also, his arrest could hurt its credit ratings and eventually make it tougher to secure money needed to operate the company.Since 2012, Dongkuk Steel has suffered setbacks in its business, hit by an industry-wide slump. In June last year, the steelmaker agreed with its main creditor, Korea Development Bank, to enhance its financial health and launched a large-scale corporate restructuring drive that included an asset sale.Last month, Dongkuk Steel's board of directors approved a deal to sell its headquarters building located in downtown Seoul to Samsung Life Insurance Co. for about 420 billion won ($389 million).

The move came three days after the 66-year-old was grilled over his alleged influence-peddling for 19 hours from Thursday morning at Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office. Park was accused of accepting kickbacks from Doosan Group, which owns Chung-Ang University, in return for pressuring the Education Ministry to grant privileges to the school. He allegedly exerted undue influence on the ministry to allow the university to merge its separate campuses and acquire the Red Cross College of Nursing in 2011. The merger is reported to have saved the school tens of billions of won.Park served as president of Chung-Ang University from 2005 until he joined Lee’s administration in 2011.The former presidential secretary reportedly denied all charges during the investigation. Prosecutors also accused Park of receiving about 1.8 billion won ($1.6 million) between 2008 and 2012 from Doosan Group’s affiliates through Mootsori Foundation, where Park is a chief director, in return for giving favors to the company-owned university.Park allegedly transferred ownership of a building constructed with public funds to Mootsori in 2013 after he ended his term at Cheong Wa Dae, which prosecutors viewed as embezzlement.The investigation also found that Park violated the Private School Act by accepting financial donations for Chung-Ang University’s foundation from Woori Bank through an inappropriate bank account. Woori Bank allegedly offered the money as a token of gratitude after Chung-Ang University extended its contract with the bank in 2008 while Park was president of the university. Other accusations include that his wife illegally secured leases at a shopping mall operated by a unit of Doosan Group in 2011 and that Chung-Ang University altered its recruiting requirements to hire his daughter as a music professor last year. Park himself has served as an outside director at Doosan Engine since March 2014, receiving an annual income of 58 million won. A court will hold a hearing early next week to review the warrant application. Prosecutors plan to summon Park Yong-sung, a former chairman of Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction and of Chung-Ang University foundation, for further investigation.By Ock Hyun-ju  (laeticia.ock@heraldorp.com)","arrest warrant late monday ,and embezzlement the prosecutors ,monday for park bum ,an arrest warrant late ,2013 faced six charges","['Park', 'Lee Myung - bak']",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.07176524 0.37360248 0.09158528],Ock Hyun-ju,Social affairs,5,2015,"an arrest warrant late monday ,bribery and embezzlement the prosecutors ,investigation prosecutors also accused park ,arrest warrant late monday for ,arrest warrant late monday","['Park', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Doosan Group', 'Chung - Ang University', 'the Education Ministry', 'the Red Cross College', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Lee', 'Doosan Group ’s', 'Mootsori Foundation', 'Park', 'Mootsori', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Park', 'the Private School Act', 'Chung - Ang University ’s', 'Woori Bank', 'Woori Bank', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Doosan Group', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Doosan Engine', 'Park Yong - sung', 'Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction', 'Chung - Ang University', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",3,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.07176524 0.37360248 0.09158528]

Monday's attack in the Bosnian Serb town of Zvornik instantly raised tensions in Bosnia, still fragile two decades after the end a war between its Christian Orthodox Serbs, Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats that left 100,000 people dead and divided the country along ethnic lines.The suspect taken into custody is known to police and has been questioned in the past for possible Syria ties and recruitment efforts for the Islamic State group, Bosnian Serb police chief Dragan Lukac said. The gunman was identified as 24-year-old Nerdin Ibric. Police say the gunman shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which is the Arabic phrase for ""God is great,"" before opening fire in the town of Zvornik.Police didn't give the full name of the suspect arrested Tuesday, identifying him only by the initials A.S.H. in accordance with Bosnia's privacy laws.Lukac said the suspect had frequent contact with Ibric in the lead-up to Monday's attack. The police chief didn't immediately give details about the suspect's connection to the shooting, or whether he may have inspired the gunman to launch an attack by preying on his vulnerabilities about his father.Izeta Okanovic, a neighbor of the gunman in the nearby village of Kucic Kula, told The Associated Press that the man's father was taken away in 1992 and that he never came back. Local media reported that Serb police rounded up the father along with 750 Muslims from the town and killed them all.The town, located on the border with Serbia, was about 60-percent Muslim before the start of the 1992-95 war. Almost all Muslim residents were expelled from the town, and many were rounded up and killed as part of a Serb campaign to create a purely Serb area.The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement ended the vicious war and divided the country into two autonomous regions, one for Serbs and the other shared by Bosniaks and Croats.

He retweeted a claim by a local reporter that Koh and his children had a U.S. green card.Under the Korean law, an elected official loses his or her post if sentenced to a prison term or a fine of 1 million won or more. Cho has already said that he will appeal, meaning he is likely to retain his post for at least several months. But the ruling is expected to present major hurdles to his education policies. Seoul’s education chief Cho Hi-yeon speaks before signing a memorandum of understanding with Paris’ education office on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Cho said he would appeal to the Constitutional Court, saying the defamation clause cited against him infringes upon the freedom of expression during the election. The clause was challenged in 2008 by former lawmaker Lee Moo-young, but was ruled constitutional. In light of Friday’s ruling, an old debate about the direct election system reemerged. The Korea Federation of Teacher’s Associations, one of the most outspoken opponents of the system, claimed that the ruling demonstrates a well-known problem.“Since the system was implemented in 2007, two out of four elected Seoul education chiefs were forced to step down due to scandals involving their election campaigns, while a third might go down the same path,” said KFTA spokesman Kim Dong―seok. “This problem goes beyond personal blunders; it is derived from the structural problems of the direct election system.”Last year, the right-leaning teachers group filed a petition to the Constitutional Court to strike down the system. It claimed that using an election to choose an apolitical figure such as an education chief was contradictory, since running for election itself is a highly political action.Korea’s education superintendents ― entrusted with policies for primary and secondary education within a city or a province ― were originally appointed by the president. Amid calls for education autonomy, however, direct elections were adopted. But since then, everyone who has been elected as Seoul education chief has stood trial for election misconduct. Two of Cho’s predecessors ― Kwak No-hyun and Gong Jeong-taek ― were stripped of their positions.A KFTA survey of 238 teachers conducted shortly before last week’s ruling showed that 64 percent of the respondents thought the direct election system had a negative impact on Korean education. Some 53 percent said the biggest reason behind the reoccurring problems was the excessive competition among candidates. Saenuri Party Rep. Won Yoo-chul said the current system forces candidates to spend large amounts of money, making them more susceptible to corruption. “In the process of raising funds, (candidates) are easily involved in corruption. The system also allows wealthy people with political influence to have an edge over education experts,” he said.Won, who also heads the party’s policy committee, announced that the committee would discuss possible alternatives to supplement the current system at the Saenuri Party’s Supreme Council meeting Monday. Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung also told reporters that the Cho Hi-yeon situation prompted him to think that the current system was not working.Among the possible alternatives was a “running mate” system, which pairs a candidate for a mayor or a governor with a candidate for a superintendent post. One of the problems cited by opponents of the direct election system was discord between the head of a regional government and the education chief. Cho’s predecessor Moon Yong-rin, a conservative, often butted heads with liberal Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon over key education policies.Liberal candidates dominated the 2014 educational chief elections in 2014. The NPAD has criticized the ruling party‘s move to abolish the direct election as an attempt to overhaul the system as liberal candidates prevailed last year’s elections against the conservative rivals.The Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union also refuted the calls to overhaul the system, saying such attempts ran “against the wave of education autonomy that is slowly taking root as a result of nationwide consent.” “Such calls are ridiculous as suggesting we should overhaul direct election of presidents, after a problem occurred during a presidential election. … Are they suggesting that we return to the past when the Education Ministry dictated everything and used education to serve its political purposes?” the KTU said in its statement.Progressive education chiefs across the country also defended the current system.Jang Hwi-kook, the education chief for Gwangju and the head of the superintendents’ association, voiced his opposition about talks of abolishing the direct election system.“Such an approach deals with an educational issue with a political purpose in mind. It is likely to disrupt educational autonomy,” he said.Lee Jae-jung, the education superintendent of Gyeonggi Province, also criticized such debates and said the more effective way of preventing election-related crimes would be to thoroughly verify each candidate’s qualifications, suggesting that the authorities should implement a system to make this possible.Last year’s race for Seoul education chief turned into a dogfight after prominent candidates Cho, Koh and Moon Yong-rin began to hurl suspicions and criticisms at each other. Koh recently told local media that Cho’s accusation of him having a U.S. green card was the key reason he lost.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","education was fined million ,education superintendents after seoul ,friday for spreading false ,found guilty last week ,elections for education superintendents","['Seoul', 'Choi Hi - yeon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Koh Seung - duk']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37623358  0.34855381

Most of the 304 victims were high school students on a field trip..  Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken Sewol ferry, in a hearing on Tuesday, April 28, 2015. (Yonhap)A lower court had convicted the 70-year-old of gross negligence and dereliction of duty, giving him a 36-year prison term.   Lee ordered the passengers to remain where they were and failed to have them evacuate while he was among the first to be rescued, the court said.  ""The captain prematurely ended the students' lives and scarred their parents for life,"" said an emotional Judge Seo Kyeong-hwan, who fought back tears as he read the ruling. ""His actions tarnished South Korea's image and could not be justified under any circumstances.""  In the ruling, the court threw out the murder conviction of the ship's chief engineer, identified only by his surname Park, and commuted his prison term from 30 to 10 years.  The prison terms of 13 other crew members were reduced, and range from one and a half years to 12 years.  Less than half a dozen family members watched the proceedings on TV from a courthouse in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, where the students went to school.  One of them, who lost her only child, said the sentences delivered to the crewmen were too light.  ""All of them are responsible for abandoning the children, so they should be given heavier sentences,"" she said.  South Korea announced last week plans to salvage the ferry which remains at the bottom of the sea along with nine missing bodies.  The retrieval is expected to begin in September and take up to one and a half years.  The government is forecast to spend up to 150 billion won in the process, although there may be added costs down the road.

Cho is appealing to the Supreme Court. If the nation’s highest court upholds Seoul District Court’s decision, he will lose his post and be asked to return some 3 billion won in campaign funds. Seoul education chief Cho Hi-yeon. (Yonhap)The Supreme Court’s decision is expected to be announced in one year. In the meantime, Cho’s major projects as Seoul education chief, including the controversial plan to reduce the number of elite high schools in Seoul, may be affected by his weakened position and the court’s ruling. The district court concluded that Cho spread false claims that Koh was a permanent resident of the United States and that he was using his resident status to educate his two children overseas. During the campaign, Koh, a lawyer-turned-politician, publicly explained he did not hold permanent residency in the U.S., and his children were U.S. citizens by birth. After Koh’s explanation was proven to be valid, Cho continued to accuse Koh with the allegations during his campaign, the court said.Cho, a former sociology professor and the only liberal candidate, won an unexpected victory in the Seoul education chief election last year, beating two conservative frontrunners, including Koh. His key pledges included increasing the number of public, ordinary high schools, while reducing the number of private elite schools to promote equality in education. He also pledged to increase the number of public kindergartens to serve children of unprivileged households. Cho is not the first education chief of Seoul to be found guilty of breaching the nation’s election laws. In 2009, then-Seoul education chief Gong Jeong-taek was removed from his post after the Supreme Court fined him 1.5 million won for receiving bribes to bankroll his election campaign. In 2012, Kwak No-hyun was stripped of his post as Seoul’s top educator after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction on charges of giving bribes to Park Myoung-gee, a rival liberal candidate, in return for his withdrawal from the 2010 election for the job.

President Park Geun-hye is expected to accept his resignation soon after her return home from a four-nation South American tour early next week.

The two, however, have been suspected of trying to hide evidence that may reveal the underhanded dealings. A huge portion of computer files at Keangnam headquarters was missing, and closed-circuit televisions had been turned off, apparently to hide any trace of the evidence destruction.Prosecutors suspect the evidence tampering had been ordered by the late chairman.Sung was under investigation for embezzlement when he committed suicide. He hanged himself on April 9 just hours before a court hearing that would have determined the legality of his arrest.A day before his death, he organized a press conference to refute the allegations and claimed he had been victimized.

Saenuri Party lawmakers have opposed the proposal and have expressed holding the hearing after the polls, apparently worried the scandal could adversely influence voter sentiments.The Sung scandal began on April 9, when the businessman claimed in an interview with a local daily to have given illegal campaign funds to officials with close ties to Park, hours before police found him dead in an apparent suicide in the woods of northern Seoul.Prosecutors had been probing Sung, the ex-chief of Keangnam Enterprises, for allegedly swindling government subsidies. He had denied the allegations and called the investigations against him a witch-hunt sponsored by corrupt Park officials such as Lee.Investigations into Sung’s claims intensified in the early hours Wednesday when prosecutors detained Park Joon-ho, a former top Sung aide, for allegedly tampering with evidence. Park had tried to erase evidence backing Sung’s graft allegations, authorities said. They also suspect Park could be withholding information on how and when Sung had allegedly given illegal campaign funds to the accused officials of Park.Prosecutors also raided the home and car of Sung’s first son in search of evidence supporting the claims. Authorities also obtained the original suicide note Sung had left at his home, hours before law enforcement found him dead.The Saenuri Party, meanwhile, criticized the opposition’s alleged links to Sung during the Roh Moo-hyun administration.

Deceased businessman Sung Woan-jong ― who died in an apparent suicide on April 9 amid a corruption probe ― suspected that Lee initiated the investigation that targeted him, and told local media shortly before his death that he had given illegitimate money to Lee and seven other prominent politicians.As the nation’s incumbent prime minster, Lee was the main point of attack in a hailstorm of criticism from the public and opposition following revelations about the graft scandal. Even the ruling Saenuri Party determined Monday that Lee should resign after a myriad of evidence disproved his claims of not having close relations with Sung.Lee Wan-koo. (Yonhap)“A commander in a ‘war against corruption’ fell in battle due to his own corruption, a misfortunate incident,” said Rep. Jung Chung-rae of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy. The “war against corruption” refers to a slogan the premier was planning to use for the anti-corruption campaign, before scrapping the name just minutes before announcing the plan. While it was widely expected that Lee would eventually quit, his abrupt announcement in the middle of the night surprised even some at the prime minister’s office. “We’re just as shocked as rest of the country. There’s nothing we can really say at this moment,” an official from the office said.It marks the fourth time Park’s pick for her second-in-command has been forced to quit due to a scandal; three premier-designates were denied the job, while Lee was forced to step down after only 63 days in office. Lee will retain his position as a ruling party lawmaker.If Lee’s resignation is accepted by President Park, he would have served as prime minister for the shortest period in history, two days shorter than the 65 days that 1960s politician Heo Jeong served in the post. But since Park is expected to accept his resignation after returning from her Latin America tour next week, Lee’s tenure is likely to be slightly longer than Heo on paper. In reality, Lee’s days as the nation’s premier is effectively over. He did not show up at Tuesdays’ Cabinet meeting ― which was to be presided over by him in Park’s absence ― and did not leave his Seoul residence as of Tuesday afternoon. The Prime Minister’s office was quiet regarding Lee’s remaining schedule for the week, but some officials said it is likely that it will be canceled.Lee’s resignation concludes a short but tumultuous tenure as the premier. When Park appointed the 64-year-old lawmaker in January, the initial reaction from rival parties was relatively favorable. It was considered a good sign, considering the past nomination fiasco that saw two consecutive premier candidates fall due to scandal.But Lee was soon embroiled in a series of scandals, namely suspicion about him and his son dodging mandatary military duties, illegal real estate dealings and threatening reporters. The National Assembly eventually approved Lee, albeit by a slight margin in the lawmaker’s vote. Lee’s unusually short term followed Kim Hwang-sik and Chung Hong-won, two of the longest-reigning prime ministers since 1987, when the direct presidential election was introduced. Only three ― including Kim ― stayed in office longer than Chung. Chung offered to step down after last April’s ferry disaster ― which left more than 300 dead or missing ― but stayed in office until Lee took over, as other premier-designates were thwarted by scandals.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","march 12 deceased businessman ,in recent graft scandal ,corruption on march 12 ,recent graft scandal ,recent graft scandal lee","['Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Wan - koo', 'Lee', 'Sung Woan - jong']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37720439  0.2310202

Swimmer Park Tae-hwan's doctor, accused of professional negligence, is seen leaving the court after the first hearing of her trial. (Yonhap)The doctor of the Olympic swimming champ, identified only by her surname Kim, had given him an injection of a drug called Nebido.Prosecutors accused the female doctor of professional negligence for failing to disclose the risks and ingredients of the injection.She is also charged with violating the medical code and causing bodily harm.She pleaded not guilty to all of the charges at the first hearing of her trial, insisting Park had agreed that it was his responsibility to confirm whether the injection had something to do with doping. The agreement was made as she is an anti-ageing and health care doctor who is not a doping expert.They met through a shared acquaintance, and Kim has treated Park free of charge ""out of compassion,"" according to her lawyer, Moon Jeong-il.""Kim has no professional knowledge in sports and had never treated an athlete before,"" Moon told the judge at a courtroom in the Seoul Central District Court. ""That's why she explicitly asked Park to be the one making the call in October 2013.""The reason she prescribed Nebido was because Park's testosterone level was lower than average, he said.Besides, it was ""totally normal"" to experience some pain after an injection, he said, refuting the claim of bodily harm.Park is the only South Korean to date to hold an Olympic swimming title.He has been suspended from the sport starting retroactively from Sept. 3, the day that FINA, the international swimming federation, collected his samples.FINA also stripped him of six medals he had captured at the Incheon Asian Games, when all swimming races were held at an arena bearing Park's name. Three of those medals came in relays, and Park's teammates in those races will lose their medals because of Park's suspension.The suspension ends in March 2016, which theoretically allows him time to compete at the Summer Olympics in August of that year.The outcome of this trial won't affect WADA's punitive measure, as Article 10 of the World Anti-Doping Code states that athletes ""are responsible for their choice of medical personnel and for advising medical personnel that they cannot be given any prohibited substance.""Park apologized for letting down his fans last month.""I'd like to apologize to the people for causing so much trouble with this unacceptable incident,"" Park said, fighting back tears, at a press conference.Park said the doctor had assured him the drug would be clean, but acknowledged he was responsible for the mistake.Park will testify at the next hearing set for June 4. (Yonhap)","tae hwan doctor tuesday ,negligence swimmer park tae ,guilty to negligence swimmer ,tuesday pleaded not guilty ,hwan doctor tuesday pleaded","[""Swimmer Park Tae - hwan 's"", 'the World Anti - doping Agency', ""Swimmer Park Tae - hwan 's""]",7,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.20361905 0.46129239 0.58266276],KH디지털2,Social affairs,4,2015,"the olympic swimming champ ,park tae hwan doctor tuesday ,doping agency in october swimmer ,doctor of the olympic swimming ,doctor tuesday pleaded not guilty","[""Swimmer Park Tae - hwan 's"", 'the World Anti - doping Agency', ""Swimmer Park Tae - hwan 's"", 'Kim', 'Park', 'Kim', 'Park', 'Moon Jeong - il', 'Moon', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Park', 'Park', 'south korean', 'FINA', 'FINA', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'WADA']",1,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.20361905 0.46129239 0.58266276]

The report revealed the teenager had run away from home after falling victim to sexual violence at 12 years old. Her alcoholic father, a single parent, had been physically abusive. She soon became involved in juvenile crime, habitually intoxicated with alcohol, and was eventually forced by other runaway teens to sell herself for money.The late teen was just one of some 200,000 teenagers who are estimated to run away from home every year, with the number growing.Statistics show that illegal sex trade involving teenagers is rising, in conjunction with the rising number of runaways, as the country struggles to clamp down on the sex industry. CCTV footage shows a murder suspect (left) and his teenage victim entering a motel in Seoul last month. The two reportedly met via a mobile messaging application for prostitution at the property, where the victim was later found dead. (Yonhap)Korean law currently stipulates that both purchasing and selling sex carries a one-year penalty in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won ($2,767). Buying sex from the underage carry a heavier penalty of one year and 10 months in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won ($46,310). Despite the penalties, the number of sex trade cases that involve teenagers more than doubled from 528 in 2010 to 1,290 in 2014, while the total number of sex trade cases dropped ― from 9,583 to 8,977 ― in the same time period, according to data released by the National Police Agency. The number of teens who ran away from home also increased between 2009 and 2012, from 15,114 to 21,813. The government predicts that figure would reach 200,000 if it counted those who ran away from home but were not reported by their parents or guardians. As of 2013, 60 percent of teens who were forced into prostitution were runaway teens. New Politics Alliance for Democracy Rep. Nam In-soon said one of the reasons behind the increasing number of teens involved in the sex trade has to do with the government’s poor regulation of the Internet and smartphone use. As of 2010, about 80 percent of the sex trade with teenagers was pre-arranged online, mostly using instant messaging applications on smartphones, which makes it harder for authorities to crack down on. According to Nam’s office, 717 mobile applications were involved in the illegal sex trade in 2013. “Among 182 of the apps involved in the sex trade, 65 percent did not require their users to register their age, and 96 percent were free applications for anyone to use,” she said in a statement.Lax regulations against managers of accommodation widely used for illegal sex trade was also considered a factor.In March, the murder of a middle school girl by a man in his 30s at a motel room in Seoul received heated news coverage. The victim reportedly met the suspect for prostitution via a mobile messaging application.Following the arrest of the suspect, a group of female lawyers filed a request to police to investigate the owner of the motel. “It is illegal for motel owners to let teenagers stay in their property without checking their ID,” said Kim Bo-ram, from the Korean Women Lawyers Association. “But 65 percent of sex trade cases involving teenagers take place in motels, according to data released by the Gender Equality Ministry.”Local studies have shown that female teens are more likely to run away from home and turn to sex work than their male counterparts. In 2010, 13,462 female teens ran away from home, compared to 8,825 male teenagers, according to the National Police Agency data. Among the 175 female runaway teens surveyed by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2012, 41 percent said they had been sexually abused at least once in their lives, while 55.3 percent said they were involved in the illegal sex industry.“The studies show that sexual violence and underage prostitution are linked to each other,” said Kim Nan-hee, a Gwangju-based activist for youth rights. “This tells us that we need to look at the two issues together, rather than simply trying to combat sex trades.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","her alcoholic father single ,an illegal sex worker ,home after falling victim ,old her alcoholic father ,her alcoholic father",[],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73826504  0.22219335

(K-Sure) for its nonexistent exports.An investigation by the prosecution has found the false reports, along with the trade insurance from K-Sure, allowed the company to borrow some 3.4 trillion won ($3.12 billion) over a seven-year period starting in 2007.The company was declared bankrupt late last year with about 550 billion won in outstanding loans from 10 local lenders.To prevent any company from securing trade insurance or bank loans based on false or inflated trade reports, the trade insurance company will be required to check and verify the authenticity of any export deal, through on-site inspections if necessary, when the deal requires more than $1 million in insurance, according to the Ministry of Trade, Insurance and Energy.K-Sure will also be required to introduce an assessment program that can expose accounting fraud.The company is already subject to annual audits by the ministry and the national board of audit and inspection, but it will freshly be subject to inspections by the Financial Supervisory Service, which can better check the financial soundness of trade insurance extended by the company, ministry officials said.They said this may also help expose possible corruption by company officials by checking the validity of trade insurance.The prosecution investigation has concluded that a number of former K-Sure officials, as well as tax investigators, may have received financial kickbacks from Moneual in exchange for letting the company dodge any scrutiny.

Testimonies that Lee was close to the late Sung Woan-jong also intensified suspicion against the prime minister.Sung, former head of construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, allegedly gave Lee 30 million won ($27,000) in the parliamentary by-election in April 2013, according to an interview with the Kyunghyang Shinmun, a local newspaper, hours before police found him dead last Thursday in an apparent suicide. Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo is surrounded by reporters at the government complex in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)“I went to (Lee’s) campaign office (in the 2013 April by-elections) and handed the money over in person,” Sung was quoted as saying.On Tuesday, Lee repeatedly denied any illegal ties to Sung at an interpellation session in the National Assembly.“You all know that hundreds of people stop by our campaign offices during elections,” Lee said. “I do not remember each and every visitor.”As speculation escalated following the note, as well as phone records showing Lee calling a mutual acquaintance with Sung up to 15 times on the day after Sung was found dead, Lee said, “Sung and I were not as close as many of you think.”The acquaintance reportedly claimed Sung had expressed disappointment over Lee’s refusal to stop prosecutorial probes on Sung’s company, and that Lee repeatedly asked to know what Sung had said about him.Prosecutors had accused Sung of swindling government subsidies by overstating his company’s profits. But Sung claimed President Park Geun-hye’s administration was on a witch hunt against his company to shore up declining political support in the days before his death.Prosecutors declared an end to investigations on Sung after his death. But officials found a note on Sung after he died naming eight officials he had allegedly given kickbacks to, including former presidential aides, and P.M. Lee, among others.Lee’s comments so far appear to be placing him in a deeper quagmire.On Monday, Lee said he had suffered from cancer in 2012, preventing him from assisting President Park’s campaign rallies. But past photos showed Lee standing next to or around Park during rallies at Daejeon and Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.Lee’s past record of making false statements also seems to be haunting him.In February during his confirmation hearing opposition lawmakers had accused Lee of intimidating journalists at a private luncheon. Lee claimed he did not remember the incident and continued to deny related accusations until opposition lawmakers publicized a tape recording of him making threats against reporters, saying he could get them fired using his ties to media company executives.“(The sacked reporters) won’t know what hit them,” Lee said in the recording.

He returned to South Korea in early April after wrapping up his tenure in Libya.His successor, Amb. Kim Young-chae, arrived in Libya on Monday, ministry officials said.They apologized for what they called a ""mistake"" largely attributable to a gap between the date of Lee's departure and that of Kim's inauguration.""It seems that we made a mistake since we didn't have a clear understanding of the situation,"" a senior ministry official said.He stressed that the ministry did not make the incorrect statement intentionally.Islamic militants opened fire on the guard post of the embassy, killing two local security guards and wounding another.

Trading of Keangnam shares will be terminated on Wednesday as the company has failed to deal with mounting debt, according to the Korea Exchange.Keangnam leaves the local stock exchange 42 years after becoming the nation's first construction company to go public. The main bourse operator has been in the process of delisting the builder after creditors last month rejected its request for additional financial support and its attempts to go into court receivership fell through. The builder had been struggling in the red in recent years amid a prolonged slump in the local housing market, suffering annual losses of 182.7 billion won and 310.9 billion won in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Last week, its former chairman, Sung Wan-jong, committed suicide in the midst of a widening probe into his company and other state firms involved in the overseas development projects pushed during the former Lee Myung-bak administration. During Lee's years in office from 2008 to 2013, local companieslaunched expansive business projects to secure energy resources.Sung, who had served as a ruling lawmaker between 2012 and 2014, left behind a list of politicians, including close aides to President Park Geun-hye, whom he claimed to have given up to several million dollars.

Hong Joon-pyo, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, Saenuri lawmaker Rep. Hong Moon-jong and Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo ― in 2011-2012 by Sung as suspected. Among the four, the first to be investigated will be Gov. Hong, the prosecution said. The four are suspected of having received the money from Sung to spend in the ruling party’s leadership race in 2011 and the 2012 presidential election campaign. Rep. Hong, in particular, managed President Park’s election campaign in 2012.Sung, the former head of local builder Keangnam Enterprises, was found dead Thursday just hours before a court was to issue an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal related to a resource development project carried out by the Lee Myung-bak administration.“We will make every effort to thoroughly investigate the case that is the subject of the nation’s widespread suspicion,” Moon told reporters Monday.The team received investigation data gathered by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office that had been probing allegations of Keangnam’s irregularities, including Sung’s phone logs, bank accounts, and documents seized during the search of the company. The team will also check the call records of two mobile phones that Sung used until he committed suicide.Investigation will also focus on the whereabouts of 3.2 billion won in cash that had been withdrawn from Keangnam’s business account on 370 occasions between 2007 and 2014.In his suicide note, Sung listed names of eight key politicians, including the four, along with the money amounts. In the note, Gov. Hong was alleged to have received 100 million won, Yoo 300 million won, and Rep. Hong and Suh 200 million won each.Sung’s memo also included names of President Park’s former chiefs of staff Kim Ki-choon and Huh Tae-yeol, along with Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo.Local daily Kyunghyang Shinmun last week revealed a voice recording of Sung’s interview in which he argued he handed $100,000 won and 700 million won to Kim and Huh, respectively.Both of Park’s former chiefs of staff and governor Hong on Monday vowed to cooperate with the prosecution probe, while denying the allegations. “If Sung were alive, I would confront him and let the public know the truth,” Park’s former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon said in an interview with a local radio station on Monday. He said all the claims were “fictional.”“But since that is not an option, I feel rather perplexed.”By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","committed suicide last thursday ,funds prosecutors on monday ,businessman to four political ,deceased businessman to four ,suicide last thursday",['Sung Woan - jong'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40193182  0.02746819

Bae scored two birdies and an eagle, along with three bogeys, and finished tied for 33rd with four others.Noh Seung-yul, in his first Masters, finished one worse than Bae at one-over 289. His final round was an even more of a roller coaster, with six birdies, four bogeys and one triple bogey for a 73. He ended in an eight-way tie for 38th.Bae finished the 2012 tournament at four-over 292 and missed the cut last year. He also called a penalty on himself on the par-4 seventh when the ball slightly moved on the green as he was getting ready to take his putt. Assessed a penalty stroke, Bae left the hole with a bogey.Bae somewhat salvaged his day with an eagle on the par-4 14th.With 165 yards to the pin, Bae struck an eight iron that landed on the back of the green and spun into the cub for his fifth career eagle at Augusta National. Bae said afterward this year's Masters was a major learning experience.""I prepared hard, but I now realize I have to work even harder,"" he said. ""I didn't putt as well as I wanted to on all four days.""Noh's day could have been better if not for the triple bogey on the par-5 13th.

The team will be headed by Daejeon’s chief prosecutor Moon Moo-il under the supervision of chief prosecutor Kim, they added. The team will officially begin the probe on Monday.  Saenuri Party leader Kim Moo-sungThe move came shortly after Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung urged a “swift and thorough” investigation into Sung’s memo implicating Park’s closest aides in the bribery scandals.“The ideal thing right now is for the prosecutors to conduct a swift investigation into the matter to discover the truth, and they should leave no stone unturned,” Kim said in an emergency press conference at the party’s headquarters. “We do not have the slightest intention to protect (the accused) from the probe.”Sung, the former head of Keangnam Enterprises, was found dead Thursday in an apparent suicide, just hours before a local court was to issue an arrest warrant for embezzlement and his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal related to a resources development project by the previous Lee Myung-bak administration. He was carrying a memo that had the names of eight political heavyweights, including Park’s former chiefs of staff Kim Ki-choon and Huh Tae-yeol, along with the incumbent prime minister and Saenuri lawmaker Lee Wan-koo. On Friday, the local daily Kyunghyang Shinmun revealed a recording of Sung’s interview in which he claimed that he handed $100,000 and 700 million won ($639,970) to Kim and Huh, respectively, in line with the content of the memo. Later in the day, the daily disclosed another recording of Sung saying he handed Saenuri Rep. Hong Moon-jong, who managed President Park’s election campaign, 200 million won to be used during the campaign.“The memo written by the deceased is casting doubts upon entire political circles, hindering the entire government affairs,” said Saenuri chief Kim. “Any attempts to cover up irregularities can only spark further suspicion. The Saenuri Party will make sure no outside influence will sway the prosecution’s investigation.”He said he did not discuss the content of the press conference with the president, explaining such consultation would be inappropriate since her aides’ names are included in what has been dubbed the “Sung Woan-jong list.” Kim also revealed that Sung called him just days before his death to plead innocence. But the ruling party leader ― whose name was not included in Sung’s list ― also said he did not recognize the phone number of Sung, the businessman who was a Saenuri lawmaker until 2014. All eight politicians whose names were on Sung’s list had claimed they did not have a close relationship with the deceased and denied ever receiving money. Rep. Hong held a press conference Saturday and vowed to retire from politics if he “had received even a penny” from Sung.Despite the ruling party feverishly attempting put distance between Sung and themselves, the revelation is likely to affect the upcoming by-election slated for April 29. Kim admitted there is “no question” that the incident spells bad news for the ruling party.Moon Jae-in, the leader of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy, denounced the incident as an “unprecedented corruption case in which the president’s aides have been revealed to have received huge bribes.”“The people whose names appeared on the list must lay down their positions and ranks and cooperate willingly with the investigation,” he said, adding that the probe is likely to be hindered as the people accused of corruption are all high-ranking officials. The bribery scandal is expected to be high on the agenda of the four-day interpellation session that will open in the National Assembly tomorrow, along with government-proposed pension reform, possible deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, and salvaging the sunken Sewol ferry.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","bribery list the prosecution ,10 person special investigation ,recently deceased businessman sung ,opens probe into bribery ,probe into bribery list","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Jin - tae']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14366578  0.03364809

Also on the list are Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo and Hong Moon-jong, a ruling party lawmaker who served as the president's campaign manager in 2012.  Sung claimed that he gave some 200 million won ($182,000) in cash to Hong, believing that the money would be used for Park's election campaign, according to local daily Kyunghyang Shinmun's interview with the businessman that was made right before the suicide.  The scandal is feared to deal another blow to Park, who managed to muddle through a leadership crisis following the recent controversial leak of sensitive presidential documents, analysts say.  Sung, a former lawmaker, was a major target of the ongoing probe into the country's overseas resources development projects.  He is suspected of taking 80 billion won in government loans by exaggerating the amount of profit his company was expected to make on an investment in an oil exploration project in Russia. He allegedly used part of the funds to create slush funds.  ""The corruption scandal should not hamper the current investigation into the overseas energy projects,"" Kim added.  The head of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy urged those in question to resign from their posts and cooperate with the prosecutors' probe.  ""Those on the list should cooperate with the investigation,"" said Moon Jae-in, head of the NPAD. ""Prosecutors should also conduct a prompt probe into the case and disclose the truth without leaving any doubt.""  The NPAD also called for the chief of the ruling party to clarify the sources of Park's 2012 presidential election campaign funds.  ""For prosecutors' thorough probe, Kim should first dispel the suspicion surrounding Park's election funds,"" said Rep.

""If not, the ruling party's move to resolve this scandal is just a political gambit.""  Depending on the progress of the prosecution probe, the NPAD could push to appoint an independent counsel to look into the case, he added.  The scandal also erupted ahead of a by-election slated for April 29 that could serve as a yardstick to gauge public confidence in the Park administration in the middle of its five-year term.

The list, apparently written by the late Sung Woan-jong, includes two former chief presidential secretaries and the incumbent prime minister.Local daily The Kyunghyang Shinmun reported earlier Friday that Sung, former chief of a construction company facing an irregularities probe, claimed to have given money to two of President Park Geun-hye’s former chiefs of staff in a telephone interview just hours before his apparent suicide. Police found Sung dead on a mountain in Seoul on Thursday.According to the newspaper, Sung said he gave about $100,000 to Kim Ki-choon in 2006 and 700 million won ($640,000) to Huh Tae-yeol in 2007, when Park unsuccessfully ran in the Grand National Party’s presidential primary. The GNP is the forerunner of the governing Saenuri Party. Former Cheong Wa Dae Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon on a trip to Belgium in 2006. The late Sung Woan-jong accused Kim of receiving $100,000 from him just before this trip. Police found Sung dead Thursday in an apparent suicide. Prosecutors had been probing Sung for allegedly swindling government funds. (Yonhap)Kim served as chief of staff from 2013 to early this year, while Huh was Park’s first chief presidential secretary in 2013.They denied the claims.“Although I express my deepest regret over (Sung’s) death, the accusation is an absurd lie that has no grounds whatsoever,” Kim said in a statement released through Cheong Wa Dae.Huh also said that “such money trade is unimaginable” as then-candidate Park stressed the need for a “clean primary.”In a note found with his body, Sung also listed Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, Incheon Mayor Yoo Jeong-bok, South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo, current Presidential Chief of Staff Lee Byung-kee and “the mayor of Busan.”Prosecutors are examining the handwriting to ensure Sung wrote the note.Prime Minister Lee said he had no connection to Sung, while incumbent Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo called the allegation “baseless.”The Saenuri Party went into an uproar after the prosecutors disclosed the list, with the party leadership planning an emergency meeting but canceling at the last minute.“It is our position that the truth must be clarified first. ... . It is difficult to make any official statement when no facts have been clarified,” party spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo said.The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy called the accusations proof of “the Park administration’s largest political scandal.”While some demanded a special probe into the new allegations, others took a more cautious approach. They cited the difficulty in unraveling the truth as Sung was dead.Sung’s claims are nonetheless expected to hinder the Park administration’s recent anticorruption drive as its top officials are linked to the allegations. The accusations are also expected to affect the by-elections this month as many of the accused are members of the Saenuri Party.Prosecutors have been probing firms linked to influence-peddling allegations during the administration of Park’s predecessor, Lee Myung-bak. Prosecutors suspected Lee officials of giving firms favorable financial treatment, including Sung’s company Keangnam Enterprises.Prosecutors had planned to detain Sung on the day of his death, pending a court’s approval. Sung had denied his charges.In his Thursday interview published on The Kyunghyang Shinmun’s website at noon Friday, Sung claimed he had given the money in good faith to Kim and Huh.“I helped Park’s campaign team a lot in 2007,” he said.“Those funds were given with an implicit trust, you know, that we would be helping each other out,” Sung added. Sung’s allegations could have some impact on the by-elections later this month depending on how the investigations unfold, experts said.“The names are big enough to have some impact,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, professor at Hanshin University, noting that the incumbent prime minister and former presidential chiefs of staff were among those accused of receiving money.“But we will have to wait for the dust to settle to see how big the impact will be on the elections.”Yang Seung-ham of Yonsei University said many aspects of Sung’s accusations remained murky, as they also need to figure out how the money was spent, and if they were actually given to the aides.“The list could damage the credentials of the Saenuri Party candidates in the elections … but we’re going to have to wait and see,” Yang added.By Jeong Hunny hj257@heraldcorp.com)","funds from deceased businessman ,money prosecutors on friday ,deceased businessman said park ,aides took money prosecutors ,prosecutors on friday revealed","['Sung Woan - jong', 'Sung']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4470239   0.48343605

""What they had done is appalling behavior beyond imagination.""    In October, the lower court dismissed murder charges sought by the prosecution, while handing down more severe rulings of 45 years in jail at maximum. The prosecution had demanded capital punishment for some of the accused for murder.  The case, which was brought to light belatedly in a media report, is among a series of incidents that have laid bare the chronic problem of bullying in the barracks and a rigid military culture.   In June last year, an Army sergeant who had been bullied by his comrades went on a shooting spree at a border outpost on the east coast, killing five soldiers and wounding seven others.  All able-bodied South Korean men are subject to compulsory military service for about two years in a country facing North Korea across the heavily fortified border.

In the fall of 2013, the Education Ministry ordered all eight local publishers to revise descriptions that they deemed were inaccurate or ideologically biased. These descriptions mainly concerned North Korea’s political philosophy of “juche,” Pyongyang’s sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan, the former South Korean president Park Chung-hee and the 1950-53 Korean War.But the authors of seven publishers claimed the government move was an attempt to cover up flaws in a textbook by Kyohak Publishing Co., which they said was subpar in quality and ideologically-biased toward conservatives.They said the textbook contained favorable descriptions about Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of Korea and the authoritarian government of former president Park, who is the father of President Park Geun-hye.The authors of six textbooks filed a lawsuit against the ministry, arguing that it had forced a particular historical viewpoint on them.“Today’s ruling proved that textbooks are not about teaching the correct historical perception to students, but in fact can be revised at any time to ingratiate the government administration,” Han Chul-ho, a history professor at Dongguk University and one of the authors who filed the lawsuit, told local media after Thursday’s ruling.The controversy surrounding the textbooks had carried over to 2014, when left-leaning civic groups, opposition lawmakers and some parents protested against schools choosing the controversial Kyohak books. Surviving “comfort women” ― victims of Japan’s sexual slavery during World War II ― even sought an injunction to ban the books.In the aftermath, the debate was rekindled over potentially reinstating a state-authored history textbook system for high schools. The system was established during the elder Park’s administration in the 1970s and has been gradually dismantled since 2002.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","seoul court ruled thursday ,school korean history textbooks ,alter history textbooks seoul ,history textbooks the revision ,history textbooks seoul court","['Seoul', 'korean', 'the Seoul Administrative Court']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50807393  0.24850249

The 63-year-old former lawmaker is also believed to have created a slush fund of up to 15 million won from this amount.Investigators have called in Sung’s wife and Keangnam’s vice president surnamed Han on Wednesday for questioning over their involvement. Prosecutors have reportedly acquired evidence that high-ranking officials at Keangnam created the slush funds via its associated companies. Sung is to arrive at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at 10 a.m., and prosecutors will decide whether to request a preliminary arrest warrant after the questioning. The prosecution has been zeroing in on a series of corruption allegations surrounding Lee administration’s so-called “energy diplomacy,” a now-defunct multibillion dollar project that sought to develop overseas energy resources. Steelmakers POSCO and Dongkuk Steel, along with state-run National Oil Corp., are also facing an investigation.Rival parties at the parliamentary committee for the overseas projects have locked horns over whether they should request the former president to attend the hearing.

But she was acquitted of obstructing a government probe into the incident.Both the prosecutors and her attorneys have filed for an appeal.A noticeably enfeebled Cho appeared at the first appellate hearing, which took place in a packed Seoul High Court room.She pleaded guilty to the latter two charges but said she wasn't guilty of changing the route of the flight.""Cho acknowledges her act of violence and asks for the victims' forgiveness,"" her attorney said. ""But it's not fair to say she obstructed aviation safety or changed the route of the flight.""Cho's lawyers said the taxiway shouldn't be considered part of the ""route of a flight,"" which is not clearly defined in the aviation law.Meanwhile, prosecutors called for a heavier punishment for Cho, who they said abused her authority as the executive member of South Korea's largest full-service carrier.""It's questionable whether she actually feels sorry,"" a prosecutor told the judges. Cho had initially said she ordered the flight back to the gate because she was ""doing her job as the vice president.""In a green prison uniform and wearing black horn-rimmed glasses, Cho asked for leniency.""I ask for the victims' forgiveness,"" she said in a barely audible voice. ""I am deeply sorry for what I did.""Her attorneys said she has suffered emotionally during her three months in a detention center.

But they said their probe would continue to verify the allegations that Kim had violated the law by possessing various publications carrying “enemy-benefiting” contents. Kim Ki-jong. (Yonhap)The 55-year-old assailant attacked Lippert with a paring knife during a forum in downtown Seoul on March 5. At the scene, Kim said that he carried out the attack to stop the South Korea-U.S. military drills that were strongly opposed by North Korea.The attack left an 11-cm wound on Lippert’s face and another injury on his left arm. The ambassador immediately received surgery and is currently recovering.The prosecution filed an attempted murder charge as the depth of the wounds and the paring knife indicated that Kim had premediated the attack with an intention of killing the top U.S. envoy. But Kim has claimed that he did not mean to murder Lippert.The investigators questioned two surgeons who conducted the surgery on Lippert to analyze the wounds and prove that Kim attempted to murder him with the knife.As for the possibility of complicity, the prosecution said Kim appears to have carried out the attack alone.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Lippert wrote his first blog post since he left the hospital on March 10.

He is likely to face a summons from the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office in the coming weeks.While the prosecutors initially targeted the firm’s alleged irregularities, involving embezzlement, during its overseas investments under the Lee administration-led resources development projects, its large amount of sour loans could lead investigators to summon some FSS officials and bank executives.The company, which filed for court receivership last week, is also suspected of rigging financial statements to get higher credit ratings.The prosecution is investigating alleged irregularities by a consortium of Korean companies, including Keangnam, formed to invest 300 billion won in an oil field development project on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia between 2005 and 2009. The consortium withdrew from the project in 2010.Keangnam’s involvement in a nickel development project in Africa is another probe target.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","examines suspect bank loans ,lobbying with banking officials ,prosecution examines suspect bank ,irregular lobbying with banking ,suspect bank loans to","['Keangnam Enterprises', 'the Board of Audit and Inspection']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0928266  -0.06276067

(Yonhap)Corruption allegations involving Park are being released file-after-file, as the prosecution tightens its investigations into former ranking officials of the Lee administration, as well as their ties with conglomerates such as POSCO.Park, who served for Chung-Ang University as president from 2005 to 2011, worked at Cheong Wa Dae from February 2011 to February 2013 as senior secretary for education and culture.Along with spreading suspicions of Park exerting influence in various personnel decisions at the school, prosecutors are also reportedly looking into the background of how his daughter was hired as a professor of an art college at the school at the age of 33 in September last year, Chosun Ilbo reported Monday.Insiders were quoted as saying that most faculty members spend around 10 years as part-time lecturers before securing a seat, and hence most professors are in their 40s.Park has also been suspected of engaging in illicit college admission practices, complying with several requests from social dignitaries for their sons and daughters’ entrance.Further, investigative authorities are also reportedly looking into any dubious transaction involving a training institute for gugak, Korean traditional music, during his term as the university head.In 2008 Park donated his land in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, to a gugak art performance association to establish a training center, backed by 900 million won in funds from the Yangpyeong-gun Office. He was working as the college head and the project could be regarded as a social contribution.But the ownership of the land was handed over to a foundation, held by Park, again in March 2013. Currently, Park and his oldest daughter was registered as directors of the foundation.The land, which stood at 9,000 won per square meter when he was donating it, is hovering at 150,000 won.The Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office is interrogating the former presidential aide while internally fine-tuning whether to seek an arrest warrant for him on a variety of corruption charges.Park, who graduated from the same university in 1976, majored in music composition.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","his daughter as professor ,widening investigation for irregularities ,aide former presidential secretary ,lee aide former presidential ,prosecutors widen probe into","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Park bum - hoon', 'Lee', 'the Education Ministry', 'Chung - Ang University ’s', 'Seoul']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35724252  0.24649997

A man in Gangwon province, whose information was withheld, was acquitted Saturday of adultery charges, court officials said. The man was sentenced to a six-month jail term with a stay of one year for cheating on his wife in 2013. “As the Constitutional Court ruled the adultery ban unconstitutional, the defendant’s charges are no longer a crime,” judges said in the retrial. Two other men in Daegu and Incheon, were also cleared of adultery charges in their retrials last week. The 39-year-old man in Daegu was sentenced to a two-year prison term with eight months of probation for cheating on his spouse in July 2013. He immediately sought a retrial after the controversial law was struck down.A 50-year-old man in Incheon was also cleared after facing an eight-month jail term with a stay of two years in 2012 for the same allegations.If acquitted in the retrial, all related criminal records are removed, legal officials said. The Constitutional Court abolished the anticheating law with a 7-2 decision Feb. 26, ruling that the 62-year-old ban violates individuals’ sexual rights and privacy. Under the law, adultery was a crime punishable by up to two years behind bars. Any third person involved in a love affair could also face criminal charges. The regulation was only applicable when a spouse filed a lawsuit.In the past, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In its 2008 ruling, the majority of the judges supported personal freedom but were one vote shy of ordering a change.The landmark ruling is expected to save thousands of people who were punished by the law. About 100,000 people were punished since the law was enacted in 1953. Of these, only around 3,000 have been eligible to seek retrials, the law authorities said. The court grants review requests only from those who were given a guilty verdict after Oct. 30, 2008, the date the last ruling in favor of the adultery ban was upheld.Those punished can also seek compensation from the government after getting acquitted in the retrial, they added.

In 2004, Chang was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended for four years, for providing security loans to his relatives and paying off personal debts using company funds. The chairman later received a special pardon from President Lee Myung-bak.In 2011, Chang underwent a special 8-month tax investigation by the National Tax Service, which ended with the chairman paying additional taxes without charges being pressed.The recent investigation is considered to be part of a widening probe into the former Lee Myung-bak administration, including a series of inspections into overseas resource development projects carried out during Lee’s term in office.On Friday, the prosecution began investigating former Chung-Ang University president Park Bum-hoon for allegedly granting special privileges to the university while working as a senior secretary to former president Lee from 2011 to 2013.The same day, prosecutors raided the home of former POSCO Engineering & Construction vice chairman Chung Dong-hwa. Chung is suspected of having created slush funds worth over 10 billion won at the steelmaker’s construction operation in Vietnam.Construction firm Keangnam Enterprises, state-run Korea National Oil Corp. and petrochemicals company SK Innovation are also facing similar charges of allegedly misusing government funds linked to the Lee administration’s state-financed projects.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","office on saturday raided ,embezzlement tax evasion prosecutors ,tax evasion the seoul ,saturday raided dongkuk steel ,raided dongkuk steel headquarters","['South Korea ’s', 'Dongkuk Steel Mill Co.', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Dongkuk Steel ’s', 'Seoul', 'Chang Sae - joo']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46769574  0.02880923

The former Chung-Ang University president, known to have been a key figure during the Lee administration, faces charges of allegedly pressuring the Education Ministry to grant administrative and financial privileges to the university while he was senior presidential secretary for education and culture from 2011-2013.Park is also suspected of having abused his authority at Cheong Wa Dae to push conglomerates to financially support the university’s scholarship foundation.Before holding his post, Park also worked as a member of Lee’s presidential campaign in 2007, as well as the head of the former president’s inaugural preparation committee in 2008.The prosecution is looking to question the former presidential official as a suspect and ask the court to issue an arrest warrant to take him into custody.The recent investigation is considered to be part of a widening probe into the former administration, including a series of inspections into overseas resource development projects carried out during Lee’s term in office.On Friday, prosecutors raided the home of former POSCO Engineering & Construction Vice Chairman Chung Dong-hwa, suspected of having created dubious slush funds worth over 10 billion won ($9 million) at the steelmaker’s construction operation in Vietnam.Construction firm Keangnam Enterprises and the state-run Korea National Oil Corp. are also facing similar charges of allegedly misusing state funds linked to the Lee administration’s state-financed projects.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","prosecutors office raided park ,presidential secretary probed prosecutors ,district prosecutors office raided ,university president park bum ,prosecutors office raided","['Chung - Ang University', 'Park Bum - hoon', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Park ’s', 'Chung - Ang University ’s', 'the Ministry of Educat']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19444506  0.49779785

FINA slapped Park, a four-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champ in freestyle, with an 18-month suspension, starting retroactively on Sept. 3, 2014, when FINA collected Park's urine samples.\The suspension is to end in March 2016, which theoretically gives Park time to prepare for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro five months later.However, a rule instituted by the Korean Olympic Committee last summer could prevent Park from entering his fourth Summer Games.The rule states that athletes who have received a drug-related suspension of any length are ineligible to represent the country for three years, starting at the end of the suspension. In Park's case, he'd be barred from the national team until March 2019.The rule has been in place for less than a year but it has fueled debate over a potential double punishment of athletes for the same crime.While critics of the rule say Park deserves a chance for redemption because of his contribution to the sport -- he's the first and only Olympic swimming medalist from South Korea -- others says he shouldn't receive any special treatment.Lee, who is also a vice president of the KOC, tiptoed around the issue on Wednesday.""There will be opportunities to discuss this rule,"" he said.""But first and foremost, Park Tae-hwan should apologize to the people that he's let down and plead for their forgiveness, and take time to reflect on himself.""Park arrived back home separately Tuesday night, and issued a brief apology through his agency, Team GMP.Lee said Park will soon have a chance to speak publicly about the issue.Park will be stripped of all medals earned on or after Sept. 3.Competing at an arena bearing his own name, Park won one silver and five bronze medals at last year's Incheon Asian Games, which took place after the samples were collected. Three of his bronze medals came in relay events, and Park's teammates in those races will also lose their medals with Park's suspension.

CCTV footage showing Seo being dragged by the ankle and physically abused by her husband rattled many while prompting more rumors over what was portrayed publicly as a rosy marriage. Some claimed both were at fault, while others blamed the wife for putting up with it for all these years.Just a year before, Kim Joo-ha, a prominent TV news anchor, filed for divorce, claiming she had been physically abused by her husband since 2004. It took her nine years to come forward. The agony behind Kim’s image as a successful woman seemed to unveil the uncomfortable reality here, where domestic violence is often still blamed on the victims, who therefore choose silence instead. When looking at statistics, Seo and Kim are just two of some estimated 3.7 million people who have been abused at home in South Korea as of 2009. According to government data, 15.3 percent of all South Korean women aged 65 or under had been abused by their spouses at least once as of 2013. The rate was more than five times higher than in other developed nations, such as Japan and the U.K. On top of that, more than 80 percent of all domestic abuse cases occurred in marriages. Almost 63 percent of them never report the violence, mostly because of fear and concern for their children. “Many abused women fear divorce for many reasons,” said a shelter worker who asked to remain anonymous. “Those who do not work fear that they may not be able to support their children. Others fear that their children may be stigmatized as children of single mothers.”So what do these numbers tell us? After all, Seo and Kim stood for what many women and mothers pursued. Seo managed to send her children to prestigious schools in the U.S. and Japan while running her own interior design business. Kim was undoubtedly one of the most influential media figures here. Perhaps that is why their cases rattled so many, as they reminded once again that no matter where you are on the social ladder, it is still hard to come forward against abuse.Although the number of women in the high social tiers traditionally occupied by men is rapidly rising, their vulnerability to violence, and furthermore, social condemnation against female victims seems to persist.Seo’s grown-up daughter, who is currently a Ph.D. student at the Wharton School of Business, recently supported her mother’s decision to file for divorce. She told local media that she “didn’t realize her father’s actions against her mother were wrong as a child, but learned to accept that they were not right as she grew up.” Park Cheon-taek, a public servant who oversees domestic violence issues at the Gender Ministry, said that exposing children to domestic violence, including letting them witness their mother being abused by their father, is also a form of serious child abuse. In parts of in the U.S., it is considered a crime. “It’s an emotional abuse,” Park said. “Kids exposed to domestic violence are at a higher risk of increased emotional and behavioral problems.”According to a 2010 study released by the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations, 51 percent of 998 teenagers surveyed said they have witnessed domestic violence at least once in their lives, and those who have witnessed it had a higher chance of becoming bullies in school. One in 5 juvenile offenders in South Korea is from a single-parent household or homes with conflict. The number of teenagers who run away from home is also increasing ― from 15,114 in 2009 to 21,813 in 2012. Many of them turn to illegal prostitution.Often, issues of domestic violence turn into a gender war on Internet forums. But perhaps, there is a need to accept that combating domestic violence is not a battle of the genders but a fight against a brutal crime that demolishes not only the victim but also the next generation.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","after being nearly raped ,forced to marry comedian ,husband facing domestic violence ,reporter column cutting vicious ,raped at age 19","['Seo Jung - hee', 'Seo Se - win']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24980459  0.15036072

He was found to have played a behind-the-scenes role in supporting Lee’s policies. Kim, 56, was a close aide of the ex-president’s brother Lee Sang-deuk.Han and Kim were reaping yearly sales of 5.4 billion won and 11 billion won through supplier contracts with POSCO.Another Kim, 55, the head of a regional builder, was also operating an outsourcing firm for the conglomerate.

The conglomerate attained state approval for the controversial 123-level Lotte World Mall in southern Seoul during Lee’s term.The case has been taken on by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, which is also in charge of the probe into slush fund speculation of Shinsegae Group, a retail business competitor of Lotte.On Thursday, Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn was quoted in news reports as saying that the authority “would make public any (irregular business practices in the conglomerate sector) through thorough investigation as long as (we) secure evidence and confirm their crime.”Hwang made it clear that the prosecution is investigating “not the overall enterprises but those engaged in corruption” and that the probe would not be conducted in an unfair manner. The minister also denied the prosecution was eventually aiming for former President Lee and his associates, saying, “I don’t know what pro-Lee is. The investigations are strictly over irregularities without any political consideration.”By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","lotte shopping faces slush ,prosecutors office for suspicious ,in widening prosecution probe ,slush fund probe lotte ,office for suspicious funds","['Lotte Group', 'the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit', 'the Financial Services Commission']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31640685  0.0742974

The consortium withdrew from the project in 2010. The prosecution on Wednesday raided the offices of Korea National Oil Corp. and Keangnam Enterprises for their alleged irregularities involving an aborted resources development project in Russia during the former Lee Myung-bak administration (Yonhap)At the time, the consortium held a 45 percent stake in the Russian project. Of them, KNOC held the largest share at 27.5 percent followed by Keangnam (10 percent) and SK Gas (7.5 percent).The prosecution is reportedly looking into whether the developers inflated the anticipated profit despite concerns of feasibility to gain approval from the financial authority for the project. The companies are also suspected of embezzling some of the investment.Sources said the probe will expand to other resources development projects overseas pursued during the Lee administration. Lee’s “resources diplomacy” has been criticized for yielding limited results despite the hefty investments.The investigation comes on the back of President Park Geun-hye’s all-out war on corruption. On Tuesday, she vowed to root out all the irregularities that have been holding back the country’s economic growth.Prosecutors also reportedly searched the home of Seong Wan-jong, the biggest shareholder of Keangnam and former lawmaker of the ruling Saenuri Party. Seong is said to be a close confidant of Lee Sang-deuk, brother of the ex-president.The prosecution will also scrutinize Keangnam’s involvement in a nickel development project in Madagascar. After the builder withdrew from the consortium due to a cash shortage, the state-run Korea Resources Corp. allegedly bought its stake despite an extensive loss.Opposition lawmakers have claimed that the Lee administration poured 40 trillion won into the overseas resource development projects, but recouped only 5 trillion won, or 13 percent, of the total investment.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday raided the offices ,prosecutors confiscated bookkeeping records ,administration prosecutors confiscated bookkeeping ,prosecutors confiscated bookkeeping ,prosecution on wednesday raided","['Korea National Oil Corp.', 'Keangnam Enterprises', 'Russia', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Ulsan']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24091703  0.80287403

(Yonhap)The two companies allegedly squandered 300 billion won ($266 million) in an oil exploration project in Kamchatka in Russia's Far East between 2005 and 2009.  The investment was part of then-President Lee Myung-bak's controversial push for overseas resource projects, which critics say have resulted in wasted taxpayer money with few tangible results.  Prosecutors said they found a promising lead that suggests KNOC and Keangnam Enterprises used illegal means to win the state's approval to invest, despite concerns that the project lacked economic viability.   Investigators believe these companies may have exaggerated the profits they expected from the investment when pitching the idea to South Korea's financial regulator. There is also a possibility that these firms embezzled some of the investment money, they said.  After disappointing results, KNOC and a consortium of South Korean companies pulled out of the Russian business in 2010.  Prosecutors are likely to widen their investigation into other energy diplomacy-related projects pursued during the Lee administration.  They are also looking into suspicions of irregularities in Keangnam Enterprises' sale of a stake in a nickel operation in Madagascar to the Korea Resources Corp. in 2010.

The company took a 20 percent commission fee from the ride fares, the police said. Under the Korean transport law, providing unpermitted or unlicensed transportation is banned. The two officials also faced allegations that they provided the location information of the passengers to drivers without due registration with the authorities, investigators said. Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick has also been indicted for additional illegalities, three months after he was booked for establishing and operating the ride-sharing company, they added. While the police are planning to summon Kalanick for the further probe, they are considering issuing an arrest warrant if he does not comply, the authorities said. Kalanick, who is reportedly staying overseas, has not been appearing in the trial. A total of 27 rental car company owners and private drivers were also indicted for involvement in the illegal ride-sharing service, the police said.

(Yonhap)The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office investigating the case said it started calling executives in from Sunday for questioning over their suspected involvement.   An executive surnamed Park, who was the chief of POSCO E&C;'s Vietnamese operations, is among the first officials to face questioning, prosecutors said. Others include officials who were directly involved in the running of POSCO E&C;'s Vietnam branch.  Prosecutors said they are mainly focused on determining how the firm was able to leave millions of dollars out of its books.   POSCO E&C; says it exaggerated its payments to local subcontractors, which were later reimbursed from 2009 to 2012. But authorities believe some of the funds may have been sent back to South Korea.  Prosecutors also plan to interrogate former POSCO E&C; Vice Chairman Chung Dong-hwa, who ran the firm during the cited period.   But first, they will focus on uncovering the exact size and use of the slush funds before calling in the higher-ups.   Some sources within the prosecution said former POSCO Chairman Chung Joon-yang has been banned from leaving the country to possibly face questioning.  Prosecutors also did not rule out the possibility of expanding the probe to other POSCO affiliates either, one of which was found to have evaded taxes in 2013. The National Tax Service referred the case to the prosecution last year, though POSCO E&C; says the corruption was limited to a few individuals within the company.  Last week, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo declared an all-out war on corruption, which analysts say seems to be aimed at propping up weak public support for President Park Geun-hye's job performance by launching an anti-graft drive against government officials and businessmen, especially those who worked for the previous Lee Myung-bak administration.

The prosecution recently issued travel bans on some incumbent and former executives of POSCO as it widens its scope of inquiry into the allegations that the conglomerate engaged in irregularities involving embezzlement at its construction unit. According to market insiders and news reports on Sunday, the steelmaker’s ex-chairman Chung, 67, was included on the travel ban list.Chung was the key influencer behind the group’s mergers and acquisitions during the previous Lee Myung-bak administration. There has been speculation in the market that the group conducted shady deals for some takeovers. While the number of POSCO units surged from 36 in 2009 to 70 in 2012 via M&As;, 18 units underwent capital erosion. Observers, citing the conglomerate’s worsening financial standing, raised the possibility that the prosecution would look into rumors that a slush fund was created via cozy relations between the group and the political sector. After Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo vowed on Friday to root out slush funds in the conglomerate sector, investigators raided the offices of POSCO Engineering & Construction and the residences of some executives.While the probe started from the allegation that its builder unit POSCO E&C; fostered 10 billion won ($9 million) in slush funds during its Vietnam project, observers say that the travel ban on group executives is heralding full-fledged scrutiny into the overall affiliates and subsidiaries.Some questioned the feasibility of the Park Geun-hye administration’s investigation of whether there were low-key deals between the Lee administration and some major business groups.Among the speculated irregularities under the spotlight are suspected tax evasion by POSCO P&S;, the group’s marketing subsidiary, and a dubious M&A; deal involving total solutions provider POSCO Plantec, according to a news outlet.While the National Assembly is accelerating the probe on the Lee administration’s reported losses from its overseas resource development projects, some observers predict that the prosecution will join the move starting with the steelmaker case.POSCO had yet to comment by Sunday on its stance on the raid and the travel bans.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","recently issued travel bans ,fund former posco chairman ,irregularities involving embezzlement at ,face summons from investigators ,slush fund former posco","['POSCO', 'Chung Joon - yang', 'POSCO']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15590566  0.12848735

The attack left Lippert with wounds that required 80 stitches.  (Yonhap)The 55-year-old faces charges of attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction. Police said they are planning to ask the prosecutors to take over the case later in the day.Kim has said he was acting alone. But a special task force investigating the case said the 55-year-old contacted more than 30 people -- including a former spy for North Korea and a key member of a pro-North Korea organization here -- in the run-up to the incident.Kim Cheol-jun, the lead investigator from the National Police Agency, said authorities are delving further into Kim's phone and bank transaction records to find out whether any of them had been involved.The investigator also said Kim Ki-jong told officers he attacked the envoy to alert the U.S. to the fact that the ongoing South Korea-U.S. joint military drills hinder inter-Korean reunification.South Korea and the U.S. have jointly carried out the annual exercises to prepare for a possible invasion from the North. The two Koreas remain divided as no peace treaty has been signed to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.Authorities also said some of what Kim told them shared striking similarities with North Korea's saber-rattling; Kim reportedly told them South Korea was a ""semi-colony"" of the U.S. while North Korea was an independent, autonomous country.Police said they also believe the attack was premeditated.Kim's Internet browsing history shows that he had looked up Lippert's blog, his height and South Korea's criminal law a day before the incident, according to authorities.He also appeared to have had an intent to kill, police said. He reportedly said he brought a knife because his previous attempt to harm a Japanese ambassador to Seoul years ago failed. He also slashed Lippert at least twice, leaving deep gashes on his face and arm that required more than 80 stitches.Kim, however, has said he hadn't planned on bringing the knife until the last minute and that he didn't mean to kill the envoy.Lippert reportedly told authorities he wanted Kim to be punished. He was completely taken unawares by the assailant, according to the testimony he gave to the police a day earlier. The envoy also reportedly said he thought he would have been killed if he didn't hurry towards the exit.Police are also continuing their investigation into the possibility that Kim violated a controversial security law, which bans South Koreans from openly praising North Korea. More than 20 books that are suspected of being in violation of the National Security Law were found in his home, they said.Anti-U.S. activists here have argued the U.S. has hampered progress for Korean unification. But no one had attacked a U.S. envoy before Kim. He was also the first South Korean to try to harm a foreign envoy when he threw pieces of rock at a Japanese ambassador in 2010.

(Yonhap)Late last month, the construction arm of South Korea's top steelmaker, POSCO, said two executives and about 10 employees in charge of construction projects in Vietnam were reprimanded in July for operating illegal slush funds worth about 10 billion won ($8.9 million).The money, which had been accumulated by exaggerating the amount the South Korean company needed to pay local subcontractors in Vietnam, was later given out as monthly rebates to contractors from 2009 to 2012, it said.

Lee previously ordered a thorough investigation into the case during a parliamentary interpellation session on Feb. 26.Some have raised suspicions that the secret funds were actually created by the company or that some of the money was funneled into the country.Last year, the National Tax Service referred POSCO to the prosecution on charges of inflating sales figures in transactions with its affiliates.But POSCO E&C; denies the allegations, calling it ""an individual case of corruption committed by company executives in charge of sales in Vietnam who are obsessed with their performance.""

Some have raised suspicions that Lee exaggerated the unit price to get a rebate from Havelsan, and bribed Air Force officers here and DAPA officials involved in the project. Prosecutors believe that Lee was able to reduce the cost for the EWTS production by having his affiliates participate in the project as subcontractors and letting them provide substandard parts for the equipment. At the point of the EWTS introduction, there had been a controversy that the system failed to meet the military's requirements and to fit the country's security circumstances. The platform is designed to train pilots with electronic countermeasure devices against interceptors and artilleries from enemies, including North Korea, to improve the pilots' ability to survive and to boost the country's anti-aircraft capabilities.The chief also faces allegations that he illegally acquired classified information on a state project to upgrade unmanned aerial vehicles.Lee, who founded the defense firm in the mid-1980s, has worked as an arms dealer for more than 30 years. He was arrested in 2009 on embezzlement charges while being involved in the country's weapons purchases from Russia.

Lee, 40, had been indicted for taking kickbacks, including a premium imported car.While the district court acknowledged the charges and sentenced the ex-prosecutor to a three-year jail term, an appellate court acquitted her of the charges. The Supreme Court upheld the high court’s ruling on Thursday.The district court had ruled that Lee received a credit card and a Mercedes-Benz sedan worth 55.9 million won ($50,800) as a bribe from a 53-year-old lawyer surnamed Choi, with whom she was reportedly in a relationship. Its verdict said the lawyer provided the then-prosecutor with the gifts in an attempt to ask a favor in a criminal case.But the appeals and highest courts reversed the initial ruling, concluding that the two were romantically involved and supporting the defendant’s argument that the gifts were not a bribe but a token of Choi’s love.The case, which had earned nationwide attention, was cited as an example of a loophole in the current legal system as penalizing someone for bribery and corruption by having to prove an exchange of favors.The Supreme Court’s latest decision also drew a loud response on social media, as it coincided with the recent passage of the tough antigraft bill aimed to root out corruption. Under the new anticorruption law that is to go in effect next year, persons found guilty of receiving more than 1 million won in money or kind, regardless of reciprocity, can be sentenced to up to three years in prison.Many netizens also criticized the latest ruling, claiming the judges showed leniency the former prosecutor.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","indicted for taking kickbacks ,court clears benz prosecutor ,benz prosecutor of bribery ,sentenced the ex prosecutor ,three year jail term","['South Korea ’s', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Supreme Court']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54446656 -0.02126989

Investigators asked the ambassador to testify on the assault case as part of the ongoing investigation into the motive of his assailant, Kim Ki-jong, the police said. The U.S. Embassy and the authorities are negotiating on how to deliver the testimony, the police added.If Lippert is not available, investigators may receive the victim’s statement from a representative, they said.In the meantime, the government decided to provide police protection for all foreign envoys here if it is deemed necessary, regardless of their request, as part of heightened efforts to ensure the safety of foreign officials. Police conduct a security training drill in front of the Embassy of Japan in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)The police have been closely guarding Lippert and his wife around the clock since the attack. They have also enhanced the security measures on all diplomatic properties across the country. According to police, around eight embassies have requested protection for their envoys since last week’s attack.Meanwhile, police continued their investigation into Kim Ki-jong’s alleged pro-North Korean links, and reported confirming more evidence to support a related charge.Of the 30 items confiscated from Kim’s house and office during a raid last week, 19 were found to have contained “enemy-benefiting” contents, the police said. The evidence was examined by experts to determine whether they contain pro-North Korea content.While the suspect was arrested on three charges ― attempted murder, assault on a foreign diplomat and obstruction of official duties ― after attacking Lippert last week, the authorities have separately been looking into whether he violated the security law. Reviewing Kim’s phone record, investigators also found that he had called up several pro-North Korean figures, sources said. The police will grill the suspect over possession of the suspicious items and further investigate whether there were any possible masterminds of the assault, investigators said.They will also try to find out whether Kim was financially supported by pro-North Korea groups, they added. The suspect has reportedly denied all charges and claimed that he had obtained the problematic materials at local rallies in Seoul while doing unification-related studies. Kim is under custody at a police hospital since Tuesday to treat a broken ankle sustained during a tussle with authorities who overpowered him immediately after the attack. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a few more days, medical staff said.

""Lee is suspected of defrauding the government by playing a leading role in providing sub-standard parts for the equipment,"" said a task force official. At the time of the system's introduction, there had been a controversy that EWTS failed to meet the military's requirement and fit the country's security circumstances.The training platform provides a realistic representation of threats through a wide variety of instructor-generated scenarios to improve pilots' ability to survive.Lee is also suspected of illegally acquiring classified information on the state project to upgrade unmanned aerial vehicles.As part of the probe, state investigators also raided the company's headquarters, branch offices and Lee's residence in Seoul earlier in the day, and confiscated the company's classified documents, computer hard disks and account records.Lee, who founded the defense firm in the mid-1980s, has worked as an arms dealer for more than 30 years. He was arrested in 2009 on embezzlement charges while being involved in the country's weapons purchase from Russia.Lee's detention is part of the task force's massive investigation into multiple corruption scandals in the defense industry since November last year.Jung Ok-geun, who served as the Navy Chief of Staff from 2008 to 2010, was indicted for taking 60 million won from a company that brokers sales of German-made communications equipment in 2009, and a handful of former and active-duty officers have been under investigation for alleged graft related to the country's indigenous salvage ship project.A series of allegations prompted Navy chief Adm.

(Yonhap)The suit was filed on Monday in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Queens County, according to U.S.-based law firms representing Kim Do-hee on Wednesday. Kim, a female cabin crew member who served macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a dish to first-class passenger Cho, a daughter of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho, was verbally and physically abused by the former executive for not following the in-flight service manual on a Seoul-bound Korean Air flight from New York on Dec. 5. Angered by the service, Cho chided the cabin crew chief and ordered the taxiing plane to offload him.“The evidence in this case will demonstrate that Heather Cho’s actions were not only humiliating, degrading and damaging to Kim, but were also emblematic of Cho’s unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement,” said Andrew J. Weinstein, founder of The Weinstein Law Firm representing Kim in a press release.He added that he is “very confident that the legal system in New York will find Cho civilly responsible for the extensive damage that she has caused to Kim’s career, reputation and emotional well-being.”During a court testimony in Seoul in January, Kim said Korean Air offered her a position as a college professor in return for giving testimony favorable to Cho in her trial, but she rejected the offer. “Kim had hoped to privately resolve this dispute with Cho and Korean Air without the need for litigation. Unfortunately, Cho and Korean Air, through their respective counsel, have not to date engaged with us in any substantive settlement discussions,” said Jonathan D. Cogan, a partner in the New York office of the international litigation boutique Kobre & Kim. Kim is seeking compensatory damages and punitive damages, and the amount will be determined at the trial.A Korean Air spokesman told The Korea Herald that the company has not yet been able to give an official comment regarding the lawsuit as it has not received a complaint from the plaintiff’s attorney.Kim is currently on sick leave until March 18.In February, the South Korean court sentenced Cho to one year in prison after finding her guilty for violating the aviation safety law and other charges.

Kim Young-ran, who proposed the bill in 2011, also refuted growing concerns that the law may be unconstitutional and abusive for journalists and teachers, citing the need to reform the civilian sector. The bill named after her passed the Assembly last week with over 90 percent of the attending lawmakers approving the bill. The law aims to make it illegal for civil servants, journalists and teachers to receive more than 1 million won ($910) in cash or gifts, regardless of the occasion. The law, however, excludes elected lawmakers from being punished when they lobby for legislation, revision or abolition of the bills and if such activities represent the public value. Kim Young-ran. (Yonhap)Kim strongly denounced that the exclusion of lawmakers could tantamount to them becoming “brokers.” “It is unfortunate that the law was scaled down from its initial draft,” she said during a news conference.“If it goes wrong, (the law) could possibly lead to elected officials like lawmakers being exploited as brokers,” she said. The bill also failed to include measures to prevent civil servants from seeking personal benefits in the areas in which they are designated to work, she said. “There were three elements in the original draft that bans unjust business favors, bribe receiving and the conflict of interests, but only (the first) two elements were included in the final law,” Kim said.She also voiced concerns that the bill requires only spouses of the concerned parties to be subjected to the new rule.Referring to past corruptive cases involving family members of former presidents, Kim urged that the bill should have required children, parents and siblings to report their relatives.Kim said she was surprised that the bill included journalists and teachers of private education institutes. Her original draft was written only to prevent civil servants from abusing their power, she added.Kim, however, opposed the escalating arguments that including journalists and teachers in the bill could go against the Constitution and freedom of press.“I don’t think it violates the Constitution,” she said. Citing a recent poll that showed nearly 70 percent of respondents approving the inclusion, Kim said it is hard to see that the law violated the “equality of rights” and breached the “principle of proportionality” because she believes that the two professions carry roles that are “quasi-public.”But Kim said the law could possibly infringe the freedom of the press and urged lawmakers to come up with a special countermeasure to prevent such things from happening.The remark came after a local lawyers’ group last week filed an appeal to the court arguing that the bill challenges the Constitution.The bill has arbitrarily selected the subjects for regulation, including the press, and violates the principles of equality and precision, the group said. In the face of growing criticism for hastily passing the bill, lawmakers have hinted that they would revise the bill before it goes into effect in September 2016. The parliament also has been under criticism for sidestepping clauses that would directly impact the incumbent lawmakers.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)","wrote controversial anticorruption bill ,last week said tuesday ,law author slams antigraft ,tuesday that the law ,2011 also refuted growing","['Supreme Court', 'Kim Young - ran']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01773595  0.54763269

Investigators have been gathering evidence to level charges against Kim of violating the National Security Law, as North Korea praised the attack as an “act of justice.” Kim currently faces charges of attempted murder, assault on a foreign diplomat and obstruction of work at a morning seminar in Seoul where the attack occurred. Korean high school students leave comments on a board near the U. S. Embassy on Saturday, wishing U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert a speedy recovery. (Yonhap)Kim denies any violation of the security law, arguing that he collected the publications as he needed them to write a thesis on the North for his master’s degree, and to study national reunification. He also claims that he has no ties to Pyongyang and never supported the North Korean political system.Among the confiscated items were the “Film Art,” a book that late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il wrote in the 1970s based on the North’s juche (self-reliance) ideology; and a series of periodicals published by the Pan-Korean Coalition for National Unification, a group that the Supreme Court ruled in 1997 had illegally benefited the enemy, namely the North.Kim is thought to have obtained the Film Art and other publications when he visited the North some seven times between 1999 and 2007. In 2007, Kim set up a memorial alter to mourn the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Last week, investigation authorities mentioned that “enemy-benefitting” materials referred to those carrying contents that could “threaten the existence of the Republic of Korea and the country’s political system of liberal democracy.”Investigators plan to wrap up their initial probe by Friday and hand the case over to the prosecution.North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, meanwhile, claimed the South’s attempt to link Kim with Pyongyang was aimed at shifting the blame on “patriotic forces working for Koreas’ reunification.”“This is aimed to annihilate the patriotic forces for reunification with a villainous attempt to hang more for a plot against (the North),” the statement said.Meanwhile, Lippert is doing well and may be released from hospital as early as Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning at the latest, the medical staff said.U.S. Embassy officials said Lippert was grateful for the outpour of encouraging messages from the Korean public and that he was currently reading “The Two Koreas,” a renowned book authored by Don Oberdorfer while on bed rest.Throngs of Korean politicians visited Lippert’s bedside on Sunday, including ruling Saenuri Party chairman Rep.

""Despite any suspicion (the Incheon Immigration Office) might have, asylum seekers should be given the opportunity to be evaluated for refugee status and be provided with permissible legal protection while going through the necessary procedure,"" the Seoul High Court ruling said. In late 2013, a fugitive running from conscription in his war-ridden home country in Africa was denied the right to apply for sanctuary here on grounds that there were inconsistencies in his account.The man, whose identity has been withheld, spent the next year taking legal action against the Incheon Immigration Office and went through several appeals trials in the process to seek a chance to enter the country and have his application for refugee status submitted for evaluation.Immigration officials decided not to appeal the latest outcome, making the ruling final and the first case to reverse the immigration office's decision to deny an asylum seeker's application for refugee status. ""We hope the authorities will work to bring a groundbreaking change to the immigration system,"" said an attorney who represented the defendant.  ""The country needs to improve its immigration system and have it updated in line with its Refugee Law,"" he added. Earlier in 2013, the Justice Ministry revised the Refugee Law to provide financial aid to those applying for refugee status.Under the amended law, applicants awaiting their outcome are given living costs or are allowed to stay at a facility for up to six months after submitting their applications.Last year, 2,896 foreigners sought asylum in South Korea, of which 94 were accepted, according to the Korea Immigration Service.The figure does not include those from North Korea.

It also raised safety worries in a city with a reputation as a relatively low-risk diplomatic posting, despite regular threats of war from North Korea.While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death.Lippert, 42, was recovering well but complaining of pain in the wound near his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in a televised briefing. Doctors plan to remove the 80 stitches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months.Seoul Central District Court granted a police request for the formal arrest of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong, 55, who could face charges including attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy, obstruction, and violating a controversial law that bans praise or assistance for North Korea, police officials said.Police searched Kim's offices and house and seized hundreds of documents, books and computer files. Police also obtained Kim's telecommunication and financial transaction records to help investigate how the attack was planned and whether others were involved, police officials said.Police are also looking into Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when South Korea was led by a liberal government.Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. and violent protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police he was protesting annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion.Security for Lippert was another focus.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Lippert had one full-time bodyguard assigned from the Seoul metropolitan police. She said Seoul is not a ""high-threat"" environment in which the U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security would deploy its own guards to protect the ambassador. She said ""several"" more South Korean police have now been added to Lippert's security detail.According to a Seoul police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules, 29 officers were deployed as a precaution at Thursday's event, although all but four were on standby outside the building, the officer said.""We are still getting all the facts about how people were screened to get into this event, how people were on the list, how they were allowed in,"" Harf told reporters in Washington.Harf condemned North Korea's gloating response to the attack as ""outrageously callous but unfortunately consistent with the nature of the regime and its rhetoric.""Kim was well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. He received a three-year suspended sentence in 2010 for throwing a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador to Seoul while protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea.More recently, Kim had been under investigation by Seoul prosecutors after allegedly assaulting at least one public employee at an outdoor pop concert in January.When Kim entered the hall where the attack occurred, a police officer asked one of the event organizers whether he should be allowed to enter, Jongno district police Chief Yun Myung-sung told reporters. The organizing official answered that Kim could enter because he was associated with an organization that had been invited to the meeting.A security expert called the police inept.""There is no excuse for allowing a blacklisted person to enter the venue for an event like this,"" said Yu Hyung-chang, a professor at Kyungnam University in Changwon who served in South Korea's presidential secret service for 20 years until 2000.Lippert became ambassador last October, and is a popular figure. He's regularly seen walking his basset hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened.

The wounds weren't life-threatening, but the attack left a deep gash extending from the envoy's right chin to cheek, requiring more than 80 stitches.The Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant for Kim, saying ""The reason and the necessity of his arrest were fully explained.""Before entering the court for a hearing to review the legality of his arrest, Kim said he had no ties to North Korea.""That's nonsense,"" he told reporters when asked about the police investigation into the possibility.He denied being sympathetic to Pyongyang and having ever been to the country despite police announcements earlier to the contrary.He also shook his head when asked if he had an intent to kill and said there was no one else involved.Kim had previously told police officers that he plotted the attack to stop the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises that kicked off earlier this week.The exercises are part of Seoul and Washington's efforts to better deter threats from North Korea. Kim said he thought the drills hampered efforts to re-unify the two Koreas as they remain technically at war since the Korean War in the 1950s ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Hwang Sang-hyeon, Kim's attorney, also said the attack was not premeditated. In mid-February, Kim received a letter of invitation from the organizer, and it was then he decided to confront the ambassador about the joint military drills, according to Hwang.""He hadn't planned on bringing the knife until (Thursday) morning,"" Hwang told reporters as he took from a break from police interrogation late Thursday. ""He was trying to alarm the U.S. but had nothing personal against the ambassador.""The task force said it may add the charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law if they come by enough evidence to support their case. The law bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government.Authorities said they have discovered ""treasonous books"" at Kim's home during a raid carried out earlier in the day.In a second press briefing on Friday, Yoon Myeong-seong, chief of Jongno Police Station in Seoul, said they have taken 219 items from his home and office in the western Seoul district of Seodaemun. These included Kim's PC hardware, hard drives, USBs, floppy disks and a letter of invitation from Thursday's event organizer.Yoon said they were particularly interested in some of these items that were ""suspected of being pro-North Korea in nature"" but he refused to detail the amount and what he meant by the description.A preliminary probe has already shown that Kim had been to North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim did not appear suspicious during these trips that were approved by the unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs. He also tried to erect an altar at the heart of Seoul in memory of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011 shortly after he passed away.Formed earlier Friday, the special investigation team is comprised of more than 100 prosecutors and police officers, and will be led by the anti-terrorism bureau of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.South Korea's prosecution-general ordered a thorough inquiry into the case, which he said shocked the entire world.""We must proactively respond to serious crimes like terrorism and strongly punish those responsible,"" he said in a meeting of senior prosecutors on Friday.It is the first time a top U.S. envoy here has been attacked.Kim was also behind the first-ever assault of a foreign envoy here when he threw a rock at a Japanese ambassador to Seoul in 2010.A police officer said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) has asked the South Korean authorities to share information on the investigation. The FBI won't participate in the actual probe but will make requests about the probe's direction, he addedEarly Friday, police raided Kim's home and office for documents and hard drives, which they said will help them learn how Kim planned the attack and why. They also intend to illuminate whether he had an accomplice. Police have also been issued a warrant to obtain Kim's phone and email recordsLippert, 42, became the youngest-ever U.S. envoy to Seoul last year. His wife gave birth to a son here, to whom they gave a Korean middle name. He was previously the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2011 to 2012.

Police said they found a number of materials which indicated his pro-North Korean views during raids on his home and office in western Seoul early in the morning. They also sought a warrant to track Kim’s phone records. Kim Ki-jong (Yonhap)Kim claimed that he acted alone but President Park Geun-hye and top officials called for the law enforcement agencies to ferret out possible masterminds of the assault condemning pro-North Korean elements. “We concurred that this incident should be defined as an act by the followers of North Korea and the masterminds and the truth behind it should be thoroughly investigated,” said Yoo Seong-min, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party after a three-way meeting of top-level officials from the presidential office, the party and the administration. During a trip to the UAE, President Park also instructed a thorough investigation. “As the suspect was found to have committed similar crimes before, (investigators) must thoroughly reveal the case to prevent any reoccurrence, including why the suspect committed the attack and whether there was someone behind it,” Park was quoted as saying.Investigators are looking into whether the attacker violated the National Security Law. Kim has reportedly claimed that he did not have any intentions to kill the envoy and committed the attack on his own because he wanted to stop the ongoing bilateral military drills that kicked off earlier this week.The authorities, however, suspected that Kim had planned the crime 10 days in advance and that he attacked the ambassador’s face and hand multiple times with willful negligence. The court will determine whether to arrest the suspect no later than Saturday, the police said. The Unification Ministry has confirmed that he had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007. Kim toured Mount Geungangsan one time and visited the border city of Gaeseong six times to participate in tree-planting events as a member of a left-wing civic group, the ministry said.He had also attempted to set up an altar near Seoul City Hall in memory of the North’s former leader Kim Jong-il after the dictator’s death in December 2011, it added.In order to investigate whether there were others behind the attack, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office launched a special probe team, comprised of about 100 police officers and prosecutors. The team will be led by prosecutors in charge of anticommunism and antiterrorism, officials said.The special probe team will further investigate how and why the suspect had planned the crime, they added.

He was arrested at the scene.The activist had not been invited to the event, nor was he a member of the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, the civic group that had invited Lippert to its morning conference, Saenuri Party Rep. Chang Yoon-seok said. Chang was sitting next to the ambassador when the assault took place.“The event was open to the public. I think that’s why he was allowed into the conference room without much fuss,” the lawmaker said. (Yonhap)According to Chang, Kim had been sitting a few feet away from the head table, where he was seated with Lippert.“It happened in a mere few seconds,” he said.Chang and a few others at the scene wrestled Kim down. Police arrived a few minutes later and carried him away.Kim suffered a broken ankle during the tussle, police said.He later confessed he had prepared his attack for 10 days, after finding out about the event.In 2010, the activist was reportedly arrested on charges of throwing blocks of concrete toward then-Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie during his lecture in Seoul. He was given a two-year jail term suspended for three years.Kim has been engaged in a series of campaigns, including one to safeguard Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo. In 2006 after Japan’s Shimane prefecture declared its Takeshima Day, after the Japanese name for Dokdo, Kim, along with other activists, changed their home addresses to one located on the islets. In 2007, he set himself on fire during a one-man protest in front of Cheong Wa Dae, calling on the government to thoroughly probe a case in which a member of his civic group was attacked by unidentified men at the group’s office in Seoul.By Song Sang-ho and Jeong Hunny(sshluck@heraldcorp.com) (hj257@heraldcorp.com)","man who attacked ambassador ,seoul in 2010 police ,attacked the japanese ambassador ,civic activist who attacked ,officials said the attacker","['U.S.', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ki - jong', 'Urimadang Dokdo Keepers', 'Kim', 'South Korea', 'U.S.']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49209911  0.3347491

The 39-year-old man in Daegu, whose information was withheld, submitted a petition to Daegu District Court for a new trial, officials said. He was sentenced to a two-year jail term with eight months of probation for cheating on his wife in July 2013. If he is acquitted in the retrial, his criminal record will be removed, law officials said. The Constitutional Court abolished the anticheating law last Thursday with a 7-2 decision. The judges ruled that the 62-year-old law breached individuals’ sexual rights and privacy. While about 100,000 people have been found guilty since the law was enacted in 1953, only around 3,000 people are eligible to ask for a retrial, law authorities said. The court grants requests for a review only from those who were given a guilty verdict after Oct. 30, 2008, the date the last ruling in favor of the anticheating law was upheld. “Those who were jailed for adultery in the past can also seek compensation from the government after being acquitted in a retrial,” court officials said.

He allegedly offered the companies contracts to build Navy ships in return. The bribes were provided in the form of a sponsorship to a yacht event arranged by Jung's son, investigators said. The yacht company whose majority stake was owned by the younger Jung went out of business shortly thereafter, raising suspicions that it may have been a paper company.Jung's son, a former Navy officer, and a non-executive director of an STX Group affiliate have also been indicted for collusion.

(Yonhap)Kang hadn't asked for Shin's approval when he surgically shrank the singer's stomach and accidentally punctured the small intestine and pericardium - the sac that surrounds the heart and roots of great blood vessels - in the process, police said.An infection caught on quickly, but Kang failed to take necessary measures to treat the inflammation in the lining of Shin's stomach, according to police. Shin died on Oct. 27 of complications.Police said Kang had downplayed Shin's symptoms despite their potentially fatal nature. Kang had allegedly told Shin that the high fever, abnormal surge in white blood cell count and extreme pain were ""part of the normal recovery process.""In a statement released later in the day, Kang denied any wrongdoing. ""Shrinking a stomach means 70-80% of the stomach tissue has been removed. That was not the case for Shin,"" the doctor said, adding the singer had not heeded his advice to stay hospitalized.The police said they will formally ask the prosecution to file a medical malpractice charge against Kang later this week.

Prosecutors at the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office said Koo is accused of receiving more than 1 billion won ($909,000) in cash and a luxury car from a KOSDAQ-listed company executive, in exchange for promising him a 5 billion won investment in 2010. However, the investment was never made and the plaintiff had to pay for corporate tax and other costs while squeezing out the 1 billion won kickback for Koo, according to court papers. Prosecutors said Koo had allegedly forced the plaintiff to give him a 700 million won kickback from a 1 billion won donation Koo gave to a charity foundation run by the plaintiff’s father. Koo had also allegedly pocketed another 300 million won in cash and a 90 million won Mercedes-Benz car for his girlfriend. Local broadcaster YTN reported that LG’s lawyers tried to downplay the case, asking the plaintiff to cover up Koo Bon-ho’s name. An LG spokesman did not respond to The Korea Herald’s calls for comment.Koo is the grandson of Koo Jeong-hoe, the younger brother of LG Group founder Koo In-hoe. He is the second cousin of current LG chairman Koo Bon-moo. Koo Bon-ho earlier this year made headlines when he announced a joint project with Hyosung heir and Hyosung Corp. CEO Cho Hyun-joon, which involves some 40 billion won in investment. This includes a 12 billion won investment in online game company Action Square.

The president has also been calling for public support for her reform drive, stressing that the New Year is the “last golden time” to push ahead with the plan. Contrary to her wishes, Park now faces a political crisis with questions building over her authoritative, top-down leadership, which remains unchanged despite constant demands from the public.A series of political scandals involving conflicts between groups of aides as well as the government’s inconsistent policies on tax and health insurance has damaged her credibility. President Park Geun-hye attends a lunch meeting with a group of business tycoons on corporate support for culture at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Tuesday. From left are POSCO chairman Kwon Oh-joon, Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jay-yong, LG Group chairman Koo Bon-moo, President Park, Korea Mecenat Association chief Park Yong-hyun, Hyundai Motor vice chairman Chung Eui-sun, CJ Group chairman Sohn Kyungshik, EAGON chairman Park Young-ju and Naver founder Lee Hae-jin. (Yonhap)Presidential documents were leaked to media late last year, raising speculation over lax discipline within Cheong Wa Dae. Park also came under fire after she refused to abandon her aides involved in a related influence-peddling scandal.She continued to struggle over her tax policies as the government backtracked on its initial plan to revise the tax settlement scheme in the face of public worries that the middle class would have to pay more.Her approval ratings plummeted to below 30 percent on Jan. 27, the lowest rating since she entered office. According to local pollster Realmeter, her job ratings quickly rebounded to 36 percent last week. But the score is still far lower than when her leadership was questioned in the wake of the Sewol ferry accident. Critics say that her second year was “full of disappointment,” noting that she should have reached out more to the public and given more leeway to the Cabinet to actively work on her reform drives.“Park handled foreign affairs relatively well during her second year but failed entirely on home affairs, particularly on her promise to bring about national unity,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, a professor at Hanshin University.Yoon stressed that the people started to “feel heavy” due to perceptions that she is an uncommunicative leader.“People have suffered from economic downturns for many years, not just this time,” Yoon said.“It is the leadership that gives hopes to the people in times of difficulty. But with Park, a president only reads reports day and night alone at the presidential office, people started to feel distanced from her and give up seeking hope from her.”Last week, Park appointed a new prime minister and conducted a partial Cabinet reshuffle, as part of her efforts to restore public confidence. With a new lineup, however, the president needs to keep her pledge to share more responsibility with the prime minister and minsters by allowing them greater discretion in decision-making and personnel choices, said Yoon of Hanshin University.But experts say she may have already lost her opportunity to push ahead with her reform drive.“I think she put too much focus on diplomacy during her first two years in office,” said Choi Young-jin, a political science professor at ChungAng University in Seoul. Choi lashed out by saying that she enjoyed “Cinderella moments” through introducing her mantra of a creative economy and trustpolitik, the centerpiece of her North Korean policies, during her series of presidential trips.“She missed the right time to push ahead with her reform efforts and other major agendas such as restructuring the public servants’ pension system and health insurance. Now is too late,“ he said. Despite the pessimistic views, Yoon Hee-woong, head of public opinion research firm Min Consulting, said it was too early to say she had entered lame duck status.“The possibility is still high that Park will restore public confidence, as she and her governing party hold a strong and loyal base of conservative supporters,” he said. The Saenuri Party currently holds 158 seats in the 295-strong parliament.As for inter-Korean relations, Park has been praised for her principled approach to forging a normal state-to-state relationship with Pyongyang ― rather than pampering a recalcitrant North with unconditional largesse.But she has also been criticized for being inflexible in breaking the prolonged cross-border impasse ― a reason why calls have been mounting for her to be more active in tackling bilateral issues including the issue of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.Inter-Korean tensions have remained high due to the North’s provocative behavior and menacing rhetoric. The North has constantly warned of retaliation against South Korean activists who send balloons filled with anti-Pyongyang leaflets to the North and demanded that Seoul and Washington cancel their allied military drills. Amid its verbal threats and shows of force, the impoverished North has also demanded that the South lift its economic sanctions against it, resume the long-stalled tours to Mount Geumgangsan and agree to reopen the multilateral aid-for-denuclearization talks without preconditions.Observers say that Park needs to devise creative options to defuse inter-Korean tensions and forge momentum to block Pyongyang from further developing its nuclear weapons, rather than rigidly calling for sincerity in the North’s denuclearization commitments.On the wider diplomatic front, Park’s pursuit of improved ties with Beijing has been hailed as foreign policy feat.In a departure from her predecessor’s excessive focus on enhancing relations with the U.S., Park has sought to deepen and broaden the strategic partnership with China, a crucial partner for trade, tourism and efforts to denuclearize the North.At the same time, Park has made strong efforts to maintain the traditional security alliance with the U.S.Through the conclusion of free trade negotiations with China, Seoul has strengthened its economic partnership with Beijing. It has also deepened its security cooperation to cope with the North through bilateral summits and various strategic dialogue channels.Over the course of just two years, Park has met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping six times and with Premier Li Keqiang once, which analysts say reflects the closer partnership she has built with the emergent Asian power.But the improved relations with Beijing have also posed a diplomatic challenge to Seoul. Amid the intensifying strategic competition between the U.S. and China, the South was forced to make tough strategic choices on several occasions.China has pressured the South not to allow the U.S.’ deployment of an additional missile defense asset to the peninsula and to participate in the scheme to establish the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which the U.S. sees as a move by China to exclude it and lead the regional financial order.Over recent years, the South’s relationship with Japan has worsened due to Tokyo’s failure to fully atone for its wartime misdeeds including its sexual enslavement of Asian women during World War II. Tokyo’s continued claim to South Korea’s easternmost islets of Dokdo has continued to be a source of diplomatic friction between the two neighbors.Experts say that although the public antagonism against Japan has worsened, Seoul should continue to pursue practical cooperation in security, business and other areas rather than being bound by the past.By Cho Chung-un, Song Sang-ho(christory@heraldcorp.com) (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","3rd year begins president ,president battles public skepticism ,second year in office ,sluggish economy to tear ,escalating feud with her","['Park Geun', 'Park']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40526515  0.49277973

He later deleted the video upon the teenager’s request, law officials said. Under the youth protection law, producing pornographic material of children or teenagers is a crime.The court ruled that the filming did not violate the youth protection law because there was mutual consent. “The victim, who is old enough to be legally considered able to consent, did agree to take part in the filming without anything in return, and Kim did so. Therefore, this should be considered (not as pornography but) as their privacy, which must be protected,” the verdict said. “Since the concerned video was not produced for the purpose of sales, rental or distribution but only for personal record, the concerned video cannot be categorized as pornography of children or youth,” it added. Kim, however, was sentenced to two and half years in prison with a stay of three years for raping the girlfriend twice after their relationship became estranged in May 2012. He was also ordered to take 40 hours of sexual violence awareness classes, officials said.

He also offered the chairman a chance to ride a warship with then President Lee Myung-bak.Investigators also believe Jung at one point threatened the chairman, suggesting retaliation if he didn't oblige.Jung's son, a former Navy officer, and a non-executive director of an STX Group affiliate were also indicted without physical detention for collusion.

Last month, Duksung Women’s University filed a police complaint against a professor, whose personal information has been withheld, for molesting a student. The professor is alleged to have forcibly kissed the student after drinking together early last year. The school’s unusually proactive response to the alleged sex crime could be a wake-up call for Korea’s universities, as many have been perceived as slow to respond to similar cases, experts said. After finding out that there were other victims at the school, the victim filed a report with the college office in December. Duksung immediately conducted an internal probe and restricted the professor from contacting with the victim. She has been suffering from depression and insomnia since the incident, the school said. The school also secured an admission of wrongdoing from the professor, school officials said. In a police probe, however, he denied the charges, public investigators said. The police will summon the professor again soon, they added. The concerned faculty member was removed from his post earlier this month, the school said.Public anger has been high since a Seoul National University professor was indicted last year for sexually abusing students. Kang Seok-jin, a 53-year-old mathematics professor, was suspected of engaging in inappropriate physical contact with nine students between 2008 and 2014. He will face a second trial hearing next month. A national uproar was sparked after the school accepted Kang’s resignation without imposing any penalties. Recognizing his resignation would allow Kang to receive severance and pension payments and automatically wrap up the university’s internal probe into the case. As public criticism grew over the school’s leniency, the school withdrew the decision. The prestigious public school came under fire again earlier this month when another faculty member was suspected of making inappropriate remarks to female students. While the school is investigating the reported incident, the concerned professor is denying all allegations, university officials said. In response to the series of sexual crimes, SNU students formed a student body called “Communal Action” last week to better cope with sex offenses involving professors.The group will monitor the school’s internal probes into sexual abuse cases and the punishment process for the involved teaching staff, students said. The new body will also directly receive reports from students to help them report their cases, they added. Many of the victims tend to shy away from reporting abuses by professors because of the teachers’ authority and influence, CA said.

Police said the amount can be used by up to 500 people.Police believe the man was able to sneak it in through Incheon International Airport, South Korea's main gateway, since airport X-ray machines aren't able to detect the drug.In South Korea, he allegedly smoked five joints himself and tried to sell 34 grams to a Moroccan he met through a smartphone app, police said without naming the app.The Moroccan reported him to police before the transaction took place, authorities said. Lee was caught in the act as he tried to take out weed from his bag at the promised location in the northern Seoul district of Eunpyeong earlier this month.Lee does not have a history of drug-related crimes, although he confessed to having first encountered the drug when staying in Australia for about two years in the past, police said.Authorities said many young South Koreans are tempted to sell illegal drugs they acquire abroad since they go for five-times the price in their home country.Police are searching for any accomplices Lee might have had.

Regarding this argument, the court said his family should be able to visit him here.   At a hearing earlier in the day, Kato had promised to come back to South Korea for the defamation trial.   ""I have no thoughts of fleeing from this trial, which has become an international sensation,"" he told the judges.

The female student, whose father is Canadian and mother is Korean, was scolded by the teacher for not eating kimchi in her school in Suwon last June. The 50-year-old teacher asked her why she wouldn’t eat kimchi when “she is half-Korean,” and stated that her future (Korean) mother-in-law would not like it should she find out her daughter-in-law does not eat the traditional fermented Korean dish.“We acknowledge that the teacher, as an educator, caused great emotional distress to the student with an international background,” the court said.The teacher, who has some 30 years of teaching experience, had been awarded by the Suwon Office of Education in 2004 for her work.The Suwon Office of Education did not take any disciplinary action against her, other than issuing a simple warning, when the student’s parents filed an official complaint to the police in August. “Our rule is that teachers who have been awarded by the government get a certain degree of exemption when they face disciplinary action. If she hadn’t won the award, she would have faced heavier punishment,” Lee Won-mi from the Suwon Office of Education told The Korea Herald.In May last year, the teacher made the whole class call the student “stupid” thrice loudly for “asking too many questions” in class. Another time, the teacher asked those who take private education lessons outside of the classroom to raise their hands. Among the students who did, the teacher pointed at the multicultural student and said “you are particularly a (financial) burden on your parents.”The student, who moved to Korea from Canada with her parents in 2010, reportedly underwent therapy for a number of months after suffering emotionally from such remarks by the teacher.

The travel ban was renewed for another three months by the Ministry of Justice last month. Last week, Kato filed a lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court to get the ban canceled.In a statement, the Sankei Shimbun claimed that it had referred to statements from the National Assembly and a column in a Korean newspaper.

The de facto heiress of the flag carrier was found to have ordered the taxiing plane to return to the gate.The Seoul Seobu District Court acknowledged in its ruling the charges raised by the prosecution that Cho had violated a law banning passengers from pressuring crew members to deviate from the flight route.Its verdict clarified that Cho should be held accountable for obstructing aviation safety by abusing her authority. (Yonhap)In addition, the ruling reflected the charges that she physically and verbally assaulted a female flight attendant as well as the cabin crew chief.Park Chang-jin, the cabin manager who had been pressured off the flight, backed up the charges during his testimony in the formal trial hearing. He said Cho “hustled a (female) flight attendant with some abusive words.”Park, 44, said he had also been beaten by the defendant Cho, adding that both Cho and her father Cho Yang-ho, the chairman of Korean Air and its parent Hanjin Group, had yet to apologize to him over the “nut rage” incident.While Cho Hyun-ah did not make an official apology to the cabin crew chief, it has been found that she submitted a letter of apology to the district court six times.The prosecution had sought a three-year prison term for the former company vice president.Meanwhile, the court also handed down a jail term of eight months to a Korean Air executive director. In addition, a Transportation Ministry official was given a suspended prison term of six months with probation of one year.The prosecution earlier indicted Korean Air executive director Yeo Woon-jin on charges of destroying evidence related to the case. The 57-year-old was also accused of pressuring the cabin crew chief to minimize the case’s impact.A Transport Ministry official surnamed Kim was charged with leaking information about the ministry’s probe to the airline.Kim, 55, had reportedly phoned Yeo about 30 times and sent 10 text messages between Dec. 7 and the day before the ministry’s probe was launched, investigators said. The civil servant, a close confidant of Yeo, was later found to have worked at Korean Air for 15 years as a flight attendant and chief purser.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)","prison for obstructing aviation ,thursday sentenced cho hyun ,year in jail seoul ,court on thursday sentenced ,seoul court on thursday","['Seoul', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korean Air', 'Cho', 'New York', 'Seoul']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15180343 -0.04481599

He faked the official documents from July 2008 to May of last year, stealing most of the 310 million won that was supposed to have been paid to six researchers working for him, the BAI said.Although he claimed to have used the money to pay for his students’ tuitions, he failed to turn in the documents as proof, and students denied receiving any money from him.When the inspection commenced, the professor even attempted to conceal his crimes by having a subordinate hide a bag full of cash in his lab. The BAI recommended that the SNU fire him, while requesting the prosecutors to investigate the case. The auditors also notified five state-run bodies that commissioned the cited projects ― including the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning ― to find ways to collect the embezzled funds.The case was revealed in the BAI’s monthlong inspection from April to May last year, when the organization unearthed 68 cases of wrongdoings concerning R&D; funds by 21 state-run institutes and public companies.According to the BAI, each institute invested an average of 699.4 billion won on R&D;, but they added 872.2 billion won of unrelated costs to the R&D; budget. For example, some institutes would include costs for unrelated equipment and various employee training fees.The BAI also found that officials from the state-run bodies charged for the money they spent on pricey bars and karaoke ― which amounted to 119 million won from 2010-2013 ― as part of R&D; funding.

The Seoul High Court ruled that Won Sei-hoon, former director of the National Intelligence Service, interfered in the 2012 presidential election by ordering staff to make political postings online to sway public opinion. “The agency’s cyberactivity interfered in public’s decision-making while neglecting its duty to keep political impartiality, which is required by law,” the verdict read. “(The NIS) cannot avoid the fundamental criticism that it harmed democracy.” Judges rejected a lower court ruling that found that his orders were not intended to influence the election.  Won Sei-hoon (Yonhap)The 64-year-old had been sentenced to two years and six months in jail, suspended for four years, by the lower court last year for charges of violating the law governing the NIS. Public criticism has since grown over the ruling, which recognized Won’s interference in the election but not his support for a particular presidential candidate. The appeals court said he had directed his staff to post some 270,000 political messages online with 716 Twitter accounts against the opposition-bloc candidate Moon Jae-in. Won defended himself, claiming that “he worked for the country and public.” He was detained immediately after the court’s ruling. Won’s attorneys said they would consider appealing against the decision. After the court made the decision, the ruling Saenuri Party expressed “regrets” over the court’s ruling but acknowledged the necessity to “draft up preventive measures against such wrongdoings.”The main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy hailed the court’s decision, saying that “it is a landmark ruling that proves that constitutionalism is still alive.” Won, a confidant of former President Lee Myung-bak, headed the NIS for about four years until early 2013. The ex-spy chief served one year and two months in prison until last year for a separate bribery conviction. He was found guilty of having accepted kickbacks from a businessman while in office. Meanwhile, Kim Yong-pan, a former Seoul police chief who was suspected of soft-pedaling a probe into the high-profile election-meddling scandal, was acquitted by the top court late last month.

Given this, it is appropriate to destroy it,” the ruling said.The prosecution had claimed that whether it was a first draft or finished transcript, any such document should be preserved and transferred to the national archives. Last month, prosecutors sought a two-year jail term for both Baek and Cho.The content of the summit transcript was at the center of political controversy during the 2012 presidential election. Saenuri Party lawmakers claimed that during the summit between Roh and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Roh renounced the Northern Limit Line as a de facto inter-Korean border ― a claim that could hurt the voter sentiment against opposition candidate Moon Jae-in, who served as Roh’s chief of staff.By Song Sang-ho (sshluck@heraldcorp.com)","record deletion charges seoul ,cleared two former presidential ,deletion charges seoul court ,ex presidential aides cleared ,deletion charges seoul","['Seoul', 'inter - korean', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Roh Moo - hyun']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21843916  0.29350805

As of now, a group of 100 test-takers have filed a separate lawsuit against the state, demanding to be compensated for damage inflicted upon them by the flawed question. Last year’s ruling that the Suneung question was flawed touched off public concern over the accuracy of the annual test, and further concerns arose after the discovery of two more errors on the 2014 exam. Amid criticism, the government promptly vowed to revamp the tests and will announce its plans by March.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","wednesday dismissed lawsuit against ,on wednesday dismissed lawsuit ,wednesday dismissed lawsuit ,court on wednesday dismissed ,commissioned college entrance exam",['Seoul High Court'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1332818  -0.0795387

The newspaper is published by the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, or Chongryon. The panel, chaired by a deputy premier of the Cabinet, involves officials from the central bank, the foreign ministry, the finance ministry, and law-enforcement authorities, he added.  The North has already revised its penal code to take punitive measures against related violations in accordance with international norms, said Kim.  In January, Pyongyang said that it sent a letter to the FATF, based in Paris, pledging the sincere implementation of an action plan to meet global anti-money laundering standards.

He was also found guilty of defecting from his unit with weapons and killing a superior officer.A soldier who kills a superior officer can be sentenced to death, according to Korea’s military laws. Army sergeant identified by the surname Lim is seen after appearing in court in Wonju, Gangwon Province on Jan. 16. (Yonhap)“The accused has committed a tenacious and elaborate crime. A death penalty is inevitable for the cruelty of gunning down innocent comrades,” the General Military Court of the First Army Headquarters in Wonju, Gangwon Province, said. “He also discarded his duties as a soldier to protect the safety and property of people. (The court) must hold him accountable for causing a severe security vacuum, and sound an alarm against such a horrid crime.”The court also pointed out that rather than apologize to the victims, he complained about his own sufferings and blamed fellow soldiers for the deaths.  Investigators had said Lim must receive capital punishment for “committing a ruthless and premeditated crime against unarmed men.” They added he had shown no signs of remorse and attempted to justify his crimes by saying he had been bullied by his colleagues in the barracks.A month before the incident, Lim had reportedly been involved in a quarrel with another soldier.His legal representative complained that the court had ignored several testimonies proving that Lim had been bullied, and said he would launch an appeal.A family representative of the victims said it was an “obvious ruling” and urged authorities to make sure such an incident would not reoccur. A psychiatric evaluation of Lim released in January indicated signs of paranoia typically found in bullying victims, but concluded that these were within a normal range.At 8:15 p.m. on June 21, Lim detonated a grenade and opened fire in and outside his unit’s barracks, killing or injuring a dozen soldiers. He then fled the scene with a K-2 rifle, 60 bullets and a grenade.He was captured the next day north of the Civilian Access Control Line near the border after a gunfight with troops attempting to apprehend him.Lim joined the Army in December 2012 for his mandatary military service and was to be discharged in September 2014.The case is the worst military killing spree since 2005, when a soldier killed eight people and left two seriously injured. It also underscored the immense stress general outpost units are forced to endure, including the physical and mental pressure of having to stand guard for long hours in an isolated area.Right before the accident, Lim had conducted vigilance duty for nearly six hours.A 2012 report published by the Korea Armed Forces Nursing Academy showed that about 12.8 percent of GOP soldiers were heavily stressed, due mainly to “lack of personal time” and the “tedious and unchanging work.”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","who killed five soldiers ,sentence for murder spree ,army sergeant who killed ,for murder spree military ,death sentence for murder","['Army', 'inter - korean', 'Lim', 'Army Division', 'Goseong , Gangwon Province']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15534659 -0.05556285

They claimed it was the first step toward rail privatization and bound to result in job losses and reduced benefits.  Union members and striking rail workers clashed with police officers outside the headquarters of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in central Seoul on Dec. 22 as officers forced their way into the building to round up union leaders from the state-run rail operator for questioning.

The incident sparked public outrage in South Korea.Cho has been charged with air safety violations as well as coercing staff to give false testimony and interfering in the execution of their duty.In court on Monday, chief purser Park Chang-Jin accused Cho of treating flight attendants like ""feudal slaves"" and urged her to reflect sincerely on her ""irrational and senseless"" conduct.""I think Cho did not show an ounce of conscience, treating powerless people like myself as feudal slaves and forcing us to sacrifice unilaterally,"" he said in a tearful voice.""Like a beast that found its prey gritting its teeth, she yelled and became violent, never listening to what I said,"" he said.Park has said Cho made him kneel and beg for forgiveness while jabbing him with a service manual.On Monday Cho apologized for her ""rash"" conduct but insisted the affair originated from the breach of the service manual by flight attendants.She denied using violence against Park and said the pilot made a final decision to force him off the plane.Her lawyers have argued that there had been no breach of safety laws, given that the plane had not even reached the runway when it turned back.Prosecutors also demanded a two-year jail sentence each for a company executive charged with evidence-tampering and a transport ministry official, who is accused of leaking details of a government probe into the case.Cho, the eldest daughter of Korean Air chief Cho Yang-Ho, has been in custody since Dec. 30.Cho Yang-Ho has said no crew members would lose their jobs over the incident or subsequent investigations.But Park, who returned to work on Sunday, expressed concern about possible damage to his career -- saying he had been treated like an ""expendable.""The incident was seen as emblematic of a generation of spoilt and arrogant offspring of owners of the giant family-run conglomerates, or ""chaebols,"" that dominate the economy.The story hit international headlines and was seen as something of a national embarrassment, with South Korean media commentators suggesting Cho had shamed the country.The transport ministry plans to sanction KAL with a limited flight route ban that could last for up to a month, or fines of up to $2 million.

Further, Cho faces charges of physically and verbally assaulting a female flight attendant as well as the cabin crew chief.

The arrest warrant was issued by Seoul Central District Court.The 62-year-old is believed to have received about 770 million ($702,000) from STX Engine and STX Offshore and Shipbuilding, according to a government task force on military corruption. The bribe was allegedly made in exchange for helping the companies win supplying contracts for engines and ships in 2008. The transaction was made via a yacht company of which Jung’s son is a majority shareholder, according to investigators. The junior Jung held a yacht competition at a fleet review hosted by the Navy in October 2008, where the two affiliates of STX Group handed his company 380 million won as “advertisement fees.”Investigators took Jung and his son into custody on Wednesday and questioned him whether there were any strings attached to the payment. They believe Jung demanded the money through a man surnamed Yun, who was at the time an outside director of STX.Jung had denied the accusations, but investigators said they had acquired testimony to back the charges from Yun and other former high-ranking officials of STX.This is not the first time Jung has been accused of wrongdoing; in 2012, a local court sentenced him to a two year prison term suspended for three years on charge of embezzling the Navy’s welfare fund while he held the top post. Jung served as the Navy’s chief of naval operations for two years from March 2008.He became the highest profile military personnel to be arrested since a pan-government probe into Korea’s military defense acquisition programs kicked off in November. The ongoing probe has uncovered rampant corruption links between defense firms and the military.Last week, a former Navy rear admiral under investigation for his alleged involvement in a graft case jumped into Seoul’s Han River in an apparent suicide attempt. His body is yet to be found.“Investigations on these corruption cases cannot be concluded as just wrongdoings of a few high-ranking officials, and must be used as a chance to stamp out systematic corruption within the military,” the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy said Sunday in a public statement.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","chief detained for bribery ,custody saturday on charges ,for bribery former chief ,former navy chief detained ,detained for bribery former","['Navy', 'Seoul Central District Court', 'STX Engine', 'STX Offshore and Shipbuilding']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16885374  0.05293065

The Supreme Court said it was clear that the extreme work pressure led to his suicide, overturning a decision by a lower court that the company was not responsible for his death. The top court returned the case to the Seoul High Court for review. “Oh worked at the company normally and even moved up the corporate ladder until the company decided to send him overseas. The pressure of having to use English fluently, coupled with his fear that his poor language skills could cause the company damage, appears to have resulted in extreme work-related pressure that accelerated his depression,” the court said in its ruling.The botched dispatch to Kuwait had severe effects on Oh. He suffered from extreme depression even though he was relocated to the company’s head office in Seoul and was promoted as a department head months later.“I don’t even know how I’ll face my subordinates when I can’t even work overseas because I can’t speak English,” he reportedly told his family. In December 2008, five months after he decided to stay in Seoul, he jumped to his death from the company building.Oh’s wife filed a lawsuit against the Korean Workers’ Compensation and Welfare Service in 2010, claiming Oh’s death was the result of an industrial accident and the family should receive benefits.But the Seoul Administrative Court dismissed her case, saying that it was reasonable for the company to ask Oh to work overseas. It added that the source of his stress had been removed when the company overturned its decision to send him to Kuwait. Korean law stipulates that if a worker commits suicide, it should be considered an industrial accident if it has been medically proven that the victim committed the act while his or her power of restraint, cognitive ability or decision-making capability was substantially compromised by work-related stress. The victim also needs to have been treated for a mental condition stemming from work-related stress.In spite of the previous ruling, the Supreme Court said there was a substantial connection between Oh’s death and his work. The psychological pains stemming from Oh’s fear of being disadvantaged at the company for his inability to work overseas were very severe, it said.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","killed himself in 2008 ,committed suicide after worrying ,man who committed suicide ,surname oh killed himself ,accident the supreme court","['the Supreme Court', 'Kuwait']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19658165  0.0879133

Comedian Lee Soo-geun (SM C&C;)Lee is only one of many celebrities who have been rapped by the courts for allegedly violating their legal duty to “maintain a positive conduct” as models for their respective advertisers.Last week, the court ordered actress Lee Seung-yeon, who was put on probation for drug abuse in 2013, to compensate the company she was representing by paying 100 million won. K-pop girl group Kara, who was entangled in a legal battle with its agency last year, was forced to pay 50 million won to the company that the group endorsed. Companies that hired actress Clara -- who is currently in a controversial dispute with her agency -- as their model, are reportedly preparing to file a damage suit against the actress.What exactly are the legal grounds for the celebrities to compensate the companies they represent for what may seem like “private issues?”One major source of legal power comes from the contents of the original contract signed between both sides.Typically included in such contracts is a key clause stipulating that the star must maintain a positive conduct and refrain from any behavior that will damage the image of the company or its product.Such a clause gives the advertiser legal power to file a damage suit against the hired model, who may have harmed the advertiser’s reputation through whatever form of public misconduct.In determining the degree of responsibility as well as the amount of compensation that must be paid, the presence or absence of action-specific clauses is important, legal experts say.Most contracts include a clause that outlines specific procedures for different situations -- in case the celebrity is indicted for criminal activities or commits acts publicly deemed immoral, the celebrity must pay back twice the amount originally received for the modeling service.When such clauses are absent, the settlement process becomes more complex. The prosecution must provide evidence that clearly shows the amount of financial and public damage suffered due to lapses by the celebrity.Perhaps more important is defining the so-called notion of “positive conduct and behavior” and its boundaries. For the notion is by nature subjective, it is often difficult to draw the line between a celebrity’s right to privacy and freedom of action, and the profit-related concerns of the company that hired them as models.More often than not, a number of unfortunate celebrities suffer serious damage to their public image due to issues that are out of their control.One such victim is actor Lee Byung-hun, who is married to actress Lee Min-Jung. Lee’s reputation plummeted when video footage suggesting that he was involved in a romantic relationship with a singer and model began circulating.Though the court later proved that the two women blackmailed Lee for financial gains, he ended up losing many key advertising contracts as public opinion had turned against him.To protect the rights of both the celebrities and the companies that hire them as models, it is important that both parties draw up clauses as specifically as possible when signing an advertising contract, legal experts said.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)","probation for illegal gambling ,illegal gambling in 2013 ,for illegal gambling ,probation for illegal ,for illegal gambling in","['South Korea', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee Soo - geun']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12952863 -0.05501099

Investigators said that financial difficulties might have led him to commit the heinous crime. A graduate of a prestigious college, Kang had been unemployed for three years after leaving his job at an Oriental medicine clinic in southern Seoul. After taking out a bank loan of 500 million won (US$454,000) with his apartment put up as collateral, he lost a large sum in unprofitable stock investments, according to the investigators.

""He even used an aerosol spray to build a tongue of flame.""After running away from his home, he had wandered around the capital area before being caught by police on Wednesday.

Being classified as Class-A soldiers bans the conscripts from frontline duties, but it does not mean they are exempted or discharged from the mandatory two-year military service. ""As he was not very good at his duties in his artillery unit, he was specially mentored by his senior colleague.

She had claimed the service was in violation of the proper nut-serving protocol.Another witness to appear at Friday's hearing is the female flight attendant who had served the nuts to Cho.It would mark the first time the woman, identified only by her surname Kim, made a public appearance.Court officials said she will be escorted into the court room through a private hallway.It is unclear whether the chief of the cabin crew will take the witness stand this day, as prosecutors' mailed request to have him as a witness was returned for an unknown reason.

It was also the first Supreme Court trial related to the election scandal.The then NIS head Won Sei-hoon is currently standing an appellate trial over charges of meddling in politics and the 2012 election.A lower court found him guilty of the former but not of the latter.

Jung Ok-geun allegedly took bribes from STX Group, a now financially troubled shipping and shipbuilding conglomerate, in the form of sponsorship to a yacht event in October 2008, a government anti-corruption task force said.The group's two subsidiaries, which produce high-speed vessels and engines for naval vessels, paid 770 million won (US$704,000) to the event organized by a company whose majority stake was owned by Jung's eldest son, investigators said.The yacht company went out of business shortly thereafter, raising suspicions that it may have been a paper company. Investigators are focused on whether the sponsorship was a cover-up for bribes. They believe STX paid Jung and his son to award it contracts for the nation's shipbuilding projects.Jung headed the Navy for two years from March 2008, meaning the alleged bribery took place while he was in office, investigators said.His son was arrested a day earlier on the same charges.The then STX head, Kang Duk-soo, who decided to sponsor the yacht event, had also been interrogated. He is currently serving a six-year jail sentence for embezzlement and malpractice.The government has tightened oversight of the defense industry since late last year after an expensive homegrown ship failed to rescue those missing from a ferry disaster in April. The disaster claimed more than 300 lives.

Just three kilometers from the scene, another Park nephew was found hanging from a tree.Wrapping up their investigation into the two cases, police had concluded that one nephew murdered the other before committing suicide by hanging himself due to financial disputes.In his reports, Baek cited a legal dispute between Park Ji-man and his brother-in-law, arguing that Park was also involved in the crime.

The company was declared bankrupt last month.After wrapping up a month-long investigation, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it has decided to press additional charges against Park, alleging that he borrowed 3.4 trillion won from banks by keeping up this facade from October 2007 to last September. He has yet to pay back 550 billion won to these 10 banks, prosecutors said.Not only did Moneual pretend to export computers, it also jacked up the price of these hypothetical computers by at least 100-fold to between 2-3 million won, prosecutors said.Park also faces charges of over-reporting Moneual's sales and net profit by a combined 2.7 trillion won. Prosecutors believe Moneual initially reported it exports via KT ENS, an affiliate of South Korea's telecom giant KT Corp., but started doing so itself as the loans ballooned.They also believe Park and the two executives bribed export and tax authorities around 2012 to evade scrutiny. Prosecutors allege that the three spent about 860 million won to this end and succeeded at stretching Moneual's insurance and loan limits by tens of millions of won.Prosecutors said Moneual appears to have been able to do this because authorities never checked to see if their statements were true. They called for legal revisions to prevent similar scams.

The Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to one year and six months in prison, suspended for two years.Put out by the South Korean foreign ministry in December 2010, the press release claimed the company won a project near the southeastern Cameroon town of Yokodouma to mine about 420 million carats of diamonds, or 2.5 times the annual global production at the time, prosecutors said.The news sent CNK shares jumping more than fivefold in the first three weeks, from about 3,000 won apiece to 16,100 won.The mine, however, was later found to hold only 6 percent of the claimed reserves. The project was eventually handed over to a Chinese company.In the same ruling, the court also acquitted another key defendant in the case -- Kim Eun-seok, the former Energy and Resources ambassador at the foreign ministry -- of charges that he colluded with Oh in the scheme. Kim was alleged to have played a role in getting the foreign ministry to issue the press release on the diamond project.Prosecutors initially sought prison terms of 10 and five years against Oh and Kim, respectively.

It said that the existence of the “Revolutionary Organization,” said to be the group that discussed the revolt, was based “merely on speculation,” and that there was no agreement among RO members to actually carry out the revolt.The ruling came a little over a month after the Constitutional Court handed down an unprecedented ruling to disband the UPP on the grounds that the aim of the party was to ultimately realize “North Korean-style socialism” and ran counter to the basic democratic order of South Korean society.“The defendants called for implementing concrete activities including destroying national infrastructure as forces in charge of revolution in the South while anticipating that a war would break out. Thus, this confirms their guilt of encouraging a revolt,” said the court in its ruling.“But to constitute the crime of plotting a rebellion, the agreement on the targets of the rebellion and the actual danger should be recognized. But the evidence is insufficient to recognize that the defendants conspired to subvert the government or prepare for (a revolt).” Lee Seok-ki, a former lawmaker of the Unified Progressive Party, enters the Supreme Court room to attend his verdict hearing in Seocho-dong, Seoul, Thursday. (Yonhap)The court added that should the crime of plotting a revolt be constituted when there are only simple exchanges of views on a revolt, this could undermine people’s basic rights and freedom of thought and expression.After his sentence was meted out, Lee, grim-faced and wearing a black suit, shouted towards his supporters in the courtroom, “Criminal justice has died!”The court also upheld the lower court’s ruling to sentence six other former UPP members to jail terms ranging from three to five years on the same charges. The ruling came a day after the Justice Ministry vowed to establish legal grounds to forcibly disband “antistate” entities.The main gate of the top court in southern Seoul was surrounded by police officers trying to calm down scores of members from both progressive and conservative civic groups, which underscored the country’s intense ideological division over the issue.Left-leaning activists called for the release of Lee and other detainees, accusing the conservative government of politically branding them as “pro-North Korea,” while others demanded tough punishments for those supporting the communist regime in Pyongyang.Lee was arrested in November 2013 on a set of charges including plotting an armed revolt by leading the RO. Lee has continued to deny the charges, claiming the judicial process against him was “politically motivated” to suppress liberals.The rebellion scandal broke out in August 2013 after agents from the National Intelligence Service raided the homes and offices of Lee and nine other UPP members on suspicion of plotting to subvert the government during RO gatherings that year. Last February, a district court sentenced Lee to 12 years in jail, convicting him of conspiring to overthrow the government, encouraging a revolt and violating the National Security Law. The six other members of the RO were also convicted, receiving jail terms ranging from four to seven years.Six months later, the appeals court reduced Lee’s jail term to nine years, acquitting him of plotting a revolt. The court said that the claim regarding the existence of the RO ― which allegedly conceived of staging a revolt ― was based only on an informant’s speculation.During court proceedings, prosecutors have revealed the transcripts of the two gatherings in May and December 2013, at which RO members allegedly talked of “revolution” and a plan to destroy social infrastructure. Lee’s side has argued that the transcripts were tampered with and cannot be adopted as court evidence.

The 25-year-old day care worker in Incheon was suspected of having hit a dozen 4-year-old children habitually and verbally abused them for not following the curriculum. This is the second arrest warrant sought for a day care employee in the city this year. A 33-year-old teacher was arrested last week for striking a 4-year-old boy for not finishing a meal. As public outrage escalated over the case, the police have launched an intensive anti-child-abuse campaign.While the day care worker admitted that she had hit the children since October last year, she claimed that her actions were aimed at improving their learning, the Incheon police said. Investigators have uncovered more than 60 cases of child abuse from surveillance camera footage over the past 30 days. The city government said it would suspend or permanently shut down the day care center in question. Meanwhile, the police are conducting a probe into two other child abuse cases at child care facilities reported earlier this month, authorities said.

Lee was sentenced to eight months in prison, with two years suspended, in November 2013 for abusing the drug at least 320 times over six years. The Seoul Central District Court ordered Lee to pay 100 million won ($92,000) to her former advertiser Tong Yang Group, which filed for financial compensation from the actress and her management agency in January 2013. DongYang Group claimed that the drug controversy tarnished the actress’ image, making her unable to properly fulfill the contract. The company signed a one-year contract with Lee in 2012, offering her a modeling fee of 450 million won for a commercial for its fashion brand. The contract specifically indicates that the model must not create controversy, commit any wrongdoings or taint the image of the brand.“The probe into Lee’s drug abuse case made it socially unacceptable for her to continue to appear in a TV ad,” the court said in a ruling. “Thus, the defendant has the obligation to compensate for the damage.” The 46-year-old actress promoted the brand on cable TV channels 14 times from February to December 2012 until she was accused of receiving propofol injections at various hospitals for nonmedical purposes in January 2013. Fellow actresses Park Si-yeon and Jang Mi-inae were also sentenced to eight months in jail, with two years suspended, for the same charge. Propofol, an anesthetic commonly used during plastic surgery, is known to cause hallucinations and could lead to death when overdosed. The drug was blamed for the death of American pop legend Michael Jackson in 2009. Lee debuted in 1993 with a drama “Our Paradise” after nabbing third place in the Miss Korea beauty pageant. She enjoyed immense popularity with highly rated dramas “First Love” and “Love Is in Your Embrace” in early 1990s.

The Korea Communications Commission said in a statement that the decision came at its regular meeting.  The referral for an investigation against Uber Korea claims that its location-tracking function is not registered with the authorities. A violator can be punished with a penalty of up to 30 million won ($24,647) or a 3-year imprisonment, according to local law.""As we've reached a consensus that (the company) has breached the law, it is an appropriate measure to refer the matter to the prosecution,"" KCC Chairman Choi Sung-joon said at the meeting. The ride-booking app offers a taxi or private car upon online requests from users via its smartphone application. Once a user makes a ride request, he or she can track the location of the reserved vehicle shown on the app. The KCC's decision came months after the Seoul Metropolitan Government said it was seeking to refer the company to the KCC with intent to suspend the app. Choi said that the company will not be exonerated for flouting the law even after Uber becomes registered through proper procedures. ""Whether to approve the registration will be decided based on a thorough review,"" he added.As is the case in other cities overseas, Uber Korea has been involved in a slew of legal issues here along with a strong backlash from taxi drivers since it first launched the service in Seoul in 2013. The latest came in December last year when the prosecutors in Seoul indicted Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and the head of the Korean unit for violation of a rule that states all vehicles for business purposes must be licensed. The Seoul city government began offering a million won ($921) reward this month to those who report private or rented cars that operate using Uber, in line with the official request from South Korea's transport ministry last year for a crackdown on Uber drivers and users. The scrutiny has led Uber to compromise by adjusting its business model. Earlier in the week, the company said it partnered up with a local cab company based in Incheon, the third-largest city in Korea, to connect users to a licensed taxi as an effort of compliance to local regulations. Uber had resisted such criticism and called for readjustment in legal discrepancy, saying that operating a cab service through a mobile app is not illegal according to local law. Founded in 2010, the San Francisco, California-based venture startup currently operates in over 200 cities around the world. In Korea, the company first kicked off with its premium limousine service UberBlack and expanded to the private ride-booking business UberX and UberTaxi.

The Jan. 7 ruling marked the first time that a local court has convicted a man for spousal rape that does not involve the use of a deadly weapon.The man married his wife, who is 20 years his junior, in 2012 through an international marriage agency. He was convicted of raping her about 10 times during the first two months of their marriage, as well as physically abusing her. His wife managed to escape from the house and file a complaint against him to the police with the support of a women’s rights group.“The plaintiff didn’t know anyone in South Korea other than her husband, who was physically abusive,” the court said. “We acknowledge that it would’ve been very difficult for her to actively resist her husband.” The man received a sentence of five years in prison after the first trial by the Jeju District Court last year, which he appealed to the Gwangju High Court. During the appeal process, the plaintiff settled with him for an undisclosed sum. On Jan. 7, he received a conditional suspended sentence of four years. “Many men still think rape can’t occur within marriage,” said a women’s rights activist who did not want to be named. “We hope more women who are suffering from domestic violence can come forward and seek justice after this ruling.”In 2009, a Busan district court acknowledged for the first time in South Korean history that marital rape was a crime.The convicted man, who was 42, had been sentenced to a suspended 30-month prison term, but was found hanged at his home in Busan four days later in an apparent suicide. He had been convicted of raping his then 25-year-old wife, who was originally from the Philippines, after threatening her with a knife.By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com)","raping migrant wife korean ,man convicted of raping ,convicted of raping migrant ,raping migrant wife ,man for spousal rape",['korean'],7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24368498 -0.2063095

The usurer has been standing trial on separate charges for the past two and a half years.""Because some of Choi's relatives have been involved, we thought if Choi was questioned without detention, there is a chance he might ask them to change their testimony to his favor,"" a prosecution official said in explaining the absence of a warrant.""We also took into account that he appeared psychologically unstable.""Choi had been probed since last April, and was most recently questioned a day earlier.He reportedly told prosecutors that he had only borrowed 300 million won from a different businessman and that he had paid it off in six months.But prosecutors said the money appeared to have been from the loan shark who is standing trial and whom Choi met when he was a prosecutor in 2008. Choi was in charge of the man's drug-related case, and the two realized they were from the same hometown.This marks the first time in eight years that a sitting judge has been investigated over bribery allegations. The last time was in 2006, when a Seoul High Court judge faced similar charges.Prosecutors said they plan to request a formal arrest warrant for the judge before the emergency arrest period expires after two days. They also said they are considering filing criminal charges against three prosecution officials who allegedly took tens of millions of won in bribes from the same businessman.Following the emergency arrest, the Supreme Court said it will take ""strong and stern action"" against the judge, holding him accountable for his alleged wrongdoing.But the top court said it will carefully consider whether to accept his resignation, which would make it impossible to take disciplinary measures against Choi, who earlier offered to step down.

The accused worker has admitted to the accusations, and police are planning to take her into custody after conducting further investigation into surveillance footage at the center.Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency said it has booked three teachers at an English kindergarten in Bucheon, between Seoul and Incheon, on suspicion of mistreating children and the manager for allegedly overlooking the abuse. The parents of children at the kindergarten had filed complaints against them to local police in November, claiming the teachers took the students to dark rooms to beat them.This still image from CCTV footage of a day care center in Bugae-dong, Incheon, shows a 25-year-old female worker punching a preschooler. (Yonhap)Officials said the suspected abusers have admitted to using disciplinary measures, but denied using violence.“The CCTV images show the teachers taking the children to a blind spot of the cameras, but it is not enough to say with certainty that there has been violence,” an official said. But as the surveillance images do show the children being punished, police are planning to recommend to the prosecutors that they indict the accused.A parent of a 3-year-old in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, also filed complaints to the police that her son may have been mistreated at a day care center, after she found bruises on his buttocks. Nationwide concern about child abuse by child care workers has erupted since a 33-year-old worker at an Incheon day care center was seen on CCTV footage slapping and punching a child for not finishing her meal. A subsequent investigation found further abuses by the worker ― including making death threats to another child ― and a court issued an arrest warrant for her on Saturday.The case prompted the government to toughen punishments for child abuse by child care workers. Both the ruling Saenuri Party and the Welfare Ministry have released plans to implement measures to increase child protection at day care centers, including requiring surveillance cameras and strengthening the required qualifications for staff.The authorities will also implement a “one strike” system, in which a day care center would be shut down after a single case of child abuse is found. The perpetrator and the head of the facility would also be permanently banned from working in similar jobs. Even child care workers themselves said the government needs to implement stricter standards for day care workers.Hwangbo Eun-hee, who studies early childhood education at Sookmyung University, carried out a survey on workers in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, 87 percent said they thought the current vetting system needs improvement. The respondents also generally welcomed the idea of conducting a personality evaluation and aptitude tests when certifying child care workers, giving the idea an average of 4.19 points out of 5.Last week, Rep. Shin Hak-yong of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy proposed a bill mandating character education in the training course for child care workers at colleges. “There has been nationwide concern over the qualifications of child care workers. We (lawmakers) need to ensure such concerns are addressed and the qualified workers are not penalized in any way,” said Shin. “The bill will contribute to find effective countermeasures (against child abuse by child care workers).”By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)","after nanny beating incident ,incheon abused several preschool ,nanny beating incident reports ,abused several preschool children ,after nanny beating","['Incheon', 'Incheon ’s Samsan Police Station', 'Bugae', 'Incheon']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53517306  0.25232375

Kim Sang-hun, 47, was arrested Tuesday for killing his wife’s ex-husband and his stepdaughter while holding the four hostage in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. Kim demanded that his wife come to see him during the five-hour standoff. The suspect committed the crime because he suspected that his estranged wife had rekindled her relationship with her ex-husband, the police said. Four days before the hostage crisis, Kim’s wife had asked the police to arrest Kim, claiming that her husband had stabbed her in the thigh with a knife the day before, investigators said.Under the current antidomestic violence measures, the police are allowed to separate an offender from family members in an emergency. The counseling police officer, however, had rejected her demand, saying that it was impossible to nab Kim since he was not caught at the crime scene. Instead, the police officer had advised her to file a suit, the investigators added. Receiving no urgent support, the wife had taken refuge at a motel with her children, and then moved to her ex-husband’s house, where the tragedy occurred, they added. The police said they had launched an internal probe into whether the concerned police station had overlooked the wife’s request for help. They also vowed to consider revamping the counseling system to better deal with emergency situations. Meanwhile, Kim confessed that he had sexually harassed his 16-year-old stepdaughter before stabbing her to death, the police said. The investigators also uncovered that he had committed a lewd act in front of the victim, and then attempted to rape her.While the attacker admitted having taken them hostage, he blamed others for the deaths of the victims. “This is unfair. I’m also a victim of this case,” he told the media before being taken into custody on Thursday. “The authorities are trying to silence me. My wife ignored her daughters’ request to be rescued,” he added. The biological father and his daughter were killed before the police were dispatched to the scene, the authorities said. The other two female hostages were rescued unharmed.

The 33-year-old day care provider, identified only by her surname Yang, was accused of striking a 4-year-old female child’s face in Incheon last week. Doubts mounted over the state’s monitoring system after it was found that Yang had received a first-grade day care teacher certificate and that the facility where the incident took place received 95 out of 100 points on the Welfare Ministry’s evaluation. A mother stages a protest to urge the government to strengthen child abuse prevention measures at Songdo International City, Incheon, Thursday. (Yonhap)Yang admitted Monday that she had punched the child, but she claimed that the act was part of discipline measures to correct the child’s bad habit, investigators said. The police secured surveillance camera footage at the day care facility from the last 24 days, which is the maximum storage period, to look into any further charges against Yang. The investigators also collected witness accounts from parents of 16 other students who reportedly shared similar experiences.Yang had reportedly been fired from another day care facility for locking a child in a room, according to the parents’ accounts. The police planned to seek the arrest warrant by early Friday.Families of the children are considering legal action against the day care center.The ministry immediately suspended the operation of the day care center, and said it would be permanently shut down once Yang is convicted. As concerns grew over the child care system, the police vowed to conduct intensive monitoring of all child-related facilities as part of the efforts to prevent child abuse. The ruling Saenuri Party also pledged to tighten child care regulations. “(The government and the ruling party) will make sure to amend the anti-child abuse measures this time.

""The part Kim supplied was a crucial piece of equipment, meaning the ramifications of his actions were significant.""Judge Cho, however, said he considered the fact that the piece of equipment provided by Kim was not one of the faulty parts discovered last year.""Thankfully, the piece of equipment he supplied didn't have any defects, so I took that into account,"" he said.Last year, the military said the Tongyeong's sonar system was dysfunctional and its remotely-operated vehicle unable to scale underwater structures during nationwide efforts to save the victims of the ferry sinking.The announcement prompted a government investigation into allegations of bribery and other underhanded dealings between military officials and defense firms.In late December, the vessel was delivered to the Navy after passing an operational capability test.

More than 300 people, mostly teenagers, perished with the ferry, making it one of the deadliest disasters in modern South Korean history.The KCG took much of the flak for the heavy death toll, as many blamed the government's poor initial response for the massive loss of life.In a live interview aired on April 18, Hong posed as a civilian diver and told the MBN channel that the Coast Guard was preventing her peers from trying to rescue those missing.She also said one of the divers was able to communicate with the survivors through the ferry's hull.But soon, allegations that she may have lied emerged, as she was also found to have claimed she was a cousin of a famous South Korean girl group singer in the past.Despite her history, however, the Mokpo branch of the Gwangju District Court said Hong was not guilty of libel because it was difficult to prove that her claims were false.""What she posted on social media and told the cable channel seems to have been meant to spur an effective government response to the disaster,"" Judge Jang Jeong-hwan said in a ruling. ""It is difficult to say whether it was untrue or constituted defamation of the KCG.""The judge, however, conceded that her actions were inappropriate.""But this is not to justify her actions. There were inappropriate aspects of her behavior, which were dangerous throughout the trial,"" he added.Prosecutors had sought a year and a half jail term for the woman.

While indicting Cho Wednesday, the Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office filed the additional charge that she had interfered in the Transport Ministry’s probe by having company officials attempt to cover up the case and manipulate evidence. The prosecution also indicted a Korean Air executive, surnamed Yeo, on charges of destroying evidence and forcing crewmembers involved to give false testimony to minimize the impact of the case.  A senior prosecutor announces the result of the probe into the so-called “nut rage” incident involving Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah at a press conference in Seoul, Wednesday. (Yonhap)A Transport Ministry official, surnamed Kim, was also charged with leaking information on the investigation to the airline. Kim, a former Korean Air employee for 15 years, phoned Yeo about 30 times and exchanged 10 text messages between Dec. 7 and the day before the ministry’s probe was launched, according to the prosecution. Yeo and Kim were both arrested late last month along with Cho. The prosecution said it would launch an additional investigation into the Transport Ministry over suspicions that public servants had received special favors from Korean Air. Some ranking officials were accused of having their seats upgraded regularly for free.The ministry began to investigate the “nut rage” incident on Dec. 8 ahead of the prosecution’s probe as the public criticism escalated.Public anger grew over the ministry’s investigation after the deplaned cabin crew member claimed in a media interview that the probe had proceeded unfairly. He said that officials from the airline had been present during the probe, and that he had been ordered to revise his written testimony more than 10 times. Facing public doubts over the suspicious relationship between the ministry and the company, the ministry conducted an internal inquiry into its own probe and admitted that the investigation process had not been conducted impartially. The case has gained keen international attention with critics at home and abroad arguing that the incident was an epitome of social injustice. The case has also shed light on those on the receiving end of anger from those in high authority, raising public calls for a change in the rigid, hierarchical corporate culture.By Lee Hyun-jeong (rene@heraldcorp.com)","daughter of the airline ,changing flight plans violence ,while indicting cho wednesday ,flight plans violence ,heiress faces further charge","['Korean Air', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Cho', 'the Seoul Western District Prosecutors ’ o']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15963472  0.01463905

A local court in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, on Tuesday dismissed a case filed by Lee Min-bok, a North Korean defector who leads the leaflet distribution drive, seeking 50 million won ($45,000) in compensation from the government for inflicting emotional distress by stopping his work last year. While endorsing his right to express his opinions through the flyers, the verdict said his campaign may place the people’s lives and bodies in “clear and existing danger,” which could be sufficient reason to limit the fundamental rights, citing North Korea’s repeated threats of retaliation and a recent exchange of fire across the border. The two Koreas traded fire in October after the North began shooting heavy machine guns, apparently aiming at balloons released by civic groups including Lee’s, which were filled with leaflets denouncing the communist regime, $1 bills, mini radios and other items.The court decision appears to be deepening the dilemma for Seoul over how to balance the need to improve inter-Korean ties and ensure the citizens’ freedom of expression and assembly and association.While the campaign could serve as a crucial public diplomacy tool toward North Koreans beyond the government’s role, they at times help heighten tension and thus set hurdles for Seoul’s policy goals. Doubtful about imposing any ban, the Unification Ministry pledged to work more with the police but upheld its principles. “We will provide support so that the police could take necessary safety measures to prevent any potential damage to the citizens’ lives, bodies or property,” ministry spokesman Lim Byeong-cheol told reporters Wednesday.“The necessary safety measures do not mean any physical, direct restriction on the leaflet launches that constitute the freedom of expression. … The government has been and will continue to handle the issue by comprehensively considering North Korea’s threats against the South and the possibilities of a physical clash involving our citizens.” The government has been coming under mounting pressure in particular since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un displayed his willingness for “highest-level talks” with South Korea in his New Year speech. Another defector organization recently sent a batch of balloons containing some 1.3 million anti-Pyongyang handouts, triggering concerns that it would thwart the nascent mood for a cross-border rapprochement.The North’s state media on Wednesday lashed out at Seoul for not stopping the liftoff, demanding that it choose between “confrontation and improvement of the relationship.”The National Assembly is forecast to approve a resolution next week calling for an end to slander between the divided states in line with their previous agreements. While criticizing Pyongyang for its provocative behavior, it also urges the government to take action to keep the leaflet spread from marring its pursuit of better inter-Korean ties or endangering the lives of citizens in border regions. Shortly after the shooting incident, Yeoncheon County residents pleaded for government action and took to the streets, using trucks and tractors to block the activists from reaching the venue where they had planned to release more balloons.“As a basic right of the citizens, the freedom of expression ought to be defended, but putting in danger not just yourself but others is well beyond the matter,” Rep. Kim Young-woo, a spokesman for the ruling Saenuri Party, said at a news briefing Wednesday. “The state is under an obligation to protect the people’s lives and property.” The text passed the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and unification on Tuesday.“Given the nature of their Stalinist system, North Korean officials cannot engage in talks with the South if flyers undercutting Kim’s authority are distributed in their country,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute. “The prospects would darken if the Unification Ministry, which should know the regime better than any other agency, sticks to its uncompromising attitude and does not exert any flexibility.” By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)","korea leaflets after court ,tuesday dismissed case filed ,anti north korea leaflets ,rekindled over anti leaflets ,province on tuesday dismissed","['anti - north Korea', 'South Korea ’s', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee Min - bok', 'north korean']",7,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05251661  0.17702116

Announcing the interim outcome of their one-month probe, investigators at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office said they have charged Cho Hyun-ah, the eldest daughter of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho, with violating the nation's aviation safety law and criminal code.The charges against Cho include violations of aviation safety regulations -- changing flight plans and assault on a plane -- and coercion and interference in the execution of duty, according to the prosecutors.Cho resigned as a vice president of cabin service four days after a national uproar over her conduct aboard a Seoul-bound Korean Air flight from New York on Dec. 5.The plane had already been taxiing when she ordered the chief flight attendant to deplane over the way she was served macadamia nuts -- in an unopened pack instead of on a plate. She was angry because she believed the crew did not follow the proper procedure for serving nuts to first-class passengers.The flight was subsequently returned to the gate to deplane the purser, causing an 11-minute delay in its arrival at Seoul's main gateway, Incheon International Airport. More than 250 passengers were on board.The prosecution office said it had additionally brought charges of interfering in the execution of a government official's duty as she had allegedly exerted influence in the government investigation.Cho systemically interfered with the investigation carried out by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport following the incident, prosecutors alleged. ""Cho systemically interfered with the investigation by the government agency and prompted an insufficient investigation,"" said Kim Chang-hee, a prosecutor probing the case. Cho had already been detained since Dec. 30 after a local court issued a warrant, citing ""the gravity of the issue as well as the organized efforts to cover up her involvement from the initial stage.""A Korean Air executive, identified only by his surname Yeo, was also indicted on charges of ordering employees to delete an initial report of the incident, prosecutors said.A transportation ministry official, surnamed Kim, who leaked details of a government investigation into the case involving Yeo, will also be indicted, they added.Prosecutors said they will also continue looking into suspicions that government officials got free upgrades from Korean Air.

YonhapAnnouncing the interim outcome of their probe, investigators at the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office said that they have concluded that Supt. Park Gwan-cheon authored and leaked the document.The document was then handed over to the president's younger brother, Ji-man, who is also the chairman of EG Group, an electronic materials producer, under the orders of former presidential secretary Cho Eung-cheon.Cho was indicted on charges of leaking confidential information, and violating the Presidential Records Management Act, prosecutors said.Prosecutors said they have also charged a police officer, surnamed Han, with copying the document and giving it to a Hanwha Group employee, who eventually leaked it to the media.Park Gwan-cheon had already been indicted with physical detention on charges of leaking confidential information, violating the law governing presidential documents, hiding official documents, and making false accusations, they said. The prosecution concluded that Chung, who holds no official position in the Park administration, had never met with a coterie of 10 key presidential aides since October 2013 to receive briefings on state affairs.Also, prosecutors said Park Gwan-cheon had authored the document alleging that Chung hired a man to follow the younger Park. The allegations of Chung's behind-the-scenes intervention in state affairs became a major scandal for the Park administration ahead of the start of its third year in power in February.

The prosecution concluded that the rumors were groundless. But the controversy intensified as allegations were brought by a local newspaper that disclosed a leaked presidential document reporting on Chung and his secretive meeting with Cheong Wa Dae staff. The scandal highlighted Park’s closed-off image, and internal conflicts among her secretaries at the nation’s top office. Some analysts also gave a negative outlook, saying that the scandal could give the president early lame duck status in the New Year.The trial hearings on the Seoul bureau of Sankei Shimbun came under the spotlight amid the Chung Yoon-hoi scandal involving an alleged power struggle among incumbent and former presidential aides.The prosecution had indicted Tatsuya Kato, the former bureau chief of the Japanese newspaper, on charges of defaming President Park Geun-hye “with a groundless report.”Its Aug. 3 article speculated that Park was not at Cheong Wa Dae when the ferry capsized on the morning of April 16, raising the possibility that she was privately meeting a male confidant at a location outside the presidential office.
