Korea for oil transfer to North,"The crew of a Hong Kong-registered ship have been detained for questioning in South Korea since their tanker was impounded in November for transferring oil to a North Korean vessel and breaching UN sanctions, customs officials said Saturday.The Lighthouse Winmore, which was chartered by a Taiwanese company, was impounded by South Korean customs authorities at the port of Yeosu on November 24 following an inspection.""...","The crew of a Hong Kong-registered ship have been detained for questioning in South Korea since their tanker was impounded in November for transferring oil to a North Korean vessel and breaching UN sanctions, customs officials said Saturday.The Lighthouse Winmore, which was chartered by a Taiwanese company, was impounded by South Korean customs authorities at the port of Yeosu on November 24 following an inspection.""Since then, inspectors have been coming on board and questioning the crew"", a Korea Customs Service official told AFP. The Lighthouse Winmore was impounded by South Korean customs authorities at the port of Yeosu on November 24 following an inspection. The Lighthouse Winmore has 25 crew members including 23 mainland Chinese citizens and two Myanmar nationals, another customs official at Yeosu said. The tanker, chartered by Taiwanese company Billions Bunker Group Corp., previously visited Yeosu on October 11 and loaded up on some 14,000 tonnes of Japanese refined oil before heading towards its purported destination in Taiwan.Instead of going to Taiwan, however, the vessel transferred 600 tonnes of oil to the North's Sam Jong 2 in international waters off China before returning to Yeosu, the customs service officials said.Earlier a foreign ministry official in Seoul had said the ship had been seized briefly by customs authorities who inspected it.Results of the investigation will be reported to the UN Security Council's sanctions committee, foreign ministry officials said.The Lighthouse Winmore is one of 10 ships the US has asked the Security Council to blacklist for violating sanctions against North Korea. Taipei said the Billions Bunker Group is not incorporated in Taiwan but in the Marshall Islands, and that it would ""continue to fully comply"" with UN sanctions against North Korea.Taiwan's transport ministry said it is investigating whether any Taiwanese entities were involved.The ship is owned by a Hong Kong-registered company called Win More Shipping Limited. There was nobody Friday at the address given for the firm on Hong Kong's companies registry.Four ships -- three North Korean vessels and a Palau-flagged oil tanker -- were blocked from international ports by the UN Security Council on Thursday over suspicions of carrying or transporting goods banned by sanctions targeting Pyongyang's weapons ambitions, according to the final list adopted by the world body.Even though the Sam Jong 2 was not among the four banned vessels, it appears on a list of six other ships suspected of transporting illicit cargo, along with the Lighthouse Winmore.The US had asked the Security Council to blacklist all 10 vessels, but China objected to the proposal, diplomats said, and only agreed to blacklist four ships on Thursday.The Security Council has imposed three sets of sanctions on North Korea this year: one on August 5 targeting the iron, coal and fishing industries, another set on September 11 aimed at textiles and limiting oil supply, and the most recent on December 22 focused on refined petroleum products.Pyongyang has slammed the latest sanctions as an ""act of war"" and on Saturday, the state-run KCNA news agency said in a commentary that the country would continue to pursue its nuclear ambitions.""The DPRK, an undeniable new strategic state and nuclear power...declares: Do not expect any change in its policy"", it said, referring to the North by the abbreviation of its official name.""Its entity as an invincible power can neither be undermined nor be stamped out.""","crew questioned in korea ,their tanker was impounded ,korea since their tanker ,oil to north korean ,customs officials said saturday","['Hong Kong', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'UN', 'the Lighthouse Winmore', 'taiwanese', 'south korean', 'Yeosu']",6,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.33328658  0.78938717

The North has conducted all of its six nuclear tests at the site located in the country's northeastern province.Seoul selected the defectors who expressed hope to undergo the tests among 114 refugees who came from the county after North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. All of the examinees came to the South before the North's fourth nuke test in January 2016.The ministry said that chromosome abnormality analysis examinations showed that four defectors may have been exposed to radiation, but it cannot be ruled out that other factors, such as age and smoking could have affected the result. Satellite imagery shows North Korea`s nuclear test site in a photo released by 38 North. Among them, two cases showed no statistical meaning. For one refugee, an impact of an old age, smoking and uses of computed tomography for medical purposes cannot be excluded.For the remaining person, a shortage of information stands in the way in gauging whether signs of radiation leaks are related to nuclear detonations.""The possibility of radiation exposure can be suspected, but it has not been verified whether nuclear tests affected the person as there is a lack of information assessing living environments in North Korea,"" a ministry official said.The government also said that there were no cases of meaningful results in checking possible radioactive contamination.The official said that four of the 114 defectors from Kilju County had lived close to the Punggye-ri nuclear site, but he declined to identify how many examinees in the latest checkups came from the location.Experts expressed concerns that the series of nuclear tests may have caused radioactive substances to leak into nearby areas, possibly putting residents' health at risk. Exposure to radiation could raise the risk of developing leukemia and other types of cancer.The ministry admitted that the latest medical tests have a limitation, given the small sampling and a lack of information. Also a long time has passed since the examinees were possibly exposed to radiation.The government said that it plans to advise North Korean defectors to receive heath checkups at regular intervals. It will also carry out further radiation tests on more refugees.","checkups on 30 refugees ,some north korean defectors ,the nuclear tests affected ,latest medical checkups but ,nuclear radiation leak tests","['north korean', 'Kilju County']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.24582712  0.38079405

YonhapEarlier Monday, police raided the homes of the owner, surnamed Lee, and custodian, surnamed Kim, of the commercial building in Jecheon, a day after they were taken into custody for questioning on suspicions that the two poorly managed the building where victims were trapped in a sauna on the second floor.The eight-story building housed a fitness center, restaurants and a public sauna.Police confirmed water sprinklers inside the building did not function during the blaze Thursday, and one of the emergency exits was blocked, a violation of the fire prevention law. The fire and its toll have been called “extremely preventable” by experts. The blaze has also raised questions in a country where safety regulations are often weakly enforced. “After I heard about what happened in Jecheon. I decided to work out at home on my own out of fears that a similar incident could happen to me as well,” Kim Hee-jin, a 47-year-old housewife, told The Korea Herald.Another gym-goer, Park Jae-yeong, 29, said he and other members of his health club in Seoul plan to talk to the club’s manager to ensure the building is properly managed and safety measures are functioning in time of emergency. “It seems building owners and managers easily ignore safety protocols in a quest for profits. And I want to make sure that won’t be happening around me,” Park said. According to Jecheon City, the external walls of the building were covered with highly flammable polyethylene cladding, the same material that caused an inferno at an apartment in Uijeongbu, some 20 kilometers north of Seoul, which killed four and injured 124 just two years ago. National forensic experts concluded Saturday the fire started from the first-floor ceiling of the parking lot, quickly engulfing eight stories in just seven minutes. Among the dead, 20 suffocated from toxic smoke in the female sauna.In the wake of the latest disaster, concerns continue over cheap flammable cladding that also caused the Uijeongbu apartment inferno just two years ago. Experts say the sandwich panels of Dryvit cladding, which is wrapped around the outside of a building for energy efficiency, allowed the fire to spread quickly, calling for stricter regulations to ban its use. “So many more buildings have already been wrapped by the flammable cladding, so the government should come up with solutions to ensure fire safety,” said Kong Ha-sung, a professor of the Department of Fire Safety at Kyungil University. Following the Uijeongbu fire in 2015, the law was revised to ban using flammable cladding when constructing buildings six stories and higher, but the Jecheon fitness center was not affected by the regulation as it was constructed in 2012. A memorial altar for the Jecheon victims has been set up in the city for citizens to express their condolences. President Moon Jae-in has paid a visit to the memorial and ordered a thorough investigation into the accident. By Bak Se-hwan","arrest warrant tuesday morning ,fire south korean police ,victims of thursday fire ,an arrest warrant tuesday ,arrest warrant tuesday","['south korean', 'Jecheon', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Jecheon', 'North Chungcheong Province']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01426129  0.04655363

Yonhap""There is no doubt that the first-floor ceiling was the ignition point,"" an official from the National Forensic Service said in a media briefing. Investigative authorities have been looking into the blaze that destroyed the gym building in the provincial city, 168 kilometers from Seoul, on Thursday. The accident claimed 29 lives, with 26 others injured who are now being treated at nearly hospitals for smoke inhalation.  The death toll quickly rose as many were trapped in a public sauna and could not promptly find their way out. The crime lab's conclusion on the ignition point is in line with the preliminary analysis by the police and firefighters who suspected the heating wires that were being installed in the ceiling pipes could have caused the flames. Jecheon Police Station said they will question the property owner, a 53-year-old only identified by his last name Lee. Since Lee is undergoing treatment in a hospital, they will pay a visit to get his statement, police said.  Lee purchased the building in August through a bid, according to police. He remodeled it to house a gym, public sauna and other facilities. Police said they will beef up efforts to find out whether safety tools had been managed intact and Lee complied with required fire protection protocols. Some surviving victims have told police that the sprinklers did not work at the time of fire and they saw some water leaks from fire-fighting facilities. Police have obtained surveillance footage showing a flame instantly spreading over to the vehicles. They have sent the footage and four dashboard cameras retrieved from the cars to the national forensic service for further analysis. A memorial altar for the victims has been set up in the city as part of efforts to offer a place for citizens to express condolences.

The hospital suspected contamination of injection tools or IV fluid. Medical staff at Ewha Womans University Medical Center walk into a meeting with the families of the four infants who died in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. YonhapCitrobacter freundii is a bacterium that is common in adults but can cause respiratory, urinary and blood infections in infants. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also confirmed the finding. An official from the KCDC told The Korea Herald that “several people carrying an identical DNA of bacterium means that the infections are highly likely to have occurred in an identical way.”“Prematurely born babies, born between 34 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, have weakened immune systems and are more vulnerable to infections,” said a KCDC official, who declined to be named.Health authorities also suspect that the newborns were infected via contact with medical personnel or through medical appliances. The four deceased were from the same section of the intensive care unit, where a total of 16 premature babies were in incubators at that time. Three of the four were in the same row and the other was in the next row in a section of the same unit. Each row has three incubators and each section has two rows.Regarding the hospital’s internal investigation results that said injection tools or IV fluid were most likely responsible for the babies’ sudden deaths, investigators from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said it is “too early to confirm.” After eight hours of search and seizure, Police finished searching the premises of Ewha Womans University Medical Center at around 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and secured potential evidence including incubators, medicators, injection tools and medical records, the agency said.Meanwhile, the bereaved families of the four dead babies requested a private meeting with the hospital’s officials and staff doctors to call for an urgent investigation and denounce the hospital’s lack of hygiene control. The families have been saying that hospital officials should take responsibility for their negligence. By Kim Da-sol","babies died on saturday ,last week dna analysis ,deaths of four newborns ,newborns death early investigations ,the babies died on","['Ewha Womans University Medical Center', 'Citrobacter']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68366671  0.60798252

Despite the warning shots, the Chinese boats didn't leave. The Coast Guard then mobilized four patrol boats, including a 3,000-ton vessel, to fire a total of about 200 shots with K2 rifles, M-60 machine guns and shotguns, officials said.The Chinese boats left the area around 2:43 a.m. some five hours after the first warnings shots were fired.It was unclear whether and how much damage the Chinese boats suffered, but there is no damage to the Coast Guard, officials said.Illegal fishing by Chinese boats off the west coast has been a long-running headache for South Korea. Chinese fishermen have often used violence to resist crackdowns, leading to clashes resulting in wounds, injuries and sometimes death.","chinese boats illegally fishing ,44 chinese fishing boats ,chase off chinese fishing ,fishing in south korean ,off chinese fishing boats","['MOKPO', 'South Korea', 'the Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Gageo', 'the Coast Guard']",6,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.47099519 -0.05848248

Results from full autopsies will require up to a month, the NFS said. On Monday, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at least three babies may had been infected with Citrobacter freundii, a bacterium that is common in adults but can cause respiratory, urinary and blood infections in infants. The four babies were among 16 premature babies in the intensive care unit. Three of the four were in the same row and the other was in the next row in a section of the same unit. Each row has three incubators and each section has two rows. Police investigators also plan to summon six doctors and five nurses to check how the ICU was operated and whether they administered recommended dosages to the babies. Forensic doctors Monday raised the possibility of overdoses of IV fluid. “While all four babies were under Total Parenteral Nutrition treatment,  administering an overdose of IV can be detrimental, which often leads to the death of patients,” said Yang Kyung-moo, chief of the forensic medical team at the NFS.However, he added that the cause could only be determined after the results of various postmortem tests are out. Separately from the police investigation, Ewha Womans University Medical Center formed an investigative unit comprising five medical experts, including Kim Nam-joong, a professor of infectious diseases from Seoul National University. Meanwhile, funerals were held for the four babies on Tuesday, without setting a funeral parlor. The bodies were each contained in a box of less than 60 by 40 centimeters. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo attended the parliament session Tuesday and vowed to conduct safety inspections at some 98 ICUs for newborns at major hospitals across the nation by the end of this year.","tuesday raided local university ,police on tuesday raided ,four newborns seoul police ,police raid hospital over ,where four newborns died","['Seoul', 'Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Ewha Womans University Medical Center', 'Mokdong', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3302508   0.16377798

While calls for maritime accidents are currently directed to emergency numbers of the country's police and fire departments, the ministry plans to establish an independent calling system to receive reports related to ship accidents. The government also will beef up rescue workers and diving equipment at Coast Guard stations and set up a special rescue team in Incheon and on the southern island of Jeju, in addition to the ones in Busan, Mokpo and Donghae, to handle large-scale marine accidents.The latest boating accident was the worst tragedy involving a South Korean recreational fishing boat since a similar accident occurred in waters near Jeju Island in September 2015.

The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention revealed its interim result on the preliminary blood culture tests of the three premature babies, who died over less than a two-hour period while being treated at the intensive care unit of Ewha Womans University Medical Center in western Seoul on Saturday. The blood tests detected Citrobacter freundii, a type of gram-negative bacteria, which is commonly found in a healthy human gut as a beneficial strain but can often cause respiratory, blood-related or urinary symptoms for immunocompromised patients, including premature babies, the KCDCP said.  A gram-negative bacteria is also antibiotics-resistant, raising the possibility of overuse resulting in or contributing to their deaths, it added. On Monday, forensic doctors of the National Forensic Service carried out postmortem examinations on the bodies. It released a statement later that its preliminary assessment found no obvious cause of the deaths and anything certain can only be determined after conducting a detailed analysis through a microscope, which will take a few weeks. The KCDCP has said it is carrying out a DNA sequencing to determine if the bacteria has the same identity and its result will be available as early as this afternoon.  The hospital has said its doctors in charge performed CPR on the babies when they showed signs of cardiac arrest. But the four died between 9:31 p.m. and 10:53 p.m. Families said the babies all had bloated bellies and difficulty breathing prior to the deaths. The incident has sent shock waves through the country, with police, the Seoul city government and the KCDCP having launched a full investigation to find out the exact cause of the deaths.","four newborns who died ,premature babies who died ,the three premature babies ,authorities said early tuesday ,authorities raise possible virus",['the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21984752  0.76981336

YonhapFindings of the initial examinations are expected later Monday, while full autopsy results will require a longer period of up to one month, the NFS said.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is conducting a separate investigation into the cases, said Monday that at least three babies may have been infected with Gram-negative bacteria of some kind, although its link to their deaths requires further examination. The three babies had their blood tested about six hours before they died and the KCDC is looking into the blood samples to determine the exact type of bacteria, it said.Two of the four had necrotizing enterocolitis, a common surgical emergency among premature babies in which tissues in the intestine become inflamed and start to die, it also found. The deceased were among 16 premature babies in incubators at the intensive care unit at Ewha Womans University Medical Center in western Seoul.They died one by one between 9:31 p.m. and 10:53 p.m. on Saturday, a hospital official said during a press conference Sunday. Several babies encountering cardiac arrests in such a short period of time is rare in the ICU, the doctors said, adding that they have no idea why it happened. Families said the babies all had bloated stomachs and difficulty breathing before their deaths. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said it is investigating the hospital and its staff doctors, leaving all possibilities open. It has secured relevant medical records and are looking into them, it added. Officials from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, where the hospital is located, and other health institutions are also conducting an epidemiological survey and monitoring the health conditions of other infants who were at the same intensive care unit with the deceased. Immediately after the mysterious series of deaths, eight of the 12 remaining patients at the unit were moved to different hospitals while four were discharged. Officials said all of them appear to be in a stable condition. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon ordered a thorough and swift investigation to determine the cause of the babies’ deaths. “A tragic incident that shouldn’t have happened has happened. I don’t know what to say to the parents of these babies,” Lee said during a meeting with senior aides. He also instructed officials to take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening again.In September, the hospital came under fire over IV fluid containing an insect given to a 5-month-old baby for more than 14 hours. By Kim Da-sol","seoul five forensic doctors ,newborns monday to determine ,in seoul five forensic ,forensic service began autopsies ,viral infections malfunctioning incubators","['the National Forensic Service', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64734519  0.42115489

Its morning low was 8 degrees below the 30-year average. The morning low in Chuncheon in the mountainous Gangwon Province recorded minus 14.7 degrees, with Gangneung and Daegu hitting 7.6 degrees and 6.4 degrees below zero, respectively. The KMA‘s mid-term forecast has below-average temperatures for Seoul for the next 10 days, said an official from the KMA.“What’s unique about this winter’s cold spell is that we do not see the cycle of three cold days and four warm days, a traditional winter weather pattern in the peninsula,” the official said. Last week, the mercury had dipped to as low as minus 12 degrees in Seoul and Tuesday was recorded as the coldest day of the season for the city. Temperatures in the capital and many other areas stayed well below zero throughout the week. On Monday, a brief respite is forecast, with the morning low rising slightly to minus 4 degrees. As of Sunday, a cold wave watch was issued to regions like Gyeonggi, North Chungcheong, Gangwon and North Gyeongsang provinces. A heavy snowfall watch was advised in Jeju Island and the cities in the west coastal region, with Halla Mountain recording 22 centimeters of snow on Sunday morning.

Two Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were released in to the wildness at waters off Jeju Island last July. The two dolphins, caught in the late 1990s by fishing nets, were sent to a zoo in Seoul, to perform dolphin shows. The authorities are failing to keep track of the two dolphins, not knowing whether they are dead or alive, even though 150 days have passed since they were set free.For the dolphins that were released before, the authorities observed that they joined wild fleets in five to 16 days.  There were worries at the time of the release that the two dolphins would not adopt to the ocean, considering that they were in captivation for 20 years, fourfold of the other released dolphins. Experts suspect that the dolphins might have moved to a different region or died, unable to adopt to the wildness.

Current students can receive the scholarship for the fall semester and the upcoming spring semester. High school students who will enter colleges in 2018 can also get the scholarship for a year. According to the ministry, around 3,000 students are to benefit from the new aid plan, for the total cost of 10 billion won .  College students at a college in Pohang evacuated to a nearby church after the quake The plan, however, sparked a dispute, with some opponents calling it “unfair,” saying that such a scholarship was not offered for students affected by other natural disasters.The Korea Student Aid Foundation, in charge of handling national scholarship fund, said it could prioritize students in immediate need of economic aid. An official from the foundation said, “The quake that caused extreme damage was of a national concern, warranting a scholarship plan.” An official from the Education Ministry said that the measure was taken because the Ministry of Public Administration and Security offered a scholarship to all local high school students after the region was declared a special disaster area.

The panel, composed of maritime experts, lawyers and civilians, delved into government documents and prosecution reports and gathered evidence, but its activities were limited as it was not authorized to subpoena or prosecute government officials.   A funeral car passes by the wreck of the Sewol ferry at Mokpo port, 410 kilometers south of Seoul, on Nov. 18, 2017. Ryu Jae-hyung, the ministry's internal auditor, said former officials in charge of salvaging the Sewol did not accept the advice from six law firms or the Ministry of Government Legislation and arbitrarily shortened the panel's activity period.Under the Park Geun-hye administration, the salvage team also made a report in late 2015 on how to make the fact-finding body's activities fizzle out in an attempt to conceal the government's mishandling of the initial rescue operations, Ryu said. The ministry said it will request the prosecution look into the related allegations and noted that around 10 ministry officials will be subject to investigation. In response to the panel's probe result, which failed to meet public expectations, the National Assembly passed a special law last month to launch a new committee with greater authority to re-investigate the disaster.""Due to limitations in the internal audit, the second special investigative committee will look into other allegations related to the Sewol salvage operation,"" Ryu said in a briefing. ""We will actively cooperate if  launches an investigation.""The wreck was raised from the bottom of the sea in June and put into dry dock at a local port in Mokpo, 410 kilometers south of Seoul.","coast in 2014 killing ,800 ton ship capsized ,of the deadly sinking ,killing more than 300 ,2014 killing more than",['the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06477384  0.37650052

It was just a mere day after three decomposed bodies were found off the coast of Sakata in the adjacent Yamagata Prefecture. Remains of eight people were found in a boat grounded on a beach in Akita Prefecture a week before that. Although the dead couldn’t talk, small details such as a lapel pin or cigarettes showed where they had come from: North Korea. Twenty-eight such cases were reported in the waters near Japan last month, some of them carrying people who were still alive. Every year 40 to 85 North Korean boats wash up on Japanese northern coasts. But the November tally, which tops a previous monthly record of 21 in January 2014, is unusual. Experts attribute the recent spike to a result of the United Nations Security Council sanctions imposed on the rogue nation coupled with the current growing trend towards capitalism. “It seems  Kim Jong-un has been focusing on the fishing industry and pressuring North Korean citizens to produce results,” Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies told The Korea Herald.“But with its poor infrastructure combined with the dire effect of the current sanctions, some are pushed over the edge,” he added, referring to the poorly equipped boats that are easily pulled off course by strong currents and southwesterly winds if their engines fail. “There are also personal ambitions involved in the matter, as its citizens are now interested in making more personal gains after Kim Jong-un adopted a new pro-market economic structure,” Lee said. Whether it is by force or of their own volition, more of these North Korean ghost ships are expected to haunt the waters and shores of Japan as fishing may be one of the few economic options left for Pyongyang, which has been burdened by a series of sanctions. Japan’s NHK reported Friday a group of 10 North Korean crew members told the Coast Guard that they were trying to meet the fishing quota assigned by the North Korean military. The fishermen were found on Nov. 28, near Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido, packed in a boat labeled “the 854th military unit of the Korean People’s Army.”“Since , fishermen have been frantically trying to meet  catch goals, but what’s different this year is that they are traveling to distant waters in their fragile boats,” Pyon Jin-il, a leading North Korea watcher and writer based in Japan, told AFP. “North Korea last year sold part of its fishing rights in the Yellow Sea to China to get foreign currency, so their fishermen have been kicked out of the western part of their waters,” he said.The rogue state is also reported to have sold fishing rights in the East Sea to China. An annual revenue of $75 million is raked for Kim Jong-un, Yonhap reported in August, citing unidentified intelligence sources. Most of the hard currency earned through such deals, are believed to fund its weapons program and military power while ordinary North Korean citizens suffer from lack of food and other basic necessities. On Nov. 29, Pyongyang test-fired what experts view as a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, signaling a technological advance in its missile program. Government officials here and in the US have warned that North Korea’s weapons program is “near completion.”Meanwhile, Japan has decided to bolster its sea patrols around its maritime border.“The coast guard and police have to cooperate to step up sea patrols around Japan,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a recent press briefing. “The government intends to improve this to ensure we can guard against suspicious boats or people arriving in Japan.”By Jung Min-kyung","ghost ships dead bodies ,nk ghost ships dead ,ghost ships dead ,two empty wooden boats ,ships dead bodies","['Japan', 'the Japanese Coast Guard', 'North Koreans', 'Akita Prefecture', 'Japan', 'Sakata']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36151958  0.039149

There isn’t any animal funeral hall in the city of Jeonju, two hours south of Seoul by drive. Pet funerals in Korea are similar to human funerals. A funeral car visits the home and carries the body to the funeral hall. A traditional Korean funeral process is followed, or cremation is done. The funeral usually costs around 200,000 won . An official from the city government said, “The permit will be given if the business conditions are fit, but residents’ opinion cannot be ignored.

North Korea test-fires Hwasong-14 last July. Yonhap   Analysts say it is unclear whether the missile survived re-entry into the earth's atmosphere or could successfully deliver a warhead to its target -- key technological hurdles for Pyongyang.   The isolated and impoverished North has staged six increasingly powerful atomic tests since 2006 -- most recently in September -- which have rattled Washington and its key regional allies South Korea and Japan.   On Monday the US and South Korea started their largest ever joint air exercise, an operation Pyongyang has labelled an ""all-out provocation"".   The five-day Vigilant Ace drill involves 230 aircraft, including F-22 Raptor stealth jet fighters, and tens of thousands of troops, Seoul's air force said.   Pyongyang over the weekend blasted the drill, accusing US President Donald Trump's administration of ""begging for nuclear war"".   As tensions surged, US Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican and foreign policy hawk, warned that the US was moving closer to ""preemptive war"" with the North.   ""If there's an underground nuclear test , then you need to get ready for a very serious response by the United States,"" Graham told the CBS show ""Face the Nation"".   In recent years Pyongyang has accelerated its drive to develop nuclear and missile technology capable of threatening the US, which it accuses of hostility.   ""The preemption is becoming more likely as their technology matures,"" Graham said.    His remarks echoed those of Trump's National Security Adviser HR McMaster, who told a security forum on Saturday that the potential for war with the North ""is increasing every day"".    As well as featuring the latest generation of stealth fighters, this year's wargames involve simulated precision attacks on the North's military installations, including its missile launch sites and artillery units, Yonhap news agency said, citing unnamed Seoul sources.    Risks of war    The North has boasted that the Hwasong 15 ICBM tested on Wednesday is capable of delivering a ""super-large"" nuclear warhead anywhere in the US mainland.   Analysts agree the latest test showed a big improvement in potential range, but say it was likely achieved using a dummy warhead that would have been quite light.   They say a missile carrying a much heavier nuclear warhead would struggle to travel as far.   They are also sceptical that Pyongyang has mastered the sophisticated technology required to protect such a warhead from the extreme temperatures and stresses encountered as the missile hurtles back to Earth.   The latest launch, which saw the missile drop into Japan's economic waters, was condemned by Tokyo's parliament Monday, which slammed the North's rogue weapons programme as an ""imminent threat"".   Washington has called on China, the North's major ally, to do more to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.    On Monday China's foreign ministry on Monday warned that the Korean peninsula remained ""highly sensitive"" and called on all sides to ""do more things to ease the tension and avoid provoking each other"".   The North's leader Kim Jong-Un has presided over significant progress in the country's widely-condemned nuclear and missile programmes since taking power in 2011.   A nuclear standoff between Kim and Trump in recent months has seen the pair trade personal insults.   The tensions have fuelled concerns of another conflict, more than six decades after the 1950-53 Korean War that left much of the peninsula in ruins.    But even some Trump advisers say US military options are limited when Pyongyang could launch an artillery barrage on the South Korean capital Seoul -- only around 50 kilometres  from the heavily-fortified border and home to 10 million people.   Estimates on the potential casualties from another war vary widely.    The North has thousands of conventional artillery units along the border with the South that analysts say could kill tens of thousands.    In one of the latest estimates, Scott Sagan, senior fellow at the Centre for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, said the toll could be as high as one million people from just the first day of a conflict.","last week their airline ,crew saw korea missile ,crew flying over japan ,their airline said monday ,crew of flight cx893","['Japan', ""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'US', 'Hong Kong', 'Cathay Pacific', 'San Francisco', 'Chi']",6,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.45222858  0.79950029

Fifteen people were killed and three went missing at that time. Rescue workers conducted their search for two people missing in the deadly capsizing of a fishing boat off the west coast of Incheon. Yonhap   Rescued workers unsuccessfully searched the area overnight for the two missing people by mobilizing 30 Coast Guard boats, seven Navy vessels, one local government vessel, as well as two Coast Guard planes and one Air Force plane. They also used 342 flares to illuminate the area.   Officials said they will put more search vessels into the operation.    A total of 59 vessels, 15 airplanes and 59 divers are expected to be mobilized for the operation, in addition to 1,380 people assigned to search the coastline, as victims' bodies could have washed ashore.   Coast Guard officials are also trying to determine the cause of the accident.    Investigators said later they requested arrest warrants for the tanker's captain, identified only by his surname, Jun, 37, and a 46-year-old crew member surnamed Kim, on charges of professional negligence resulting in death. They have been put under emergency detention for questioning.    Officials suspect the tanker's crew didn't do enough to avoid a collision even though they knew of the existence of the fishing boat nearby.   ""Captain Jun has stated to the effect of acknowledging his fault, saying he was aware of the fact that the fishing boat was operating nearby,"" a Coast Guard official said.   The ill-fated fishing boat was towed to the Coast Guard pier in Incheon earlier in the day.","capsizing of fishing boat ,20 anglers overturned after ,fishing boat rescue workers ,77 ton recreational fishing ,deadly capsizing of fishing","['Rescue', 'Incheon']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.0126495  -0.37290874

A soil movement sensor installed on a hill near the quake's epicenter gave a reading of 363 millimeters following aftershocks measuring magnitudes of 2.0 and 2.4, respectively, on Nov. 21, according to the Korea Forest Service data released by Rep. Hwang Ju-hong of the minor opposition People's Party.  This photo, taken Nov. 20, shows liquefaction in a paddy field in the earthquake-stricken city of Pohang, 370 kilometers from Seoul. That contrasts with a reading of 79.1 mm, meaning that soil in the area moved about 28.4 centimeters. The main 5.4 magnitude quake struck Pohang on Nov. 15, and a string of aftershocks have since followed. That tremor caused soil to move 6.5 cm, but it later returned nearly to its original state. The forest service said the latest movement isn't serious enough to cause landslides. ""Every time aftershocks happen, the land in this region widens and narrows repeatedly, but we don't see any risk of landslides or collapses,"" a forest service official said. ""We're going to greatly increase the number of  sensors and establish an alarm system."" Hwang said he's going to work with other parties to set aside some 13 billion won  for projects aimed at preventing landslides caused by soil movement.","following last month earthquake ,last month earthquake in ,last month earthquake ,363 millimeters following aftershocks ,month earthquake in the",['Pohang'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72010803  0.03499577

Seven people have been rescued, but the accident left 13 people dead and two missing.It was the worst tragedy involving a South Korean recreational fishing boat since a similar accident in waters near Jeju Island in September 2015. Fifteen people were killed and three went missing at that time. Coast Guard officials conduct rescue operations in waters near Yeongheung Island in the Yellow Sea on Dec. 3, 2017, in this photo provided by the Korea Coast Guard. Rescued workers unsuccessfully searched the area overnight for the two missing people by mobilizing 30 Coast Guard boats, seven Navy vessels, one local government vessel as well as two Coast Guard planes and one Air Force plane. They also used 342 flares to illuminate the area.Officials said they will put more search vessels into the operation. A total of 59 vessels, 15 airplanes and 59 divers are expected to be mobilized for the operation in addition to some 1,380 people assigned to search the shore as their bodies could have washed ashore.Coast Guard officials are also trying to determine the cause of the accident. Investigators have put the tanker's captain, identified only by his surname Jun, 37, and another crew member into emergency detention for questioning on charges of professional negligence resulting in death. Officials suspect the tanker's crew didn't do enough to avoid a collision even though they knew of the existence of the fishing boat nearby.""Captain Jun has stated to the effect of acknowledging his fault, saying he was aware of the fact that the fishing boat was operating nearby,"" a Coast Guard official said.The ill-fated fishing boat was towed to the Coast Guard pier in Incheon earlier in the day.","capsizing of fishing boat ,20 anglers overturned after ,77 ton recreational fishing ,deadly capsizing of fishing ,fishing boat incheon rescue","['INCHEON', 'Incheon']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.18721624 -0.26352838

Announcing the interim result of the inspection on soil in a total of 10 locations in Pohang, the Ministry of Interior and Safety said that it had found signs of liquefaction in five locations -- “high” in one location and “low” in four others.An official from the Ministry of Interior and Safey announces the interim result of the inspection on soil in l0 locations in the quake-hit city of Pohang during a press briefing on Friday. Soil liquefaction is the phenomenon where saturated, loose and sandy soil loses its strength due to an applied stress, such as earthquake shaking, which could heighten urban seismic risks and lead buildings to collapse. The government-led joint inspection has been underway after some 17 cases of suspected liquefaction were reported in Pohang, since the 5.4-magnitude quake struck the city on Nov. 15. Ha Ik-soo, a civil engineering professor at Kyungnam University, one of the team that conducted the inspection, said that the liquefaction occurred due to Pohang’s thick sedimentary layers, but liquefaction was not “serious” enough to damage structures.“The occurrence of liquefaction does not mean an immediate damage to structures. It depends on location, depth and structures,” he said. “Liquefaction is not occurring anymore . It seems that it is in the process of being stabilized.”The government said that it plans to further carry out an inspection on possible liquefaction in other locations, release the result of the testing as well as measures to mitigate its adverse impact within this year. A 5.4-magnitude quake hit Pohang on Nov. 15, damaging at least 30,878 private establishments and 404 public ones, including 110 schools and 33 roads. All the public facilities and 94.4 percent of the private establishments were restored as of Friday, according to the municipal government. The quake in Pohang forced as many as nearly 1,100 to leave homes and left some 80 people injured. The quake is estimated to have caused damages worth over 120 billion won . The Moon Jae-in government designated Pohang as a special disaster zone on Nov. 20 to provide its quake-affected residents with emergency, financial and administrative aid as part of a restoration effort.","last month earthquake in ,second strongest quake announcing ,last month earthquake ,month earthquake in pohang ,by last month earthquake","['Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Pohang', 'the Ministry of Interior and Safety']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63848418  0.41530654

The wetland is South Korea's largest wetland and home to various rare species of birds, plants and fish native to the Korean Peninsula. This undated photo shows crested ibises in their enclosure at the Upo Korean Crested Ibis Restoration Center in Changnyeong, 347 kilometers southeast of Seoul. Crested ibises are to face many obstacles, such as agricultural chemicals and natural enemies when they adapt themselves to the wild. A highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has hit South Korea almost every year, could be the biggest concern to the people of the Changnyeong municipality who wish for the successful reintroduction of the birds to the wild.But the Upo Korean Crested Ibis Restoration Center, located near the wetland, takes a dim view on the possibility that crested ibises are infected with the virus.""We have no major concern about it,"" said Lee Seong-bong, a senior official at the center who has taken charge of the project for the past 10 years.Crested ibises being bred at the center have never been hit by bird flu cases discovered in South Korea.A wild whooper swan, found dead near the wetland in December last year, was infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, but the crested ibises at the center overcame the bird flu case.There have been no reports of avian influenza hitting the birds from Japan, which reintroduced 10 crested ibises bred in captivity into the wild in 2008, and China, which has given Japan and South Korea crested ibises for their revival efforts.""Some of the migratory birds have been detected to have bird flu viruses, but they did not die en masse like cases at chicken or duck farms,"" Lee said. ""Crested ibises are to be classified as migratory birds.""South Korea has been trying to reintroduce the species to the wild since 2008, when a pair of Chinese-born crested ibises -- a male called Yangzhou and a female named Longting -- were donated by China. The center now has 313 crested ibises in captive breeding.Last year, the municipality displayed 20 crested ibises at the restoration center, making them the first to come face to face with the South Korean public in 37 years.The bird, called ""ttaogi"" in Korean, was spotted for the last time in the Demilitarized Zone, which separates the two Koreas, in January 1979. A delegation from the municipality has been to Sado Island, Japan's Niigata Prefecture, where crested ibises bred in captivity were successfully reintroduced, to learn more about how to make preparations for the revival effort.","avian influenza are expected ,protected birds said friday ,bird flu poses ,to restore crested ibises ,flu poses no major","['CHANGNYEONG', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Changnyeong', ""South Korea 's"", 'South Gyeongsang']",6,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.3987312   0.45355159

Choi Jong-ku, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, said that such people would account for more than half of 1.59 million debtors. Choi stressed in a press briefing that the government will make efforts to prevent people from taking advantage of the move. “Only the really vulnerable debtors who are utterly incapable of standing on their own will be selected.

The closure would take place within ""days,"" Geng said, without specifying any timeframe for the work to be completed and the bridge re-opened.China is North Korea's largest trading partner, but it has backed a series of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile activities, straining ties between the Cold War-era allies.US President Donald Trump has urged his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to use his economic leverage to exert more pressure on the pariah state in the hopes it might abandon its nuclear weapons programme. However, Beijing this week condemned as ""wrong"" fresh US sanctions that targeted North Korean shipping interests as well as Chinese companies that do business with the North.","korea bridge to close ,maintenance beijing announced friday ,closed temporarily while workers ,bridge will be closed ,beijing announced friday some","['China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'asian', 'chinese', 'Dandong', 'North Korea', 'sino - korean']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12846263  0.49465516

A Sewol special committee inquired into the ferry sinking from Jan. 1, 2015 to Sept. 30, 2016. The bill was put to a plenary vote on Friday morning, following an agreement reached between the ruling Democratic Party and minor opposition People’s Party on an amendment to the bill on “societal disasters” as they narrowed their differences on a special case clause. The People’s Party proposed that the special panel should refer to past records including transcriptions for cases already concluded by the previous special committee and given final court ruling. The ruling party, which initially had concerns that this might make it hard for the new panel to look into cases where no indictments were made, eventually gave its consent.  Family members of the Sewol ferry sinking victims watch from the National Assembly`s main chamber as the parliament holds a final vote on a bill that calls for reinvestigations of major disasters, including the 2014 ferry sinking.The legislation was passed 162-46, with 8 abstentions. The two above-mentioned parties combined control 160 seats in the 299-member unicameral parliament.The nine members of the special committee will comprise of four recommended by the ruling party, four recommended by opposition parties  and one recommended by the National Assembly Speaker. The panel can begin investigations once it has six members after the law is promulgated. If the committee makes a request for a probe by the special prosecution and the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee doesn’t vote on it for 90 days, it will be automatically submitted to the plenary session of the National Assembly.The law was fast tracked on Dec. 23 last year. The use of toxic humidifier sterilizers killed dozens of people and resulted in over 5,000 damage reports. The Sewol ferry sank on April 16, 2014, in waters off the country’s southwestern coast, claiming the lives of 304 people, mostly teenagers on a field trip.

The Incheon District Court found Yoo Sum-na, the daughter of Yoo Byung-eun, the de facto owner of Cheonghaejin Marine Co., guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement. The court also ordered her to forfeit 1.94 billion won . The court said she used her status as the owner's daughter and had the affiliates of her father's firm make huge investments in her own companies, which crimped their business conditions.  Yoo Sum-na, the daughter of Yoo Byung-eun who effectively controlled a shipping company that operated the sunken Sewol ferry that killed hundreds of passengers in 2014, is seen in this photo filed June 7, 2017, when she was extradited from France and arrested for embezzlement and breach of trust. The 51-year-old was arrested in June for embezzling 4.59 billion won after she was extradited from France at the request of the South Korean prosecution investigating the case. Prosecutors have demanded five years for Yoo and asked the court to collect 4.59 billion won of her assets.  She ran a design company from June 2011 till December 2013 with a woman surnamed Ha who was close to her father. She is suspected to have coerced Cheonghaejin to pay her 2.5 billion won under the pretense of providing design consulting.In another case, she is accused of making another company of hers pay 2.1 billion won to a company founded by her brother without a justifiable reason.","sinking that killed hundreds ,years for embezzlement breach ,in 2014 ferry sinking ,gets years for embezzlement ,ferry sinking that killed","['INCHEON', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Yoo Sum - na', 'Yoo Byung - eun', 'Cheonghaejin Marine Co.']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26333141  0.1135504

The test was taken Thursday following a weeklong delay. The latest earthquake came about a year after a 5.8 magnitude quake struck Gyeongju in September 2016. Moon's trip to the city began with a visit to a local high school, according to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports.There, he met a group of high school seniors and acknowledged their hardship, noting they were forced to take possibly the most important exam in their life under fears of aftershocks.More than 60 aftershocks of 2.0 or greater magnitude have followed the Nov. 15 quake so far, according to the weather agency.The government declared a special disaster zone in the quake-hit area on Monday.More than 18,000 homes and apartments have been reported damaged, with 1,380 people displaced from their homes as of Thursday.While meeting with local residents later, the president promised additional support for those who have been forced to leave their homes for safety reasons.""Even with the designation of a special disaster zone, there may not be enough support funds for damaged homes.

Although details of the document remain undisclosed, a ministry official later added that the stated purposes of travel were different from what the group had initially reported before embarking on the trip. “As soon as the incident was reported, we sent our consul to the region to figure things out by meeting the Customs and Border Protection personnel and airplane officials,” a ministry official said. “It was found that their stated purposes of travel  were different from what they had specified through the ESTA  beforehand.”The ministry also said that the consul was dispatched to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia to talk with the CBP and other relevant authorities to gain insight into the incident. The group was mostly seniors in their 60s and 70s with a private organization, it said. The official did not disclose further information about the individuals or the documents in order to protect their privacy. The travelers were ordered to fly back after they arrived at the airport via two separate flights. They attempted to enter the US through the ESTA, an automated system under the South Korea-US visa waiver program. South Koreans are permitted to travel to the US for tourism or business for up to 90 days without visas. But the group was unable to catch an immediate flight back and was detained at the airport for nearly 24 hours before boarding for Incheon Airport, several media reports here said.Meanwhile, the US edition of Joongang Ilbo reported that the group was on their way to participate in a meditation program hosted by a South Korea-based organization, Suwanee Mediation, through a travel agency. The agency’s mistake of conveying the wrong address of their destination played a big role in the denied entry, the newspaper said, citing a statement it received from the organization. The program was scheduled to take place at a farm in Florida, it added. Suwanee said it believes the agency was trying to avoid any unnecessary suspicion from US authorities, as visits to a farm could invoke the idea of unauthorized labor. The Foreign Ministry said it would probe the matter further and work to prevent similar incidents, noting that such denial of entry for South Korean travelers en masse is a rare event. By Jung Min-kyung","85 koreans denied entry ,monday airline passengers await ,said monday airline passengers ,refuse 85 south koreans ,85 koreans denied","['the United States ’', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'Consulate General', 'Atlanta']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.19883479 0.59626758 0.21726717],Jung Min-kyung,Social affairs,11,2017,"seoul foreign ministry said monday ,refuse 85 south koreans entry ,said monday airline passengers await ,ministry said monday airline passengers ,incheon airport several media reports","['the United States ’', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul ’s Foreign Ministry', 'Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'Consulate General', 'Atlanta', 'US', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Customs', 'Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport', 'Georgia', 'CBP', 'US', 'South Korea', 'US', 'South Koreans', 'US', 'US', 'Joongang Ilbo', 'South Korea', 'Suwanee Mediation', 'Florida', 'Suwanee', 'US', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'south korean', 'Jung Min - kyung']",1,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.19883479 0.59626758 0.21726717]

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he had no information.The suspension left North Korea’s Air Koryo as the only airline with regularly scheduled service to the North. Its website lists flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Dandong in China and Vladivostok in Russia.In this file photo taken Monday, Dec. 19, 2011, North Korean officials wait for passengers to board an Air China flight at Pyongyang airport in Pyongyang, North Korea. State-owned airline Air China suspended flights Tuesday between Beijing and North Korea due to a lack of demand, deepening the North's isolation amid mounting UN sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing has supported UN curbs on North Korean exports meant to pressure the government of leader Kim Jong-un to drop its pursuit of nuclear and missile technology but has argued against measures that might harm the country’s public.Flights were “temporarily suspended due to unsatisfactory business operations,” said an employee of Air China’s press office who would give only his surname, Zhang.A foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said he hadn’t heard about Air China’s cancellation. He said such decisions would be made based on the “state of operation and the market.”Airlines have steadily reduced the frequency of flights to North Korea as mounting political tensions depressed the already small number of business travelers and tourists visiting the North.Air China Ltd. announced in April it was cutting the frequency of flights to North Korea due to lack of demand. Some other Chinese carriers offered charter services to the North but those also have been canceled.Zhang said the last Air China flight to Pyongyang was Monday and he didn’t know when service might resume.The status of Air Koryo’s flights was unclear. Phone calls to the carrier’s Beijing office weren’t answered. The flight information website for the Beijing airport showed its Pyongyang flight on Tuesday took off as scheduled.Lu, the foreign ministry spokesman, appealed for measures to ease the tense standoff.“Given the highly complex and sensitive situation on the peninsula, we hope all relevant parties can do something conducive to alleviating the tension and pulling all sides concerned back to the track of negotiation and dialogue to settle the peninsular nuclear issue,” he said at a regular news briefing.","china suspended flights tuesday ,suspends north korea flights ,china suspends north korea ,airline air china suspended ,suspended flights tuesday","['Air China', 'Beijing', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'US', 'Donald Trump', 'Pyongyang', 'Air China ’s', 'chinese']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11755885  0.75313276

""Moreover, the Chugaryeong fault, which runs through Seoul, is believed to be an active one.""Last week a 5.4 magnitude quake struck the southeastern city of Pohang, the second-strongest quake on record to hit the country, revealing problems with the country's preparedness for quakes, such as the lack of quake-proof building design.The government said 5,569 cases of facility damage had been filed. The number of victims rendered homeless stood at about 1,099, and 83 people are reported to be injured, with one person in a critical condition due to an injury from a rockfall.","15 earthquakes have shaken ,shaken the seoul capital ,total of 15 earthquakes ,of 15 earthquakes ,of 15 earthquakes have","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Seoul', 'Siheung', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47338918  0.09880625

The number of people evacuated from their homes increased by 400 to 1,789 as of 6 a.m. More than 1,200 damage reports have been counted, with most of them coming from residential areas.  Officials from the city government of Suwon, just south of Seoul, visit an emergency shelter in Pohang on Nov. 16, 2017, to deliver relief items to victims of the earthquake that struck Korea the day before. This photo was provided by the Suwon city government. The state weather agency said 51 aftershocks have occured by 9 a.m. Friday.A total of 407 public facilities, such as schools and cultural heritage sites, were affected by the earthquake, mainly in the form of fissures. Relief items are being delivered to emergency shelters, and relief funds worth 814 million won  have been raised, the government said. The National Disaster and Safety Control Center said the government will provide victims with financial assistance early to help them rebuild or repair homes and other damaged facilities before those projects are completed.Under the measure, victims with completely destroyed homes will be given 9 million won  each, and those with partially destroyed houses will be provided with half that, officials said.Officials also said they're also working to determine whether to designate Pohang a disaster zone. The government has completed safety checks on 12 schools in Pohang to be used as venues for the state-administered college entrance exams to be held next week and will re-check five of them for potential safety problems. The exams had originally been scheduled for Thursday but were postponed by a week due to the quake.The government will also provide psychological treatment for victims, officials said.","second strongest earthquake recorded ,days after magnitude earthquake ,the second strongest earthquake ,second strongest earthquake ,strongest earthquake recorded in","[""South Korea 's"", 'Pohang', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.57334155  0.46161762

Among those injured, two are in critical condition and 10 are being hospitalized. Those who evacuated from their homes are currently staying in 27 different emergency shelters in nearby areas, including an indoor gym. More than 1,000 houses, buildings and private properties were either damaged or destroyed with signs of fissures and collapses, said authorities. Damages in public infrastructure including schools, roads and railways were also reported.  Victims left homeless by Wednesday`s earthquake take shelter in an indoor gym in Pohang. To cope with the damage, the government said Thursday it would take necessary steps in designating the city as a special disaster zone, which is a presidential-approved area that can receive financial support from the government to address damage from large-scale disasters. “Through a conversation with Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon,  the damage  was more serious than  ... which is why we have decided to follow the procedure,” Interior Minister Kim Boo-kyum said in a press briefing, referring to Lee’s visit to the disaster-affected area earlier in the day. Regardless of the decision, the government will first inject emergency funding of 4 billion won , he added. The city will be designated once damage from the earthquake exceeds 9 billion won. The figure is expected to rise, the ministry previously said, referencing seismic activity that hit Gyeongju in 2016.The city of Pohang estimated the total damage to amount to about 6.9 billion won as of 6 a.m. on Thursday. President Moon Jae-in was briefed on the news on a flight back to Seoul from his eight-day meetings with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Manila, Cheong Wa Dae said Wednesday. He entered an emergency meeting with his senior aides upon his arrival. On Thursday, Seoul’s prime minister also convened a separate meeting with government officials in charge of disaster recovery to review fiscal support for the city while vowing “swift recovery” of the site. Tax benefits and cuts in utility bills for Pohang residents were also discussed. “First of all, what‘s urgent is to recover from the damage and to ease the inconvenience of Pohang citizens,” Lee said at the beginning of the ministerial meeting. Lee also stressed preparedness for a possible nuclear disaster, pointing to 12 nuclear power plants situated near Pohang and calling for heightened awareness over additional earthquakes. The state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corp. confirmed normal operation of all 24 nuclear facilities in the nation Thursday. It also received orders from the energy minister to upgrade the seismic functions of key reactors. Lee later expressed his sympathy for the victims upon his visit to Pohang. The Ministry of Interior and Safety echoed Lee’s remarks by pledging to make full efforts to wrap up relief operations by the postponed date of the state-administered college entrance exam. The “suneung,” equivalent to the US’ SAT exams, was delayed this year for the first time in history, to Nov. 23 from Thursday, due to safety concerns. Gyeongju, a historic city located 370 kilometers southeast of Seoul, was declared a special disaster zone in September 2016, after it suffered from a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, South Korea’s strongest quake on record to date. Its total damage amounted to about 9 billion won and the government invested nearly 13 billion won for the recovery, according to the ministry.

The latest quake may be a prelude to larger-scale tremors to occur in the coming days,” he said. As of 5 p.m. Thursday, the Pohang area had experienced 45 small-scale aftershocks with magnitudes ranging between 2 and 3.6. The Korea Meteorological Administration said the quake may have been triggered by ruptures in the Yangsan fault plane.“Although we need further analysis on the activities of the Yangsan fault plane, we assume that the latest quake was caused by the displacement of a fault active in the country’s southeastern region,” Lee Mi-sun, head of seismic and volcanic affairs at the KMA, told reporters during a press briefing Thursday. “We are also assessing the link to the Gyeongju quake, since the epicenter of Wednesday’s quake in Pohang was just 43 kilometers away from Gyeongju.” An expert suggested that it is too early to assume that the Yangsan fault plane was the direct cause of Wednesday’s quake, raising the possibility that there may be unknown fault lines.“There are not many known active faults below the Pohang area, and there should be more research into unknown active fault lines around that area,” Hong Tae-kyung, a professor of earth science at Yonsei University, told the Korea Herald. The Yangsan fault plane is the most prominent fault plane in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula.Other experts called for the government’s prompt measures to prevent disasters.“The government needs to prepare for the possibility of a quake of 7 magnitude or higher, as well as bolster efforts to have more quake-resistant buildings and facilities around people,” said Kim Kwang-hee, a professor of geography and environment science at Pusan National University, in an interview with a Korean daily. The lack of earthquake-proof facilities and measures across the nation is also problematic, he said, adding that Korea needs to step up efforts in case of any possible quakes.According to Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport data, in 2015, just 26.7 percent of buildings that are at least three stories high or over 13 meters in Seoul were built based on earthquake-proof designs. The total figure across the country was slightly above 34 percent.By Kim Da-sol","following wednesday magnitude quake ,quake comes 14 months ,wednesday magnitude quake in ,months after magnitute quake ,wednesday magnitude quake","['south korean', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Gyeongju']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66091448  0.38314611

Student studies of the annual college entrace exam at a shelter in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, Wednesday. YonhapDue to Wednesday’s rare magnitude 5.4 quake and the series of aftershocks that struck Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, the Ministry of Education announced Wednesday evening that the test would be delayed by a week to Nov. 23. The delay, which was announced about 12 hours ahead of the start of the exam, seems so far to pose little problems, at least for private cram schools, or hagwon, as they can now take more students before the delayed exam and pocket extra profits. Among them, those in Daechi-dong -- Seoul’s affluent district that is home to hundreds of private cram schools -- responded quickly, rolling out special weeklong programs to make the most of the extra time. “We understand the frustration shared by students who have been preparing for the exam for years, although the delay is for their own safety. So we offer extensive courses to maximize opportunities for students to get the most out of their time,” said a lecturer from one of the private educational institutes in the area that teach multiple subjects. Jongro Academy, one of the biggest hagwon chains here, announced plans to offer its classrooms as study halls and for tutoring sessions, targeting frustrated students looking for space to focus on the upcoming exam.“The ministry’s announcement left me dispirited and fatigued because I have to be surrounded by books all over again for the next week. I’m worried this would have negative effect on my scores,” 18-year-old Kim Min-soo, who has been studying at one of Jongro’s branches in Gangnam, southern Seoul, told The Korea Herald. The highly competitive annual exam is the focus of 12 years of education leading to university. Students, as well as parents, often go to extreme lengths to prepare for the all-important event. The importance of the exam was clearly demonstrated in photographs of students taking shelter at evacuation centers in Pohang and continuing to study there despite fears of aftershocks. With the delayed exam, sales of related books increased over 40 times from a day before the earthquake, according to Yes24, an online bookseller.Students rummage through a pile of study aids discarded to mark the end of their preparations in Seoul on Thursday. YonhapKorean businesses, meanwhile, decided to postpone events they had prepared in time for the end of the college entrance examination.Mid- to late November is considered high season for retailers and travel agencies targeting students and their families after the college entrance exam. Department stores including Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store and Hyundai Department Store said they decided to delay by a week discount events for test-takers.Korea’s entertainment and leisure industries also rolled out measures in response to the weeklong delay. The nation’s top tourism firm Hana Tour said it had decided to allow free-of-charge changes or cancellations of trips for customers unable to travel as planned due to the delay. As this is an unprecedented case, the travel agency said it is considering how to provide the free cancellation benefits, such as whether to limit the offer to test-takers or extend it to family members as well.Amusement parks Lotte World and Everland have also decided to postpone or extend promotional discounts on tickets for test-takers.Some companies that had timed their events and campaigns for the end of the exam, however, were forced to hold the programs as scheduled.Global gaming convention G-Star has annually kicked off on the same day the college entrance exam is scheduled. But due to the delay, the gaming convention that opened Thursday to run through Sunday is expected to suffer from a fall in the number of visitors. The convention has drawn some 200,000 visitors each year, according to industry watchers.K-pop boy band VIXX LR’s concerts scheduled for Saturday and Sunday are also expected to see fewer spectators, as the boy band is largely backed by high school fans, according to industry sources.Meanwhile, some companies also acted swiftly to make donations to assist those affected by the earthquake.Korea’s largest tobacco producer KT&G; said Thursday it would raise 500 million won  to help victims in quake-hit Pohang.Major discount chains like Lotte Mart and E-mart, as well as convenience store operators BGF Retail and GS Retail, are also to offer food and daily necessities. This year marks the first time the suneung has been rescheduled due to a natural disaster. The postponement came after education authorities initially announced Wednesday that the exam would be held as planned as no severe damage had been reported to test venues in the southeastern city at the time.The earthquake was the second most powerful recorded in the country, following a quake of magnitude 5.8 that occurred in September 2016 in Gyeongju, just 25 kilometers from Pohang. With the delay, the suenung exam is to take place on Nov. 23 at 1,180 schools to accommodate a total of 593,527 students nationwide.By Bak Se-hwan and Shim Woo-hyun","due to wednesday earthquake ,wednesday rare magnitude quake ,wednesday earthquake ,wednesday earthquake is having ,to wednesday earthquake","['South Korea ’s', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'YonhapDue', 'Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5655455   0.09440406

The rare earthquake, second-strongest since 1978, hit north of the port city of Pohang on Wednesday afternoon. Tremors were felt as far as Seoul hundreds of kilometers away, with 41 aftershocks of up to magnitude 4.3 following, which continued until early Thursday morning, according to the state weather agency.  This photo, taken on Nov. 16, 2017, shows police officers delivering relief to victims of the earthquake that struck the southeastern city of Pohang a day earlier. The tally of victims displaced from their homes and staying in emergency shelters set up in nearby indoor gyms reached 1,536 as of 6:00 a.m., the authorities said.Fifty-seven people have sustained injuries, with two in critical condition and a dozen being treated at hospitals. The rest are stable and have returned home. The authorities received nearly 1,200 calls reporting facility damage in the area. The bulk of them came from residential buildings, while others were from business districts and factories, as well as public infrastructure including schools, roads and railways. Most of them were about fissures, collapses and breakages. The government will hold an emergency ministerial meeting, presided by Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, with related agencies to discuss recovery efforts in the aftermath. The Ministry of Education will carry out its own plans, including a thorough inspection of schools in the affected areas, and bolster efforts to ensure the rescheduled college entrance exam takes place without further trouble. The education ministry announced late Wednesday that it put off the date of the state-administered college entrance exam for another week, the first time such a decision was ever made for the test due to a natural disaster. The test was due to be held nationwide Thursday.","earthquake leaves many homeless ,after magnitude quake struck ,thursday the rare earthquake ,earthquake leaves many ,after magnitude quake","[""South Korea 's"", 'Pohang', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.53020942  0.24778607

The earthquake took place some 9 kilometers from the coastal city of Pohang at 2:29 p.m.. At least 14 people were reported to have sustained light injuries as of 7 p.m. It marked the second-strongest quake since the country began to collate seismic records in 1978. Korea‘s biggest magnitude 5.8 earthquake hit Gyeongju, near Pohang, last year. Experts attributed the latest quake to the displacement of a fault active in the country’s southeastern region, although they said it‘s too early to determine the cause and further study is needed based on data analysis. “When 5-magnitude or more powerful earthquakes occur, large and small aftershocks usually continue for months. A few aftershocks will follow this time too,” Lee Mi-sun, a Korea Meteorological Administration  official in charge of seismic and volcanic affairs, told reporters.The agency is looking into the possibility that the latest quake may have been caused by the activities of an eastern branch of Yangsan Fault, the most prominent fault plane in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula. Experts linked the Gyeongju quake to the 170-km fault line and its southern branch.She also said the agency is also considering geologists’suggestion that the southeastern fault lines of the peninsula were destabilized by the 9-magnitude earthquake which hit northeastern Japan in 2011. An expert suggested that the latest quake may be a prelude to more powerful ones to occur in the coming days, citing precedents in Korea and Japan. “Gyeongju was struck with a bigger quake a week after a slightly less powerful quake  had hit the region,”said Sohn Moon, a professor of geology and environmental science at Pusan National University. He said the quake may have been triggered by ruptures in the Yangsan fault plane and that means this quake may only be a prelude to larger-scale tremors. Sohn also cited a 7.4-magnitude earthquake that occurred in Kumamoto, Japan, which came days after a 7.1-magnitude quake struck the area. Hong Tae-kyung, an earth science professor at Yonsei University, noted there are not many known active faults below the Pohang area. He calls for more analysis raising the possibility that there may be unknown fault lines. They also stressed the need for caution and called for stepped-up efforts in case of any possible quakes that could come with a bigger impact.“We need to prepare for the possibility of a quake of 7 magnitude or higher, and bolster efforts to have more quake-resistant buildings and facilities around us.”","second strongest quake since ,on wednesday the earthquake ,the second strongest quake ,experts fear more earthquakes ,strongest quake since the","['south korean', 'Pohang']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68121725  0.69919443

It shattered many South Koreans’ belief that their country is safe from devastating quakes.  People shared photos and videos of buildings shaking, books falling from shelves and frames falling off walls. It has been only 14 months since the long-held notion was first challenged by a rare -- so far the strongest -- 5.8 magnitude quake originating from Gyeongju. “The front door of my house won’t open and my phone lost signal,” a Pohang resident wrote on an online community, where many shared their terrifying experiences during the series of strong tremors. “I bolted out of my house, when I saw pots and plants crashing to the floor and the shoe cabinet falling over,” another resident wrote. “I couldn’t go back in for fear of additional quakes.” Jo Jun-gil, head of the rural village of Mangcheon-ri in Pohang, said, “Many elderly residents are shocked. I visited each of their houses and told them to close the gas valve.” Social media is being inundated with photos and videos of buildings shaking, books falling from shelves and frames falling off walls. A video of students seen evacuating from the school building of Handong Global University in Pohang went viral. In that clip, a throng of people are seen rushing out of the building as its outer walls began to collapse. As of 6 p.m., the authorities said 10 people were hurt, but no casualties were reported. The first quake of magnitude 5.4 hit north of Pohang at 2:29 p.m. About two hours later, the area was hit by another 4.6 magnitude quake. Pohang citizens were told to evacuate. As of 6 p.m. Thursday, a total of nine quakes, two minor ones preceding the 5.4 magnitude quake, were recorded, the Korea Meteorological Administration said. The main tremor was recorded as the second strongest after the 5.8 magnitude earthquake in Gyeongju in September 2016. Tremors were felt in other parts of the country, including Seoul, about 270 kilometers away from Pohang, and the southern island of Jeju. Hyun Jae-yeon, who was traveling on Jeju Island at the time of the earthquakes, found out about what had happened from a series of alert messages on her mobile phone. “I felt the tremor about one minute after the emergency text message was sent to my phone. I do not think one minute is enough for people to evacuate to safe places,” said Hyun. People in the capital also voiced concerns over a lack of preparedness for earthquakes. “When my chair shook moments after receiving a text message about the earthquake, I felt unsafe here in Seoul and the country itself is horribly unequipped for earthquakes. Unfortunately, it feels like only a matter of time before a catastrophe strikes,” said Kim Jae-hoon, who felt an aftershock in Seoul on Wednesday.  People shared photos and videos of buildings shaking, books falling from shelves and frames falling off walls. There are public calls for the need to strengthen safety measures against earthquakes and prepare regulations on earthquake-resistant construction. “I do not see any significant changes regarding the government’s preventive measures since last year’s Gyeongju earthquake. Like Japan, the government should make earthquake-proof construction design mandatory for all constructors,” said Yoo Jae-min, 37, a business man who runs a coffee shop in Busan. The lack of earthquake-proof facilities across the nation are considered problematic.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s data, in 2015, just 26.7 percent of buildings three stories or over 13 meters high in Seoul were built based on earthquake-proof designs. The total figure across the country was slightly above 34 percent.By Kim Da-sol","korea wednesday magnitude quake ,quake free korea wednesday ,wednesday magnitude quake in ,wednesday magnitude quake ,safe from devastating quakes","['Pohang', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'South Koreans']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31619102  0.40875

Before then, they stayed at Paengmok Port, near where the ship sank. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries began a search operation inside the recovered wreck in early May, but only the remains of four of the total nine missing passengers were identified. “We do not want to think selfishly and continue to ask for a search ,” a bereaved family member was quoted by local media as saying. “We know that a tremendous amount of tax was already put into the search.  is what’s right for now.” The ship was carrying 476 passengers, mostly students of Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, when it sank on April 16, 2014. The Ansan City Government said it will prepare a farewell ceremony for missing Sewol passengers at a funeral hall in Ansan from Saturday to Monday.During the first stage of the seven-month search of the ferry’s wreckage, about 120 search operators sifted manually through bags of mud retrieved from the third to fifth decks of the ferry, where cabins are located.The second part of the search, which resumed in August, involved the first and second decks, the cargo compartment of Sewol.On May 17, the first human bone discovered on the sea bed where the Sewol sat was identified to be from Danwon High School teacher Ko Chang-suk, one of the nine missing passengers, through a DNA test by the National Forensic Service.A belated funeral for Ko was held Saturday. In addition to Ko, remains of two Danwon High School students and those of a female passenger have been identified. The remains of those three victims were discovered in bedrooms on the third and fourth floors where most of the Danwon High School students were staying on the day of the sinking. The ministry had said the five other missing bodies are believed to be in that area as well.Families also reportedly said they decided to halt the search operation with worries that adverse winter weather could hamper the search operation and risk operators’ lives on the seabed. By Kim Da-sol","funeral for them friday ,friday yonhapaccording to families ,ferry sinking in 2014 ,hold press conference tuesday ,hold joint funeral for","['Danwon High School', 'Mokpo Port']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06922215  0.25764194

Each of the copters fired one Hellfire guided missile at a shooting range in the waters off the western coastal city of Gunsan, according to the Army.They flew 60 kilometers before firing and all exactly hit the targets on the sea, the Army said. The Army introduced 36 Apache helicopters produced by Boeing in May last year and deployed them in January.  The Hellfire missiles were launched from different distances and in different manners so the pilots can better familiarize themselves with the missile, it also noted. Four more Apache helicopters also joined the live-fire exercise as command and back-up planes.  ""True to its name, the Hellfire is a strong guided missile that can completely destroy enemy targets. This is the first time the South Korean military has carried out a live-fire exercise with the missiles,"" the Army said. The exercise is designed to ""bring the Army's air fighting power up by one level after introducing the Apache helicopters in May last year."" With a range of 8 km, the Hellfire has been used by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan. One Apache chopper can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles.The South Korean Army's Apache unit, with its equipment and personnel, is capable of destroying 570 enemy tanks, according to the Army. ""The adoption of the Hellfire missile has equipped the military with the ability to destroy various enemy targets from a longer distance and has increased the chances of our attack helicopters' survival and our destructiveness against enemy tanks,"" the Army said. The US choppers would be mobilized to attack North Korean tanks and air-cushion vehicles in the event of armed conflict. They will also be among the first to be sent if North Korea launches a surprise landing on South Korea's frontline islands between the two Koreas. The United States Forces Korea also operates 48 Apache helicopters.","eight apache attack helicopters ,attack helicopters on monday ,firing from apache helicopters ,introduced 36 apache helicopters ,korean army tests missile","['the south korean Army', 'Army', 'Army', 'Army']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24888435  0.44296673

YonhapThe memorial service for Ko Chang-suk was held in the southwestern city of Mokpo in South Jeolla Province and was attended by bereaved families, government officials, survivors of the disaster and students. Ko went missing while trying to rescue his students as the Sewol ferry sank in waters off Jindo on April 16, 2014. In early May, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said that a piece of bone discovered underwater was identified to be from Ko. He was one of nine passengers missing from the Sewol ferry sinking. Of the missing nine, the remains of four, including Ko’s, were discovered during a search of the shipwreck that was hoisted from the sea in March.The ship was carrying 476 passengers, mostly students of Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. At the time of accident, Ko was in the lobby on the fifth floor of the ship, where it would have been relatively easy to escape, according to survivors. When the ferry started listing, Ko rushed to cabins on the fourth floor where students were staying and shouted at them to get out. He gave his life jacket to a student. He was last seen searching through cabins. “He could have escaped early,” one of the students who attended the memorial service was quoted as saying. “But he stayed to take care of us to the end.”Ko’s remains will be laid to rest at Daejeon National Cemetery on Monday. The government decided that Ko should be buried in the national cemetery because he died while on duty.By Kim Da-sol","heroic teacher victim funeral ,teacher victim funeral ,funeral was held saturday ,ferry sinking in 2014 ,teacher victim funeral was","['Ko Chang - suk', 'Mokpo', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Ko Chang - suk', 'Mokpo', 'South Jeolla Province']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09840155  0.29042709

A cold wave watch is issued if the morning low drops at least 10 degrees from the previous day or remains below minus 12 degrees for two or more days. In cities like Cheolwon in mountainous Gangwon Province, the morning low dropped to minus 1 degree, rising to a high of 16 degrees during the day, similar to the previous years’ average. Gwangju and Busan saw daytime highs hit 19 and 20 degrees, respectively, with cold weather quickly rising back to the average for this time of year in the afternoon.The cold weather is to continue off and on at least into next week, the KMA said. The central area and some parts of southern peninsula will face a cold morning with temperatures dropping below zero, with rain in store for Friday. The continental anticyclone from northern China moving in after the rain will likely send the mercury sharply down again on Saturday morning, the KMA said. Skies will be mostly clear across the country for a couple of days, though.

Ahead of Trump’s visit, Korean and US media had speculated on whether the US leader would make the visit, as all US presidents since the late Ronald Reagan had made the visit. Trump himself had kept the media guessing, saying “Well, I’d rather not say but you’ll be surprised” when asked about his plans regarding the DMZ.By Choi He-suk","canceled wednesday due to ,canceled due to weather ,koreas were canceled wednesday ,canceled wednesday due ,dmz trip canceled due","['US', 'Donald Trump', 'the Demilitarized Zone', 'Koreas', 'South Korea', 'DMZ', 'Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.36208054  0.73000264

A total of 41 patients have contracted SFTS from mites in South Korea this year. SFTS virus infections were first reported in the country in 2013, leading to 17 deaths out of 36 patients that year. The number increased from 55 infected patients and 16 deaths in 2014, to 79 infected cases and 21 deaths in 2015, and 19 deaths in 2016. There is currently no vaccine or cure to treat the virus contracted from the mites. According to experts, humid and hot weather makes it easy for the mites to reproduce. They may remain active until November, as relatively warm climates continue during the daytime. Earlier this summer, the sweltering heat had led to these mites becoming more active. About 1 1/2 times more mites were found outdoors, they added. The report, however, said an analysis on virus genetics showed that there was no SFTS virus detected from the collected mites. It added that falling outdoor temperatures will naturally diminish the risk of bites from mites. Seoul City’s quarantine authorities said they plan to monitor lethal mites at the Han River parks and execute timely quarantine measures such as weeding to prevent SFTS virus infections. By Kim Da-sol","killer bush ticks found ,found killer bush ticks ,han river raising alarm ,killer bush ticks in ,south korean health authorities","['south korean', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s Health and Environment Research Institute']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19845724  0.3882404

It is likely to take time to identify the victims as the bodies are severely damaged, they said.  Police said the truck’s brakes may have malfunctioned, based on witness testimonies that the vehicle was zigzagging on the road shortly before the crash.

But the total amount of compensation now exceeds 187 billion won, as the state has filed more claims against Yoo and those involved in the accident, including the captain Lee Joon-seok, who received life imprisonment on conviction of homicide.The passenger ship sank off the country's southwestern coast in April 2014, claiming 304 lives, mostly high school students on a field trip.  Yoo Dae-kyun The court said although Yoo could be said to be a de facto major stakeholder in Cheonghaejin Marine Co., which operated the ship, it is difficult to recognize that he was in a position to give managerial direction in relation to the Sewol's operations. It also noted that there is little evidence to substantiate the plaintiff's claim that Yoo took part in his late father Yoo Byung-eun's management of Semo Group to which Cheonghaejin was affiliated. The compensation claim was made based on special legislation enacted in the aftermath of the disaster, which stipulates the state can exercise its right to indemnity to a party that has caused the accident. The government has claimed that Yoo had the power, as the controlling shareholder in the shipping firm, to exert influence in the business. Yoo has denied the claim and insisted he was not involved in company management. The government has said the total cost of salvaging the ferry and dealing with the victims' families is tentatively estimated at 438.9 billion won. Of the amount, it has spent about 187.8 billion won as of the end of August 2015, it said. Separately, Yoo has been sentenced to two years in prison for embezzling nearly 7.4 billion won from the operator and six other affiliates. Of that total, some 3.5 billion won has been forfeited by the court.","300 dead the government ,ferry which sank three ,won 383 million from ,seoul court dismissed compensation ,dismissed compensation claim tuesday","['Seoul', 'Yoo Dae - kyun']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41090539  0.26862365

The May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement was a pro-democracy movement in which more than 200,000 Gwangju citizens took to the streets against the military dictatorship of Chun, an army general who came to power through a military coup in late 1979. Hundreds were killed and wounded there as the regime raged the most violent crackdown in the nation’s modern history.The protest was later officially recognized as a grassroots rebellion against the dictatorship. Since then, efforts have been made to find the missing, which the local government officially announced amounts to 82.The investigation comes eight years after the last excavation in 2009. The government had run three excavation investigations from 2002 to 2009, after receiving some 64 reports from the public since 1998. But its dig-up of nine sites had failed to find any missing bodies. About the secret burial of the bodies of the victims in the prison site, the military at the time had said 28 died there. But only 11 bodies have been collected. The site had been selected following testimonies and reports that pointed to the area as a secret burial site of missing victims, it added. A commander had testified to the prosecution last month that they had buried 12 bodies on May 23 that year and that three of the victims were killed as they were forcefully taken to the prison.A noncommissioned officer and a citizen protestor who had also been in the jail reported on what they saw. Based on the information, the excavation team will look into an around 117-meter stretch of land in the area and will use devices such as ground penetrating radar to detect bodies, the civic group explained. If the team finds a body, it will run gene analysis tests to verify the identity and match them with the blood samples of bereaved families stored in the forensic studies department of Chonnam National University in the region.During the press briefing, a special committee investigating the democratic uprising established at the Defense Ministry also announced that they had found evidence supporting that the government at the time had fabricated related facts about the incident. “We have found out that the Chun administration had created committees and teams such as the ‘80 Committee’ in 1985 as a countermeasure structure after the incident,” the committee said. “The members constituting the committees were from government bodies such as the National Security Agency, closely aiding the leader.” It explained that President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded the administration in 1988, had also created similar government institutes. The special committee said it would look further into the allegations.

A committee formed to record and remember the candlelit rallies -- an association of five civic groups -- unveiled plans Monday, including a commemorative vigil, public discussions and film screenings.  A total of 17 million people took to the streets for months from Oct. 29 last year, demanding Park step down over a corruption scandal involving her friend Choi Soon-sil. The protests pushed the parliament to impeach Park on Dec. 9. The Constitutional Court finalized her expulsion from power on March 10. The first anniversary rally will be held at 6 p.m. at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Saturday under the theme of “candle continues,” the committee said. Impromptu speeches will be made and several musicians, including the Jeon In-kwon Band, will perform onstage. Through the rally, participants will not only celebrate the removal of the ex-president, but also call for swift actions to eradicate “deep-rooted evils” to make society fairer and safer, the committee said during a press briefing. “Our 17 million candle citizens began to write a new history of democracy, but questions remain over how many of the 100 demands we put forward were realized,” said Jung Gang-ja, one of the co-heads of the committee. “We cannot help but declare that the candle  should continue.”Among the 100 demands are tougher actions against corporate crimes involving major conglomerates, the improvement of labor rights and reforms of the election system, political system, conglomerate-dominated economy and state-controlled media. Before the main event, some 15 rallies -- speaking up for the disabled, students, irregular workers and sexual minorities, among other groups -- will be staged at separate locations at or near the square, calling for social reforms for the marginalized, according to the committee. The committee is now working on a white paper on the candlelight vigils that took place between Oct. 29 and April 29 with intentions to publish it by the end of the year. The white paper will be distributed to civic groups and public libraries across the nation, with an online version to be available as well. It is also trying to install a statue at Gwanghwamun Square to commemorate the candlelight protests by March 10 next year. March 10 is when Park was expelled from power by the top court’s decision.The committee is also set to hold public forums on Dec. 9 to discuss what they learned through the candlelight movement and screen documentary films on the candlelight movement on Oct. 28 in Seoul, Gwangju and Jeju Island and on Nov. 4 in Busan. South Korea’s candlelight vigils have been praised as a symbol of democracy for removing the embattled leader from power through peaceful protests. Those who participated in the candlelit rallies received an internationally recognized award last week for their commitment to peace and democracy from the German political foundation Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.By Ock Hyun-ju","monday including commemorative vigil ,anniversary of candlelight vigil ,groups unveiled plans monday ,plans monday including commemorative ,first anniversary of candlelight","['Seoul', 'Park Geun']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.17457874 0.12793921 0.40202916],Ock Hyun-ju,Social affairs,10,2017,"last year demanding park step ,candlelight protests by march 10 ,plans monday including commemorative vigil ,in central seoul on saturday ,10 the first anniversary rally","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Band', 'Jung Gang - ja', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Busan', 'South Korea ’s', 'german', 'Friedrich Ebert Stiftung', 'Ock Hyun - ju']",6,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.17457874 0.12793921 0.40202916]

Construction of Shin Kori nuclear reactors No. 5 and 6 have been suspended since June 27 at 29.5 percent completion under the new Moon Jae-in administration’s nuclear phase-out drive. About 1.6 trillion won  had already been spent on the project.“We hereby announce our decision to recommend to the government the resumption of the stalled construction of Shin Kori No. 5 and 6,” a state commission tasked with gauging public opinions on the matter said in a press briefing which was broadcast live on TV.  The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said it respects the committee’s conclusion and will make necessary preparations. Resumption will be endorsed at the next Cabinet meeting slated for Tuesday, it added. The Shin Kori reactors project has been one of the most divisive issues in South Korea recently, pitting advocates of President Moon’s nuclear-free Korea vision against its vocal critics in almost every sphere of society from politics and academia to industrial sectors. Nuclear power plants generate one third of electricity here. Friday’s outcome casts dark clouds over Moon’s campaign for an energy policy U-turn away from nuclear toward renewables. Pace adjustments look inevitable. 59.5 percent vs 40.5 percent The commission that decided on the fate of the Shin Kori reactors reached the outcome based on four rounds of surveys on the “citizen jury,” a group of 471 ordinary South Koreans. After monthslong discussions and presentations from experts and different interest groups, the jury was 59.5 percent in favor of the resumption, while 40.5 percent wanted to see the project aborted altogether.“As the deliberation process proceeded, surveys showed a gradual increase in the number of those who support the project’s completion,” Kim Ji-hyoung, the head of the nine-member committee explained. “In the end, there was a quite significant difference between the two.” The result has a 95 percent confidence level with a margin of error of plus and minus 3.6 percentage points, he said. Regardless of the Shin Kori reactors, the jury supported a reduction in nuclear energy overall, Kim said. “We also recommend that the government should forge polices toward reducing the proportion of nuclear power generation,” he said. In the fourth survey, 53.2 percent of the jurors supported a scale-down of nuclear reactors, while 35.5 percent chose a status quo and 9.7 percent an increase, the commission revealed. South Korea currently has 24 reactors and 9 are under construction or being planned. Moon in June unveiled a green energy roadmap which includes shutting down aged reactors and closing all other facilities over the next four decades. Shortly after the announcement, the country’s oldest reactor -- Kori No. 1 -- closed operation. Mixed reactions  The construction site of Shin Kori. Reflecting a divided society on the issue, reactions were also mixed. The Korea Federation for Environmental Movements said they “accept the final survey result with a heavy heart,” but will continue to campaign for a nuclear-free South Korea. Greenpeace Korea said in a statement that the government should not allow Friday’s outcome to affect its push for a green energy transition. Some environmental activists urged the president to make good on his election promise to do away with nuclear reactors. Opposition politicians did not miss the opportunity to attack President Moon and the ruling camp, demanding Moon’s apology for causing social confusion and economic losses. “The government has to apologize for the commotion that it has triggered and take time for self-reflection,” Choung Tae-ok, the spokesman of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party said.“The government has made a nuclear power phase-out a fait accompli and has used all ways and methods to promote its policy. ... , it has submitted to citizens‘ right voices regarding its wrong policy,” he added.The ruling Democratic Party said it would “respect” the outcome, stressing that the government carried out a democratic deliberation process to reach social consensus over the highly polarizing issue.The nuclear industry hailed the decision. “Once we receive the official document from the government, we will notify contractors and work for the resumption of the construction,” the state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., which is leading a consortium of companies building the two reactors. It also said it plans to compensate local contractors on about 100 billion won in financial damage caused by the construction’s suspension. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission said once the government finalizes the resumption, the commission’s task force will thoroughly check on the safety conditions since work is to resume after a three month hiatus. It could take about one month, it said.By Kim Da-sol","nuclear reactors on friday ,nuclear reactors to resume ,reactors on friday ,reactors to resume south ,reactors on friday in","['South Korea', 'Kori', 'Moon Jae - in']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5962168   0.5634492

YonhapAccording to the poll conducted by Realmeter on 526 people on Wednesday, 43.2 percent supported resumption of the construction, while 43.8 percent said they would like to see the project aborted altogether. Construction of the Shin Kori No. 5 and 6 reactors, located in the southeastern city of Ulsan, was halted at about 28 percent completion in July, amid the Moon Jae-in’s administration’s drive to shift energy policy away from nuclear power toward renewables. The government formed a committee to gauge the opinions of different interest groups and said it would accept whatever result the committee makes.The committee will announce its conclusion Friday. If the difference between proponents and opponents exceeds a margin of error of 8 percentage points, the final decision will be based on the majority opinion. According to the Realmeter survey, 56 percent in Daejeon and Chungcheong Province opposed continuing the construction, while over the majority in Gwangju and Jeolla Province also opposed the construction, at 54 percent.However, cities like Busan and Ulsan, where 10 out of 24 nuclear reactors in Korea -- including two reactors on hold -- are located, showed 53.3 percent agreed to resumption of the construction. Currently, Korea has 24 nuclear reactors in operation, from which it gets about a third of the country’s total electricity.The committee conducted the first-stage public survey by phone on some 20,000 people across the country last month. The second-stage survey was conducted during a jury panel orientation session last month, while the third and fourth surveys were carried out on 471 “citizen jurors” during the jury panel’s final comprehensive debate that ended last week. Last week, Moon said he would not seek to single-handedly push ahead with his election pledge, given the division of public opinion, reiterating that he would “accept the results no matter what.”The committee’s conclusion will be televised live Friday, while the government’s decision will be made during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.By Kim Da-sol","nuclear reactors expected friday ,reactors expected friday survey ,526 people on wednesday ,friday survey showed thursday ,reactors expected friday",['korean'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65347594  0.52398956

But more than arguing over how fast the country’s energy policy should shift, the country must focus more on finding the right energy mix, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s secretary-general.  OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria. YonhapSouth Korea is about to see a “very drastic and accelerated changing of energy cost structures,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. Choosing the right energy mix that would work for consumers, industrial companies as well as the environment is not a simple task. “There is no single technology or source . It’s more about thinking which direction to go, moving away from pollution,” he said. “It’s a question of technology and cost. It’s a question of speed and availability of renewables,” he added. Gurria spoke positively of the South Korean government’s commitment to moving away from nuclear energy, which now accounts for one-third of the country’s power production, and increasing the proportion of clean energy. South Korea, with its advanced and sophisticated technology and strong political commitment, would be able to handle much of the current power demand with alternatives, he predicted. The world is seeing a fast drop in the minimum unit cost for renewables such as solar and wind energy, in contrary to that of nuclear power, the official added. On Friday, South Korea will find out whether the Shin Kori No. 5 and 6 nuclear reactors, the construction of which has been suspended since June by the Moon Jae-in administration at 28 percent completion, will be aborted. Gurria’s remarks were made in a joint press conference with Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon on the sidelines of a meeting of the OECD Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth meeting that opened Thursday.The secretary-general also mentioned another great resource that Korea has available but has not been able to make active use of: women and the elderly. “ still has a very big gap between men and women when it comes to economic participation as well as salary in the labor market,” said Gurria. Acknowledging Korea’s aging population, he said too many elderly are required to stop working as early as in their 50s, which he viewed as one of the most serious elderly issues among OECD countries. “With no active migration policy in Korea, suggestions are that you have to use your capacity to use the current resources.”By Kim Da-sol","under construction due friday ,two nuclear reactors already ,south korea energy industry ,energy policy should shift ,construction due friday","['South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ’s', 'OECD', 'Angel Gurria']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.406284    0.38708442

The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. About 13 percent said they're unsure about what's best.The survey is in line with a series of other polls that show pros and cons are neck and neck.By region, opposition to the project was higher among those in Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces, while support was higher among those in Seoul, Gyeonggi and Gyeongsang provinces. More than 70 percent of supporters of the liberal ruling Democratic Party expressed opposition to the project, while an overwhelming number  of supporters of the conservative main opposition Liberty Korea Party called for resuming construction.In an effort to reduce South Korea's dependence on nuclear energy, President Moon Jae-in proposed scrapping the reactor project. The government then established the independent commission and charged it with gauging public opinion on the proposal. It also suspended the reactors' construction until a decision is made. The commission plans to unveil its recommendation Friday.The reactors were about 28.8 percent complete before construction was suspended in July.The proposal to scrap work on the reactors sparked heated debate in a country that relies on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity. Proponents say the country should phase out nuclear power for safety and environmental reasons, but opponents say it will lead to a shortage in the power supply and a spike in electricity prices, and that too much money has already been spent on the construction.","reactors survey showed thursday ,two unfinished shingori nuclear ,526 adults on wednesday ,nuclear power reactors survey ,unfinished shingori nuclear power","['South Koreans', 'Shingori', 'Shingori-5']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39121684  0.55744773

YonhapAccording to the Korea Meteorological Administration, the quake originated some 10 kilometers away from where the communist regime conducted its sixth and largest nuclear detonation. It was detected at 1:41 a.m. Friday in the northwest region of Gilju in North Hamkyung Province from a depth of about 3 kilometers underground. The US Geological Survey assessed it to be of 2.9 magnitude, originating 23 kilometers northeast of Sungjibaegam, Ryanggang Province, in North Korea. “The event has earthquake-like characteristics, however, we cannot conclusively confirm at this time the nature  of the event,” said a statement released by the US Geological Survey. The area is considered stable and quakes do not normally occur there. However, since the Sept. 3 underground nuke test, it has seen two other quakes of magnitude 2.6 and 3.2. The North’s latest nuclear experiment, which it claimed involved the test of a hydrogen bomb, generated seismic waves of 5.7 magnitude, according to the Korean authorities, or 6.3 magnitude based on the US’ analysis. Experts say the small quakes that occurred after the test may have been linked to the nuclear detonation, with some suggesting a possible increase of geological stress in the area. All of North Korea’s nuclear explosions since 2006 caused earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.3 or above.By Kim Da-sol","friday near nuclear test ,earthquake was detected friday ,largest nuclear detonation ,detected friday near nuclear ,friday near nuclear","['North Korea', 'korean', 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Gilju', 'North Ham']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50791931  0.26734579

In the disaster, the Sewol ferry sank off the country’s southwestern coast, resulting in 295 deaths and nine passengers unaccounted for. Since the wreckage was brought ashore in April this year, the remains of four of the nine missing passengers have been found. According to President Moon Jae-in’s chief of staff Im Jong-seok, documents were found that suggest the timeline of Park being briefed on the day of the disaster have been modified to be favorable to the former president. Presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok explains to reporters about records related to former President Park Geun-hye's activities during the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster, at Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday. Im also said that Cheong Wa Dae’s crisis management manual had been changed in the weeks that followed the disaster. “The previous administration said that then-President Park Geun-hye was first briefed on the Sewol at 10 a.m. on April 16, 2014, and gave the first order regarding the response at 10:15 a.m.,” Im said. Im said that the documents discovered by the current administration, however, state that the first briefing was made at 9:30 a.m.“The problem is that Cheong Wa Dae drew up the log again, with the briefing times changed. The log compiled on Oct. 23, 2014, six months after  states that the first report was made at 10 a.m.,” Im said.“It can only be considered that the change is intended to narrow the time gap between the time of the first report  and  first order.” Regarding the changes to the crisis management manual, Im said the orders were given by then NSC chief Kim Kwan-jin. The changes state that the NSC was in charge of crises related to national security, while disasters come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Security and Public Administration. In the unaltered version, the manual states that the NSC chief “acts as the control tower in a national crisis,” Im said. Im also revealed that the duties required of the NSC chief were reduced in the altered version. According to Im, the original states that the NSC chief must aid the president in managing crises, analyze and assess related information, and plan crisis management measures. In the altered version, however, the role is stated simply as supporting the president in “stable execution of state affairs” in relation to national crises. Im went on to list the legal procedures involved in changing the manual, which includes review by the Ministry of Government Legislation, saying that the Park administration made the changes illegally. “Cheong Wa Dae  ignored legal protocols, and altered the manual by crossing out  and informed government ministries  on July 21, 2014,” Im said. “This illegal change appears to have been made to fit testimony by Kim Ki-choon, who said at the National Assembly that NSC is not the control tower in managing crises.”Kim was Park’s chief of staff from August 2013 to February 2015.By Choi He-suk","2014 sewol ferry disaster ,the nine missing passengers ,thursday in the disaster ,sewol ferry sank off ,the sewol ferry sank","['Park Geun', 'Accordi']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20295605  0.17995948

YonhapAttended by victims’ grieving families, officials in charge of the salvage operation and some 30 other people, the ceremony was held following the wishes of the mothers of Cho Eun-hwa and Heo Da-yoon.“It would have been better to hold funerals for our children with other passengers still missing from the disaster. That’s why we want to call  a farewell ceremony,” the families said. The bodies of five passengers are still unaccounted for.In April, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries began a search of the recovered wreckage and discovered from inside the ferry the remains of Danwon High School teacher Go Chang-suk and student Heo Da-yoon. In the following month, the remains of Danwon High School student Cho Eun-hwa and passenger Lee Young-sook were discovered. Marking the start of a long-awaited end, families held Saturday a send-off ceremony for two girls at Mokpo Port in South Jeolla Province, where the 6,825-ton ferry that had been lying at a depth of 44 meters since 2014 April was raised on March 23. Since then, the search operation for five unrecovered passengers’ remains has been underway. Two victims’ portraits were then moved to a multipurpose hall at Seoul City Hall as part of the families’ efforts to express gratitude to the people who had prayed for them and shed tears alongside them. Over the weekend, hundreds of people visited and laid flowers in front of the portraits of Cho and Huh. Monday’s farewell ceremony was brief. Many watched the two mothers thanking those who wished for the return of their daughters.“I want to look at her face again,” said Lee Keum-hui, mother of Cho Eun-hwa, approaching the portrait of her smiling daughter. “Thanks to all your prayers, I am now ready to send my daughter to a peaceful place, taken out from the cold freezer which her body was kept for so long.”Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon also attended the ceremony, and could be seen consoling the mothers. “Knowing no end to the endless sorrow of this tragedy, the entire nation cried and suffered together. Suffering like this should never be repeated,” Park said. While the families decided not to hold a formal funeral ceremony, portraits were shortly placed at a classroom in Danwon High School, which the two first-year students had attended prior to the tragic sinking. Their bodies will lie at Seoho Funeral Park in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where other Sewol victims have been laid in state.The search team has yet to find the remains of five of the 304 victims, including two other Danwon High School students, a teacher and a father and son.By Kim Da-sol","school victims held farewell ,farewell ceremony on monday ,farewell ceremony at seoul ,victims held farewell ceremony ,yonhapattended by victims grieving","['Jindo', 'Danwon High School', 'Danwon', 'Cho Eun - hwa', 'yonhapattende']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34996006  0.28355277

South Korea’s seismic agency put the magnitude at 3.2, while US and Chinese agencies estimated it to be 3.5 and 3.4, respectively.   Given the nature of seismic waves and the lack of acoustic waves, the incident clearly showed the earthquake was not caused by an artificial explosion, said Woo Nam-chul, an earthquake expert at the meteorological agency.  “We clearly detected the seismic characteristics of P-wave and S-wave, which are shown in natural earthquakes,” Woo was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency. “Sound waves are usually detected in the case of artificial earthquakes, but we didn’t capture any sound waves.” The agency confirmed that it had witnessed two earthquakes in the same area, saying a 2.6 magnitude quake took place 49 kilometers northwest of Kilgu at 1:43 p.m., about four hours before the 3.2 magnitude earthquake hit around the same place. China Earthquake Networks Center said 3.4-magnitude earthquake was detected in northwest of North Korea. YonhapReversing its initial assessment of a “suspected explosion,” China Earthquake Networks Center concluded that Saturday’s earthquake was “not a nuclear test,” adding that the incident had the characteristics of a natural earthquake. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also released a report saying the earthquake was likely a “lagged collapse earthquake,” according to a report by AFP, echoing experts’ assessment that the earthquake was a delayed repercussion of the previous detonation.In a tweet posted Saturday, Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, said the quake was “unlikely man-made” and looked similar to a “collapse” event at North Korea’s Sept. 6 nuclear test. North Korea’s latest nuclear test -- its sixth to date -- was detected as a 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Sept. 3 and was followed by a 4.1 magnitude quake that experts said could have been a tunnel collapsing after the nuclear explosion.“The most probable hypothesis at present is that this is a consequence of the previous event, which was of a significant magnitude and may still have repercussions in a fracture zone,” Zerbo said in an interview with AFP. David Wright of the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists agreed the latest quakes did not appear to have been caused by a new nuclear explosion. “It seems likely that these small tremors are related to the shifts in the ground due to the recent large test,” he told Reuters.The United States Geological Survey was neutral in its assessment of the cause of the tremor, saying in a statement that it could not “conclusively confirm at this time” whether the earthquake was a natural or human-made event.With North Korea and the US exchanging bellicose rhetoric over Pyongyang’s relentless pursuit of its nuclear ambition, the world has braced itself for another show of force by the North, which threatened to carry out an atmospheric nuclear test.In comments to reporters in New York on Thursday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said his country’s leader Kim Jong-un is considering whether to demonstrate his ability to detonate a nuclear warhead aboard a missile sent above the Pacific.

Pyongyang claimed it detonated a full-fledged hydrogen bomb earlier in the month and said it can be placed on a long-range missile.The KMA was also forced to change the epicenter of the magnitude 2.6 and 3.2 aftershocks, by some 20 kilometers, despite Chinese authorities releasing the precise location hours earlier. The weather service initially said it detected only one aftershock over the weekend, although the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization under the United Nations immediately reported two tremors in the vicinity of the North Korea nuclear test site in Punggye-ri, North Hamgyong Province.The failure to quickly provide data comes after it was slow to announce small quakes triggered by the caving in of the test site after the latest nuclear test. It was not until Sept. 5 that the KMA reported small tremors at the Punggye-ri site. At that time, the China Earthquake Networks Center reported the quake almost in real time.This tardiness coupled with the KMA not releasing information about the quake it received from the state-run Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources caused the country's prime minister to issue a stern warning to both agencies.  Related to the criticism, the KMA claimed it took time to make the announcement because it did not get relevant data from CENC. The two agencies exchange information on earthquake data under a pre-set arrangement.On the positive side, the local weather service was clear early on that the latest aftershocks were not caused by an underground explosion, while CENC and some foreign media reports initially raised the possibility of another explosive test by Pyongyang.","actually two earthquakes saturday ,two earthquakes saturday ,latest underground nuclear test ,two earthquakes saturday which ,korea latest underground nuclear","[""South Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's"", 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54439753  0.6689592

A tiny dead insect was found inside the product, while being administered to a five-month-old child at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital. Parents found it and called hospital staff to disconnect the IV product from their child. In another case, reported Tuesday, a nurse at Inha University Hospital in Incheon found a contaminated IV product and reported it to the authorities. A cockroach is suspected, officials said. The two products are from different suppliers, Sungwon Medical and Shinchang Medical. Health authorities, while investigating the cases, suspended business of the manufacturers and ordered a recall of the entire 40,000 products supplied by them. Sungwon Medical, which supplied to Ewha university hospital, has a factory in the Philippines that manufacture half-finished products. The later process of assembling, packaging and labelling the products is done here. Suspecting that the insect may have gotten inside during the manufacturing process, the ministry said it will conduct an onsite investigation at the factory in the Philippines. Parents of the infant that received fluids from the tainted bag blamed hospital staff for negligence and a flawed hygiene management of the medical equipment.The ministry, however, said inspections showed that there was no breach of rules on the side of the hospital. Authorities said the investigation into the IV fluid bag from Shinchang Medical which allegedly had a roach in it was still at an early stage Wednesday. The ministry said it will conduct a special inspection next month to strengthen the manufacturing process and hygiene management of medical products. By Kim Da-sol","two local medical suppliers ,contaminated iv bags reported ,drug safetyhealth authorities confirmed ,bags reported since sunday ,some 110 000 intravenous","['the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug SafetyHealth']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04364606  0.81079698

""Receiving the news of the causalities and losses of many materials caused by the recent hurricane in the eastern and central areas of your country, I extend deep consolation and sympathy to you and, through you, to the Cuban government, people and residents in the afflicted areas,"" Kim said in the message sent to Castro Tuesday. The Rodong Sinmun, a daily of the ruling Workers' Party, carried it on its front page.  This photo provided on Friday, Sept. 8, 2017, shows storm damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Virgin Gorda’s Saba Rock in the British Virgin Islands. Irma scraped Cuba’s northern coast Friday on a course toward Florida, leaving in its wake a ravaged string of Caribbean resort islands strewn with splintered lumber, corrugated metal and broken concrete. North Korea experts here said, however, that the message was somewhat a departure from the North's common practice, in which its titular leader Kim Yong-nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, has sent congratulatory or condolence messages to foreign leaders.""Kim's message seems to have taken the importance of the North's diplomacy with Cuba into consideration as its diplomatic isolation in the Central and South Americas deepens in the wake of its sixth nuclear test, such as the recent expulsion of its ambassadors from Mexico and Peru,"" Chang Cheol-woon, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said.                       It's the third time that Kim has sent a message of condolence to a foreign leader in his name, following one to Castro over hurricane damages in October 2012 and another one to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad over the death of his mother in February last year.","hurricane damages north korean ,recent hurricane in the ,castro over hurricane damages ,hurricane irma north korean ,the recent hurricane in","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'cuban', 'Raul Castro', 'north korean']",6,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.27057573  0.08767824

The man, initially spotted on the track near Gimhae International Airport Station, was shortly reported to the BGLRT by the passers-by. However, it took 50 minutes since the initial report for the BGLRT to remove him from the railway, after he had walked 4 kilometers down the track.According to the BGLRT, the 22-year old man from Kiribati, a country in the Pacific Ocean, was on his way to Gimhae International Airport to catch his flight. Wandering around under the influence of alcohol, he got stranded from his company and walked into the train track.The man’s act was an infraction of the Railroad Safety Act, but the BGLRT had let him leave the country without putting him under a proper investigation.In the absence of a thorough investigation, the BGLRT has still been unable to identify the exact route through which the man broke into the train track: a crucial piece of information needed to identify the weak spot in the railway’s safety mechanism and prevent such trespassing in the future.The BGLRT also did not report the incident to its oversight body, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.","drunk kiribati man walking ,man walking on busan ,sasang station last tuesday ,busan train track sparks ,walking on busan train","['Kiribati', 'Busan', 'Kiribati']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45495009  0.08489446

In 2009, six South Koreans were killed after the North's sudden release of water from the dam.After the deaths, the North promised to give the South notice before opening the floodgates, but the regime has not done so since its last notification in July 2013.","floodgates of hwanggang dam ,korea releases dam water ,monday causing the water ,releases dam water without ,north opened the floodgates","['YEONCHEON', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Pi']",6,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.21097259 -0.02599533

Social media users have been abuzz with wishful predictions of an extra vacation.  The previous Park Geun-hye administration had sometimes given out extra days off to boost lackluster consumer sentiments and to attract public support.However, the Office for Government Policy Coordination and Ministry of Personnel Management have called the rumor “groundless,” Wednesday.“Nothing has been discussed in the latest Cabinet meeting to set the 14th as a temporary holiday,” wire service Yonhap quoted a government official as saying.“The next Cabinet meeting is scheduled for Aug. 16, after the liberation day. There are no plans to hold an emergency meeting to designate the 14th as a holiday.”In order to confirm a temporary holiday, a request has to be made by a government department to the Ministry of Personnel Management, who will then raise the bill to the Cabinet and publish it in the official gazette. There is still a chance for a 10-day holiday in October.  In October, a long stretch of national holidays is expected starting with National Foundation Day on Tuesday Oct. 3, Chuseok holidays from Oct. 4 to 6 and Hangeul Proclamation Day on Oct. 9.If Monday, Oct. 2, is made a temporary holiday, that would create a chain of holidays that includes two weekends and a full 6 week days.The government will discuss the matter around the end of September.

According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 1,284 people have fallen ill due to heat-related illnesses as of Tuesday, while six have lost their lives.A woman in her 60s living in Geoje, South Gyeongsang Province, where the hot spell has been the most intense with the daytime high reaching 37 degrees Celsius on Monday, was found dead in a rice field. Another man in his 80s was found dead in front of his house in South Chungcheong Province at around noon on Friday. The average midday high hit 33.7 C last week. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said Tuesday that over 2.1 million livestock died due to the extreme weather, including at least 2 million chickens, 35,000 ducks and 9,000 pigs at farms across the country.The scorching heat is also affecting sea temperatures. Due to the warmer water temperature, at least 8,000 flatfish at fish farms in Busan were reported dead. At least five fish farms on the southern island of Jeju reported damage of at least 69,000 fish deaths, while six fish farms in North Gyeongsang Province reported a damage of some 36,000 fish. Flat fish, one of the most common types raised in Korean fish farms, can withstand a water temperature of up to 32 C. But water temperatures at some of these farms exceeded that level, the ministry said. On Tuesday, heat wave alerts were issued in 29 cities and counties, including Busan.

Although the typhoon is expected to skirt the peninsula, there is a chance that South Korea's southern and eastern coastal areas will be inundated by heavy rains, the agency said.On Sunday afternoon, a trough passing the northern part of the country, coupled with constant inflows of water vapor, will likely bring heavy rains to Seoul and the central region. The east coastal region is expected to receive heavy rains on Monday through Tuesday.The precipitation is expected to reach up to 50 millimeters over the 24-hour period in the central region and 20 mm in the southern region when they are approached by the typhoon.Chances are high that the typhoon, which formed in the sea 1,950 kilometers east-southeast of Tokyo on July 21, will become this year's first one to directly hit Jeju Island, the weather agency said.The weather agency said earlier that South Korea will likely be affected by about two typhoons this summer, the same as in the average year, with an average of 10 to 12 typhoons expected to form in the northwestern Pacific region.","on sunday strong typhoon ,sunday strong typhoon ,sunday strong typhoon is ,the season fifth typhoon ,friday typhoon","['South Korea', 'japanese', 'Kyushu', 'japanese', 'Okinawa']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.72289586  0.13072096

Jeju and Busan will see indirect impacts of wind gusts and at least 300-400 millimeters of rain from Saturday night. Wind gusts, storm surges and torrential downpours will expand across the rest of the peninsula late Sunday night into Monday evening, with the highest risk expected in cities near East Sea. Formed on July 20, Noru has recently reached super typhoon status, becoming the strongest developed so far this year. To become a super typhoon, a storm’s peak winds must exceed 240 kilometers per hour. Large swells caused by Noru have already been seen affecting parts of the Japanese coast and East Sea.The Jeju Emergency Management Agency on Thursday activated emergency measures and issued advisories for high winds and waves on the sea near the southern island. The Busan Metropolitan City also held an emergency meeting for preventive measures against possible landslides and stream flooding. It discussed ways to remove beach umbrellas and water sports activities structures. Other municipalities said they are considering canceling summer festivities such as a beach festival slated for the weekend. On Thursday, Seoul and most cities across the country saw blistering temperatures, with highs hovering in the mid-30s in metropolitan areas. Daytime highs soared to 34 degrees Celsius in Seoul and Gwangju and on Jeju, while Jeonju saw its high get up to 35 degrees.A heat wave warning was issued in Seoul, Incheon, Gwangju, Jeju and parts of South Gyeongsang, South Chungcheong, Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces. By Kim Da-sol","said thursday yonhap typhoon ,of thursday the typhoon ,thursday yonhap typhoon ,thursday yonhap typhoon noru ,thursday the typhoon","['South Korea', 'Korea ’s', 'noru', 'Japan']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41534922  0.3360545

It is located some 5 kilometers from the closest residential village in Bongyang County, Jecheon.Separately from the ministry, Jecheon police are checking whether nudists going au naturel at a privately owned lodging, if the facility qualifies as such, could be punishable for public lewdness. According to a survey conducted last month by local pollster Realmeter on 510 men and women aged 19 or older, 51.9 percent of respondents answered that nudist resorts should be prohibited, since the concept is “not agreeable to Korean sentiment.” Another 22.4 percent said naturism should be allowed in people’s privately owned space, while 25.7 percent said they had no opinion. By Kim Da-sol","nudist resort faces crackdown ,resort faces crackdown nudist ,controversial nudist resort faces ,faces crackdown nudist facility ,crackdown after villagers staged","['Jecheon', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'South Korea ’s', 'Jecheon', 'North Chungcheong Province']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61223125  0.17975301

Operators the Sewol ferry continued to run services on the vessel even after they became aware of a critical engine failure, which could have contributed to the ship’s capsizing in April 2014, a news report said Tuesday. An engine failure was detected in the ferry at least six months before the accident and its operator Chonghaejin Marine Co. was aware of the associated safety risks, local media outlet Media Today reported, citing company documents. But the firm was unable to find its cause or repair it. The Sewol sinking is the country’s worst maritime disasters in history. The 6,800-ton ferry was carrying 476 passengers when it sank off the southwestern coast near Jindo on April 16, 2014, killing 304 aboard, most of whom were high school students on a field trip to Jeju Island. “There was an accident in which the ferry’s engine suddenly stopped working after oil steam was generated and pressure was reduced, which could have resulted in severe casualties,” Chonghaejin said in a report to the Incheon branch of the Korea Shipping Association on Sep. 26, 2013. The ship operator requested the industry lobby to launch a probe into an excessive inflow of sludge -- a mixture of oil, water and sand -- into the fuel pipeline inside the Sewol. In a report written on Jan. 28 in 2014, the company reported a similar malfunction, saying the safe operation of the ship was hampered due to the sludge blocking the pipelines. It asked the association again to look into how the sludge-mixed fuel was supplied and who was responsible. But the cause of the problem was not found and the ferry continued to run. In another paper filed about a week before the disaster, an official from the ferry operator said that he had not discovered “clear” reasons behind the problem even after an on-site inspection. More than three years after the sinking, little information has been found about the cause, with the bereaved families calling for a full-fledged reinvestigation. The prosecution concluded in October 2014 that the accident resulted from a combination of the illegal redesign of the ship, overloaded freight and an erroneous sharp turn by an inexperienced crew member. The government’s lax safety regulations were also thought to be a reason. A special investigative committee was launched in July to examine the salvaged ferry and the cause of the disaster for up to 10 months. The panel is looking into whether there was any mistake by crew members in the steering room and why the ship lost balance during a sudden change of direction. The 145-meter-long ferry, which had been lying more than 40 meters underwater, was lifted above water in March and moved onto a dry dock at the port of Mokpo in April this year. The bodies of five victims are still missing, and searches of the ferry’s wreckage and the site of the sinking are underway.","ship capsizing in april ,the salvaged sewol ferry ,tuesday an engine failure ,months before the accident ,salvaged sewol ferry at","['Mokpo', 'South Jeolla Province']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09706803  0.36887124

A rip tide monitoring system run by the state-run Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency showed the highest-level alert requiring evacuation from the sea.Rip currents are channels of water that form near beaches and run a certain distance out to sea. They are fast-moving and powerful enough to carry swimmers away. A huge wave hits the Haeundae Beach in the coastal city of Busan on Aug. 1, 2017. The lifesaving team for the beach, famous in the country, took a measure to keep swimmers off the sea for the second straight day due to the high possibility of a rip tide hitting them. On Sunday, as many as 70 swimmers were caught in this summer's first rip tide that hit the beach, and all of them had to be rescued by the lifesaving team.Tuesday's measure irked some of the swimmers who packed the beach, who then tried to ignore the lifesaving team's instructions and had a quarrel with the lifesavers who were preventing them from entering the sea.Haeundae, which opened on July 1, is home to the most famous beach in South Korea that attracts millions of beachgoers during the summer.An official at the lifesaving team said, ""A rip tide could take place all of a sudden and there is a higher possibility of swimmers being carried away by a rip tide coupled with high waves like today.""The team allowed swimmers to wade into water as deep as their knees to help beat the heat.The Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency forecast that the beach will see a rip tide on Wednesday.","beach rip tide monitoring ,rip tide keeps swimmers ,the sea on tuesday ,the beach rip tide ,sea on tuesday for","['Haeundae Beach', 'Busan']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38894886  0.27337646

The court also sentenced five other former ranking government officials to between 18 months and two years in jail, with some on probation, for their involvement in the blacklist.Earlier, the team led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo called for Kim to get seven years in prison and six years for Cho, insisting, ""The evil influence they have on the nation and people was so immense.""

The survey will be conducted by next month through home and mobile phones, officials said. Members of the government panel tasked with overseeing public deliberations on the fate of two nuclear reactors prepare to hold a session at the central government complex in Seoul on July 27, 2017. Among the 20,000 citizens, the panel will select 350 people who will join the full-fledged deliberation process, officials said.""It is not that the  people will determine whether to resume construction or not, but the panel will play a role of providing information that will help the government make its final decision,"" a panel official said on the condition of anonymity.The government has vowed to accept whatever decision the selected citizens would make and ensure that the panel will carry out its mission in a ""fair, politically neutral, objective and transparent"" way.The outcome of the panel's activities is expected to serve as a crucial gauge of public sentiment about President Moon Jae-in's energy policy.The panel began its three-month operation on Monday amid concerns that the cancellation of the construction project, which is nearly 30 percent complete, would incur some 2.6 trillion won  in losses, and trigger many layoffs and damage suits. The suspension of the construction last month was in line with Moon's pursuit of an energy policy shift away from nuclear power, which experts warn could lead to a hefty rise in electricity prices and a potential energy shortage.","nuclear reactors decided thursday ,350 citizens determine fate ,reactors decided thursday ,reactors decided thursday to ,two nuclear reactors decided",['Ulsan'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61332786  0.79779911

The company, however, did not seek approval for the visit last year due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula sparked by the North's nuclear and missile tests. This photo taken on July 4, 2017, shows the lobby of the headquarters of Hyundai Asan Corp. in Seoul. The North's Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee is known to have turned down the latest request via fax, according to insiders. This marks the first time ever that the North has rejected Hyundai Asan's bid to hold the observance. South Korea's unification ministry earlier gave the green light to the company's plan to contact the North to arrange the memorial service. If the company was invited to hold the event, it would have marked the first visit by South Koreans to the North under the Moon Jae-in administration. In July 2008, Seoul suspended the Kumgang tour project after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort. The program was launched in 1998 under a previous liberal government.The new government announced its stance on the flexible resumption of civilian inter-Korean exchanges to an extent that would not compromise the international sanctions imposed Pyongyang.North Korea, however, has turned down South Korean aid groups' move to spur exchanges, in protest of Seoul's support of the latest U.N. sanctions.The Seoul government has separately proposed holding talks on easing border tensions and arranging family reunions, but Pyongyang has also kept mum on such overtures.","thursday rejected hyundai ,now suspended tour program ,thursday rejected hyundai asan ,on thursday rejected hyundai ,pyongyang rejects hyundai asan","['North Korea', ""Hyundai Asan Corp.

Comfort women is euphemistic term for the victims of Japan's sexual slavery.  A participant carries a portrait of Kim Kun-ja, a victim of Japan`s wartime sexual enslavement, during her funeral at a hospital south of Seoul on July 25, 2017. Kim, who died two days ago at the age of 91, was one of tens of thousands of young Korean girls, known as ""comfort women,"" who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers at front-line brothels. Approximately 100 guests, including Democratic Party Reps. So Byung-hoon and Lim Jong-seong, Gyeonggi Province Deputy Gov. Kang Duck-gu, former comfort women, Kim's friends and bereaved family, attended the ceremony.""We will recover your honor by engraving your words calling for the Japanese government to publicly apologize and be held legally liable into our hearts,"" House of Sharing's Venerable Wonhaeng said in a eulogy.Rep. So also paid tribute to Kim, calling her a ""victim of a heartbreaking history"" and promised to remember her legacy as someone who led the charge in standing up for the historical truth. Kim's remains were cremated and enshrined at a memorial park in Seoul. Kim was 91 when she passed away Sunday. She was born in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province. Kim was forcefully mobilized by Japan to ""comfort facilities"" in China's northeastern province of Jilin at the age of 17. She tried to commit suicide seven times during her three years there.She drew attention to the wartime crime by Japan by attending a hearing on comfort women hosted by then US Congressman Mike Honda in February 2007 and testifying about her experience.Most of the 37 remaining survivors of the gross human rights abuse are in their 80s or 90s.The comfort women issue has been a long-time thorn between South Korea and Japan, which occupied the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 Asian women, mostly from Korea, were mobilized by the Japanese military to work in front-line brothels.In late 2015, the two neighbors reached a deal to resolve the issue with an apology and compensation from Tokyo. But some of the Korean victims have rejected the agreement, saying the apology is not sincere, nor is it enough to address their grievances.","two phase buddhist funeral ,phase buddhist funeral service ,brothels for japanese troops ,buddhist funeral service ,funeral for the late","['Kim Kun - ja', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'buddhist', 'the CHA Bundang Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the House of Sharing', 'Gyeonggi']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.08297211  0.42095372

As part of the Moon Jae-in administration’s efforts to tackle the nation’s worsening air pollution, the government has shut down eight plants aged 30 years or over for the month of June: four in South Chungcheong Province, two in Gangwon Province and the remaining two in South Gyeongsang Province.According to an analysis by the Ministry of Environment, the level of PM2.5, ultrafine particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, in South Chungcheong went down by 15.4 percent from the previous two years’ average of 26 micrograms per cubic meter to 22 micrograms per cubic meter. The data was collected at 40 measuring points, located within a radius of 70 kilometers from the four suspended power plants in the province, which is home to 26 of the country’s 59 coal-fired power plants. A study, which factored into its projection weather conditions in June for the past three years, showed a decrease of 0.3 micrograms per cubic meter in the dust concentration level, the ministry said. As for the actual amount of PM2.5 emissions, the ministry said the shutdown of the plants resulted in a cut of at least 304 tons, or 15 percent of the total 1,975 tons emitted from coal power plants across the country in June last year, the ministry said.According to the 2009 data from the National Institute of Environmental Research, the mortality rate is projected to go up by 0.8 percent when the PM2.5. level increases by 10 micrograms per cubic meter. During the presidential election campaign, President Moon pledged to lower fine dust concentration levels by 30 percent by reducing the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels and switching to cleaner energy alternatives.By Kim Da-sol","after coal plant closures ,sejong on tuesday yonhap ,environment ministry said tuesday ,falls 15 after coal ,in sejong on tuesday","['South Chungcheong Province', 'Kim Beob - jeong', 'Sejong', 'Yonhap)As']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22916037  0.74863201

Antonov An-148 jet airliner. The North's sole airline introduced an An-148 medium-range airplane in 2013 and 2015 from the Ukraine Antonov Co. The airliner is capable of carrying up to 85 passengers with a range of 2,100?4,400 km. The long suspension of the P-672 operation has something to do with the decrease in the number of Air Koryo's overall flights, the broadcaster said. Until last year, the airline had operated its planes on eight international routes at least without stop, with its An-148 jets, in particular, intensively mobilized to carry summer vacationers from Chinese cities like Qingdao and Taiyuan. This year, however, Air Koryo curtailed the number of flights from five per week to four on the Pyongyang-Beijing route and from twice per week to once every two weeks on the Pyongyang-Shanghai line. Such decline is attributable to a drop in passengers because of the UN sanctions, the broadcaster said.","grounded for eight months ,flight data since november ,airliner stops intl operation ,months north korean jet ,flights has been grounded","['north korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'US', ""Air Koryo 's"", 'P-672', 'Voice of America']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.11982046  0.56798398

There are 427 business establishments across the nation under the designation that can employ foreign workers holding E-6-2 entertainment visas and which can receive benefits like Tourism Promotion Fund eligibility.These business establishments, whose target customers include foreign sailors and US troops in Korea, have been accused of having employees engage in prostitution.The proposed amendment seeks to toughen the designation criteria for these foreigner-only entertainment restaurants. For a business to operate under this category, it will have to receive approval from the mayors or governors of the relevant municipalities, which can be disfranchised if the business violates the designation criteria.

UNAI Korea is building the Ban Ki-moon Global Education Institute to help realize the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and nurture related global experts. The UNAI is short for the UN Academic Impact, an initiative launched by then-UN chief Ban in November 2010 to align institutions of higher education, scholarship and research with the UN. At present, more than 1,000 institutions in over 120 countries and some 40 academic networks are now members.  Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon delivers a congratulatory speech during a ground-breaking ceremony for the Ban Ki-moon Global Education Institute at the Handong Global University in Pohang, 374km southeast of Seoul, on July 11, 2017. ""I hope the GEI will be a place for a well-rounded education that combines personality and expertise,"" Ban said in a congratulatory speech. Ban stressed that countries and interested parties should come together for global civic education, saying, ""The three axes of globalization education are peace, development and human rights, and in particular, peace and development have no meaning without human rights.""The three-storied GEI, to be built on a 3,400-square-meter lot and completed by October next year, will house the Handong GRACE School for rounded education and the Ban Ki-moon Sustainable Development International Research Center.The institute will focus its efforts on carrying out SDG research, supporting developing countries and nurturing related youth leaders. The Institute will also seek exchanges with UNAI ASPIRE, a student branch of the UNAI. The Actions by Students to Promote Innovation and Reform through Education is intended to embody the UNAI's 10 principles within student communities around the world. One of the UNAI principles is a commitment to educational opportunities for all people regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity. ""We'll continue to endeavor to undertake SDG research and cultivate global experts with some 1,200 UNAI member institutions and faculties around the world as well as with 68 local universities,"" Handong President Chang Soon-heung said.

A research team of orthopedists from Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital Seoul and Korea University Ansan Hospital found that women who drink lightly two to three times a week had higher bone density than those who drink heavily or not at all, the team said in the latest issue of the medical journal Plos One.  To analyze the effect of drinking alcohol on osteoporosis, the research team looked into 3,312 postmenopausal women who took part in the 2008-2010 national nutrition survey.The interviewees’ average age was 62.6. Based on the analysis, the team also found that those who drink four times and more a week were 1.68 times more likely to develop weak bones. Women with no drinking habits also had 1.7 times higher risk of lower density bones, the researchers found.Light drinking should be associated with regular exercise and good nutrition, the researchers say. “Besides alcohol habits of the interviewees, women who drink lightly often exercised regularly, consumed healthy nutrients good for bones and engaged in more economic activities, said Chang Hae-dong of Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital Seoul, who led the study.People with osteoporosis, often old women, suffer weak and brittle bones that can fracture with only a small movement, bending or even coughing. In South Korea, women in their 50s are eight times more at risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis than women in their 40s. Regular aerobic exercise like walking and dietary intake of vitamin D help increase the density of bones and prevent the disease later in life, experts say.By Bak Se-hwan","women south korean medical ,medical research showed friday ,drinking helps prevent osteoporosis ,of osteoporosis for women ,osteoporosis for women south","['south korean', 'Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital Seoul', 'Korea University Ansan Hospital']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54091585  0.31742305

In a local radio interview, Rep. Kim Jin-pyo, who chairs the State Affairs Advisory Committee, said his panel is “almost set” on the holiday plan. Rep. Kim Jin-pyo  “Oct. 2 falls between a weekend and Chuseok holidays, and we think it is important to allow workers to fully rest,” Rep. Kim of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea said. The equivalent of Thanksgiving in the West, the three-day Chuseok holiday takes place from Oct. 3 to 5 this year. Since Oct. 3 is National Foundation Day, an official holiday, the following workday, Oct. 6, Friday, has automatically been designated as a substitute holiday. The following Monday, Oct. 9, is also a holiday, Hangeul Day. If Oct. 2, which is a Monday, is added, the vacation period would extend to 10 days, including two weekends. “Koreans are working the longest hours in the world. We plan to expand on the substitute holiday system as well, to protect citizens’ right to rest,” the chief said. The substitute holiday system adds an extra holiday if a national holiday falls on a weekend. Rep. Kim added that the extra holiday would also boost domestic consumption. The designation of the holiday only applies to public institutes, as the government cannot “force” private institutes and businesses to follow suit. But the government’s decision would likely affect the private sector, as has been the case in the past, he explained. During his campaign, President Moon Jae-in stressed the importance of resting, saying good rest is a factor deciding “national competency.” Moon also vowed to revise related laws to give public servants at least 12 days of summer holidays and to review extending paid leave from the current level of 15 to 20 days per year. Personally, he plans to use all of his annual paid leave, the president has said. A government report showed that one extra holiday could bring an economic benefit of 19 trillion won  and 80,000 new jobs.

Sunday and Monday’s downpour brought only about 5 to 20 mm of rain to southern Gyeonggi Province.The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said that at least 70 to 100 mm of rain is needed to bring an end to the drought in parts of Gyeonggi South Chungcheong provinces where the dry spell has been the most intense.The monsoon front is expected to taper off southwards, pouring more rain on southern provinces till later this week. Meanwhile, Typhoon Nanmadol, the third typhoon of the year, is currently moving northwest from Taiwan with a wind speed of 18 meters per second. The meteorologists predict it may reach waters south of Jeju Island on Tuesday and turn northward toward Japan before losing steam Wednesday.As of Monday 5 p.m., the KMA lifted all heavy rain alerts in the country, as the rains will ease a little on Wednesday. But the rain will return in full force toward the weekend, the KMA said.Temperatures are expected to slightly go up, while Monday’s highs in Seoul and Daejeon were 28 degrees Celsius and 32 degrees in Daegu.

Divers will walk on the seabed and use sonar radar to detect the bodies. A worn-out car which has been inside Sewol's wreckage for the past three years is seen at Mokpo port, Jeolla Province. In case the missing five bodies are not found in waters off Jindo, which have the second-strongest tidal current in Korea, the search operators will dig out up to 5,000-tons of mud and stones underwater. It will be carried in bags and brought onshore using dredging vessels for a search, the ministry said. During the first stage, about 120 search operators sifted manually through bags of mud retrieved from the third to fifth decks of the ferry, where cabins are located. Noting that the remains of Danwon High School teacher Go Chang-suk, one of four victims identified during the search, was discovered underwater, bereaved families have continually requested that the authorities strengthen the underwater operation. The search of Sewol’s wreckage, which was brought onshore on April 9, will resume, too. Deck and cabin areas were earlier searched, leading to the discovery of the remains of the five victims. While the entire search operation led by the ministry will come to an end in September, an independent committee will continue to investigate why the ship sank and so many were not rescued, the ministry said. The special investigative body, which will comprise of some 35 government officials and 15 officers with expertise, is expected to be organized by July. The committee will have six months to investigate the cause behind the sinking.By Kim Da-sol","resume the underwater search ,2014 ferry sinking site ,seabed to install 200 ,the 2014 ferry sinking ,underwater search for sewol","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Oceans of Fisheries', 'the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46187466  0.21271321

Around 80 to 150 millimeters of rain poured down in Seoul, while other regions saw about 10 to 100 millimeters of rain. Pedestrians walk in the heavy rain at a street in the southern city of Daejeon on Sunday. Due to continued rain throughout a day, the Seoul Metropolitan Government closed off traffic to Cheonggyecheon Stream.A daytime high nationwide went down by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, hovering around 26 degrees in the capital. Morning low hit 23 degrees in Seoul.The Korea Meteorological Administration said sporadic rain showers are expected to linger until the first week of July. The KMA said up to 150 mm of rain is predicted to pour down nationwide until Wednesday and the monsoon front will bring more rain in the southern cities like Gwangju and Busan later in the week. But the agency said this summer will see a dry monsoon season, with higher temperatures and less showers. It predicted some 289 millimeters of rain in July, not enough to bring relief to drought areas. As heavily developed rain clouds are making their way into a stretch of the western Pacific Ocean and influencing skies of East Asian countries, the KMA said the heavy rain will hit Gyeongsang Province hard, while Gangwon and Gyeongsang provinces could experience loud thunder and lightning along with rain.As of Sunday afternoon, a heavy rain advisory is issued in Gapyeong, Gangwon Province and some cities in Gangwon Province. A heavy rain advisory is issued when at least 70 mm of rain is predicted to pour down for six hours.A preliminary rain alert was issued in metropolitan areas like Seoul and Incheon and Chungcheong Province and some cities in North Gyeongsang Province as these regions are expected to see up to 200 millimeters of rain. Weather forecasters encouraged people to be aware of accidents amid the torrential rain accompanied by thunder, and be prepared for the heavy downpour to cause floods, traffic jams and the disruption to facilities.

According to the ministry, the Eugene Bell Foundation Korea’s shipment is valued at 1.9 billion won , with medication worth 1.5 billion won and construction materials estimated at 350 million won. The wards will be built with materials produced in South Korea and is designed to accommodate 200 patients.Stephen Linton , chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation Korea, speaks to reporters over the foundation`s project to offer medication for tuberculosis to North Korea on June 15, 2017. Under the former administration, South Korea had approved delivery of tuberculosis medication three times, but it has rarely permitted the shipment of construction materials to North Korea, as such investments were banned following sanctions against Pyongyang implemented on May 24, 2010.Kaesong industrial park, an inter-Korean factory complex in a North Korean border city, was the only exception to the rule before its shutdown in 2016.“ tuberculosis is a disease necessary for consistent treatment, and the shipment does not have the risk of being misused and monitoring will continue,” a ministry official said.The construction materials are expected to be delivered to the North Korean port city of Nampo through China in July. Despite the news, South Korean nongovernmental organizations are still stuck in limbo with their humanitarian aid business which has been defunct for nearly a decade. Seoul has been giving the greenlight to South Korean nongovernmental organizations on their requests to “contact” North Koreans, but has been tight-lipped about visitation rights and the exchange of goods. In a recent interview with The Korea Herald, Lee Joo-sung, head of World Vision Korea’s North Korea division, stressed the importance of humanitarian projects conducted under South Korean nongovernmental organizations. “The program is now in operation, though  not so smooth. What’s regrettable is that South Koreans have been unable to visit because the program is modeled here and without them it could not go easily,” Lee said. “South Korea’s humanitarian aid programs have significance in that they help achieve better understanding and reconciliation between the two countries, and serve as a stepping stone to unification. And that’s something international NGOs cannot do.”Earlier this month, Pyongyang rejected a South Korean civic group’s offer for an anti-malarial exchange, taking issue with Seoul’s decision to follow the UN Security Council’s sanctions against the communist regime. Since May, the Unification Ministry has been approving local nongovernmental organizations to contact North Korea, within the extent that they do not undermine international sanctions.By Jung Min-kyung","seoul greenlights tb medication ,greenlights tb medication construction ,seoul greenlights tb ,korea it said tuesday ,greenlights tb medication","['Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'North Korea', 'the Eugene Bell Foundation Korea ’s']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01662926  0.28762758

Joseph Aucoin, the commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet. Aucoin, speaking at a news conference at the 7th Fleet's home base in Yokosuka, Japan, wouldn't say how many bodies were recovered, pending notification of next of kin. Aucoin said that much of the crew of about 300 was asleep when the collision happened at 2:20 a.m. Saturday, and that one machinery room and two berthing areas for 116 crew members were severely damaged. He said the destroyer -- which returned to Yokosuka on Saturday evening with the help of tug boats -- was hit on the side and there was a significant impact.  The victims might have been killed by the impact of the collision or drowned in the flooding, said Navy spokesman Lt. Paul Newell, who led the media on a visit to get a firsthand look at the mangled destroyer. Aucoin described the damage and flooding as extensive, including a big puncture under the ship's waterline, and said the crew had to fight to keep the destroyer afloat. ""The damage was significant. This was not a small collision,"" he said. ""You can't see most of the damage -- the damage is mostly underneath the waterline, and it's a large gash near the keel of the ship,"" he said. ""So the water flow was tremendous, and so there wasn't a lot of time in those spaces that were open to the sea. And as you can see now, the ship is still listing, so they had to fight the ship to keep it above the surface. It was traumatic."" The Fitzgerald's captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was airlifted from the ship's deck after daybreak Saturday to the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka with a head injury. Two other crew members suffered cuts and bruises and were also flown out by helicopter. Aucoin said Benson's cabin was destroyed. ""He is lucky to be alive,"" he said. Aucoin wouldn't speculate on the cause of the collision, and said he would order a thorough investigation. Conditions were clear at the time of the collision, though the area is particularly busy with sea traffic. The damage to the destroyer suggests that the container ship, the ACX Crystal, might have slammed into it at a significant speed. This has raised questions as to whether there was proper communication between the two vessels, particularly given how busy the waters in the area are. The waters where the collision occurred see as many as 400 ships pass through every day, according to Japan's coast guard. They are especially congested in the early hours of the day, with ships carrying cargo for early morning delivery in Tokyo. The waters also have fast currents, making it a tricky area that requires experience and skill to navigate.   The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons and is 222 meters  long, much larger than the 8,315-ton destroyer. The container ship's left bow was dented and scraped, and it did not appear to have sustained any major structural damage when it was docked in the Tokyo bay late Saturday. But on Sunday, a group of accident investigators from the Japanese transport ministry found damage to the container ship that had been hidden under the waterline when it arrived in Tokyo the previous night. Footage from Japanese broadcaster NHK showed a sharp horizontal cut across the bow area, which looked like a shark's mouth. Many scratches were also seen in the frontal area.  The container ship was seen making a U-turn before the collision on some ship trackers, a move that has raised questions about what happened. All of the ACX Crystal's 20-member Filipino crew were safe, according to Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen K.K., which operates the ship. The Japanese coast guard questioned crew members of the ACX Crystal, and is treating the incident as a case of possible professional negligence, said Masayuki Obara, a regional coast guard official. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a sympathy message to President Donald Trump on Sunday. ""We are struck by deep sorrow,"" Abe said in the message. ""I express my heartfelt solidarity to America at this difficult time,"" he said, praising US servicemen in Japan under the allies' bilateral security pact.","after their destroyer collided ,sleeping quarters navy divers ,seven us navy sailors ,missing after their destroyer ,after the destroyer collided","['Japan', 'AP', 'US Navy', 'japanese', 'Navy', 'philippine']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13034727 -0.10065156

The remains of nine people have yet to be fully recovered. "" will resolve the Sewol problem with a completely different attitude from the previous government,"" he said in a meeting with the families of the missing victims. ""The search for the missing Sewol victims is one of the most important tasks for me as maritime minister. I'll do everything in my power to safely speed up the  process to bring them to their families.""He was appointed by President Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, Friday following the National Assembly's confirmation hearing. He visited the site as his first job as the minister in an apparent show of his resolve to prioritize the search operations.The minister vowed to increase the budget for the search operations if necessary and take measures to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again. The families of the victims accused the former Park Geun-hye administration of having been tepid on the search works.Not long after Park was removed from office by the Constitutional Court's ruling to uphold lawmakers' impeachment vote March 10, the ferry was raised from waters. It was moved to the dock in Mokpo in late March.Some remains of four people have since been discovered in the wreckage and the sinking site, with three identified as students and one as a teacher. The search team plans to start searching the hold, as the operations in the cabins are almost finished.","maritime minister on saturday ,korea new maritime minister ,ferry that sank three ,minister on saturday promised ,nine missing victims believed","[""South Korea 's"", 'Oceans', 'Fisheries', 'Kim Young - choon', 'Mokpo', 'Oceans', 'Fisheries', 'Kim Young - choon']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29836562  0.37417191

In this photo provided by the South Gyeongsang provincial government, a quarantine official restricts access to a farm suspected of having chickens infected with avian influenza in Goseong, 466 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on June 11, 2017. The measure is an extension of a ban the government placed last week on the trade of birds at traditional markets and restaurants that raise their own chickens and ducks.The ministry said it will also ban the transportation of live birds nationwide, rather than only in areas affected by the disease.Under the new measures, vendors who wish to transport or trade live birds will be required to pass clinical tests by quarantine authorities.The latest outbreak is thought to have begun at a farm in Gunsan, 274 kilometers south of Seoul, and spread nationwide mainly through small farms.At a government meeting earlier in the day, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon instructed officials to take all preventive measures as the  epidemic could spread over the long term.""The fact that new cases of AI are appearing through the trade of birds by intermediary vendors and not just through birds that were bought directly in Gunsan means that the current quarantine system is incomplete,"" he said.","midnight sunday to prevent ,spread of bird flu ,bird trades at midnight ,weeks starting midnight sunday ,pathogenic avian influenza","['the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'South Gyeongsang']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13667202  0.33463299

190,190,190,Trial into ousted Park to gain speed,"The trial involving former President Park Geun-hye, who is on trial over a series of corruption allegations, will accelerate starting this week, with the court adding one more hearing per week.The Seoul Central District Court is scheduled to hold four hearings every week to look into the alleged bribery allegations involving Samsung Group on Mondays and Tuesdays, and SK and Lotte Group on Thursdays and Fridays. Park,...","The trial involving former President Park Geun-hye, who is on trial over a series of corruption allegations, will accelerate starting this week, with the court adding one more hearing per week.The Seoul Central District Court is scheduled to hold four hearings every week to look into the alleged bribery allegations involving Samsung Group on Mondays and Tuesdays, and SK and Lotte Group on Thursdays and Fridays. Park, who remains in detention, is on trial over a total of 18 charges including bribery and abuse of power in connection with the scandal that removed her from office.Former President Park Geun-hye, who is now in jail over corruption charges, is taken to the Seoul Central District Court on May 30, 2017. The prosecution suspects that Park solicited or was promised to receive bribes totaling 59.2 billion won  from Samsung, Lotte and SK in the guise of donations for entities controlled by her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in return for policy favors. This week, the court will bring in a professor involved in the national pension agency’s decision to vote in favor of a merger of Samsung Group’s two affiliates and other officials involved in the dubious donations. Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong is on a separate trial for allegedly offering bribes to Park and Choi to secure the merger in 2015, a key for Lee to consolidate his control over the nation’s largest conglomerate. Former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo received 2 1/2 years in prison last week for influencing the National Pension Service to vote for the merger. But the verdict did not include the bench’s judgement on whether Moon had done so under Park’s order.SK is suspected of seeking to have its chief pardoned, while Lotte Group allegedly looked to win a business license for its duty-free shop in exchange for the donations.Park’s lawyers asked the court to reduce the number of hearings per week, citing Park’s frail health and lack of time to prepare her defense. They even said, “Before Park is a former president, she is an old and weak woman.”The court, however, rejected the request, citing the huge amount of investigation records and the need to call in hundreds of witnesses. The trial of Woo Byung-woo, a former presidential secretary for civil affairs, will also begin Friday. He is suspected of condoning or abetting the alleged corruption under the Park administration. In the first hearing, a former culture minister, who is also jailed, will testify on whether Woo peddled undue influence to sack the ministry’s government officials who were uncooperative with the Park administration.It is also set to wrap up its proceedings for Lee young-sun, a former administrative staff at the Blue House. He is suspected of assisting Park when she received dubious cosmetic treatments at the presidential residence. The court handed down an 18-month term in prison, suspended for three years, to Park’s “shadowy” doctor Lee Young-jae. He was convicted of providing cosmetic treatments to Park at the Blue House without leaving any official records. It was the first ruling on key figures implicated in the corruption scandal. The court is reserving other rulings related to the corruption scandal until it finishes hearing Park’s case. The prosecution, meanwhile, is considering summoning Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra for questioning and applying for an arrest warrant for her again this week. The court rejected an earlier request, citing the lack of evidence. Chung, 21, faces allegations that she was unfairly accepted into an elite school and received good grades despite her lack of qualifications on the back of her mother’s ties to Park. Her mother and the school’s officials stood trial for their involvement in the alleged academic fraud, with the court’s ruling scheduled for June 23. Chung is also considered the biggest beneficiary in the alleged bribery scheme involving Park and Choi.By Ock Hyun-ju","corruption allegations will accelerate ,four hearings every week ,thursdays and fridays park ,hold four hearings every ,lotte group on thursdays","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung Group', 'Lotte Group']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34861708  0.5981462

Health authorities in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province quarantine a chicken farm on June 3, 2017, after a suspected case of avian influenza was reported. Highly pathogenic avian influenza refers to viruses that cause severe disease in birds and result in high death rates, according to the World Health Organization.The farm reported to the authorities after five Korean Ogol Chickens it purchased from a traditional market in Gunsan in the country's southwestern region last month all died. Three other chickens it originally had also died. Some 3,600 out of 6,900 chickens from the Gunsan farm have been sold throughout the country, according to the ministry. On Sunday, a poultry farm with some 6,000 birds in the southern port city of Busan tested positive for the flu. The farm had purchased 650 Korean Ogol Chickens in Gunsan.Up till Sunday, poultry from Gunsan was sold to eight cities and counties including Busan, Jeju, Paju and Yangsan. A total of 31,913 chickens from 18 related farms have been culled so far, regardless of their test results. The ministry is restricting movement in the area to contain further outbreaks.Meanwhile, South Korean health authorities said that there is very low risk that the avian influenza virus strain in the country will infect humans. South Korea has yet to report any human infection by the flu.","pathogenic avian influenza confirmed ,chicken farm on june ,highly pathogenic avian influenza ,province quarantine chicken farm ,influenza confirmed in jeju","[""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Gunsan', 'North Jeolla Province']",6,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.1524172  0.46525937 0.03211394],a2017001,Social affairs,6,2017,"reported highly pathogenic avian influenza ,virus that hit poultry farm ,quarantine chicken farm on june ,highly pathogenic avian influenza ,highly pathogenic avian influenza refers","[""South Korea 's"", 'Jeju', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs', 'Gunsan', 'North Jeolla Province', 'the World Health Organization', 'Korean', 'Gunsan', 'Busan', 'Korean', 'Busan , Jeju , Paju', 'Yangsan', 'south korean', 'South Korea']",2,[0.         1.         0.         ... 0.1524172  0.46525937 0.03211394]

The students attended a kindergarten affiliated with an international school that largely caters to Koreans.This provided photo shows a bus that was gutted by a fire inside the Taojiakuang Tunnel in Weihai, Shandong Province, China, on May 9, 2017. Twenty people, including 10 South Korean children and the bus driver, were killed after the bus carrying 11 pupils from a South Korean international preschool and their Chinese teacher caught fire inside the tunnel, the South Korean Embassy in Beijing said. Chinese media have reported that the pupils were five South Koreans and six Chinese based on an announcement by the Weihai municipal government. But the South Korean Embassy said it is believed 10 were South Korean, including those with dual citizenship.According to the investigation, the driver, Cong Weizi, was in a feeble-minded state when he set the bus on fire after he rear-ended a preceding vehicle.The Shandong provincial police agency told a press conference at a Weihai hotel the same day that Cong bought a lighter and gas, placed them in the bus and set it alight on the day of the bus fire, one day after he was dissatisfied because the school gave him a dismissal notice.During the press conference, the police agency's vice chief, Wang Jincheong, said the cause of the Weihai school bus incident was the result of the driver's arson, and traces of the lighter and gas bought by the driver were found.""The driver seemed to have spite against the school because he was terminated by the school the previous day,"" Wang added.The Chinese police believe the fire was a premeditated crime, saying CCTV footage on the bus and video clips, taken from black boxes in about 280 vehicles passing through the tunnel at the time of the fire, showed the fire starting from behind the driver's seat.They also secured video footage in which Cong appeared to open a gas container hesitantly when he boarded the bus. His purchase of gas for the diesel-powered bus and a lighter in spite of being a nonsmoker strengthened the police's belief that Cong planned the crime in advance. But the bereaved family members of the killed children said they cannot accept the investigation results.""There are many doubtful aspects regarding the announcement,"" said Kim Mi-seok, the leader of the families' group. ""The Chinese authorities appear to have been trying to hold the driver responsible.""  Kim objected to where the police claim the fire started, saying photos and video clips on the scene showed the right side of the vehicle, not the driver's seat, first catching fire.In Friday's notification, the Chinese ministry and the Shandong provincial government also expressed their willingness to make the utmost efforts to compensate the bereaved families of the victims.A joint team of Chinese police sent forensic investigation organs in Tianjin, Yantai and Qingdao, evidence collected at the scene to conduct the probe. In order to find out what caused the fire to happen, the team also utilized scientific methods by re-enacting various situations involving vehicles, roads, drivers and weather.It took just under one month to discover the cause of the incident as the Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping, showed concern.","bus fire last month ,china calls fatal bus ,killed 10 south korean ,fatal bus fire inside ,calls fatal bus fire","['BEIJING', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'China', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'the south Korean Embassy']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18526062  0.28502882

198,198,198,[Feature] Incheon Airport to set tone for irregular workers’ status shift,"INCHEON – Incheon Airport has been praised for its excellent service, chosen as the world’s No. 1 airport for 12 years in a row.

Beneath the fancy title, however, the airport has long been viewed by local labor experts as a microcosm of the country’s sharply-polarized labor market: Nearly 85 percent of the workforce here are “irregular workers” on an average salary that is less than half that of the “regular workers.” Precisely for that reason, President Moon Jae-in chose it as the place to start his bold and controversial campaign for “zero irregular workers” in the public sector. Visiting it on May 12, just two days after taking office, the liberal leader promised to make 10,000 outsourced workers full-time employees, declaring the labor market polarization as a major obstacle to economic growth. Three weeks after the presidential visit, the initial joy has mostly subsided.Employees of Incheon Airport’s partner companies attend a press conference hosted by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions at the airport, west of Seoul, May 18. Instead, some practical issues, many of them unforeseen, have emerged, as the related authorities, labor groups and experts discuss how to implement the change.Oh Sun-ok is among 6,831 irregular workers hired by 46 outsourced firms contracted to offer services in cleaning, safety checks, traffic control and maintenance, among other things. The 60-year-old cleaning staff who has worked at the airport for 11 years told The Korea Herald that she wants to continue working until she retires. In most public firms, employees with permanent employment status are subject to forced retirement at age 60. “I have been just too exhausted. As the number of passengers using the airport doubled, so did my workload,” said Oh, who works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., six times a week. “But I did not complain because I could not afford to be fired. I have children to support at home. And I cannot get another job at this age” she said. Workers like Oh are an integral part of the airport’s operation, passenger service and even its vigilance against terror. The airport is even outsourcing such functions as bomb disposal and security checks. In order to renew their contracts, service providers -- most of them small companies -- compete on price, resulting in low pay and poor working conditions for their employees. Guaranteeing workers job security and better work conditions should be seen as an investment to enhance the airport’s overall operation and management, claimed Shin Chul, policy director at the airport branch of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. “Workers themselves should have a say in the discussion process, because our employment status is linked to the safety of passengers,” he stressed. “The airport has taken advantage of our experience and know-how, but did not properly reward us for our contribution.” The airport operator’s CEO Chung Il-young has created a task force to map out a plan to give irregular workers permanent jobs and promised to get it done by the end of this year. He is to meet with representatives of labor unions at the airport as well as those not organized. “We are going to draw up a plan in mid-June and push for the plan starting in August or September,” said an official at the Incheon International Airport Corp. But there appears to be a long way ahead for both the airport and labor unions to reach an agreement on what kind of regular workers they can be and how it can be funded. One of the most likely scenarios is to set up an affiliate to hire all the regular workers at the airport. That idea, however, is not without criticism. “Establishing a separate body would only result in creating low-quality regular jobs and justify discrimination against the second-class regular workers at the airport,” said professor Kim Sung-hee at Institute of Labor Studies at Korea University. Whichever approach it takes, the airport will likely be the touchstone of whether the era of “zero” irregular jobs is possible during the Moon presidency. On the back of Moon’s pledge, there are already a flood of demands among irregular workers for a regular status in the public sector. From teaching assistants at universities and nurse’s aides to mailmen and cleaners, they demanded regular status for themselves, too, in public statements or through a strike in recent weeks. Some state-run firms, including Industrial Bank of Korea, NH Nonghyup Bank, Korea Land & Housing Corp., Korea Technology Finance Corp. and Korea Asset Management Corp., have joined the drive by creating a task force to remove irregular jobs. A total of 118,763 people, or 36.2 percent of the workers hired by the nation’s 332 public firms, are non-regular or outsourced workers, according to data from the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. “Companies have created irregular jobs because it was considered more efficient to outsource tasks and hire workers through recruitment agencies,” said professor Kim. “That way, they cut back on labor costs and didn’t have to take responsibility for workers’ rights or working conditions.” Park Hye-young, a labor attorney, said that the jobs do not have to be divided into regular or non-regular ones as long as the principle of the same payment for the same work can be established.“The discussion should go beyond solving the problem of irregular workers,” she said. “It won’t matter anymore if salary and benefits are the same for the same work regardless of their job types.” But there are also concerns that Moon’s push for rooting out irregular jobs in the public sector could increase the financial burden on taxpayers and a reduction of job openings. “A profitable public firm like Incheon Airport can keep afloat for a few years. But if all irregular workers are uniformly turned into regular ones, there is a possibility that they cannot recruit any new regular employees and turn to taxpayers’ money,” said Sung Tae-yoon, an economics professor at Yonsei University. Also, questions arise over whether it is “fair” to grant the same status and entitlement to irregular workers as regular workers. “I think it is unfair to give permanent job status to all the irregular workers without any specific screening process,” said a 27-year-old banker, who studied for a few years to get into a state-run bank. “Also, given my experience, there are people who want to work part-time or only for a short time. Some positions don’t need full-time employees.”By Ock Hyun-ju","airport for 12 years ,workers status shift incheon ,shift incheon incheon airport ,labor market nearly 85 ,the airport has long",['INCHEON'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19853842  0.70425171

This file photo taken on Nov. 26, 2016, shows a massive rally against former President Park Geun-hye under way in downtown Seoul. Lee said the plan will be reported by the NPA to a presidential policy advisory panel Saturday, along with other measures to better protect the human rights of rally participants, as well as police troops.In November 2015, a local farmer was put in a coma after being hit by a police water cannon during an anti-government rally in Seoul. He died almost one year later.The upcoming change in the way police cope with outdoor rallies has come after Moon vowed earlier this week to better protect basic human rights in running state affairs and ordered government agencies to adhere to the country's human rights watchdog's recommendations as much as possible.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said Moon will regularly receive reports from the National Human Rights Commission of Korea and consider evaluating government agencies by the rate that they accept the watchdog's recommendations.Specifically, the president has ordered police and confinement facilities to come up with specific reform measures as the number of human rights violation cases reported there marked the majority of the total.In a related move, the Ministry of Justice said Friday that it will soon come up with measures to improve human rights, medical services and welfare of local prison inmates.The ministry said it will first conduct in-depth research into possible violations of human rights at correctional facilities nationwide before rolling out measures to improve living and medical conditions of inmates.According to petitions filed with the NHRCK, a new inmate asked for a replacement for his prison uniform, which was too small and worn-out, but failed to receive any reply for over 10 days.Many inmates have also complained that basic prison supplies, such as blankets and pillows, are insufficient and the current 10-minute hot water shower per week could run counter to human rights standards, according to officials at the rights watchdog.They also noted that inmates, as a whole, are not given proper medical services.","police will refrain from ,police agency said friday ,longer deploy riot troops ,at street rallies ranking ,no longer deploy riot","['the National Police Agency', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Lee Dae - hyung', 'Busan']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54203975  0.01640539

High ozone concentration occurs when the temperature is high. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, a daytime high in Seoul on Sunday reached 28 degree Celsius, a summer heat normally expected at around mid-July to August. Daytime highs reached 29 degrees Celsius in Daejeon and Gwangju, and 30 degrees Celsius in Gangneung and Daegu. Citizens resting by water to beat the summer heat at Han River Park in Seoul on Sunday. The KMA said daytime highs will hover around 30 degree Celsius across the nation until Tuesday.With the mercury rising, the ozone concentration and ultraviolet index are likely to rise as well, according to a local weather forecast agency K-weather.As of Sunday afternoon, ozone concentration levels were “bad” in metropolitan areas, inculding Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungcheong, and Jeolla Provinces.Hot and dry summer weather normally intensifies ozone problems as sunlight reacts with emissions from cars, trucks and other sources to create ozone, the main ingredient in smog, experts say.Experts warn that breathing ozone can trigger health problems such as chest pain, coughing and throat irritation. Children, older adults and those already suffering respiratory problems are advised to take extra precautions when the ozone concentration level is high.“We are still experiencing a somewhat still bad quality of air after the country’s worst fine dust earlier this year, but I guess it is not the time to take masks off outside yet, with high ozone concentration problem to peak this summer,” said 31-year-old mother living in Suwon.South Korea’s ozone concentration figures were seen worsening over the recent decades. The ozone concentration went up from 66 micrograms per cubic meter in 1990 to 68 micrograms in 2015. The OECD average fell slightly from 61 to 60 micrograms during the same period. Weather forecast encouraged citizens to avoid outdoor activities and to put on sun screen for protection during the daytime when ozone concentration is at its peak. Skies will be relatively clear until Wednesday when sporadic rainfall is expected in parts of the country, reducing the temperature temporarily, the weather forecast said. By Kim Da-sol","in seoul on sunday ,of yellow dust storms ,daytime high in seoul ,yellow dust storms ,warnings as temperature rises","['South Korea', 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46543112  0.6587953

An official packs a 40-kilogram rice sack for the APTERR food aid program. It is part of the South Korean government's plan that was approved by the ASEAN+3 Emergency Rice Reserve to offer 750 tons of rice to the regional food aid program.Launched in 2013 by 10 countries of the ASEAN and the three Northeast Asian countries of South Korea, Japan and China, APTERR is aimed at safeguarding the region's food security in case of emergencies, such as floods and droughts.The ministry said it is the first time that the government-run rice stockpiles will be donated to a third country through an international framework.South Korea is the only country in the world to have become a donor country after being a recipient of UN aid in half a century. This transformation has inspired many developing nations to follow in the country's footsteps to advance their respective economies.The APTERR participation is also part of the Seoul government's schemes to deal with a chronic oversupply of rice in the country stemming from a sharp drop in rice consumption. Some 300,000 tons of rice remained in excess last year, as the 4.2 million-ton supply outnumbers the 3.9 million tons consumed, and the glut will likely stay at 200,000 tons in 2017.","250 tons of rice ,south korean rice will ,to myanmar on friday ,myanmar on friday ,tons of rice will","['south korean', 'southeast asian', 'cambodian', 'Sihanoukville', 'Myanmar', 'the Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56234127  0.94191968

Authorities said operators found bones after they cut off parts of the vessel and cleared obstacles to the fourth floor, where some of the missing bodies are expected to be.But upon the request of the bereaved families, authorities said they would not reveal information about the size of the retrieved fragments or other details.The bones will be transferred to the National Forensic Service for DNA tests. The results will come out in a month, the ministry said.On Friday, a 34-centimeter shin bone believed to be from a victim was found in waters off Jindo. Officials said a diver found it during a search of the seabed where the ferry rested for three years after sinking. As of Wednesday, a total of 1,188 personal belongings, such as school uniforms and bags, and 759 bone fragments had been retrieved.Meanwhile, the bereaved families pinned hopes on the new administration leading a swift search operation, raising expectations on recovering more remains.A mother of a victim still missing from the 2014 sinking of the ferry Sewol reads a letter directed at new President Moon Jae-in in Mokpo Port, South Jeolla Province on Wednesday.

I believe he will keep his promise to support fact finding on the Sewol ferry tragedy,” Kim said during a radio interview with CBS.In 2014, Moon Jae-in, who became president Wednesday, staged a nine-day hunger strike in Gwanghwamun Square, calling for the passage of the special bill for the Sewol ferry disaster.“I believe the new president will speed up the search operation of the missing passengers by improving the search method,” said Park Eun-mi, whose daughter is among nine passengers who are still unaccounted for.Sewol sank on April 16, 2014, off the southwestern coast, while on its way to the southern island of Jeju.

The Korea Forest Service said high winds with a speed of 10 to 15 meters per second have further complicated the situation there, with 60 percent of the blaze having been put out as of Monday morning.Authorities said residents in Seongsan-myeon in Gangneung were evacuated at around 3:20 a.m. Monday. “We need a much bigger workforce to contain the fire and completely remove it from underground spots,” said Ko Gi-yeon, chief of the Korea Forest Service’s eastern region headquarters.The government has sent some 20 helicopters and thousands of people, including firefighters, soldiers, police officers and government officials, to contain the fire. Some 6,300 military personnel were dispatched to the disaster-hit area to help firefighting helicopters and 1,500 officers. Meanwhile, one crew member died after a firefighting helicopter got stuck on a high-tension power line during a mission to put out fires at around 11 a.m.Authorities said the maintenance worker on board the helicopter fell unconscious and later died after being taken to a nearby hospital for treatment in Samcheok.

The retrieved Sewol was brought onshore April 9, three weeks after the wreck was salvaged, and three years after it sunk in waters off Jindo, South Jeolla Province.The ministry said efforts to raise and move the ferry onshore were hampered by adverse weather and failure to load the wreck -- heavier than originally expected -- on transporters. The waters off Jindo are known for strong currents throughout the year.The nation’s worst maritime accident left 295 dead, mostly high school students on a school trip, with nine passengers still unaccounted for.“The report is total nonsense. The ministry knew very well that changing the time frame for the Sewol salvage operation will only deal tremendous economic loss to the government, while a Chinese consortium led by state-run Shanghai Salvage were working in spite of 100 billion won  in budget deficit,” Lee said. Vice Minister of Oceans and Fisheries Kim Young-seok said that “the ministry will hold SBS responsible for its malicious report and punish those who hold legal responsibility for wrong reports.”The ministry could have delayed the Sewol salvage operation so the situation could turn favorable to Moon Jae-in prior to Tuesday’s presidential election, the report said.  Workers search for the remains of nine missing people inside the raised Sewol ferry. Moon’s camp also denied the report.“Maybe, former President Park Geun-hye might have delayed the salvage operation, but it is not us for sure since I have never heard of it. Such a false news report is absolutely illogical,” said Song Young-gil, the campaign manager of Moon’s Democratic Party of Korea. On Wednesday, SBS withdrew the story and released an official apology for causing controversy.

Visitors and shoppers from the two countries during the period had helped boost South Korea's economy.he number of Chinese visitors to South Korea, however, is expected to plunge during the holiday season due to Beijing's retaliation against Seoul over a missile defense system.

In contrast to a downturn in Chinese visitors, the number of Japanese tourists here has been on a steady rise this year. In the first two months of this year, 339,000 Japanese visited South Korea, up 20.8 percent from the previous year.","overcharging tourists during holiday ,season police said thursday ,during holiday season police ,on overcharging tourists during ,thursday they will strengthen","['Japan', 'China', 'Japan']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55490172  0.26127955

A total of nine access holes were made into the hull of the 6,800-ton ferry to allow the workers to gain access to the vessel.  A smartphone was found on the fourth-floor deck near the bow of the ship on Wednesday morning, officials said. It marks the second time that a smartphone has been found on the vessel. The first was retrieved during the process of raising the ship.Separately, preparations are underway to let workers enter the fourth-floor deck near the aft of the ship. Officials said it could take three days for the preparations to be completed so the search can be carried out in that part of the ship.Once access is gained, search teams will comb the area, which is where six of the nine victims may have been when the ferry capsized three years ago. Among the items found so far within the wreck were a few pairs of shoes, two suitcases, two backpacks and two pairs of trousers, making the total tally of recovered lost items so far 126, officials said. The Sewol ferry that sank on April 16, 2014, off the nation's southwest coast claimed 304 people, most of them teenage students on a school trip. It was raised from the bottom of the sea and put into dry dock at a local port in Mokpo, some 410 kilometers south of Seoul, last week. The bodies of nine people, including four students and two teachers, were never found during the monthslong search that took place after the tragedy.","sewol ferry on wednesday ,ferry mokpo salvage workers ,ferry on wednesday ,ferry on wednesday in ,yonhap smartphone was found",['mokpo'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31796721  0.50190097

Like most of the other passengers, six of the nine -- four students and two teachers -- were on a school excursion to the southern resort island of Jeju. Three others, including a father and his 7-year-old son, were on their way to the island where they hoped to start life anew. The following are their stories based on memories and information provided and compiled by their relatives and support groups.  Portraits are shown of teachers at Danwon High School Yang Seung-jin and Go Chang-seok; students at Danwon High School Cho Eun-hwa, Heo Da-yun, Nam Hyun-cheol and Park Young-in; and passengers Lee Young-sook and Kwon Jae-geun and his son Hyeok-kyu. Yang Seung-jin, teacher at Danwon High School  Yang was last seen giving his life vest to a student and calling out to students to evacuate the ship. He then went to reach more students inside. These last actions reflected his personality as a caring teacher, colleague and husband. The 57-year-old social studies teacher was a strong person who could be depended on, recalled his co-workers and wife. Teaching for 30 years, his motto was pretty clear: to be responsible for them. He created a small orchard behind the school building to plant apple trees and Eastern prickly pear trees, where he would care for the trees with his students. He planned to create a scholarship for students lacking financial support with profits made from selling the fruit. His wife and two children, a daughter and a son, still await for their husband and father to return. Go Chang-seok, teacher at Danwon High School Go always dressed in a suit and a tie and had his hair waxed at school. Some would say it was acceptable to wear gym clothes as a physical education teacher, but he refused to do so, regarding it as a serious subject. His students said they were not surprised to find out that he didn’t swim out of the sinking ferry, even though he was a skilled swimmer with a lifesaving certification. A father of two young sons, now aged 11 and 9, he always made time for his family. He was also caring and romantic, sending bouquets of flowers to his wife’s office for her birthday and anniversary every year.Cho Eun-hwa, student at Danwon High School Cho was a straight-A student who received top scores on exams. She wanted to become an accountant. She was also a kind daughter who would never make her mother worry, her mother Lee Geum-hee said. Since Cho was lost in the cold sea in 2014, Lee and her husband have practically moved to Paengmok Port, the nearest point to the wreck site, to wait for her daughter to come back. “I am a grieving mother who is still living that day, begging for the life of my child,” Lee said. Heo Da-yun, student at Danwon High School Heo was a lively and warm-hearted student who wanted to become a kindergarten teacher. As a devout Christian, the 18-year-old would do volunteer work every week to look after children from multicultural families. She was mature enough to take care of her sick mother, who suffered from a rare disease, and never asked for anything that would burden her parents, her father recalled. Heo often met him at the subway station as her father home from work and loved to walk her dog Kkambi and go shopping with her older sister. Nam Hyun-cheol, student at Danwon High School Nam was a talented musician and member of the school’s vocal club. He could play the guitar well and wrote the lyrics for a song co-written with his friend, Lee Da-woon, another victim of the disaster. The song, “My Dear Love,” was later revised and released by ballad singer Shin Yong-jae. The profits from the song have been used to help the victims of the incident. Nam was a fourth-generation only son. His mother still remembers the first time she taught her son to shave. “Those daily life episodes that were once trivial are left as some of the strongest memories for me now,” she said. On Nam’s guitar, his father wrote, “My son. I am grateful and proud that you are my son. We love you forever, Please come back home.”Park Yeong-in, student at Danwon High School  Park was an athletic student and member of the school bowling club. He also had passion for soccer. Unlike some other teenager boys his age, he was very close with his parents and loved to go on family trips, his mother said. “My child would also help with household chores,” she said. Park would spend time with his father, particularly attending baseball games. While his soccer shoes still await him at Paengmok Port in Jindo, only his bag with his school uniforms was recovered. Kwon Jae-geun  and his son, Hyeok-kyu Kwon’s family was on board the Sewol ferry to move to start a new life on Jeju Island. They planned to start an orchard there. However, only his youngest daughter Ji-yeon, who is now 9 years old, lives on.Kwon’s Vietnamese wife Han Yoon-ji, 29, was found dead. Kwon and his son, Hyeok-kyu, are still missing. Witnesses said Hyeok-kyu, 7 years old, had given his life vest to Ji-yeon. Lee Young-sook  When Lee boarded the Sewol ferry, she had just purchased a new house on Jeju Island where she hoped to live with her son after over a decade of living apart. After her husband died, she struggled to make a living and had to leave her son to live with her in-laws. Now, her 35-year-old son awaits his mother’s return.

The day brings back traumatic memories of watching on TV a giant passenger ferry sink slowly in a calm sea and realizing a few hours later that what they had watched was the scene of nearly 300 being drowned to death. It is even more difficult for victims’ grieving families, as they still search for the truth behind what caused the Sewol ferry to sink and why the government failed to save so many. Yellow baloons fly away at the thrid annual memorial event held at Paengmok Port on Jindo, near the site of the Sewol ferry disaster, Sunday. “Min-jung was a sweet girl who wanted to become a pharmacist -- and she studied hard in school for her dream,” Chung Ki-yeop, 51, an uncle of the student victim Kim Min-jung, told The Korea Herald in front of a joint altar in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. “Anyone who wasn’t at the site of the accident cannot understand the helplessness and pain. I could not do anything but watch a loved one drown,” he said. Sewol, a 6,800-ton passenger ferry, was carrying 476 passengers -- mostly high school students on a field trip -- when it sank off a southwestern island on April 16, 2014. Just 172 passengers were rescued. Nine are still missing. April is once again marked with apologies and promises not to forget those who died in the Sewol ferry tragedy and to find the truth behind the man-made disaster to prevent a recurrence. This April, however, should be different, some mourners hoped. “I hope it will be different this year,” said Lee Seon-ok, 46, in front of the joint altar at Gwanghwamun Square, one of several erected to mark the three-year anniversary of the disaster. “The recovery of the ship is only the beginning of finding the truth behind the accident,” said Lee whose daughter is the same age as the student victims. Hopes for a closure finally The anniversary this year comes amid growing hope that the country may be closer to some kind of a closure to the tragedy, with the salvage of the ill-fated ship from the seabed. The raised Sewol ferry loaded onto a dry dock at Mokpo Port, South Jeolla Province, Sunday. Sewol, which lay more than 40 meters below the waves for three years, was raised above water on March 23. Now moved to dry land at Mokpo Port, the hull is being secured and washed for the long-awaited search of its interior for the bodies of the nine still missing. The government is to announce the search plan Tuesday. Many South Koreans hope that the soon-to-launch search and inspection process of the hull will be able to unearth the “whole truth” behind the sinking. In 2014, state prosecutors concluded that a combination of overloaded freight, a displacement of cargo, an illegal redesign of the ferry and a sharp turn by unskilled helmsmen were the causes of the disaster. But the results did not answer questions over why the authorities failed to rescue passengers in the early hours of the rescue operations and who should be held accountable for the deaths of 304 people.Many believe ousted President Park Geun-hye was part of the reason behind the botched rescue efforts and that her administration tried to cover it up. Mishandling of the Sewol disaster was one of the charges brought against the conservative leader when she was impeached by the parliament late last year. However, the Constitutional Court did not see it as an impeachable charge in its decision to finalize her removal from office in March. Mourners pay tribute to victims of the Sewol ferry disaster at the joint altar set up in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. “I hope that the deaths of 304 people will help make society safer,” said Oh Jin-geun, a 44-year-old office worker from Seoul who was among thousands who visited another joint altar for victims set up in Ansan, where memories of the student victims remain intact. Most of the victims were students from Danwon High School in Ansan. “During the next government, the nine missing bodies should quickly be recovered and the causes behind the sinking should be revealed,” Oh said. The altar had flowers, chocolates and other gifts such as books and soccer balls that showed the tarnished youth and dreams that once shone bright. In the afternoon, some 7,000 people, including four of the five presidential hopefuls, gathered for the third annual memorial event held near the altar. Memorial songs were sung, poems were read and videos were played.Presidential hopefuls attend the third annual memorial event for victims of the Sewol ferry disaster in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, Sunday. Just a few blocks away from there, “memory classrooms,” a scale replica of the actual classrooms at Danwon High School, also received visitors. The classrooms were relocated to the Ansan Education Office last May. Visitors browsed through handwritten letters and left messages and gifts on the desks that have been preserved in memory of the 250 students killed in the sinking. Outside the classrooms, an estimated 1,000 people marched some 5 kilometers across the city toward the joint altar, carrying yellow balloons and flowers to commemorate the victims. A visiter browses through handwritten letters at one of the ""memory classrooms,"" a scale replica of the actual classrooms at Danwon high School, set up at the Ansan Education Office, Sunday. “The Sewol ferry incident symbolizes the rotten part of South Korean society,” said Kim Yoo-na, a 32-year-old participant from Daegu. “The problem with it is that the authorities gave permission ‘to fix’ a secondhand ship to be reused to transport people -- it’s disgusting and those rotten parts should be cut out.”On Jindo, near the site of the accident, some 1,000 mourners gathered for a memorial event to commemorate the third anniversary of the disaster and to support families of the nine victims that remain unaccounted for. Paengmok Port, South Jeolla Province Mourners also visited Mokpo, where the raised ferry is sitting and bereaved families are still waiting for the remains of their children to return. Mourners look through a fence covered with yellow ribbons, a symbol of sympathy for the Sewol ferry disaster, at Mokpo Port in South Jeolla Province. Sunday marked the three-year anniversary of the sinking that left over 300 dead or missing. A day earlier, an estimated 100,000 people packed into Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul to join the nation’s biggest memorial event, with hundreds of people waiting in a line 1 kilometer long to pay tribute to the victims at the joint altar. “The reason I see hope out of this disaster is the raised awareness among the young generation. They learned that they should not just stand still as they are told,” said teacher Son Chae-eun, who has been collecting signatures for a petition for a probe into the ferry disaster for the past three years at the square.“I dream of a safer, better society in which students don’t have to lose their dream.” An estimated 100,000 people pack into Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul to join the nation’s biggest memorial event, Sunday. As dusk fell, candles began to be lit, with participants watching musical performances, speeches by the grieving families and a survivor, and video clips showing the three-year-long fight for the “truth.” Shedding tears and also sharing smiles, they in unison vowed to stand in solidarity with the bereaved families until the nine missing bodies are recovered and those responsible for the disaster are punished. Former President Park, who is now in prosecution’s custody, is widely expected to be indicted Monday for corruption, joining a handful of her former aides and confidante who are standing trial. The Sewol ferry’s captain, who was among the first to abandon the ship without giving an evacuation order, was sentenced to life in prison. The court handed down a 12-year jail term to three ranking sailors and a seven-year prison term to the CEO of the shipping operator. A maritime police official in charge of the on-site rescue operation was sentenced to three years in prison.

The country's biggest national holiday, called the Day of the Sun, came amid growing speculation that Pyongyang could conduct its sixth nuclear test or launch missiles around key anniversaries in April.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen amid concerns over the United States' possible pre-emptive strike against North Korea.Washington has sent Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and its navy strike group to water near the region in a show of force.North Korea's military parade has been closely watched by outside experts to get a glimpse of the North's latest additions to its missile program and other new military equipment.North Korea's last parade was held in October 2015 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Worker's Party of Korea. It staged a similar lavish parade in 2012 to mark the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth. The country unveiled an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the KN-08 for the first time at that time.The North's leader said in his New Year's message that the country has entered the final stage of preparing to launch an ICBM capable of hitting the US mainland.The country has vowed to permanently seek the dual pursuit of nuclear weapons and economic growth, commonly known as the ""byongjin policy.""North Korea is known to have invited about 200 foreign journalists to let them cover the country's celebrations of the key national holiday.On Thursday, it opened a new residential zone lined with skyscrapers, called Ryomyong Street, in a bid to show the world that it remains unscathed by international sanctions.""Ryomyong Street is an accomplishment that the North wants to promote on the economic front,"" said an official at Seoul's unification ministry.

Nine are still unaccounted for, and presumed to be inside the wreck.In order to recover the remains and conduct a detailed investigation into the disaster, the South Korean government decided to pull the ferry from the water intact in 2015, with the 85.1 billion won  project going to a Chinese consortium led by state-run Shanghai Salvage.After months of preparation, the operation to raise the Sewol, lying about 40 meters under water, began on March 22. After the ferry was raised, it was loaded onto a semisubmersible transport ship, and arrived in port on March 31. Even after its arrival in Mokpo it took more than 10 days to move the ship to a dry dock, due to its excessive weight.The government said the search for the missing passengers, which is a key part of the national healing process, will be centered in compartments located towards the aft part of the vessel. Starting next week experts will carry out safety checks on the hull.It had considered cutting the ship into two in order to gain easier access into the compartments, but scrapped the plan as bereaved families opposed it.Instead, investigators will go into the Sewol ferry through windows and doors on the starboard side, which is exposed, and remove any dangerous debris and obstacles. All items retrieved from the ship including mud and cargo will be scrutinized to find any bone fragments of the missing people, it authorities said.Since the project to raise the ship began last month, 20 animal bone fragments and some 100 items including a passport, bags and other personal belongings have been recovered from the wreck. The passport was found to be that of Lee Joon-seok, the Sewol's 70-year-old captain who is serving 36 years in prison for criminal negligence and dereliction of duty.The government said it will also decide whether to preserve the ferry as an exhibit after investigations are completed.","ferry sinking is the ,the nine missing people ,the sewol ferry sinking ,sewol ferry sinking is ,anniversary of its sinking","['mokpo', 'Mokpo']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12956536  0.31121325

The ministry said it began a second round of test operations at around 2:15 p.m., while the result has not come out as of Thursday 5 p.m.Sewol, which sank in waters off Jindo in 2014, is currently on board a semisubmersible transport vessel at Mokpo Port, waiting to be moved to a dry dock for a search of its interior. The nation’s worst maritime accident left 295 dead, mostly high school students on a school trip. Nine are still unaccounted for. Although some experts cautioned that the ferry is too heavy to move with modular trailers, the ministry said it will not utilize extra trailers for the time being. Currently, some 480 units of transporters are deployed to make a loading platform for Sewol. Each can carry up to 40 tons. The wreck, originally an 8,000-8,500-ton vessel, is estimated to weigh about 14,500 tons, with seawater and mud inside.Since the Sewol arrived at Mokpo last week, operators have been draining water and mud from the hull in order to reduce the overall weight. In case the operation is delayed again, the ministry is considering to begin a search for missing bodies inside without placing the ferry on land, with the consent of bereaved families and the special investigation committee.As of Thursday, a total of 101 items presumed to belong to the passengers on Sewol have been retrieved from the wreck, the ministry said.By Kim Da-sol","thursday as engineers failed ,transporters thursday delaying further ,ferry onshore faced difficulties ,thursday delaying further search ,onshore faced difficulties thursday","['the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries', 'Mokpo Port']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70018572  0.30364582

She came to Seoul to attend a high-level ICC meeting. For a case to be brought to the ICC, either the country where the crime took place or the country where the alleged perpetrator is from must be a party to the Rome Statute, which the international court is established upon, she noted.Cases that do not fall under such jurisdiction can only be brought to the ICC if the U.N. Security Council refers them to the court.Neither North Korea nor Malaysia are a state party to the Rome treaty.The president said she will discuss with Malaysia its relationship with the ICC and possibilities for the country's ratification of the treaty, emphasizing the need to expand the number of state parties in the Asia-Pacific region. Kim Jong-nam was killed on Feb. 13 at an airport in Kuala Lumpur by two Asian women, who allegedly smeared the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent on his face.Malaysian police said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the killing. North Korea claimed that Malaysia colluded with South Korea to manipulate the probe.","tuesday the murder case ,seoul during her visit ,brother in malaysia cannot ,said tuesday the murder ,tuesday the murder","['the International Criminal Court', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Malaysia', 'Silvia Fernandez de Gurmendi', 'the Supreme Court', 'Seoul']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.31915662  0.2962147

The Marshall Islands-flagged ship departed Rio de Janeiro on March 26 and was sailing near Uruguay when it made the distress call, according to the foreign ministry here. Sixteen Filipinos and eight South Koreans were on the ship.Seoul’s embassy in Brazil had asked for assistance to find the missing crew with the Brazilian Air Force dispatching a C-130 plane to the site. Families of missing crew members of cargo ship Stella Daisy listen to a briefing by officials of the ship‘s operator Polaris Shipping about the search and rescue operation in the company’s office in Busan on Sunday. YonhapThe escape raft carrying the two Filipino crew was found drifting by commercial ships in the area. Two more rafts and two powered lifeboats that can carry up to 30 people each were also discovered, but no one was on board. Stellar Daisy has two lifeboats and five rafts, four of which launch automatically.  Authorities said that all crew members are believed to be wearing life vests.“From what we know so far, we assume that the situation on Stella Daisy may have been so urgent that crew members couldn’t even launch the lifeboats,” a government official said. “The ship may have went under shortly after the distress call,” he added.From news reports","filipinos koreans from missing ,shipping firm began saturday ,for 16 filipinos koreans ,16 filipinos koreans from ,koreans from missing cargo","['South Koreans', 'filipino', 'Seoul', 'the Stellar Daisy', 'south korean', 'south korean']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1112107   0.25647449

But the passenger ship, now a rusted wreck, reached the end of its voyage at Mokpo, South Jeolla Province, on Friday afternoon, 1,801 days after its departure. With families of the victims of the sinking almost three years ago and ordinary citizens watching, the salvaged ferry, loaded on a transport vessel, arrived at Mokpo Port at 1:15 p.m. Friday. The Sewol ferry is brought to a port in Mokpo on Friday after it was lifted from where it sank some three years ago in the country’s southwestern waters. “It arrived safely six days after we lifted the hull,” said Lee Cheol-jo, a ministry official who is in charge of the salvage operation.Sewol’s sinking on April 16, 2014 was the nation’s worst maritime disaster, which left over 300 dead or missing. The victims were mostly high school students on a field trip. As Sewol set sail for the final voyage at around 7 a.m. from the wreck site off Jindo, South Jeolla Province, families of the nine missing passengers followed it on a small boat. “Let’s go home my daughter. Sorry for making you wait for so long,” said Park Eun-mi, a mother of one of the missing Danwon High school student Huh Da-yoon.The wife of Danwon High school teacher Yang Seung-jin said her only hope is to find the body so she can have a funeral for her husband.“My husband has been stuck in dark and cold water for three years. I will certainly find his body when we reach the shore,” said Yoo Baek-hyung who followed Sewol on the boat. Other family members of the missing passengers, who have lived in makeshift houses at Paegnmok Port near the wreck site ever since the disaster, packed their bags to move to Mokpo Port. The ill-fated vessel had been lying at a depth of 44 meters on the seabed for nearly three years before it was lifted out of the water on March 22. A search of its interior for the missing passengers is likely to start only around April 10, the ministry said. “Engineers still need to move the ferry into a dry dock, using a rail-like transporter,” Lee of the ministry said. The work could be complete by April 6, he added. After sterilization and other safety procedures, the search team will check the ship for the nine missing passengers in the hope that their bodies are still inside. In case the bodies are not found there, the team also plans to search the sea bed with sonar radar. An on-site headquarters for the search operation opened at Mokpo Port on Friday. They also plan to provide necessary support to the bereaved families, such as psychotherapy treatments, funeral procedures and more.

Defense officials here said they are reviewing whether to inform North Korea of the plan through the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission, which oversees the armistice between the two Koreas.The two sides are technically in a state of war as their 1950-53 conflict ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.The North has reacted sensitively to the South's military operations close to the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime border on the peninsula.More than 30 soldiers equipped with rigid inflatable boats will be mobilized for the crackdown aimed at protecting the interests of South Korean fishermen and reducing the possibility of accidental skirmishes, a military official said on the condition of anonymity. At times, patrol ships of the South's Coast Guard approach the NLL, trying to drive away unauthorized Chinese fishing vessels.The South's military carried out similar operations there last year in partnership with the Coast Guard and the UN Command during the crab-catching season. It gave a prior notice to the North.","chinese fishing boats illegally ,catching season chinese fishing ,crackdown on chinese fishing ,crab catching season chinese ,season chinese fishing ship","['south korean', 'chinese', 'inter - korean', 'chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'Coast Guard', 'the Coast Guard']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51590419  0.08279241

The KCDC said an increasing number of patients are being infected with the virus, with 139 cases from all age brackets this year. The virus, which usually spreads between late fall and winter, is very contagious, spreading easily from children who are already infected to other children and sometimes adults.

The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries had previously said that it had found human bones, presumably remains of a victim of the 2014 ferry disaster that left more than 300 passengers dead.The salvage team found the seven pieces of bones at 11:25 a.m. on the deck of a semisubmersible ship on which Sewol currently sits, after having been lifted out of the water last week in preparation to move it to Mokpo Port, the ministry had said. “They turned out to be animal bones,” an official of the ministry told reporters. Sewol, a 6,800-ton passenger ferry, was carrying 476 passengers -- mostly high school students on a field trip -- when it ran aground and sank off the southwestern island on April 16, 2014. Just 172 passengers were rescued. Nine bodies are still unaccounted for. Once the ferry is brought to shore, authorities plan to search its interior hoping to recover the nine missing bodies and discover the causes of the sinking of the ferry. The National Assembly on Tuesday passed a bill to establish a special committee to oversee the search and reinvestigate of the maritime disaster.Questions over what caused the sinking and why the authorities failed to rescue so many of the passengers remain unanswered for many South Koreans, despite the government’s official investigation. The government’s botched rescue operation was part of the reason former President Park Geun-hye was impeached by the National Assembly, although the Constitutional Court in its decision to finalize her removal did not see it as an impeachable charge. In 2014, state prosecutors had concluded that a combination of overloaded freight, a displacement of cargo and an erroneous sharp turn by unskilled helmsmen was the cause of the disaster. The following year, the Supreme Court acquitted the helmsmen, dismissing the prosecution’s claim as lacking proof. It sentenced the ship’s captain to life in prison for abandoning the ship, which was listing at that time, without rescuing passengers. On Tuesday, the Assembly also named five members to a committee who will work with three others appointed earlier at the recommendation of an association of victims’ families.They included a lawyer and a former researcher and professor of the Korea Institute of Maritime and Fisheries Technology, according to parliamentary officials.The eight-member committee will work over the next 10 months to oversee the reinvestigation, help determine the exact cause of the accident and bring those responsible to justice, officials said.By Ock Hyun-ju  and Jo He-rim","passengers dead the salvage ,dead the salvage team ,300 passengers dead ,the sunken sewol ferry ,authorities said late tuesday","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20388821  0.84555966

In 2014, state prosecutors had concluded that a combination of overloaded freight, a displacement of cargo and an erroneous sharp turn by unskilled helmsmen was the cause of the disaster. The following year, the Supreme Court acquitted the helmsmen, dismissing the prosecution’s claim as lacking proof. It sentenced the ship’s captain to life in prison for abandoning the ship, which was listing at that time, without rescuing passengers. On Tuesday, the parliament also named five members to the committee, who will work with three others appointed earlier at the recommendation of an association of the victims’ families.They include a lawyer and a former researcher and professor of the Korea Institute of Maritime and Fisheries Technology, according to parliamentary officials.The eight-member committee will work over the next 10 months to oversee the reinvestigation, help determine the exact cause of the accident and bring those responsible to justice, the officials said.By Ock Hyun-ju","korean government said tuesday ,salvage operation nearly three ,salvage operation south korean ,sewol salvage operation south ,300 people trapped","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Oceans']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08849952  0.43685424

The search could begin April 10 after workers complete disinfecting the ship, the ministry said.At the same time, an eight-member fact-finding body will launch a probe to determine the exact cause of the tragedy.Also, the ministry said a search for any bodies left in the water and on the sea floor, where the Sewol sank, will commence in early April. The project to pull the ferry out of the water intact was aimed at recovering the bodies of the people still missing and conducting a detailed investigation into the disaster.The South Korean government decided to push forward with the 85.1 billion-won  project in 2015, with the Chinese consortium led by the state-run Shanghai Salvage winning the bid.","government officials said tuesday ,salvage workers are speeding ,semisubmersible transportation ship week ,last wednesday yonhap ,week after the salvage",[],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26405904  0.55696028

The ministry said that it will take three to five days to complete preparations including the drainage work.It said a search for the bodies of nine missing passengers expected to still be inside the wreck will begin when the ship arrives.Early Saturday, the Sewol was completely separated from the barges, which hoisted the ferry from the deep water during the first stage, after being placed on the deck of the transport vessel.It took four days for the operators to lift the ship lying about 40 meters under water and move it to the semisubmersible transport vessel since it began the lifting in earnest on Wednesday. The project was on a tight schedule as it had to be carried out during the neap tide period which ended Friday midnight.A total of 304 people, most of whom were high school students on a school trip, died when the ferry sank on April 16, 2014, with investigators concluding that the sinking was a man-made disaster.Nine bodies are still unaccounted for.In 2015, in order to protect any remains of people still missing from the tragic sinking and conduct a detailed investigation into the disaster, the South Korean government decided to pull the ferry out of the water intact.The 85.1 billion won  project went to a Chinese consortium led by state-run Shanghai Salvage.After the ferry safely leaves the accident site, known for its fast current, divers will search carefully for any remains left in the water and on the sea floor, according to the officials.Authorities said underwater fences surrounding the area where the Sewol sank have been set up.","sunken sewol ferry fully ,the water on saturday ,800 ton sewol ferry ,sewol ferry fully emerges ,ton sewol ferry fully","['Sewol', 'south korean', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Fisheries']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27920064 -0.15737407

It was carrying 476 people, including 324 students of Danwon High School in Ansan, south of Seoul. The students and their teachers were on a field trip to the resort island.   The ship left port 2.5 hours behind schedule due to fog.   At 8:48 a.m. April 16, the ferry made a sharp turn after sailing through the Maenggol Channel, which is notorious for its strong underwater currents.   At 8:52 a.m., a student on the ship called 119, the emergency hotline, sending a distress signal that the boat was sinking. His first words were ""Save us, please!"" He later said, ""The ship is tilting.""   It took six more minutes for the nearby Coast Guard in Mokpo to register the call. At 9:06 a.m., the Jindo Vessel Traffic Service made contact with the ferry and began to take control of the situation.   Rescue operations kicked off with the involvement of the Coast Guard, the Navy and dozens of fishermen and fishing boats in the vicinity.   The first report on the sinking was broadcast on news channel YTN at 9:19 a.m.   At 9:39, the ferry's chief engineer and six other engineers escaped on the first rescue boat sent by the Coast Guard. Several minutes later, the ferry's captain also abandoned ship and was rescued by the Coast Guard.   By 9:50, 80 people were rescued. Four minutes later, the port side was completely immersed in the water as the ship tilted more than 64 degrees.   At 10:00, then President Park Geun-hye gave her first order through her spokesman to do everything possible to save the people on the ferry. The government set up a task force to directly handle the situation.   At 10:21, some 40 people were rescued from the sinking ferry.They were the last to be rescued before the Sewol capsized at 10:31.   Late in the afternoon, around 5:30 p.m., President Park visited the government task force to be briefed on the rescue operations and issue another order to do everything possible.   The ferry's operator, the government and the Coast Guard gave conflicting reports on the exact number of people on the boat and the number of people who had been rescued.   Search operations resumed past midnight using flares, but the number of casualties climbed. By 9:00 a.m. April 17, eight people were confirmed dead, while 288 others remained unaccounted for.   On April 18, the Sewol was fully immersed under water and sank completely at around 11:50 a.m.   Only 172 people were rescued. Of the others, 295 were confirmed dead and nine others have remained missing since. -- Why the disaster shook the nation The nation's worst maritime disaster laid bare a number of deep-rooted problems in South Korean society and politics. The government took most of the blame for bungling its initial response to the sinking with delayed rescue operations, botched coordination, and conflicting reports on passenger and casualty numbers.   It revealed how Koreans are used to ignoring regulations for the sake of expediency and sometimes profit.   The tragedy also exposed the sordid ties between regulators and businesses in a country where government officials often take jobs related to their former duties after retirement.   Such ties among the ""bureaucratic mafia"" were blamed for lax safety checks on the Sewol, which was found to have been carrying too much cargo and had been remodeled beyond its safety limits.   The nation's safety management system was found to be poorly in place and barely functioning. Few people were prepared to respond effectively to a disaster on the scale of the Sewol.   There was nationwide soul searching over the apparent lack of ethics not only in those in high positions of society but also among the general public. The ferry's captain who abandoned ship was a case in point.   The number of casualties was large, and the fact that the majority of them were young students caused greater mourning. -- How the nation respondedThen Prime Minister Chung Hong-won offered to resign to take responsibility for the poor handling of the disaster. He was retained by Park.   On May 19, Park announced the dissolution of the Coast Guard.   The prosecution arrested the captain Lee Jun-seok and 14 other crew members. Lee was sentenced to life in prison for murder and the Supreme Court confirmed the sentence in November 2015. The other crew members also received prison terms.   Prosecutors also launched an investigation into the ferry's owner Yoo Byung-eun and his family over their alleged corruption and other illegalities, which were believed to have contributed to the disaster.   Amid a nationwide manhunt, Yoo was found dead in a plum field in July.   In November, the National Assembly passed a special bill aimed at uncovering the truth behind the sinking. The government was reorganized with the launch of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security, which was tasked with overseeing disaster management.    Criticism of Park persisted amid rumors she underwent plastic surgery or other cosmetic treatments during the early hours of the sinking. The rumors were caused by her apparent absence from duty during the seven hours from when the sinking was first reported until she appeared at the government task force around 5:30 p.m.   In December 2016, the National Assembly passed an impeachment motion against Park over a corruption scandal involving her and her close friend Choi Soon-sil. The resolution cited her failure to protect lives and faithfully execute duties during the ferry sinking as one of the reasons for her ouster.   In March 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment and removed Park from office. On the Sewol, however, the court said it is not in its jurisdiction to determine whether she faithfully carried out her duties. It also said it is difficult to recognize that the president has a specific responsibility to take part in rescue operations in a disaster threatening people's lives.","the ferry sewol sank ,southwestern coast and killed ,how the ferry sankthe ,825 ton passenger ferry ,lift the sunken ferry","['south korean', 'Incheon']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38973889 -0.00372899

Part of the rusted Sewol ferry resurfaces above the sea off the southwestern island Jindo on March 24, 2017, three years after it capsized and killed over 300 people, with nine still missing. Two salvage barges on Thursday raised the 145-meter-long, 6,825-ton ship that had been lying about 40 meters under water, some three years after it capsized off the southwest coast of the peninsula near the island of Jindo, while en route to the resort island of Jeju on April 16, 2014. Its sinking, the worst maritime disaster in the country's history, left 304 people dead, with nine of them still missing.After the team removes the ramp, the final leg of the salvaging process should gain speed, which involves loading the ship onto a semisubmersible vessel and transporting it to a nearby port in Mokpo. This process needs to be completed by midnight when the neap tide is expected to end. The next neap is not until April 5.  The government said it has so far hoisted the upper part of the hull some 12 meters above sea level, with one more meter to go as they need to raise it 13 meters for a safe loading onto the semisubmersible ship.  Efforts to lift the Sewol started early Wednesday following several hours of careful examination of the weather conditions because the sea must be fairly calm.It will take about eight days to lift the ship and move it to port, and then take an additional four days to move it onto a dry dock, the ministry said.","salvage team removes ramp ,ferry enters critical phase ,shanghai salvage firm cut ,government and shanghai salvage ,ferry enters critical","['the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries', 'Shanghai']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11706942  0.05191918

Among its 476 passengers, 304, mostly high school students, lost their lives. Nine are still unaccounted for. The right side of the Sewol ferry is seen above the water as the wreckage begins to be lifted from the seabed near the nation’s southwestern island of Jindo, Thursday. At around 3:45 a.m., the right side of the ferry’s structure was seen above water between the two salvage barges, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said.As of 6 p.m., Thursday, about 8.5 meters of the central part of the hull had surfaced above the water.“Once the hull of the ship is lifted 13 meters above the surface, which we expect to be around late tonight, we will start tying the hull to the salvage barges, so it can be transported by a semisubmersible vessel to a port in Mokpo,” a ministry official said.Despite the drizzle, salvage operators said they aim to complete lifting the hull and dock it onto the semisubmersible vessel by Friday, as the tides will get more extreme after that, which will create stronger currents that are more difficult to work in.“We were expecting to see about 13 meters of the hull of the ferry above the surface by this morning, but due to delayed preparations, we may see it by late today or at midnight if there are no complications,” the Oceans and Fisheries Minister Kim Young-seok told reporters during a briefing. The ministry said the ship was being raised at an average of 3 meters per hour. But in an emergency briefing at 10 p.m., the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced its decision to halt the lifting procedure temporarily, as one of the Sewol’s boarding ramps was found to be open, hampering the procedure for raising the ship.“Salvage operators found at around 6 p.m. that during the process of sinking, it looks like one of the hinges holding the Sewol’s 11-meter-long boarding ramps broke. “We did not see this coming, so we decided to remove the ramp by cutting it off overnight and then resume the lifting,” said ministry official Lee Cheol-jo.“We still aim to completely raise the ship to 13 meters above the surface by tomorrow and transport it onto a semisubmersible vessel by Friday midnight at the latest,” Lee added.Salvage workers seen on the part of the Sewol ferry that resurfaced after nearly three years. Salvage operators said it would take about a week to properly dock the ship on the semisubmersible vessel for transportation and to drain the water. The transport vessel will then deliver the ferry to a port in Mokpo, some 87 kilometers from the site.It is expected to take around 12-13 days for the entire process, the ministry official said.Once the ship is transported to a port in Mokpo, authorities will try to find the remains of the missing passengers and determine why the ship sank. Prior to the actual lifting of the ship, the ferry was carefully test-lifted 1 meter from the seabed Wednesday, so experts could see if the vessel was ready to be raised.The ship, lying on the floor of the sea on its left side, would normally weigh 8,300 metric tons according to the ministry, but water, stones and sand inside it have increased that to about 20,000 metric tons.The government announced the salvage operation plan in 2015, but bad weather and high tides have several times delayed the resumption of operations to raise the wreckage of the ship.By Kim Da-sol","two salvage barges lifting ,two salvage barges ,with two salvage barges ,sank on april 16 ,salvage operators worked overnight","['Jindo', 'South Jeolla Province']",6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14812428  0.03102137

Cutting the ship into pieces is the only choice to find them,” said Kim Young-suk, head of the ministry of oceans and fisheries which is overseeing the operation. There are nine bodies still unaccounted for since the Sewol ferry capsized in water off Jindo, South Jeolla Province, about three years ago. Despite the massive rescue operation, the government has yet to discover the location of their bodies. During the disaster, 304 people, mostly high school students, died. Kong gil-young, a professor at Korea Maritime and Ocean University, noted that removing the stern from the ship’s body might not be the best strategy for the recovery mission because the process would require massive time and effort. “The removal process involves welding, so it is very difficult and time consuming,” said the oceanology professor in an interview with a local media outlet. “The government should come up with an accurate assessment about which options would be best to find them.” Some of the victims’ families disputed the government’s calculation that cutting the ship into pieces would be finished within a week. Chung Sung-wook, who lost his son in the disaster, said the process would take at least a month. “If we can find the missing people within a week, we should cut the ship,” said Chung. ""But, according to our calculation, it would take at least a month. If this is the case, I don’t think there would be much difference if we didn’t cut the ship into pieces.""By Yeo Jun-suk","to recover missing bodies ,sunken sewol ferry beginning ,in massive salvage operation ,of sinking the government ,recover missing bodies with",[],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67116201  0.13949656

Protesters urge efforts to recover a sunken passenger ship, the Sewol, in a candlelight vigil held in downtown Seoul on March 18, 2017. ""With all the rest of the nation, I sincerely hope the ship will be safely recovered and all missing persons will return to their families,"" said Moon Jae-in, referring to nine missing passengers from the ship.Moon, a former chief of the Democratic Party, is now seeking the party's nomination for the May 9 presidential election. He is currently facing three other contenders in a party primary.""If I am elected, I will launch a second special investigation panel and identify every little piece of truth behind the sinking of the Sewol,"" he said.An Hee-jung, South Chungcheong Province governor and one of four contenders in the Democratic Party primary, was in the vicinity of the accident site to meet with the families of those missing and killed in the tragic accident.""I will do my utmost to thoroughly determine the cause of the accident while also paying attention to the recovery of those who remain missing,"" he was quoted as telling the families.Seongnam City Mayor Lee Jae-myung, also a Democratic Party contender, expressed hope that the physical recovery of the ship will be the start of an emotional recovery for many family members of victims.""I wish the recovery of the Sewol will be the start of identifying the truth behind the tragedy,"" he said at a press conference in Gwangju, some 300 kilometers southwest of Seoul.Officials from the former ruling Liberty Korea Party and the conservative Bareun Party also expressed hope for a safe and successful salvage of the ship.""The government and the political circles must do their utmost to find out the cause of the accident and enhance the country's safety measures to make sure such a tragedy will never occur again,"" In Myung-jin, the interim head of the former ruling party, said.However, the chief of the former ruling party apparently sought to redirect people's attention from the thorny issue which, at least in part, may have contributed to the parliamentary impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, which led to her removal from office on March 10.In addition to a series of corruption allegations, the former president faced strong public anger over her government's botched response to the tragic sinking which left 304 dead.Referring to the sinking of a Korean warship, the Cheonan, by a torpedo attack from a North Korean submarine seven years ago on Sunday, the interim head of the Liberty Korea Party said security cannot and will not be ensured by one single party.""The attempt by some political figures to continue such a consuming debate does not ensure the people's safety or the country's security,"" he said.The Bareun Party, which broke away from the former ruling party, has designated the entire week for the commemoration of the 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, which left 46 young South Korean sailors dead.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, seeking to run for president on the ticket of the conservative party, expressed opposition to politicizing the tragic incidents.""I wish the Barun Party will be a party that can embrace and console all, and never use either the Cheonan or Sewol accident for political gain,"" he said.Yoo served as a floor leader of the former ruling party.

""We started to raise the hull of the Sewol at 8:50 p.m. and expect 13 meters of the 22-meter-wide ferry hull to be above the surface at around 11 a.m. Thursday,"" said Song Sang-geun, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.  The site of the Sewol ferry sinking off the country's southwestern coast near Jindo, some 472 kilometers south of Seoul If the lift is successful the salvage barges will move the hull onto a semisubmersible ship, which will carry it to the port of Mokpo, he explained.""It will take about eight days to lift the ship and move it to the port. And it will require four additional days to move it onto a dry dock,"" the spokesman said. Before committing to raising the ship, the ferry was carefully test lifted one meter from the sea bottom at 3:30 p.m. so experts could see if the vessel was ready to be raised, the ministry said. The hull had been left at a depth of some 40 meters for nearly three years since it sank off the country's southwestern coast near Jindo Island in April 2014. The sinking, the country's worst maritime disaster, left more than 300 people dead, mostly high school students on a school excursion. Nine of them still remain missing. The ministry said salvage workers carried out balancing procedures first before committing themselves to pulling the hull out of the water. It said all technical aspects and local weather conditions were reviewed. Divers also checked the underwater situation to make certain that the operation will go smoothly. The complete lifting and transportation of the vessel to port is expected to be an arduous process and require good weather conditions, officials said. The hull itself should break the water's surface in the early hours of Thursday if there are no complications. Efforts to lift the 145-meter-long, 6,825-ton ship began at 10:00 a.m. with two salvage barges and the semisubmersible ship. It took several hours to decide whether to start lifting the ship because the sea must be fairly calm, meaning waves must be under 1 meter and wind speed needs to be below 10 meters per second. Earlier, the Seoul government decided to pull the ferry out of the water intact in order to protect any remains of the people still missing from the tragic sinking. The 85.1 billion won  project to recover the ship is being conducted by a Chinese consortium led by China's state-run Shanghai Salvage. Divers have worked on making the ship buoyant by injecting air into tanks in the vessel and installing large balloons and other flotation devices. Once the ship reaches Mokpo, authorities will try to find the remains of people still listed as missing and determine why the ship sank.","ferry sewol late wednesday ,ferry sewol south korea ,to raising sunken ferry ,22 meter wide ferry ,11 thursday said song","['South Korea', 'Song Sang - geun', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Fisheri']",6,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.2951408   0.56958109

And the day when the ill-fated passenger ship is brought on land would, for the victims’ families and many ordinary citizens, mark the start of a long-awaited end to bitter disputes and acrimonies over why this country that prides itself in technological prowess failed to rescue over 300 passengers from a slowly sinking ship in broad daylight. On Friday, when The Korea Herald visited the waters off Jindo, where Sewol capsized on April 16, 2014, final preparations to raise the wreckage of the sunken ship were in full swing. A semi-submersible vessel arrives in waters off Jindo on Thursday. It will carry the sunken Sewol to a port in Mokpo, about 87 kilometers away from where the ship capsized and sank in April 2014. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries had planned to begin lifting it Sunday, but had to change the schedule due to weather conditions. The lifting is mostly likely to take place on April 5 when the next neap tide is expected, a ministry official said. None had expected salvaging the ship would take this long. To lift the 6,825-ton ferry, which lies 40 meters underneath the surface of the water, the government had decided to install beams underneath the wreckage, which will be used for the lifting. “I’ve never seen that kind of soil. It wasn’t bedrock, not earth nor sand, but it was more like a mixture of concrete and rocks,” recalled Lee Cheol-jo, an official from the ministry who has been supervising the entire salvage operation since 2015.“Each diver had to go underwater and check the soil condition, brief us on what it is, put the drilling machine and this process took too long,” Lee said.The government announced the salvage operation plan in 2015 and selected Chinese consortium Shanghai Salvage to spearhead the 85 million won  project.Since then, at least 200 workforces have lived on a floating barge. The Sewol ferry was carrying 476 people, mostly students on a school trip. Just 172 passengers were rescued and nine bodies are still unaccounted for.A group of 60 divers, technicians and engineers had to stay awake 24-7, taking turns in three shifts, because they never know when there would be a calmer sea for them to go underwater, they said.The salvage project began in June last year with the target of bringing the ferry to the surface by the end of July.But with work postponed several times due to adverse weather and technical problems, the timeline for raising Sewol was repeatedly pushed back to August, September and then October.Lee Cheol-jo, an official from the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries who has been supervising the entire salvage operation since 2015, briefs on the salvage operation Friday. To finish the preparation operation in time, divers were put on standby in body-warming suits connected to a hot water tank even in December, ready to go underwater, ministry officials explained. The waters off Jindo are known to have strong currents throughout the year.Shanghai Salvage, a Chinese company, was the only company that suggested lifting the sunken Sewol using a lifting rack in a method called “tandem lifting.” Other companies mostly suggested hooking the ship and lifting it with a crane.Lifting a ship of this size with such a method has never before been tried, ministry officials said. “It is crucial to practice and conduct a final check on the center of gravity and calculate how much power each lifting wire needs to withstand,” said Lee.During the entire process, keeping balance is the key to lifting the heavy ship.The Sewol ferry, lying at the bottom of the sea on its left side, would now weigh about 16,250 tons, due to water, stones and sand inside the ship.Without knowing the exact location of the nine missing bodies and the heavy freight inside the sunken ferry, they need to precisely analyze the load and forces to lift the ship beforehand, authorities said.Two jack-up barges, which will lift the hull of Sewol, will bring the ship and dock it onto a semi-submersible vessel. The vessel will then carry the ship to a port in Mokpo, about 87 kilometers away. If work goes smoothly, the whole process will take 10-15 days, ministry officials said. “We need to lift it at least 35 meters off from the ground during the actual lifting slated for April 5. Then we will be able to see about 13 meters of the hull of the ferry above the surface, to be dried and ready to dock to another vessel to be carried to land for inspection,” said Lee.In case the missing nine bodies are not found inside the ship, the rest of the workers will continue to search underwater. A total of 40 40-by-20-meter nets have been installed around the area where the ship is lying. Divers will walk underwater on the seabed and use sonar radar to detect the bodies. Authorities said that it made the nets as tight as possible so even small bones would not go missing, considering the victims’ families.“It will be a slow and steady process. But we cannot rush,” said Chang Ki-wuk, head of the salvage operation methods team.“ will be the start of a successful search for not only the missing nine bodies, but to find out the clear cause of the Sewol ferry sinking, which will takes months from now,” Chang added.By Kim Da-sol","lift sunken sewol ferry ,three years lying ,sunken sewol ferry ,underway to lift sunken ,nearly three years lying",['South Jeolla Province'],6,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22824016  0.02461091

Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and half brother of the incumbent leader, was assassinated with what a Malaysian investigation said was poison by North Korean agents at Kuala Lumpur International Airport last Monday.The Malaysian police called on Kim's family to come to the country and undergo a DNA test to retrieve the body which is now kept in a hospital in Kuala Lumpur, but no one has come forward so far, possibly due to assassination fears.A source said the Malaysian police took note of the Kim family's sensitive status and the difficult situation they are currently in when it made the decision to dispatch the officers to Macao. Han-sol and Kim's other family members are reportedly in Macao and Beijing under the protection of the Chinese government.After collecting DNA samples, the Malaysian police will immediately try to match them with that of Kim Jong-nam in order to verify his identity and eventually hand over the body to his family.North Korea's state-run press, Korean Central News Agency, denied in a report earlier in the day the body belongs to Kim Jong-nam and accused Seoul of cooking up the murder case against the regime.Malaysia's police chief later said, however, that the country has not sent a DNA sampling team anywhere, denying the dispatch plan, according to other Malaysian news reports. China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told Yonhap News Agency that he is not aware of the reported travel plan.","thursday to collect dna ,officers to macao thursday ,lumpur last week media ,police to collect dna ,morning to gather dna","['Malaysia', 'Macao', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Malaysia', 'China Press', 'Sin Chew Daily', 'malaysian', 'Macao']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.49359384  0.7799328

The second woman, 25-year-old Siti Aishah from Serang in Banten province, was alone and carrying an Indonesian passport when caught by the authorities. Khalid Abu Bakar, Malaysia’s inspector general of police, said in a statement that they had “positively identified” her from CCTV footage at the airport. The man is believed to be Aishah’s boyfriend, local media reported.  A second female suspect in the poisoning of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, is transferred from Kuala Lumpur Police Station in Malaysia on Thursday. Aishah appeared at the court early Thursday along with the first woman, 28-year-old Doan Thi Huong, who was arrested Wednesday after the release of CCTV images showing a woman matching her description. The pair was given seven days in detention in line with the request of a regional district headquarters. The remand decision was “unusual” and reflected “security concerns,” Malaysia’s Sun daily reported, citing Selangor state police Chief Datuk Abdul Samah Mat.Authorities have said there were at least four men involved in the attack, but it remains unknown whether the nabbed man is one of them. Selangor state police Chief Abdul Samah Mat told AFP that they are “looking for more suspects,” but declined to say how many were being sought after or their nationalities. Other news reports suggested the first woman testified that she took part in the plot without knowing it was Kim Jong-nam. She also said she thought it was a “prank” as allegedly told to her by four men who approached her and her female friend at the airport on their way to board a flight back home. The men allegedly included those with North Korean and Vietnamese backgrounds. But the reports could not be confirmed immediately. Kim Jong-nam, 46, is believed to have been killed with poison by two female secret operatives while trying to check in for a flight to Macau at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday morning. He was pronounced dead on his way to a hospital. A seven-hour autopsy was carried out late Wednesday and the results are expected to be released later this week following a detailed analysis. Officials confirmed a toxic spray was used in the killing but the type of substance used remains unclear. North Korean operatives are widely known to favor tiny guns or pens loaded with neostigmine bromide, which is estimated to be about five times stronger than potassium cyanide, but it is possible the spray contained something else. Japan’s NHK broadcaster reported later in the day that a nerve gas such as VX appears to have been employed, citing multiple Seoul government officials. The tasteless and odorless liquid, a chemical warfare tool, is known to be much more lethal than sarin. “The National Intelligence Service is closely looking into if it was a toxic chemical that has never been used before,” said Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Liberty Korea Party who chairs the parliamentary intelligence committee, in an interview with BBS Radio. The panel was briefed on the murder by the spy agency Wednesday. The lawmaker also raised the possibility that the first arrested woman may have been trained by North Koreans to claim a false Vietnamese identity or use a fake travel document. North Korean agents previously caught in South Korea, as well as Kim Jong-nam himself, were found to have traveled on forged passports. “It’s difficult to judge because there are some clumsy elements there. Or she could be someone who got suddenly involved for some reason but we’d better wait and see,” Lee added. Jakarta’s Foreign Ministry also said it will look into Aishah’s nationality, saying millions of Indonesians work in nearby Malaysia and the passports seized by the Malaysian police could have been lost or stolen. “We have been trying to verify those reports with our embassy in Malaysia as soon as we heard about that, because this is not the first time that an Indonesian reportedly committed a crime just based on the bearer of an Indonesian passport, but then the bearer was not an Indonesian citizen,” Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, director for citizen protection at the ministry, was quoted as saying by AP. Meanwhile, controversy erupted after Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Thursday the country will return the body in line with Pyongyang’s request. The Kim Jong-un regime has reportedly sent senior officials to Kuala Lumpur, with North Korean officials including embassy staff being spotted visiting the hospital’s forensics unit in diplomatic vehicles Wednesday. They demanded the body be released without a postmortem examination and then attended the autopsy after the request was turned down. “We will facilitate the request by any foreign government although there are procedures to be followed,” Zahid was quoted by AFP as telling reporters after a meeting with business leaders. At a separate news conference, the deputy premier confirmed the man was Kim Jong-nam and he carried “two different identities” but the passport bearing the name Kim Chol was authentic. He also said the case would not affect relations with Pyongyang, saying Kuala Lumpur wants to “maintain and we would like to strengthen our relationship with any foreign country that has established their embassy here.”By Shin Hyon-hee","arresting woman with vietnamese ,murder of north korean ,day after arresting woman ,detained an indonesian woman ,malaysian authorities said thursday","['malaysian', 'indonesian', 'malaysian', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'vietnamese', 'Siti Aishah', 'Serang', 'Banten province', 'indonesian', 'Khalid Abu Bakar', 'Malaysia']",6,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.23133601  0.55502057
