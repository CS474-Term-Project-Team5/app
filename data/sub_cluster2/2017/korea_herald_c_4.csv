Cho is also suspected of pressuring the Federation of Korean Industries, the nation’s largest business lobby, to financially support pro-government civic groups. Cho is being tried at the appeals court for her alleged role in blacklisting and discriminating against liberal artists critical of the Park administration. She was arrested in January, but was released from custody in July after the lowest court sentenced her to one year in prison, suspended for two years. The prosecution said in a statement that it is “difficult to accept the reasons behind the rejection.”“Her charges in connection with the grave crime were sufficiently clarified by  such as documents from the presidential office indicating  involvement in supporting conservative groups and her subordinate’s testimony,” it said. The prosecution also said it is “unfair” that Cho avoided arrest while her subordinate Heo Hyeon-jun, a presidential office staff member under the Park administration, was arrested on the same charges. Amid an escalating probe into the nation’s spy agency in recent weeks, the court has set free some of the key suspects accused of meddling in politics and offering bribes to ex-President Park. The prosecution, in a rare move, has protested the decisions. Among those freed are former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin and his deputy Lim Kwan-bin, who are suspected of leading an online smear campaign on behalf of former President Lee Myung-bak. They were arrested, but released from custody earlier this month after they asked for a review of the legality of their arrests.","court denies arrest warrant ,thursday rejected the prosecution ,prosecution cries foul seoul ,to ousted president park ,her destroying evidence given","['Seoul', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",4,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.54730314  0.39406171

1,1,1,Closure of Kaesong complex unilaterally ordered by ex-leader Park: panel,"Ousted former President Park Geun-hye unilaterally ordered the shutdown of an inter-Korean industrial complex last year without proper consultations and legitimate process, a panel report showed Thursday.The report was unveiled by a nine-member committee of civilian experts that has been reviewing the previous conservative governments' North Korea policies, including Seoul's closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex ...","Ousted former President Park Geun-hye unilaterally ordered the shutdown of an inter-Korean industrial complex last year without proper consultations and legitimate process, a panel report showed Thursday.The report was unveiled by a nine-member committee of civilian experts that has been reviewing the previous conservative governments' North Korea policies, including Seoul's closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex in February 2016. The panel was launched by Seoul's unification ministry in September.The Park administration shut down the factory zone, just north of the inter-Korean border, in response to North Korea's fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in 2016. The move put an end to the last symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.""It is verified that the closure was decided by the president's unilateral verbal order without discussions and consultations at the official decision-making level,"" the report showed.The former government said that the shutdown was decided at a National Security Council meeting on Feb. 10, 2016, right before the announcement. But the report showed that Park made the order two days earlier.It also said that the closure is a decision that transcends law, adding that even a political decision amid a security crisis should be made within the boundary of law and under legal procedures.At that time, the ministry said that the decision was aimed at preventing money generated by the factory park from bankrolling North Korea's nuclear and missile development. This file photo shows the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the now-shuttered inter-Korean industrial park, just north of the border. But the panel said that there is no sufficient information or evidence to support the claim that funds from the complex had been used for other purposes.""This hampers the legitimacy of the government's decision and limits Seoul's future stance over the resumption of the Kaesong complex,"" the report showed.The report failed to clear up speculation that Choi Soon-sil, the now-jailed long-time friend of Park, might have been behind the closure. The former government dismissed the allegations.Choi was at the center of the corruption scandal that led to Park's impeachment in December 2016 and ouster earlier this year.The report is likely to rekindle a row over under what conditions the operation of the Kaesong complex can be resumed.The liberal Moon Jae-in government is seeking better inter-Korean ties and engagement with Pyongyang though it now focuses on employing sanctions and pressure on the North over its nuclear programs.Seoul said the resumption of the industrial park would hinge on progress in the resolution of North Korea's nuclear and missile problems.""With implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions on the North, we need to re-open the Kaesong park and to actively prepare for it if certain conditions are met due to changes in the global political landscape,"" the report added.The committee, meanwhile, added that intelligence on North Korea should not be politically used, saying that the government broke the practice of not revealing details about defections by North Koreans.Last year, the ministry announced that 12 North Korean female workers at a Chinese restaurant en masse and Thae Yong-ho, a former diplomat stationed in the North's embassy in Britain, defected to the South.""The ministry passively made the announcement at the request of Seoul's spy agency. It is identified that the ministry was not even aware of details about intelligence well,"" Im Seong-taek, a lawyer and panel member, told a briefing.The panel also stressed that the issue of humanitarian assistance should be separately handled from political considerations and civilian inter-Korean exchanges need to be encouraged.A joint tour program at Mount Kumgang in North Korea has been suspended since 2008, when a South Korean tourist was killed by a North Korean soldier there. Seoul also imposed sanctions banning inter-Korean exchanges in May 2010 to punish North Korea's sinking of a South Korean warship.The panel's review came as the Moon government is seeking to set a North Korea policy that can survive through succeeding administrations regardless of their ideology. It said that South Korea's inter-Korean policy should be made based on public consensus and law and in a consistent manner.The ministry said it will take into account the panel's policy recommendations in setting its policy on North Korea and unification.","ousted former president park ,panel ousted former president ,leader park panel ousted ,policies including seoul closure ,unilaterally ordered the shutdown","['Park Geun', 'inter - korean', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Kaesong Industrial Complex']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35941508  0.43321857

The court decision against Woo's request is also seen as an acknowledgement that he presents a risk of destroying evidence and his detention is necessary for the ongoing investigation. The photo filed Dec. 27, 2017, shows Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary to then-President Park Geun-hye for civil affairs, walking towards the courthouse in southern Seoul to attend a hearing for review on his arrest. Woo, 50, was arrested on Dec. 15 for ordering the National Intelligence Service to secretly keep tabs on government officials including a then presidential inspector who was pursuing a case against him over alleged corruption. On Monday, Woo filed for a court review on the legality of the issuance of his writ. The court held a hearing on his request on Thursday. The prosecution had filed for his arrest warrant twice in February and April, which were both denied by the court at the time. Woo, 50, also stands accused of involvement in the creation and management of a blacklist of artists and cultural figures deemed critical of the Park government. He served his post in the presidential office from 2015-2016. The former senior prosecutor is regarded as a key figure in the influence-peddling case that led to Park's ouster from office in March. He has already been standing trial without detention on charges that he overlooked and tried to cover up the scandal and that he abused his power to block an investigation into the Park government's mishandling of the 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 passengers.","rescind his arrest seoul ,his arrest seoul court ,court on wednesday dismissed ,wednesday dismissed the request ,denies ex park aide","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Woo Byung - woo']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47502384  0.10869171

The Seoul Central District Court said her charges are disputable and it's difficult to see that she presents a risk of flight or destroying evidence in light of the progress in the investigation. Prosecutors filed for the arrest warrant on Friday on charges that she took at least 50 million won  in bribes from the National Intelligence Service between 2014 and 2015 when she served as senior presidential secretary for political affairs.  The photo, taken on Dec. 27, 2017, shows former culture minister Cho Yoon-sun as she walks out of the courthouse in southern Seoul after attending a hearing held to decide on her arrest over alleged bribery and abuse of power in a scandal involving the state spy agency. They also suspect that she pressured the country's largest business lobby for conglomerates to donate some 3.5 billion won to 31 conservative civic groups that supported the Park administration. If the warrant was granted, she would have been arrested for a second time, only five months after she was released from custody with a suspended prison term for her role in the creation and management of a blacklist of artists deemed critical of the Park government. Cho, 51, was under pre-sentencing detention for about six months before she was released on July 27, after a lower court meted out a one-year jail term suspended for two years.

Prosecutors also maintained their sentence demands for four top Samsung executives: 10 years each for Choi Gee-sung, former head of Samsung's now-disbanded control tower Future Strategy Office, and his former deputy, Chang Choong-ki, and seven years each for Park Sang-jin, a former president of Samsung Electronics, and another former president, Hwang Sung-soo. They were convicted of similar charges and sentenced to four years in prison or given suspended terms by the lower court.The prosecution also demanded the defendants forfeit 7.89 billion won of assets hidden overseas.The court is to deliver its verdict on Lee and the four defendants on Feb. 5. Lee, in the courtroom, once again pleaded not guilty. ""I had a dream of being credited as a leader of a global company by managing Samsung to the best of my ability,"" he said. ""I am no fool to believe that I could succeed at it just with the help of a president... It may sound arrogant, but I had the confidence.""The prosecution charged Lee and the other defendants with involvement in offering or promising 43.3 billion won of bribes to Park and Choi to win government support for a key merger of two Samsung units. The merger was seen as vital to his control of the business group in order to inherit the leadership from his ailing father Lee Kun-hee.  ""Why would I ask for a favor to take over the leadership through bribes? I cannot admit ,"" he said.  The vice chairman said he feels terrible that the trial has deprived him of such a chance and that he feels lost as to how to recover his credibility as an entrepreneur, which has been tainted by the scandal.  But he opted to take the blame for all the criticism and asked for leniency on his executives. ""The skein of threads have gotten tangled in such a complicated and messed-up way and one thing for sure is that everything is on me,"" Lee said. ""I take all the legal and ethical responsibilities and other defendants are only here because they worked for the company.""Special Counsel Park Young-soo refuted the defendants' argument of insisting the donations were part of fulfilling their social responsibilities. ""Claiming the illegal sponsoring, including the purchase of a high-end steed and massive funding to Choi's foundations using its affiliates' assets, to be donations is an insult to true corporate philanthropy.""The lower court did not acknowledge as bribes part of the money including the group's donation of some 20.4 billion won to the two foundations allegedly controlled by Choi and 13.5 billion won which were not actually provided. The defendants argued that they only accepted Park's demands for fear of retaliation and never sought any government favors in return. Lee continued to deny that his first one-on-one encounter with the former president had already taken place prior to the two meetings he has admitted. ""I only met the ex-president in her safe house twice ... I wouldn't need to lie about something like this,"" he told the court.""It may sound inappropriate, but if I don't remember that, I must have dementia."" Lee insisted that he did not intend to take over the busines empire from his father after he became bedridden following a heart attack in 2014. ""I do not understand what it means by saying management succession,"" he said. ""I never accepted her requests thinking that it would get me the leadership."" He said, ""Proving my capabilities and being credited by executives for the vision I have is what matters, not how much my stake is worth."" Lee was arrested in February.

Prosecutors need parliamentary approval to arrest him as an incumbent lawmaker has immunity from being taken into custody by law enforcement while the National Assembly is in session. Unless the parliament passes a motion for his arrest during the session, the prosecution has to wait till Jan. 9, when the session is due to end. Prosecutors questioned him last week over the allegations. He has denied any wrongdoing. The former city council chairman, only identified by his last name Kong, has been charged with violating political funding law and detained pending a court verdict.","illicit political funds prosecutors ,opposition lawmaker on charges ,prosecutors on tuesday filed ,lawmaker over alleged illicit ,party korea on charges","[""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Lee Woo - hyun', 'Liberty Party Korea', 'Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18846776  0.34051654

A prosecutor and two investigators from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office visited the Seoul Detention Center earlier in the day to interrogate Park. She appeared in a meeting room where they had been waiting, but refused to answer any questions, according to the prosecution. She returned to her cell after, they said. Park has been in presentencing detention since late March over a string of corruption charges involving her longtime friend and confidante Choi Soon-sil. Park was removed from office over the scandal by a Constitutional Court ruling on March 10.  Yonhap)Prosecutors have been looking into fresh allegations involving the ousted president that the National Intelligence Service regularly paid her through her two aides some 3.8 billion won  from May 2013 to July 2016 with the state funds. They were to ask her about her alleged involvement and knowledge of the illicit payments, with which prosecutors suspect Park could have used personally or for illegal political activities. Her reaction was widely expected as she has been boycotting all sessions in her trial since October in protest against the court decision to extend her arrest for another six months. She has given up her right to counsel, accusing the judiciary of not being fair with her case. Park made a rare speech in the last trial she attended in which she claimed to be a ""victim of political revenge."" Prosecutors have indicted her two aides and three then NIS chiefs over bribery charges. They plan to review the evidence and soon decide on whether to file additional charges against the former president, they said.","by prosecutors on tuesday ,refuses questioning in prison ,scandal former president park ,in prison by prosecutors ,prosecutors on tuesday","['Park Geun', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'the Seoul Detention Center', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3191734   0.05176037

The Supreme Court also confirmed Lee Wan-koo, former prime minister under ousted President Park Geun-hye, was not guilty of bribery charges in connection with the scandal, citing a lack of evidence. Hong and Lee were indicted in July 2015 as part of the prosecution’s probe into a suspected “bribery list” that Sung Wan-jong, chairman of construction company Kyungnam Corp., left behind before taking his own life in April 2015. The list included the names of eight lawmakers close to Park, including Hong and Lee.  Leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, Hong Joon-pyo Hong, a former presidential candidate for the Liberty Korea Party, was suspected of taking illicit campaign funds worth 100 million won  from Sung in June 2011. Lee was accused of receiving 30 million won from Sung in April 2013.Hong and Lee were sentenced to 18 months in jail and eight months in jail, respectively, with a two-year suspension, but appeals courts overturned the rulings, clearing them of the bribery charges.Hong’s acquittal is likely to boost his reform efforts to regain public trust in the Liberty Korea Party -- which is still reeling from the corruption scandal that led to Park’s ouster -- and unite the fractured conservative bloc ahead of next year’s local elections. Hong expressed relief over the ruling. “As I am now out of slander and fetters, the Liberty Korea Party will make utmost efforts to safeguard the liberal Republic of Korea with conservatives at the core,” he said in a press briefing following the ruling.

But it quashed the earlier ruling and ordered a retrial for part of her tax evasion charges, saying to the effect that the charges should be dropped as she did pay them via other means such as electronic devices. Choi, 47, has been sentenced to six years in prison with a forfeit of 4.3 billion won  for taking some 10 billion won in kickbacks from two local businessmen from 2015-2016. They were charged with illegal overseas gambling and running an unauthorized financial firm. She told them she could help them bargain their time in prison or get a suspended sentence. The top court also ruled that the bribery case of Kim Soo-chun, a judge at the Incheon District Court, to be retried as part of the charges that were dismissed in the appellate court call for re-examination, it said.  Choi You-jeong, a judge-turned-lawyer charged with bribery in a massive lobbying scandal, is circled in red in this photo taken Dec. 22, 2017, as she enters the Supreme Court to attend her trial in southern Seoul. On the right is her official picture. Kim has been indicted on charges that he received 180 million won in bribes from Jung Woon-ho, then head of a local cosmetics chain, in return for pulling the strings for him to mitigate the sentence in his trial. Jung is also one of the businessmen who bribed Choi. Kim was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to forfeit 120 million won. The top court did not accept the previous ruling that cleared him of part of the graft charges, saying he should be convicted on all charges, including bribery and intermediation. If the retrial ends in line with the top court's ruling, Kim will likely be given a heavier punishment. The lobbying scandal involving Jung and the judges, along with other similar cases that followed, put the judiciary and legal circles under intense public scrutiny last year, leading to a formal apology by the then Supreme Court Chief Yang Sung-tae.","judges charged with bribery ,friday sent the corruption ,turned lawyer on charges ,lobbying scandal that rocked ,judiciary lobbying scandal that","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Supreme Court', 'Choi You - jeong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17279829  0.55083483

The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office sent investigators to the ministry headquarters and the residences of four ministry officials in charge, including then Minister Kim Young-suk, at around 9 a.m. to confiscate evidence, according to the office.  The raid comes as the inspection unit of the oceans ministry, now under the liberal Moon Jae-in administration, has filed a formal complaint with the prosecution seeking an investigation into an alleged organized scheme by former ministry officials to interrupt the probe into the sinking of the Sewol ferry. The vessel sank off the country's southwestern coast on April 16, 2014, killing mostly high school students who were en route to the resort island of Jeju on a school trip. The Park government's alleged mishandling of the disaster became one of the reasons that later triggered moves toward her impeachment. She was removed from office in March over a massive corruption scandal involving her longtime friend and confidante.

Cho, the eldest daughter of the airline’s chairman Cho Yang-ho, was sent to trial in January 2015 for assaulting a chief cabin crew, forcing the taxiing plane back to the gate in New York and disrupting the plane’s operations. In February 2015, the lowest court sentenced Cho to a one-year jail term, acknowledging all charges including altering the flight route.  In May 2015, the appeals court cleared her of causing a change in the flight path, reducing her sentence to 10 months with a two-year suspension.The top court agreed with the appeals court’s ruling.In December 2014, Cho, who was then in charge of in-flight service at Korean Air, was on an Incheon-bound flight departing from New York‘s John F. Kennedy International Airport when she allegedly became upset about the way her macadamia nuts were served -- in an unopened bag, not on a plate. In a rage over what she viewed as “poor cabin service,” Cho verbally abused the chief steward Park Chang-jin, made him kneel and jabbed his hand with a folder and ordered the flight to return to the terminal gate to deplane Park. The incident immediately triggered public outcry over the long-held privileges of a handful of family-owned conglomerates that dominate the national economy, making it one of the most high-profile cases in Korea.","2015 for assaulting chief ,january 2015 for assaulting ,10 months in prison ,years for disrupting plane ,thursday lower court ruling","['South Korea ’s', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korea Air', 'Cho', 'Cho Yang - ho']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.03117457 0.34770048 0.06652668],Ock Hyun-ju,Social affairs,12,2017,"january 2015 for assaulting chief ,two years for disrupting plane ,10 months in prison suspended ,2015 for assaulting chief cabin ,prison suspended for two years","['South Korea ’s', 'Cho Hyun - ah', 'Korea Air', 'Cho', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'New York', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'Korean Air', 'Incheon', 'John F.

She is in detention and on trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power in connection with a corruption scandal that removed her from power. Park is suspected of receiving some of the “special activities fund,” part of the NIS’ annual budget, on a monthly basis, from the NIS chiefs in return for personal favors. Park is also facing allegations that she was involved in supporting pro-government rallies under her administration. Two former chiefs of the NIS under the Park administration, Lee Byung-ki and Nam Jae-joon, were sent to trial earlier this month for channeling 50 million won  to 100 million won monthly to the presidential office. The money came from the 4 billion won special activities fund, which was not subjected to the parliamentary audit and scrutiny. Former presidential secretaries and Park’s longest serving aides Lee Jae-man and An Bong-geun were indicted for allegedly taking the money from the NIS, which the prosecution views as bribes.Lee testified during his trial that Park had ordered him to take the money.

Three others have been indicted without detention for embezzlement and other charges, one of whom includes Park Jung-woon, a once popular Korean singer in the 1990s, they said.  A prosecutor from the Incheon district office speaks during a press briefing on the cryptocurrency investment scam by Mining Max and its top investors on Dec. 20, 2017. Seven other Korean and foreign nationals have been put on Interpol's wanted list, including the chairman and vice chairman of Mining Max who have fled the country, while a search is continuing to track down four top investors that remain at large. The suspects stand accused of pocketing some 270 billion won  from 18,000 investors in 54 countries including Korea, the US, Japan and China between September last year and this October. They allegedly lured them into investing in their cryptocurrency mining tools that produce ethereum, the second most popular type of virtual currency after bitcoin, promising higher returns in the cybermoney if they increase investment. Its IT subsidiary deceived investors by manipulating the mining results to look as if they were digging more ethereum using the computer program it developed. Their scam began to falter as they could not make enough returns from cryptocurrency mining.  Mining Max is suspected to have graded its investors into seven different levels depending on the amount of investment. Top performers took part in the scam to manage their downlines, for which some of them were paid as much as 4 billion won in incentives, as well as luxury items such as Mercedes and Rolex. Prosecutors believe the company spent only 75 billion won to buy the miners and the rest was used by the management personally or to reward top performers. They suspect the executives have hidden about 100 billion won of the investment in offshore accounts.The prosecution estimates the investor victims' tallies at about 14,000 in Korea, 2,600 in the US, 600 in China and 700 from the rest of the countries including Japan.","multimillion dollar cryptocurrency scam ,prosecutors bust multimillion dollar ,uncovered multimillion dollar fraud ,bust multimillion dollar cryptocurrency ,multimillion dollar fraud scheme","['INCHEON', 'the United States', ""the Incheon District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'US', 'Mining Max']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34233731 -0.00105855

YonhapIn the appeals trial at the Seoul High Court on Tuesday, Special Counsel Park Young-soo demanded a seven-year imprisonment for Kim Ki-choon and six years for Cho Yoon-sun, who were indicted in February over allegations they created the blacklist of nearly 10,000 artists in the fields of film, music and literature. Kim served as Park’s chief of staff while Cho held posts as culture minister and presidential secretary for political affairs. “The defendants committed the crimes to discriminate against artists just because they had different views, although democracy acknowledges the right to differ,” a member of the counsel team said during the final hearing of the trial. The list was created and used under the Park administration to exclude left-wing figures from state support, part of a massive scandal that toppled the Park presidency. The former president, expelled from office in March, is now standing trial separately on 18 charges. Those on the blacklist included writer Han Kang, who won the 2016 Man Booker International Prize, and director Park Chan-wook of “Oldboy” fame. Many were put on the list for their liberal-leaning political views, but some were added due to criticism of the Park administration’s botched handling of the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, which claimed more than 300 lives, mainly children on a school trip. A lower court convicted Kim and Cho in July. Kim was sentenced to three years in jail while Cho was released on a one-year jail sentence suspended for two years. Both the counsel and the defendants appealed. Also on Tuesday, the counsel team demanded jail terms for five others ranging from three to six years in prison, include former Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok and senior secretary for education and culture Kim Sang-ryul concerning the same charges.Kim succeeded Cho as culture minister when Cho was picked for the Blue House secretary position. Park, the first female president elected in Korea, was arrested on March 31 and indicted on April 17. Park’s main charges include abuse of power, bribery, coercion and leaking government secrets. Park’s scandal first came to the surface in October 2016, leading to her impeachment in December.By Bak Se-hwan","seven years in jail ,blacklist scandal south korea ,demanded seven year imprisonment ,seven year imprisonment for ,jail for former president","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Kim Ki - choon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30944729  0.11598846

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it has charged independent lawmaker Lee Jung-hyun with violating the broadcasting law. Lee, known for his close ties with Park, stands accused of trying to tone down the public broadcaster KBS' coverage of the Sewol ferry that sank off the country's southwestern coast on April 16, 2014.  This photo filed Oct. 27, 2017, shows independent lawmaker Lee Jung-hyun. The sinking of the vessel killed 304 passengers aboard, mostly high school students on a field trip to the resort island of Jeju off the tip of the peninsula. Prosecutors believe Lee, then the senior presidential secretary in charge of promotion and communication, made a phone call to the then KBS chief editor and suggested how the news coverage should be edited. The allegations involving Lee first surfaced in June as several civic media groups filed a complaint with the prosecution, seeking an investigation into Lee's involvement in the suspected interference. The prosecution decided to press charges against Lee based on the decision made by a public jury, made up of nine civilians, which recommended Lee be prosecuted. The then government's alleged mishandling of the Sewol sinking became one of the reasons that later triggered moves toward the impeachment of Park, who was removed from office in March over a massive corruption scandal involving her longtime friend and confidante. The incumbent government, led by liberal President Moon Jae-in, has set out for a probe into the suspected mishandling of the Sewol tragedy under Park's leadership, including Park's unaccounted whereabouts at the time of the accident. The prosecution said it has also launched a probe into allegations that the Park administration sought to block an internal inquiry into the Sewol sinking by a special committee of the oceans and fisheries ministry.","sinking former presidential aide ,pro park lawmaker indicted ,sewol sinking former presidential ,sinking former presidential ,park lawmaker indicted","['Park Geun', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Lee Jung - hyun', 'Lee', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20696014  0.26979908

In October, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, now led by liberal President Moon Jae-in, made a revelation that the preceding government may have deliberately altered the time it had first reported to then-President Park about the accident, to 9:30 a.m. from 10:00 a.m., in an apparent attempt to conceal the president's unaccounted whereabouts at the time of the ship sinking. Cheong Wa Dae has formally filed a complaint with the prosecution, seeking a probe against Park's key aides, including then chief of staff Kim Ki-choon on possible charges of document falsification and abuse of power.  Kim Ki-choon The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it executed a search warrant it had obtained from the Seoul High Court and has visited the Presidential Archives in Sejong, south of Seoul, over a number of occasions since last week to access the confidential files. Presidential documents are normally sealed for up to 30 years from the end of presidencies. But an exception is allowed by law for their disclosure if it is considered vital evidence in an investigation. It has to be open upon parliamentary approval from two-thirds of the seats and a court warrant subsequently issued by the head of the high court. The documents were sealed by then-Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn in March this year, who was also the acting president after Park was removed from office in that month over an influence-peddling scandal involving her close friend. The then government's mishandling of the Sewol ferry disaster later became one of the reasons that triggered moves toward Park's impeachment amid intense public criticism, as her administration had never been clear about where she was around the time of the sinking. Prosecutors said they have been focusing the probe to find out if there were any fabrications in instruction and report logs after the fact, and whether there were any intentional orders from high-level officials.","the 2014 ferry sinking ,probe prosecutors said friday ,accessed classified presidential documents ,prosecutors access sealed presidential ,2014 ferry sinking that","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Cheong', 'Moon Jae - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.22913527  0.38979575

It was the prosecution’s third attempt to take Woo into custody. Following the decision, Woo was transported to a detention center. Woo Byung-woo The court said that his charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt and there is a possibility of him destroying evidence. The same court rejected the prosecution’s requests twice in February and April this year, citing lack of evidence. The prosecution sought to arrest him again over new suspicions that Woo, 50, ordered the National Intelligence Service to secretly spy on civilians and government officials deemed critical of the conservative Park administration. Among the surveilled was Lee Seok-su, ex-special inspector who was probing Woo over corruption allegations. The prosecution also suspects that Woo has been involved in drawing up a blacklist of liberal cultural figures considered critical of Park and her policies and implementing it to discriminate against them, such as in doling out state funding. Woo has denied all charges, saying he never ordered the NIS to conduct illegal surveillance and he only did the job within his discretion as the presidential aide for civil affairs. Woo has been tried without detention on charges that he abetted or condoned meddling in state affairs by Park‘s confidante Choi Soon-sil and that he disrupted an investigation by then-special inspector Lee. Woo is the only major figure to have avoided arrested among those implicated in the corruption scandal. The scandal, which led to ex-President Park’s ouster in March, sent Park, Choi, government officials and business tycoons including Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong to trial and jail. Park, who was arrested in March, is on trial on 18 charges including bribery and abuse of power. Choi, who was arrested in November last year and accused as an accomplice to Park for 13 charges, is awaiting a verdict scheduled for Jan. 26. The prosecution has demanded a 25-year prison term for her. Woo’s arrest is expected to give a boost to the prosecution’s investigation into suspected irregularities surrounding the state agency under the previous conservative administrations. The prosecution has been looking into the NIS over allegations that it interfered in the 2012 presidential election to sway public opinion in favor of then-conservative candidate Park, spied on civilians and government officials and provided illicit funds to the presidential office.It remains to be seen how the arrest will affect Park’s trial. Woo reportedly testified during a prosecutorial questioning that Park had ordered him to spy on Kim Jin-seon, ex-head of the committee for PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and public servants from the Culture Ministry.","park aide woo arrested ,was arrested early friday ,state spy agency illegal ,arrested early friday morning ,arrested early friday","['Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Woo', 'Park ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23075464  0.13367005

The prosecution asked for a four-year term for the business tycoon on charges that he gave bribes to a foundation run by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of former President Park Geun-hye, expecting business favors in return. Separately, prosecutors asked a court to hand down a 25-year prison term to Choi, who was at the center of the massive corruption scandal that led to impeachment and arrest of Park.The Seoul Central District Court will hand down its judgment on Shin on Jan. 26.The court is also set to issue a separate sentence on Shin on Dec. 22 on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust.Prosecutors suspect that Shin paid 50 billion won in wages to people who never worked for its affiliates and inflicted 130 billion won in losses on the business group's subsidiaries by forcing them to cover the losses of other units. Prosecutors have demanded a 10-year jail term for the business tycoon.Industry watchers say a guilty verdict, if issued, could deal a heavy blow to the country's fifth-largest conglomerate, which has been moving to settle a holding firm system.In October, Lotte established the holding company Lotte Corp. in a bid to solidify Shin's leadership and boost the group's managerial transparency.The legal battle is the latest headache to hit the retail giant.Lotte Group is said to have incurred about 2 trillion won  in damages in recent months amid a Seoul-Beijing diplomatic spat over Seoul's deployment of a US missile defense system.Lotte became a key target of Beijing's ire when it provided its golf course in March as the host site of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, seen as a security threat by China.Beijing took punitive action against the conglomerate's business in China. Eighty-seven of its 112 Lotte Mart discount stores suspended operations, and sales at the handful of stores that managed to stay open dipped more than 80 percent. The conglomerate decided in September to give up and announced it would sell off its local chain.Founded in Japan in 1967, Lotte grew into one of South Korea's major chaebol, driven by its success in the retail, food and amusement businesses. The group's business includes chemicals, duty-free, finance and construction, and it has a global workforce of 125,000.","43 million in bribes ,korean retail giant lotte ,coming weeks over bribery ,thursday lotte group chairman ,million in bribes","['south korean', 'Lotte', 'Lotte Group', 'Shin Dong - bin', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - il']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15050255  0.27730414

29,29,29,Prosecutors seek 25 years in prison for Choi Soon-sil,"The prosecution on Thursday demanded 25 years in prison for Choi Soon-sil, the woman at the center of the massive corruption scandal that led to President Park Geun-hye’s ouster early this year.

The court will rule on Jan. 26. At the final hearing of the 13-month trial at the Seoul Central District Court, the special counsel and state prosecutors asked the court to order Choi, 61, to pay a fine of 118.5 billion won  and forfeit 7.7 billion won, saying she is “the beginning and the end of the corruption scandal.”Choi, Park’s friend of 40 years, has been tried on a total of 18 charges including bribery and coercion since Nov. 20. The charges against her center on the alleged collusion with the former president to extort donations from local firms and receiving bribes from Samsung Group. The prosecution also asked the court to sentence Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, 62, to four years in prison and confiscate 7 billion won for offering bribes to Choi-controlled foundations in return for favors for his duty-free business.For senior presidential secretary An Chong-bum, 58, the prosecution demanded the court hand down a six-year jail term, impose a fine of 100 million won, and forfeit 40 million won for colluding with Park and Choi to extort local firms. He is also accused of taking bribes from a local plastic surgeon.  Accusing Choi of capitalizing on her 40-year ties to Park and disrupting the order of the government and private businesses in doing so, the prosecution called for a heavy punishment to serve as a lesson to future generations. “Choi colluded with Park and used Park’s presidential power for her private interests, which resulted in severely violating Constitutional values and shaking the foundations of the nation,” a prosecutor said, adding Choi shows no signs of atoning for her wrongdoings. Also calling it a typical case of corruption between politics and business, the prosecution underscored the “need to sound an alarm about corruption crimes in society.” Choi is accused of using her ties to Park to force conglomerates to donate 77.4 billion won to two foundations controlled by her. She is also accused of taking bribes worth 29.8 billion won from Samsung Group for her daughter’s equestrian training and her business interests. Choi has denied all charges, blaming the prosecution for framing her in a fabricated case. She vehemently defended Park, saying Park is not such a person who could pursue private interests. “I never conspired with Park to seek personal interests, but being fined more than 100 billion won is more severe than having property confiscated in a socialist country,” said Choi during her 20-minute final remark. “South Korea’s prosecution must make an effort to find the truth but it has been biased against .” she said, choking several times and shedding tears. “I cannot accept the frame  has put me and President Park in.”Choi, arrested in November last year, is one of the central figures in the corruption scandal that sent ex-President Park, government officials and business tycoons including Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong to trial and jail. Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong was sentenced to five years in jail for giving or promising to offer donations worth 43.3 billion won to Park and Choi, which the prosecution viewed as bribes. He appealed the ruling. The verdict for Choi, Shin and An, slated for 2:10 p.m. on Jan. 26, is likely to affect the ruling for Park, as Choi and Park were accused as accomplices for 13 charges including bribery and coercion. Park, who has been detained since March 31, is standing trial on a total of 18 charges including bribery and abuse of power. She is suspected of letting Choi meddle in state affairs, helping her business interests and discriminating against liberal artists critical of her as well as sacking government officials who refused to aid or abet her alleged wrongdoings. Another major charge is leaking government secrets to Choi. The corruption scandal drove an accumulated 17 million people onto the streets demanding Park’s ouster for months, which led the parliament to impeach Park on Dec. 9. The impeachment was finalized by the Constitutional Court in a unanimous ruling on March 10.Choi received a three-year prison term in a separate corruption case for abusing her power to get her daughter accepted into a prestigious university despite her lack of qualifications.It is not yet decided whether the verdict hearing will be televised. According to a recent change in court rules, it is now possible to broadcast live sentencing hearings deemed important to the public interest.

The Seoul Central District Court held a hearing to decide whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of Woo over his alleged involvement in the National Intelligence Service’s illegal spying on civilians, while serving as Park’s senior secretary for civil affairs. Woo Byung-woo The 51-year-old former prosecutor appeared at the court building at around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. When asked by reporters whether he still believes that his actions, now accused by prosecutors as illegal spying, were an extension of his job, Woo said “yes,” without elaborating. He served in the position from 2015-2016, during which he is suspected to have exerted influence on the national intelligence agency to conduct surveillance on dissidents.The court’s decision on whether to approve the warrant will be announced as early as late Thursday night or early Friday.Prosecutors have already sought to arrest Woo twice, in February and April this year, but both attempts were rejected by the court due to insufficient grounds. They filed for an arrest writ on Monday, making a third attempt. Woo is accused of ordering NIS to surveil civilians and influential public officials who were deemed critical of the conservative Park administration, including the presidential office’s internal inspector Lee Seok-su. He is also suspected to have played a role in instructing the NIS and the Culture Ministry to create a blacklist of artists and celebrities considered critical of Park and her policies. In addition, he is accused of exerting power to delay a prosecutorial investigation to determine the cause of the deadly sinking of the ferry Sewol in 2014, in order for public sentiment to become favorable to the Park administration. Woo is the only major figure who has avoided arrest among those implicated in the corruption scandal involving Park. He has denied any wrongdoing.Former President Park was expelled from power in March over a sweeping influence-peddling and corruption scandal. She is currently in jail and is being tried for a host of 18 charges, including bribery and abuse of power.

From a first-term lawmaker to party heavyweights, over seven of its politicians have been investigated for corruption or are soon to face interrogation. The latest to come under scrutiny was five-term lawmaker Rep. Won Yoo-chul, who on Wednesday was questioned by the prosecution on the allegation of receiving hundreds of millions of won in illicit political funds from local businessmen. Rep. Won Yoo-chul of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party appears at Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office to be questioned over allegations of receiving illicit political funds, in Seoul on Wedneday. His office had been raided by the prosecution and his former aide was arrested last month, along with a real estate developer based in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province -- Won’s constituency.A prominent member of the party and a loyalist of ousted former President Park Geun-hye, Rep. Won said he would earnestly cooperate with the prosecution as he appeared in front of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office in the morning.Rep. Won is far from the only one going through a prosecution probe in the conservative opposition party. On Tuesday, first-term lawmaker Rep. Um Yong-soo was charged without detention as prosecutors suspect he colluded with an aide to take a bribe of 200 million won  from a campaign manager in his constituency of Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province. A two-term lawmaker, Rep. Lee Woo-hyun has also been called on by the prosecution on receiving kickbacks, while Reps. Kweon Seong-dong and Yeom Dong-yeol are similarly expected to be investigated over unfair hiring practices in the casino resort of Kangwon Land, located in their constituencies in Gangwon Province. For a four-term lawmaker and staunch supporter of the former president, Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan, the Justice Ministry submitted a motion Tuesday seeking parliamentary consent for his arrest.The prosecution sought an arrest warrant for the lawmaker after they questioned Choi for receiving 100 million won from the nation’s intelligence agency when he was sitting as the deputy prime minister and finance minister under the Park administration in 2014.For an incumbent legislator to be arrested while the National Assembly is in session, the parliament needs to pass the motion to give a consent.The newly elected floor leader of the Liberty Korea Party, Rep Kim Sung-tae called the prosecution’s moves part of the liberal Moon Jae-in administration’s “political vendetta” against opposition parties. “We believe that the government has deliberately brought up issues such as bribery cases involving the National Intelligence Service as a political vendetta and to pressure the opposition,” he said. Previously, the prosecution concluded that floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea Rep. Woo Won-shik would be free from suspicion of paying a politician to abandon his candidacy in the 2012 general election. A former lawmaker of the minor opposition People’s Party, Choi Myeong-gil, was stripped of his membership at the parliament on Dec. 5, after the nation’s top court confirmed the original verdict to fine him 2 million won for violating election law.According to law, legislators are disqualified from their position if they receive fines of over 1 million won or a jail sentence.

The Seoul Central District Court again refused to issue the writ for Jun Byung-hun, former senior secretary for political affairs to President Moon Jae-in, after it turned down the first request last month. The court said that the bribery and embezzlement charges laid against him are disputable and he seems to be at low risk of fleeing or destroying evidence given the evidence collected so far. Jun is accused of inducing two local home shopping channels to donate 480 million won  between 2013 and 2015 to the Korea e-Sports Association, which was under his control. Prosecutors suspect the money was given in exchange for favors involving the renewal of their broadcasting license. Jun was at the time a three-term lawmaker belonging to the parliamentary committee in charge of related policies. He is also accused of receiving up to 8 million won worth of gift vouchers from Lotte. Jun resigned as an aide to Moon over the scandal but flatly denied wrongdoing. This file photo shows Jun Byung-hun, former senior secretary to President Moon Jae-in, appearing at the prosecution`s office on Dec. 13, 2017. In a separate case, another judge at the court refused to issue the warrant for Kim Tae-hyo, a former aide to Lee from 2008-2012, citing similar reasons it gave for Jun's case. Prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for the Sungkyunkwan University professor last Friday, accusing him of involvement with the military cyber command's operations in 2012 to write Internet comments to sway public opinion in favor of then ruling party presidential candidate Park Geun-hye. Prosecutors suspect that Kim delivered Lee's messages to the military, including an instruction to hire people with conservative political views and thus who are friendly to his administration. When leaving office, he also allegedly took military documents and presidential records with him without permission. Kim has denied all charges.

According to the police, the suspect had initially ran his car into two parked vehicles -- a Grandeur and K5 sedan -- in front of the Cheongju District Court on Nov. 7 at 11:41 p.m. The suspect fled the scene and was caught after crashing his car into a traffic light 800 meters away. No casualties were reported. With the help of a passerby who reported the incident, the police were able to confirm that the suspect had been drinking and driving through a breathalyzer test upon arrival. Police said that the suspect looked “intoxicated” and “could not get out of the car due to contact wounds from the accident.” Due to the difficulty of measuring exact blood alcohol concentration levels, police also reported having taken blood samples from the suspect. Blood samples have been sent to the National Forensic Service for further analysis. It is said that the suspect suffers neck and back wounds and was transported immediately to the nearest hospital for treatment. Cheongju Sangdang Police Station announced that they have arrested the suspect for leaving the scene of a motor collision without detainment. They are still investigating the exact details of the accident. Because it takes two to three weeks for blood sample analysis, police are waiting to see if the suspect‘s blood alcohol concentration exceeds the legal limit of 0.05 percent and whether to arrest him on added DUI charges. The administrative court official refused to make any further comments on the pertinent case. By Catherine Chung","cheongju police revealed tuesday ,suspect caught last thursday ,employee arrested for fleeing ,police revealed tuesday ,police revealed tuesday that","['Cheongju Police', 'North Chungcheong', 'Grandeur', 'K5', 'the Cheongju District Court']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.10888468 0.56890661 0.40771285],Catherine Chung,Social affairs,12,2017,"caught after crashing his car ,thursday on alleged charges driving ,old suspect caught last thursday ,cheongju police revealed tuesday ,suspect caught last thursday on","['Cheongju Police', 'North Chungcheong', 'Grandeur', 'K5', 'the Cheongju District Court', 'the National Forensic Service', 'Cheongju Sangdang Police Station', 'Catherine Chung']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.10888468 0.56890661 0.40771285]

The prosecution suspect she received 50 million  won from the National Intelligence Service, when she was in office. They believe she obtained the money as a monthly allowance of 5 million won from June 2014 to May 2015. It has been four months since Cho, the former culture minister and senior political affairs aide to Park Geun-hye, has been released from detention after she was sentenced to a year in prison with two years of probation. She had been charged of creating a blacklist of dissenting artists to deny them state support when she was the culture minister in 2014. She also faces allegations of creating a “white list” of conservative organizations, and providing financial aid of some 6.9 billion won to selected specific groups, such as the Federation of Korean Industries, by pressing conglomerates. Several others are under investigation related to the bribery allegations involving the NIS. An incumbent four-term conservative lawmaker, who was a former finance minister under Park’s leadership, Choi Kyung-hwan, has also been summoned to be questioned over similar allegations on Wednesday. He is suspected of taking 100 million won from the spy agency as he was the finance minister in 2014. Two former chiefs of the intelligence agency, Lee Byung-kee and Nam Jae-joon are indicted for channeling the agency’s budget to the presidential office in return for personal favors, following the order of the former state chief. Lee, who led the agency from July 2014 to February 2015 is suspected of sending a total of 600 million won to bribe related officials and presidential aides as Lee, who was the chief from 2013 to 2014 has given a total of 800 million won. The money came from the intelligence agency’s allotted budget of 4 billion won, dubbed as the “special activities fund.” The budget is not subjected to the parliamentary audit and scrutiny and its usages has been under cover.According to prosecutors, the practice is likely to have been started by Nam.The prosecution has been looking into the NIS as it found evidence that the spy agency has manipulated elections, spied on civilians and provided illicit funds to the presidential office under the Park administration. After the conservative former president was ousted in March, liberal President Moon Jae-in was elected in May. He vowed to reform society and eradicate irregularities, and created reform committees in 13 government bodies, such as the NIS and the Defense Ministry.

Lee Young-ryeol, former chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors` Office, walks out of a courtroom in southern Seoul on Dec. 8, 2017, after he was acquitted of charges in violation of an anti-graft law. He provided each of the two officials with 1 million won  in cash and a meal worth 95,000 won during a private dinner meeting. He was indicted in June for violating a new anti-graft law enacted to articulate acts of corruption and toughen punishment for violators. Prosecutors demanded a pecuniary fine of 5 million won. But the court acknowledged that his act is exempt from the regulations. It noted the law does not apply to meals and gifts that higher officials give subordinates as encouragement. The cash doled out by Lee is also not punishable by the criminal code, which applies when the money provided is in excess of 1 million won. The court said he could face a penalty in a separate administrative proceeding.  The incident drew keen attention because the dinner was offered for a prosecution team in charge of the investigation of a corruption scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye. It was co-hosted by a senior justice ministry official who is a close acquaintance of Park's key aide who was probed in the case.","of corruption charges friday ,corruption charges friday ,corruption charges friday the ,former seoul prosecution chief ,april of two prosecutors","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee Young - ryeol', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' office""]",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.20564544  0.23290682

The Seoul Central District Court ruled Choi Eun-young, 55, violated the law that bans insider trading. She was immediately taken into custody. The court also ordered her to pay a 1.2 billion won  fine and forfeit 503 million won. This photo, filed Sept. 27, 2016, captures Choi Eun-young, former chairwoman of the now-defunct Hanjin Shipping Co. The court said, although her charges are grave enough to deserve a heavy punishment, it considered that the stake selling does not appear to have been meticulously planned out and that Choi already donated 10 billion won to bear the responsibility for her misdeed. Choi was indicted in December last year for unloading the stakes held by her and her two daughters, taking advantage of the undisclosed information. Her family avoided some 1 billion won of possible losses. In April, 2016, Hanjin Shipping filed for court receivership after failing to deal with its mounting debts amid a protracted global downturn in the shipping sector. The once world's seventh-largest shipper was declared bankrupt by the court in February after its creditors rejected to let the firm proceed with its salvage plan.  Choi is the wife of the late Cho Su-ho, the younger brother of Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho, who also runs the country's top air carrier Korean Air Lines Co. She took over the management control of Hanjin Shipping in 2006 after her husband's death and headed the company until April 2014.","court sentenced former chairwoman ,shipping chairwoman gets prison ,chairwoman gets prison term ,jail for selling off ,seoul court sentenced former","['Seoul', 'Hanjin Shipping Co.', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Choi Eun - young']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.51267463  0.08016054

The Seoul Southern District Court made the ruling, saying that it was difficult to see that the decision-making process at MBC had been ""greatly infringed by the board's move that led to the dismissal of the president, as the board officials have claimed."" ""It is also hard to accept the argument that the dismissal came from a decision that was made without a thorough and fair review and that it was based on the opinion of a particular interest group,"" the court said.  MBC chief executive officer and president Kim Jang-kyom is surrounded by reporters as he walks his way into the Seoul district agency of the labor ministry for questioning over alleged unfair labor practices at the public broadcaster on Sept. 5, 2017. The Foundation for Broadcast Culture, the controlling shareholder of MBC, passed a motion in a November board meeting to remove then-President Kim Jang-kyom from the post, citing his political bias. The ownership structure of MBC is influenced by politics, which is one of the reasons for the prolonged battle between the management and union under the two conservative administrations of the past decade.  Dozens of MBC news reporters and producers deemed left-leaning have been either sacked or demoted by previous MBC presidents appointed by the then-FBC board, which comprised mainly officials who had ties with the conservative ruling party. Since the liberal Moon Jae-in government took office in May, the MBC union has ratcheted up its fight against the management and filed a formal complaint with the labor ministry seeking a probe into Kim for violating labor law.In the meantime, the FBC board of directors was partly replaced with liberal officials after those on the conservative side resigned.

The crime unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency referred the case of Kim Dong-seon, 28, to the prosecution recommending a nonindictment, the agency said.Kim, the third and youngest son of South Korea's eighth-largest conglomerate head Kim Seung-youn, has been under police investigation over suspicions that he attacked lawyers while he was drunk at a private dinner in September. Kim Dong-seon, the youngest son of Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn, is shown in this file photo from March 8, 2017. He is suspected of slapping some of them in the face, yanking their hair and making patronizing remarks. The Korean Bar Association filed a complaint against Kim seeking a formal probe into the allegations after media reported on the incident. Kim apologized over his misbehavior through Hanwha. Police said there is little grounds to charge him since the law here stipulates that an offense involving physical violence must entail the victim's consent for the probe to proceed. There is also insufficient evidence like surveillance footage to charge him with obstruction of business, they added. Kim is already known for his past assault records. In January this year, he got into altercations with guests at a bar and was given a suspended jail term in March.","son for assaulting lawyers ,lawyers police said wednesday ,the prosecution recommending nonindictment ,for assaulting lawyers police ,chief son for assaulting","['Hanwha Group', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Kim Dong - seon', 'Kim', ""South Korea 's""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12109923  0.30601865

The hospital said she had cerebral palsy, a form of brain damage stemming from premature birth. The patient, now 19 years old, was hospitalized many times at South Korean and foreign medical institutions. But her condition did not improve before being judged as having a severe brain disorder, and she could not walk. Her parents had to carry her on their backs when she attended school.In July 2012, however, the patient's family received a second opinion from the rehabilitation center at a hospital in Seoul that she did not appear to have the brain disorder but seemed to be infected with Segawa syndrome, a rare muscle disorder characterized by an uncoordinated or clumsy manner of walking.Segawa syndrome is caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase that leads to a lack of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in the brain. Dopamine is important for many functions, including muscle control and cognition.After one week of medication prescribed by the Seoul hospital, the patient was able to walk on her own.The patient and her father filed a suit against the Daegu hospital in October 2015 to seek 440 million won in damages.Wednesday's court decision is interpreted as the court's partial acceptance of the hospital's complaint that it was hard for the hospital to detect Segawa disease with medical techniques back in 2001.Medical sources said the rare disease became known to the industry around 1999 and was first carried in textbooks of medical colleges in 2010.","hospital to pay w100m ,pay w100m in damages ,parents visited university hospital ,w100m in damages over ,2001 when their daughter","['DAEGU', 'the Daegu District Court', 'Daegu']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15551046 -0.1923202

He was indicted in October and has been under pre-sentencing detention. But the court cleared him of charges that he took part in extorting money from Samsung, citing a lack of evidence. The court also sentenced Chang Si-ho, a niece of the former president's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil at the center of the corruption scandal, to 2 1/2 years in prison, convicting her of similar charges. Prosecutors had demanded 3 1/2 years and 1 1/2 years for Kim and Chang, respectively. Kim Chong, former vice minister at the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, is escorted to the courtroom on Dec. 6, 2017, to hear his sentencing over the influence-peddling scandal that led to the ouster of President Park Geun-hye in March. The court said it meted out Chang's prison sentence longer than the prosecution's request even though she has actively cooperated with the investigation, because she had the most to gain from the wrongdoing. ""The defendant, as Choi's niece, knew about her aunt's relationship with the former president more than anyone else, and used it to secure the donation and embezzle 300 million won out of it,"" it said. Chang, who was released in June upon the expiration of arrest, was immediately taken into custody following the court ruling. The defendants are accused of colluding with Choi to force big conglomerates including Samsung, and a culture ministry-affiliated firm, to donate a combined 1.8 billion won  to a kids sports foundation allegedly controlled by Choi. Kim is accused of secretly revealing government documents to Choi to help her win a business deal. Chang is also charged with siphoning off some of the donation and state support provided to the nonprofit foundation.The former president and Choi have been standing separate trials over the scandal.","three years in jail ,years in jail wednesday ,jail wednesday for his ,gets years in jail ,2016 guilty of abuse","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Kim Chong', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19350635  0.08479647

The presidential office has promised to offer a response to any petition with signatories that exceed the threshold in less than 30 days.The petition, posted Nov. 4, called for a revision of a law to ban any leniency toward those convicted of crimes while being under the influence of alcohol. Cho Kuk Cho Kuk, the top presidential secretary for civil affairs, said the criminal code currently did not allow, let alone ensure, leniency for those committing crimes under the influence but noted leniency was often offered to those deemed unconscious or insentient at the time of their crimes.""The clause is not aimed at reducing punishment for crimes committed under the influence of alcohol but largely deals with cases that may deserve leniency, so deleting the entire clause may require a very careful discussion,"" Cho said while appearing on a live show broadcast by Cheong Wa Dae on a social network service.Noting the petition was initially prompted by the scheduled release of a convicted child molester who, by a mistake committed by the prosecution, was offered such leniency, the presidential official said the law has already been revised to ban legal leniency for sexual criminals.In a separate petition, more than 600,000 people signed to demand an extension of the child molester's 12-year jail sentence, set to end in 2020.Cho dismissed the possibility, saying a retrial of a convicted criminal is only possible when it is in favor of the convict.","influence of alcohol wednesday ,related crimes the presidential ,000 people the presidential ,for alcohol related crimes ,crimes the presidential","['Cheong', 'Dae']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62316412  0.13213134

The money came from the 4 billion won “special activities fund,” part of the spy agency‘s annual budget, which was not subjected to the parliamentary audit and scrutiny.  Nam Jae-joon  and Lee Byung-ki The prosecution said that they had ordered their subordinates to deliver the money to former President Park through her presidential aides. Nam was additionally charged with coercing a local conglomerate to financially support a right-wing organization holding pro-government rallies under the Park administration. The prosecution plans to continue its probe into the spy agency. It summoned Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party for questioning scheduled for Wednesday. He is suspected of taking bribes from the NIS when he was finance minister during Park‘s presidency.Shortly before the indictments, the top prosecutor said that the prosecution will strive to complete high-profile investigations into alleged wrongdoings committed under previous conservative administrations by the end of the year.Since President Moon Jae-in took office in May, calling for reforms to eradicate irregularities in society, the prosecution has been looking into the spy agency over allegations that it manipulated elections, spied on civilians and provided illicit funds to the presidential office. “It is difficult to set a deadline for investigations, but we will do our best to wrap up major probes within the year,” Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il told reporters at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office. “We are investigating them with determination so that such cases in which public servants, government agencies and powerful state institutes interfered with elections and monitored civilians in a democracy will not take place again,” he said. Key accusations against the National Intelligence Service include its alleged meddling in the 2012 presidential election to sway public opinion in favor of then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye and the alleged implementation of a blacklist to discriminate against liberal artists. Conservative opposition politicians, however, have been crying foul over the series of probes into former conservative administrations. They say the prosecution is serving liberal President Moon in his personal vendetta against conservatives. To make the prosecution more transparent and independent of political pressure, Moon said that it had also formed a taskforce to come up with measures to fix past investigation practices that some critics denounced as “forcible.”The prosecution will launch a committee this month consisting of 200 external specialists including lawyers and activists to review the prosecution’s investigation process and give opinions on whether the prosecution should make arrests and indictments in key cases, he said.By Ock Hyun-ju","bribes to ousted president ,tuesday as the prosecution ,prosecutor office indicted lee ,ousted president park geun ,south korea spy agency","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Seoul Central Prosecutor ’s Office', 'Lee Byung - ki', 'Nam Jae - joon', 'the National Intelligence Service']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.23638949  0.22411281

The disinformation was delivered by Lee Joong-seo to party members on the election panel.Prosecutors concluded in July that the party's leaders including Ahn were not involved in the scandal.

Choi Yun-su Choi, who was in charge of the agency's domestic intelligence gathering from February 2016 to June 2017, was Choo's direct supervisor. Prosecutors believe Woo instructed the NIS to conduct illegal surveillance on Lee when he began looking into Woo's alleged irregularities and Choi took a role in the process.The former NIS deputy is also suspected of being involved in the NIS' writing and delivery of a blacklist of cultural and art figures considered critical of the Park government to the culture ministry at the instruction from Woo.Choi reportedly acknowledged during questioning by prosecutors on Sunday that he reported the outcome of the NIS' surveillance on Lee and Park Min-kwon, a former vice culture minister. He also admitted that he told Choo to inform Woo of the outcome but allegedly said he considered it part of his routine work of gathering information on public servants.Earlier on Wednesday, prosecutors summoned Woo for questioning on his alleged involvement in the illegal surveillance scandal.Prosecutors have said they will consider issuing an arrest warrant for Woo based on the results.","arrest former deputy spy ,deputy spy chief prosecutors ,prosecutors on wednesday sought ,to arrest former deputy ,prosecutors seek warrant","['Park Geun', 'Choi Yun - su', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'NIS', 'NIS']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51014966  0.19124462

YonhapWoo, who served as senior presidential secretary for judicial affairs from 2015-2016, is suspected to have exerted influence on the National Intelligence Service to conduct surveillance on dissidents. It is his fourth time facing interrogation by the prosecution since late last year, when a massive influence-peddling scandal surrounding the former president surfaced, leading to her eventual removal from office. “It’s my fourth time standing here over the past year,” he told reporters as he appeared at around 10 a.m. in front of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. “If it’s my fate, I take it.”The prosecution said the interrogation would mainly focus on allegations surrounding the covert NIS operations and possible charges of abuse of power and violation of the law.Prosecutors sought an arrest warrant for Woo in February and April this year. But both were rejected by the court due to insufficient grounds.According to prosecutors, Woo rejected accusations he was involved in any illegal activities of the NIS, including alleged spying on civilians and the blacklisting of artists, during the interrogation. He reportedly said he did have phone conservations with NIS officials at the time, but they were strictly routine business calls. Woo is accused of ordering the spy agency to surveil civilians and influential public officials including the presidential office’s internal inspector Lee Seok-su. He is also suspected to have played a role in instructing the NIS and the Culture Ministry to create a blacklist of artists and celebrities considered critical of Park and her policies. In addition, he is accused of exerting power to delay a prosecutorial investigation to determine the cause of the deadly sinking of the ferry Sewol in 2014, in order for public sentiment to become favorable to the Park administration. Woo, a former state prosecutor, is the only major figure who has avoided arrest among those implicated in the corruption scandal involving Park. He has denied any wrongdoing. The Korean media sarcastically describes him as the “emperor” for his strong grip on Korea’s most powerful organizations -- the prosecution and the NIS -- as well as his arrogant attitude in front of the camera. By Kim Da-sol","scandal prosecutors on wednesday ,prosecutors on wednesday summoned ,prosecutors on wednesday ,prosecutors office on wednesday ,over nis scandal prosecutors","['Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'YonhapWoo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45245999  0.53030527

Woo Byung-woo, ex-senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, appeared at around 10 a.m. for what was his fourth prosecution interrogation since he was implicated in a massive influence-peddling scandal that removed Park from office early this year, according to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. He served in his post from 2015-2016. ""It's my fourth time being here over the past year,"" he told reporters. ""If it's my fate, I take it. And I think it's also up to me to overcome ."" He said he would faithfully answer to the prosecution about his charges.  Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, walks into the Seoul Central District Court to attend his trial on Nov. 27, 2017. The 50-year-old former prosecutor was quizzed over his alleged involvement in the secret surveiling of influential public officials and civilians by the National Intelligence Service, including a then special presidential inspector, Lee Seok-su. Lee was one of those who first raised suspicions over the establishment of two foundations allegedly controlled by Choi Soon-sil, Park's confidante and longtime friend at the center of the corruption scandal. Woo is also accused of instructing the NIS and the culture ministry to keep a blacklist of artists and celebrities considered critical of Park or her policies and give them disadvantages. The fresh allegations bring the possibility of charges of abuse of power and collusion in violation of the NIS law, the prosecution said.Woo has already been standing trial on charges that he overlooked and tried to cover up Choi's meddling in various state affairs. He is also accused of exerting power to block an investigation into the Park government's handling of the 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 passengers, one of the triggers that sparked moves for Park's impeachment. Prosecutors sought an arrest warrant for Woo twice in February and April this year, both of which were turned down by a court citing insufficient grounds, as he presents no risk of fleeing or of destroying evidence and the charges raised against him are disputable. He is about the only person left among those implicated in Park's corruption scandal who has avoided arrest. It is likely that prosecutors will request another arrest warrant for Woo following the interrogation.","his fourth prosecution interrogation ,fourth prosecution interrogation since ,was his fourth prosecution ,fourth prosecution interrogation ,his fourth prosecution","['Park Geun', 'Woo Byung - woo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.06402788  0.67355454

Byun and Chang, along with another prosecutor indicted over the case, have been demoted to lower-level posts since they became subjects in the investigation.","sunday indicted four former ,officials ex prosecutors indicted ,four former national intelligence ,indicted four former national ,prosecutors on sunday indicted","['National Intelligence Agency', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Suh Cheon - ho', 'NIS', 'Chang Ho - joon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18737896  0.69076079

Kim added that the agency would be an institution to keep in check those in power, including the president, and a tool to reform the prosecution that critics say has wielded too much power and often been politically skewed.The independent investigation agency is one of Moon's priority campaign pledges to curb graft and irregularities among high-level officials, including top government officials, lawmakers, prosecutors and judges.Signs of tensions between the ruling camp and prosecution were detected as the prosecution accelerated a probe into the scandal involving two former aides of Jun Byung-hun, the former senior presidential secretary for political affairs.Jun's former aides are suspected of pressuring a local home shopping channel in 2015 to donate 300 million won  to the Korea e-Sports Association, then chaired by Jun.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office has indicted Lee Jae-man and Ahn Bong-geun, two former senior presidential secretaries to Park, on charges of bribery and loss of state funds, according to the office.  Prosecutors said Park has been stated in the indictment bill as an accomplice of Lee and Ahn. The two are accused of taking some 50-100 million won  every month from the National Intelligence Service between 2013 and 2016 at Park's request. They were arrested Nov. 3. They believe the illegal transactions from the NIS fund amounted to 3.3 billion won and were ordered by Park's three former NIS chiefs: Nam Jae-joon, Lee Byung-kee and Lee Byong-ho. Nam and Lee Byung-kee were arrested over similar charges Friday. Prosecutors suspect that the money was funneled into Park's secret fund and used in illicit political activities or even by her personally. They are said to question Park soon over the additional suspicions.","faces more bribery charges ,fund scandal former president ,more bribery charges ,more bribery charges in ,bribery trial involving","['Park Geun - hye', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Lee Jae - man', 'Ahn Bong - geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.24068624  0.17324097

Choi Kyung-hwan in connection with the National Intelligence Service’s alleged misuse of its covert operations budget. Choi, a four-term lawmaker of the conservative main opposition Liberty Korea Party, is suspected of having received 100 million won  from the NIS in 2014. He was at that time the vice prime minister and finance minister for the conservative Park Geun-hye administration.  Investigators remove records from Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan`s office at the National Assembly on Monday. YonhapThe investigators also plan to summon Choi, who strongly denies the allegations, for questioning in the near future. According to the prosecutors’ office, investigators raided Choi’s home and his office at the National Assembly at about 9:30 a.m., and collected evidence including documents and computer hardware. Choi came under suspicion in the prosecution’s probe into allegations that the NIS delivered large sums of money to Cheong Wa Dae officials during former President Park’s term. Park was expelled from power in March following a massive corruption scandal. Several of Park‘s former aides are also under investigation for receiving the unmonitored NIS funds.Choi is still considered a key pro-Park figure within the Liberty Korea Party.According to reports, the investigators have testimony and NIS accounting records supporting allegations against Choi. Evidence against Choi include a written testimony from former NIS chief Lee Byung-kee, in which he said that he approved the 100 million won to be given to Choi. Lee, who was arrested last week, also stated that Choi was given the money to recruit to resist opposition parties’ push to reduce the NIS budget. Along with Lee, former NIS chief Nam Jae-joon was also arrested Thursday in connection to the case. Lee Byung-ho, another former NIS chief, has also been implicated in the case, but his arrest warrant was rejected.

The jailed former president has been standing trial since May over a string of charges including bribery and abuse of power in a massive influence-peddling scandal that removed her from office in March. In October, the court extended her arrest warrant for another six months until April next year. Her legal counsel quit en masse in objection to the court decision, saying that she was not being tried fairly. Park delivered a long speech in her trial after her detention was extended. She claimed to be a victim of political revenge and declared that she would not be attending the rest of the trial. The court has since appointed Park five public defenders to continue the trial, but she has refused to meet them in prison.

Choi Kyung-hwan of the Liberty Korea Party on Monday over allegations that he received kickbacks from the state spy agency in 2014. Investigators from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office searched his house and his office in the National Assembly to confiscate evidence, its office said. The four-term lawmaker is suspected of taking 100 million won  in bribes from the National Intelligence Service when he was finance minister under the Park Geun-hye administration. Prosecutors believe the money was paid to lobby him for retaining the NIS' off-book funds -- with which the spy agency allegedly paid Choi -- when then opposition parties pushed for scaling it down on the basis of the untraceable nature of the ""NIS special activities fund"".  Rep. Choi Kyoung-hwan of the Liberty Korea Party Choi held the post, which doubles as deputy prime minister, from 2014-2015.The raid is part of a far-reaching probe into a massive scandal at the NIS involving the ousted President Park Geun-hye and her two aides. Prosecutors have alleged that the NIS paid Park and her aides at least 4 billion won from its coffers, until months before she was forced out of office over an influence-peddling scandal. Two former NIS chiefs have been arrested for arranging the illegal payments. Lee Byung-kee, one of the two arrested, apparently told the prosecution that he approved the NIS payment to Choi when he was the director in Oct. 2014.

Former NIS chiefs Nam Jae-joon , Lee Byung-kee Prosecutors had sought warrants for the two and another former NIS head Lee Byung-ho, claiming the three had given a total of 4 billion won  to senior presidential aides. But the court did not grant the warrant for Lee Byung-ho as it saw the accused as not presenting any risk of flight or destruction of evidence. The three led the nation’s spy agency from 2013 to 2017 under jailed former President Park Geun-hye. They are suspected of regularly channeling funds to Park and the presidential office. Prosecutors believe the money was used for illegal political activities and also for personal use. While admitting that they had handed over large sums to presidential aides on a monthly basis, the three claimed they did so upon the request of Cheong Wa Dae and that they could not deny the presidential office.Lee Byung-ho, who has not been arrested, was the last chief to serve under the former government. It is believed that the largest sum -- 2 billion won -- was given to presidential aides during his term from March 2015 to June this year. But he maintained that he was simply following the custom that had begun before he was appointed. Nam was in office from March 2013 to May 2014, while Lee Byung-kee worked from July 2014 to February the following year. The money came from the intelligence agency’s allotted budget dubbed as the “special activities fund” and it was given regularly to presidential aides with close ties to Park. According to prosecutors, the practice is likely to have been started by Nam.The special activities fund is said to be over 500 billion won each year. But the NIS is not required to disclose how the money is spent. It is not audited or scrutinized by the National Assembly, as the budget is intended to finance the most covert operations that require confidentiality.Prosecutors are also looking into the possibility of lawmakers close to the former conservative leader receiving bribes from the spy agency. It has been alleged that Park loyalist and conservative heavyweight Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party received 100 million won from the NIS. Choi, a four-term lawmaker, served as deputy prime minister for economy in 2014. Choi has denied the allegations.The report comes a day after incumbent NIS chief Suh Hoon told the parliamentary intelligence committee that he did not confirm reports that a number of lawmakers also received money from the NIS. During the intelligence committee meeting, chief lawmaker Rep. Kim Byung-kee said the National Assembly will start looking thoroughly into the details of the agency’s budget use.

The Seoul High Court found Kang, also a former finance minister under the Lee Myung-bak government, guilty of pressuring the government to designate a biotech firm run by his friend as a business partner and provide 6.6 billion won  in state subsidies in late 2009.  Former Korea Development Bank Chairman Kang Man-soo is seen in the photo filed Nov. 17, 2017. In May, he received a four-year jail term by the lower court. He was ordered to forfeit 90 million won and pay 50 million won in fines. The appellate court lowered the amount of the additional charge to 80 million won, while retaining the amount of the fine. The court overturned the previous ruling and found him guilty of coaxing Nam Sang-tae, then CEO of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., into investing big in his friend's company in return for exerting influence for Nam when he was implicated in a massive accounting fraud scandal that broke out at the shipbuilder. Prosecutors indicted Kang late last year. The KDB is the largest shareholder of Daewoo Shipbuilding. The appeals court also convicted him of coercing two brokerage firms into paying donations to seven conservative lawmakers in 2012, a charge that was cleared by the lower court. The court berated Kang for not admitting to his guilt and continuing to make excuses in breach of his duty to maintain fairness and responsibility as a high-profile public figure.  ""Most of the state funds have not been recouped and the damage is substantial. And yet  is denying the liabilities by saying that they were fair decisions made within the boundary of his power for business purposes,"" the court said.

Lee is one of three NIS directors under Park, and prosecutors requested court warrants Tuesday to arrest the other two -- Nam Jae-joon and Lee Byong-ho -- over the same charges. The three are accused of providing money from the agency's coffers to close aides to Park on a monthly basis between 2013 and mid-2016 totaling about 4 billion won . Prosecutors suspect the money may have been channeled into a secret fund belonging to Park.They also think that the amount of monthly payments doubled to about 100 million won when Lee Byung-kee and Lee Byong-ho headed the NIS from about 50 million won when Nam was leading the agency. The three reportedly told prosecutors the payments were made at the request of Cheong Wa Dae.Prosecutors are considering questioning the ex-president over the allegations.Park has been jailed at the Seoul Detention Center since March on bribery and other charges in a massive corruption scandal that led to her removal from office.","prosecutors seek arrest warrant ,prosecutors seek arrest ,prosecutors sought an arrest ,arrest warrant for former ,on wednesday over allegations","['the National Intelligence Service', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Lee Byung - kee', 'NIS', 'Lee', 'NIS']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.13300081  0.65164161

His aide, Yoon, is suspected of forcing Lotte to make the donation in exchange for a promise not to take issue with Lotte's license renewal.In a message sent to reporters later in the day, Jun refuted the prosecution's claim over the 300 million-won donation.""The license renewal had already been done with in late April.

The court also retained the prison terms for Choi Kyung-hee, the former Ewha Womans University president, and Kim Kyoung-sook and Namkung Gon, two former professors at the university who complied with Choi's requests. Choi and Kim were sentenced to two years in jail, while Namkung was given one and a half years in the initial June ruling. This composite photo, filed June 23, 2017, shows the six defendants accused of committing irregularities to help the daughter of Choi Soon-sil , former President Park Geun-hye`s confidante, with university admissions. Clockwise from top center are former Ewha Womans University President Choi Kyung-hee; Prof. Kim Kyoung-sook; former head of admissions Namkung Gon; and Profs. Rhu Cheol-kyun and Lee In-seong. Two other professors accused of similar charges -- Rhu Cheol-kyun and Lee In-seong -- were given suspended terms with fines, all in line with the previous verdicts. The court also ruled the same initial verdicts for three other professors for their involvement in the collusion.Prosecutors indicted the defendants for conspiring in getting Chung, an equestrian athlete, accepted into Ewha as a gifted player. Her mother Choi is believed to have demanded professors give her daughter grades for papers she never submitted and exams that she never took.The court ruled that the defendants ""ignored the law and legal procedures, and principles and rules, as well as betraying trust and credibility over fairness and justice."" It rebuked Choi as a parent who ""let her child learn the logic of power as opposed to principles and rules"" and the rest as educators that ""taught students to be fair and just while in fact they easily gave themselves into illegalities and expediency."" ""Therefore, the court cannot but hold the defendants accountable for their misdeeds,"" it said.This scandal was one of Choi's many alleged wrongdoings that triggered moves towards Park's impeachment late last year. She was removed from office upon a Constitutional Court ruling on March 10, and is also standing trial over a string of charges including bribery.","court three year prison ,her daughter the seoul ,corruption scandal that stripped ,three year prison term ,daughter an appellate court","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Choi', 'Ewha Womans Unive']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15474832 -0.03244135

She was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in 2010 after having worked at a Samsung semiconductor plant in central South Korea from 1997 to 2003.""If the likelihood of developing a brain tumor at semiconductor workplaces like the one in this case is significantly higher compared with the average likelihood of developing the disease among all Koreans or among those in the age brackets similar to the deceased, it can work as a factor contributing to recognizing the causal relationship between the work and the disease,"" the court said. ""It cannot be concluded that there is no link between the work and the brain tumor just because the deceased was diagnosed with brain cancer seven years after leaving the company,"" it said.Lee filed the suit in 2011 after the Korean Workers' Compensation & Welfare Service, a government agency that compensates industrial disaster victims, refused to cover her medical treatment, saying there was no link between her illness and the work carried out at the factory.After her death a year later, her family took over as plaintiffs.In the first trial, the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of Lee, saying she developed the disease after prolonged exposure to harmful substances such as benzene, lead, formaldehyde and extremely low frequency magnetic fields. It marked the first time a brain tumor was recognized as a work-related disease at a semiconductor plant.But the Seoul High Court overturned the verdict, saying that there was no basis to believe that stress and overwork caused the brain cancer and that it's difficult to recognize the causal relationship between work and the disease in light of the fact that she was diagnosed with the disease seven years after leaving work.","death of former samsung ,court on tuesday struck ,late former samsung worker ,lee died in 2012 ,worker from brain tumor","['the Supreme Court', 'Samsung Electronics', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Samsung', 'Lee Yun - jeong', 'Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05594197  0.11521321

This composite file photo, dated June 8, 2017, shows ex-Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo  and Hong Wang-sun, former head of the National Pension Service fund management division. The court also retained the lower court's two and a half year sentence on Hong Wan-sun, then-head of the NPS asset management division, on charges of dereliction of duty. He is accused of inflicting losses on the pension fund by ordering the merger's approval. The higher court acknowledged the prosecution's argument that Moon was well aware that the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae had a keen interest in the Samsung merger, as a former presidential secretary testified.Moon has claimed that he knew nothing about Cheong Wa Dae getting its fingers into the deal and that the argument had been accepted by the lower court. ""Notwithstanding the alleged pressure from Cheong Wa Dae, it does not acquit the defendant of the liabilities in which he forced NPS staff into duties that they had no obligation to do,"" the court said.

The case sparked public criticism of the couple and the court has considered what disciplinary measure should be given her.According to the related law, courts can punish judges with suspension, reduction in salaries and other disciplinary measures if they violate or neglect their duties, engage in demeaning acts or hurt a court's prestige. But after about a month internal inspection, the court decided to issue a verbal warning.""Judge Sul's act is not subject to punishment under the domestic law, and the child abuse charges were dropped and the time the children were left alone was less than 20 minutes instead of 45 minutes originally known.

Former President Park Geun-hye Former National Intelligence Service chiefs under the Park administration allegedly abused the agency’s “special activities” budget, which investigators suspect was an illicit channel for bribes for Park.Intended to finance the most covert operations, the special activities fund is not audited and scrutinized by the National Assembly. If proven to be true, the allegations could add new charges to Park, who has been detained in a solitary cell since she was arrested in March on a total of 18 charges including corruption and abuse of power. On Friday, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office summoned former NIS chief Lee Byung-ho, who headed the agency from 2015-2017, for questioning.Lee’s predecessor, Nam Jae-joon, who held the position from 2013 to 2014, was summoned earlier Wednesday over the same allegation. On Monday, Lee Byung-kee will be the third former spy chief to face grilling.All three worked under Park and are suspected of illegally providing a total of 4 billion won  to former presidential secretaries from 2013 until last year through the agency’s secret account. Those accused of taking the NIS’ money are Ahn Bong-geun, Lee Jae-man and Jeong Ho-seong who are also under investigation.Prosecutors suspect that the money might have been raised for a slush fund for Park. The crackdown on the NIS came after prosecutors received testimonies by the three former presidential secretaries that Park had ordered them to regularly take illicit cash from the agency. Part of the money is suspected to have been used to pay for Park’s beauty treatments and clothing. Prosecutors are expected to search her residence in the southern part of Seoul soon to trace the whereabouts of the 4 billion won.The probe is among several ongoing investigations into irregularities committed under the Park and Lee Myung-bak administrations. Prosecutors are also looking into allegations that the spy agency blacklisted media professionals deemed unfriendly to former President Lee. The NIS Reform Committee -- a body launched by President Moon Jae-in -- also concluded that the agency masterminded a smear campaign on social media against left-wing Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in the 2011 mayoral election. Nam Kyoung-kook, a constitutional scholar at the University of Seoul Law School, said it is just a matter of time before prosecutors question Park Geun-hye, who is now under detention and on trial. “A key question is whether Park was behind the scheme to amass slush funds from the NIS -- and her former presidential secretaries’ testimonies now suggest she was. But the funds are state-owned, and it would be difficult to add additional bribery charges if no favors were given to the secretaries. Her new charges could be loss of state funds and abuse of power,” Nam said.By Bak Se-hwan","face new bribery charges ,scandal involving former president ,new bribery charges in ,new bribery charges ,peddling scandal involving former","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.21370834  0.29613638

But conservatives have dismissed the endeavors as ""political retribution.""Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party, sharpened her rhetoric against Lee."" was a breach of national order and a case that trampled upon the constitutional order,"" she said during a party meeting.

Moon's presidential campaign filed a complaint against Song in April on possible charges of defamation, leaking confidential information, and violation of laws regarding presidential documents and elections. It claimed that Song's memoir contained false accusations that Moon exerted influence to prevent South Korea from voting for a UN resolution on North Korea's human rights. Moon was then chief of staff for President Roh Moo-hyun.Song, who took the ministry's helm from 2006-2008, wrote in his memoir that the government asked the North of its opinion before it decided to abstain from the UN vote. Prosecutors verified Moon aides' claim that Cheong Wa Dae had made up its mind before it talked with the North. But it also concluded that it was difficult to charge Song with defamation, since there are sufficient grounds to believe that he had been misled about the situation. Prosecutors also said Song could not be charged with revealing government secrets since the documents published in the memoir are neither original nor recent enough to constitute a violation of such law. Moon became the president in May, following the ousting of his predecessor Park Geun-hye over an influence-peddling and corruption scandal. The book, published only weeks before the May presidential vote, sparked a huge controversy and fierce attacks on Moon from his rivals, who accused him and the Roh government of secretly communicating with Pyongyang about the vote.","memoir prosecutors acquitted former ,with memoir prosecutors acquitted ,prosecutors acquitted former foreign ,memoir prosecutors acquitted ,2007 moon presidential campaign","['Song Min', 'Moon Jae - in', 'UN', 'North Korea', 'Moon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5629015   0.35849398

Prosecutors suspect the ex-presidential secretaries took bribes from the National Intelligence Service between 2013 and 2016 under the Park administration. Prosecutors searched 10 locations, including residences of Ahn, Lee, three former chiefs of NIS -- Nam Jae-joon, Lee Byung-ki and Lee Byung-ho -- and former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, as part of the investigation into the alleged bribery. The prosecution said it will question Ahn and Lee over why they received money from the NIS’ officials and how they used it. It did not confirm the amount of the bribes, but said it was enough for the court to issue an apprehension warrant for them.Lee Hun-soo, a former senior official at the spy agency, was said to have testified earlier during questioning that the spy agency had given 1 billion won each year , totaling 4 billion won, to key officials at the presidential office since Park took office. The money was from the agency‘s budget allotted for “special activities,” such as probes requiring confidentiality for security reasons. For such reasons, money for special activities could be spent without proving how or why it was used. Ahn and Lee, along with now-jailed former presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong, have been dubbed the “doorknob trio” due to their close ties to Park. They had served Park since she entered politics in 1998. As they were presidential secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae during Park’s presidency, there was speculation they had been closely involved in the process of leaking state secrets to Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil and helping her meddle in state affairs.But Ahn and Lee did not face an investigation for their alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. They were indicted without detention in July only for refusing to appear at last year’s parliamentary hearing on the scandal.Jeong, accused of leaking presidential documents to Choi, is awaiting a court ruling, scheduled for Nov. 15.In connection with allegations ex-President Park took bribes from local conglomerates in the form of donations to entities controlled by Choi and let Choi interfere with state affairs, many of Park’s ex-presidential secretaries, ex-ministers and business tycoons have been investigated, arrested and are now also standing trial. Park herself was removed from power in March, following months of massive rallies demanding her resignation or removal over the scandal. She faces 18 charges, including bribery, extortion and abuse of power under detention. Choi is also being tried on charges of bribery and extortion.The investigation into the corruption allegations, which surfaced late last year, is still ongoing under the Moon Jae-in administration, with a new focus on the NIS. The spy agency under former President Lee Myung-bak, Park’s predecessor, is suspected of having meddled in the 2012 presidential election to help Park win the race. The agency is also being probed for allegedly drawing up a blacklist of liberal artists deemed critical of the Lee government and implementing it to discriminate against them. It is also suspected of sponsoring pro-government civic groups to mobilize them in favor of conservative administrations. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea called for a thorough investigation into Ahn and Lee, while the main opposition parties said the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration should also be subject to a probe. “Ahn and Lee monopolized absolute power, but they were not held legally accountable. For their private interests, they destroyed the public system,” said Rep. Cho Eung-chun of the Democratic Party during a parliamentary audit on Tuesday.“Beyond political bias, there should be a fair investigation in accordance with legitimate procedures. The ex-NIS chief Kim Man-bok under the Roh administration should also be probed,” Rep. Oh Sin-hwan of the minor opposition and conservative Bareun Party said.","aides apprehended on bribery ,aides to ousted president ,bribery allegations two key ,apprehended on bribery allegations ,bribes from state spy","['Park Geun - hye', 'Ahn Bong - geun', 'Lee Jae - manthe', 'Ahn Bong - geun', 'Lee Jae - man', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.15928237 -0.09318675

Ahn Bong-geun and Lee Jae-man, the closest aides to Park, were taken into custody on an urgent warrant approved by a court, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said. They are suspected of regularly receiving money from then National Intelligence Service officials when they worked at Cheong Wa Dae between 2013 and 2016.Ahn served as Park's personal aide and communications secretary, and Lee was in charge of general affairs of the presidential secretariat.  This composite photo, filed Sept. 1, 2017, shows two former presidential secretaries of ex-leader Park Geun-hye -- Ahn Bong-geun  and Lee Jae-man.

Shin was indicted in October last year on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He is accused of paying 50 billion won in wages to people who never worked for the company and of inflicting about 130 billion won in losses on some Lotte affiliates by forcing them to cover the losses of other subsidiaries. The prosecution also requested the court sentence his brother Shin Dong-joo, former vice chairman of Japan-based Lotte Holdings, to five years; and it asked for seven years each for his imprisoned sister Shin Young-ja and his father's mistress Seo Mi-kyung over similar charges. Prosecutors asked the court to fine the chairman 100 billion won  and the other three members between 12.5 billion won to 220 billion won.The prosecution claimed the Shin family ""has accumulated a tremendous amount of wealth through illegal means, and the chairman privatized company assets for the sake of his family's own interests."" The defendants have mostly denied the charges, arguing that all the decisions were made by Lotte founder Shin Kyuk-ho and they had no choice but to follow their father's directions.They also claimed that some of the decisions were intended to salvage the affiliate from going belly up and asked for consideration be given to the crisis in the business stemming from Seoul's diplomatic row with Beijing over the THAAD defense system.""I'm deeply sorry for causing concerns,"" the chairman said. ""If I'm given another chance, I'll do everything I can to turn Lotte into a more transparent company as I've realized that a firm belongs to its investors and is not something that the owner possesses."" The court is due to announce its sentence on the Shin family on Dec. 22.The elder Shin, 95, has been on trial separately over similar charges. The prosecution is set to deliver its sentencing demand for him later in the week.Chairman Shin has also been standing trial in another case over the massive corruption scandal involving ousted President Park Geun-hye and her close friend Choi Soon-sil.

The firm's head, only identified by his last name Chang, claimed that Lee pulled the strings through Kim to have BBK, an investment advisory firm run by Korean-American Kim Kyung-joon, pay 14 billion won  to DAS, an auto parts manufacturer in which Lee's elder brother owns a controlling stake.  Chang insists that the money was to be paid to his company for recovery of the losses, but it was given to DAS because Lee hampered the transaction process. DAS had apparently invested about 19 billion won in BBK. The investigation draws attention as it could lead to the reopening of a high-profile stock manipulation case in BBK, for which its head Kim was convicted and served a prison term. Allegations at that time were that Kim fixed the stock price of Optional Ventures, a subsidiary of BBK, pocketed millions of dollars in illegal profits and embezzled hundreds of billions of won in company money in the early 2000s. Lee had been alleged to be the real owner of BBK, although suspicions were never substantiated in the prosecution probe launched then. However, fresh allegations arose recently after local media reported that Lee's son, Si-hyung, has been appointed as head of some of DAS' China-based units and that the former consul-general had attended an emergency meeting at DAS.","summoned local businessman monday ,prosecutors summoned local businessman ,businessman monday for questioning ,probe involving ex president ,prosecution calls in businessman","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Optional Capital', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Lee', 'Consul', 'Kim Jae - soo', 'Los Ange']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22969745  0.27320814

YonhapA suspect, surnamed Heo, was arrested Thursday hours after he admittedly killed NCsoft founder and CEO Kim Taek-jin’s father-in-law near the victim’s home in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province. The suspect attested to the killing, but said it was accidental following a dispute with the victim, known only by his surname Yoon, over parking. However, police investigators have found suspicious circumstances that may indicate planning. Heo was spotted on CCTV entering the victim’s property a day before the murder.

He is accused of having treated the six cruelly at the hotel for soldiers and their families near the Marine Corps Command in Hwaseong, south of Seoul, this year.Since he was assigned to the hotel early this year, the non-commissioned officer has allegedly committed various acts deemed to be harsh, including holding the men's tongues with a pair of tongs, and beating their heads and elbows with a baseball bat, the official said. Testimonies obtained from the victims prompted the military investigators to look into the case as a possible crime.Twenty officers and soldiers work at the hotel, which is equipped with a restaurant, a beer hall, guest rooms and a public bathroom. The soldiers man the front desk, serve food at the restaurant and maintain the hotel's facilities.Military authorities were alerted to the case Saturday and sent military police to the hotel. During the investigation, some officers were found to have personally used liquor worth 2 million won .In August, the Marine Corps' audit office learned about the case after some soldiers at the hotel gave testimony about the non-commissioned officer's harsh acts against them. But it did not launch a probe into the case.The military authorities dismissed a major in charge of the audit and are interrogating him about the failure of the probe. Four officers at the hotel, also dismissed from their positions, are under investigation.Since Tuesday, the Marine Corps has implemented a complete checkup on its five hotels to see if there are any similar cases.

The prosecution presented initial police reports, Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency’s forensic investigative reports on testing of a tumbler IED device and the victim’s photos during treatment of burns as evidence.  Kim’s lawyers, however, insisted on the “lack of evidence” of an explosion and instead described the parcel bomb as “bursts of small flames.” They also tried invalidating the professor’s seriousness of injury and stated that Kim had only caused minor injuries to the victim.

CNN cited a report written by her international legal team from global consultancy MH Group, saying Park is living in a cell that is “dirty, cold and constantly lit so she cannot sleep.” “Park is being held in a cell of an appropriate size with a heating system, TV, drawer and a flush toilet, among other things,” the Justice Ministry said. “During sleeping hours, we reduce the light to the extent that  movement can be observed. Two out of three lights are turned off.” Park has been detained in a solitary cell at Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, since she was arrested on March 31. She is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power in connection with the corruption scandal that removed her from power in March. The ministry also denied CNN reports that said Park is not receiving proper treatment despite her suffering from a handful of chronic conditions including lower back pain, osteoarthritis in her knee and shoulder joints, chronic fatigue due to adrenal insufficiency, as well as malnutrition at the detention facility.“We are guaranteeing proper and sufficient medical treatment  by allowing her to receive treatment from in-house medical staff at any time and allowing her to get treatment twice at outside medical facilities,” it said.Park has been receiving treatment out of prison at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital. She had not attended her own hearings on three occasions in July, citing pain in her toes. The detention center also added that she is provided with meals on a regular basis and a chance to exercise on a regular basis, as well as an extra folding mattress, given her back pain. The allegations raised by MH Group are in stark contrast to public sentiment. The public has criticized the detention center for granting special treatment to the former president, as it was revealed that she had been allowed to stay at a larger cell alone. Detention center officials did not confirm the exact size of her cell, but her solitary cell is said to be about 6.56 square meters in size. It was a cell used to house six to seven inmates, but was remodeled exclusively for her use. She stayed in an office at the detention facility for two days while her room was being prepared.For most other inmates, six to seven people are allegedly held in a 12.01-square-meter cell. Like other cells, Park’s cell comes with a TV, folding mattress, drawer, desk, sink and a flushing toilet, according to the detention facility. Like other inmates, she eats 1,440-won meals with three to four side dishes, and sleeps on a foldable mattress. Two former presidents, prominent politicians and business tycoons have also been sent to solitary cells to separate them from other inmates and ensure their safety. Rep. Roh Hoe-chan, floor leader of the minor progressive Justice Party, has raised allegations that Park had received “king-like” treatment early this month, ahead of the court’s decision on whether to extend her detention. According to the document he obtained from the Justice Ministry, he said that Park had received the privilege to use a 10.08-square-meter room, five times bigger than a cell for ordinary inmates, despite the nation’s correctional facilities housing 20 percent more inmates than allowed due to a lack of space. “The right to consult with a lawyer is the defendant’s right, but it is hard to imagine meeting with a lawyer once a day for ordinary inmates due to attorney fees,” he said, noting that Park has met with her lawyer more than once a day since she was arrested. Over her 135-day detention as of Aug. 24, she met with her lawyers 138 times. She had a meeting with detention center officials 24 times and with Lee Kyung-sik, head of the center, 12 times, the document showed.He said that it shows the reality of “privilege” that those with money and power, unconcerned with lawyer fees, can enjoy.Whenever such allegations of “special treatment” for Park surfaced, the detention center had said that it had done so out of respect for the former president. MH Group plans to submit the document on her situation in prison to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Wednesday, CNN reported. The OHCHR is set to conduct a routine review on South Korea’s human rights early next month. With Park’s trial still underway, a Seoul court extended her custody by another six months Friday, citing the possibility of her destroying evidence. Park called her trial “political revenge in the name of the rule of the law.” “The past six months have been a terrible and miserable time,” Park said. “It is meaningless to believe that the court will handle the case only in accordance with the Constitution and conscience despite political winds and public pressure.” Her local lawyers quit en masse in protest, taking issue with the fairness of the trial Monday. The local defense team is distinct from MH Group, a global legal firm that deals with high-profile international legal and diplomatic cases. It formerly represented Saif Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan leader.MH Group called the decision “excessive” and “unduly harsh,” saying Park is ailing and needs proper medical treatment out of custody. “It is most unfortunate that the court has held that Ms Park must remain in custody when there are no legitimate lawful grounds for depriving her of her liberty while her trial continues,” MH Group said in a statement. “Under accepted international standards, detention is the exception. It should only be ordered when absolutely necessary as persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Park stands accused of colluding with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to take bribes worth 43.3 billion won  from large conglomerates, including Samsung Group. Other charges include coercion and leaking government secrets.By Ock Hyun-ju","for corruption charges cnn ,wednesday denied former president ,corruption charges cnn ,corruption charges cnn cited ,jailed ex president","['the Justice Ministry', 'Park Geun - hye', 'CNN', 'MH Group', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.34317872  0.52305257

In November 2015, Baek Nam-ki fell unconscious after he was shot directly by a police water cannon during an anti-government rally. The farmer in his 60s was in a coma before he died of acute renal failure in September 2016. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office indicted Goo Eun-soo, then-commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Shin Yun-kyun, then-chief of the 4th riot squad, and two low-level officers who operated the water cannon.  They will face trial without detention. The prosecution claimed that their negligence of duty was responsible for the farmer's death, which stirred up a huge public uproar against the police's excessive use of force on protesters.A probe found the riot police had failed to follow rules that ban the firing of water cannons directly at a person above the chest. Baek was hit directly in the head by the high pressure jet. It accused the police of neglecting their duty to use force with the utmost caution. The probe also revealed that a device that controls the water pressure was malfunctioning at the time, raising the possibility that it could have been fired at a pressure exceeding the legal limit.The police agency denied responsibility, saying it had followed every legal procedure.  The prosecution did not file charges against Kang Sin-myeong, national police chief at the time of the incident, saying he was not directly involved in the operation. Baek's family expressed regret over the probe result, insisting that Kang should also be held accountable. They called on the prosecution to hasten its investigation into Seoul National University Hospital over alleged doctoring of its initial report on Baek's death, which stated he died from an illness.

YonhapEstablishing the organization, the idea of which has floated for two decades, needs to be approved by the National Assembly. Under the Justice Ministry’s plans, the organization will also be given powers similar to that of the public prosecutors’ office, including the power to investigate and of indictment.The Ministry of Justice, however, said that a committee comprised of outside personnel will be established to review decisions concerning indictments in order to prevent the new organization abusing its powers. Under the plans, the organization will include less than 25 public prosecutors, 30 investigators and less than 20 administrative positions. The chief and deputy chief of the organization will have single, three-year terms. Prosecutors working in the organization will have terms of three years, which can be renewed three times. The organization will be responsible for investigating criminal allegations against incumbent high level government officials and their families, including the president. The organization will also be tasked with investigating former officials and their families for corruption for up to two years after they step down from their posts. Other government posts that come under the jurisdiction of the organization include members of the National Assembly, prime minister, chief and justices of the Supreme Court, prosecutor general, and top military and police officers.

Former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun are escorted to the courtroom at the Seoul Central District Court to attend their sentencing hearing on July 27. YonhapThe Seoul High Court on Tuesday will begin appeal trials for Park’s ex-chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and other former presidential secretaries, including Kim Sang-ryul, who were sentenced to prison by a lower court in July over their involvement in the blacklist scandal. Former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun will also stand trial in the appeal in the same week. Cho was acquitted of her charges related to the scandal, but received a one-year jail term suspended for two years for perjury as she was convicted of lying before the National Assembly at a blacklist scandal hearing last year. The lower court ruled on July 27 that Kim and other government officials had orchestrated a systematic discrimination against nearly 10,000 leftwing artists, writers and filmmakers whose work appeared unfriendly to the conservative Park administration, cutting them off from state funding. Kim, who received a three-year term for ordering presidential staff members and Culture Ministry officials to make the blacklist, immediately appealed the ruling, saying his scheme was to keep a balance in state support for progressive and conservative artists.The blacklist is part of a massive corruption and abuse-of-power scandal that dismissed Park from office in March. Park herself is on trial over accusations that she took and solicited some 59.2 billion won  in bribes from large business groups, including Samsung in collusion with her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil. The case also led hundreds of those on the list to file a lawsuit against the former administration seeking compensation. The ex-leader, who was arrested on March 31 and indicted on April 17 on a total of 18 charges, has since been detained at a correction facility in a southern suburb of Seoul. Park will continue to stand trial under detention until the first verdict is reached expectedly around mid-November. Also on Thursday, the court is set to bring Park’s other former senior presidential secretary, Ahn Chong-bum, to the stand in the former president’s hearing to hear witness testimony. It is Ahn’s first time to take the stand against Park since he was arrested and indicted on Nov. 20 last year. Ahn allegedly carried out Park’s order to push forward with pressuring local conglomerates into paying donations to two new non-profit groups -- the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- effectively controlled by Park and Choi.

The Seoul Central District Court said there is the “possibility of her destroying evidence,” issuing an additional warrant to extend her detention for another six months. Her six-month detention order was set to expire Monday. Ousted former President Park Geun-hye leaves a Seoul court on Friday. State prosecutors last month asked the court to extend her detention, citing the possibility of Park refusing to turn up at hearings or attempting to fabricate or destroy evidence. Park’s defense team, however, called for her immediate release, citing the principle of “innocent until proven guilty” and “investigation without detention.” Park stands accused of colluding with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to take bribes worth 43.3 billion won  from large conglomerates, including Samsung Group. Other charges include coercion and leaking government secrets. The court began to hear her case on May 23. It has held four hearings since June 1, summoning more than 70 witnesses. There are about 300 more witnesses to call in, including the heads of LG Group, GS and Hanjin Group. It is not certain whether a ruling on Park can be reached within this year. Other key figures at the center of the corruption scandal, including her confidante Choi, ex-presidential secretary An Chong-bum and former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon, also had their detentions extended by the court. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party blasted the decision, saying “the court yielded to political pressure” and calling it a “violation of human rights.” The conservative party and Park’s supporters have claimed the trial of Park has been politicized.The ruling Democratic Party of Korea and other minor parties welcomed the decision.Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong began his appeals trial a day earlier to overturn a five-year jail sentence on related charges. Lee was convicted of bribery, embezzlement and other charges for bribing Park in return for political favors on Aug. 25.Park, in return for the bribes, is suspected of pressuring the nation’s state-run pension agency to back the 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates, which was seen as a vital step for Lee to tighten his control over the conglomerate.

The documents included a daily journal of the crisis management office, which indicated the first report of the accident to Park was made at 9:30 a.m. the day of the accident that left 304 people killed or missing, instead of 10 a.m. as earlier claimed by Park and her aides.""The reason they pushed back the time of the first report to the president by half an hour appears to have been an attempt to reduce the time between the first report and Park's first order, said to have been made at around 10:15 a.m.,"" Chief of Staff Im Jong seok said Thursday.Im noted that the 45-minute gap between the first report and the first order may be seen as a failure.""Considering that every minute mattered on the day of the accident, it makes us think a lot,"" he said.The documents also showed Park's top security adviser Kim Kwan-jin may have ordered an illegal revision of the government manual on crisis management to place the responsibility of handling accidents, such as the Sewol ferry sinking, on the Ministry of the Interior and Safety instead of Cheong Wa Dae as originally stated.Im said the revision was made in July 2014, shortly after then-presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon testified before the National Assembly that Park and the presidential office did not have responsibility for dealing with the tragic accident in the first place.Cheong Wa Dae officials have said the revision of the government guidelines for crisis management and then delivering them to all government offices may constitute falsification of official documents and abuse of power.  Such an amendment requires legal procedures, including a review and approval by the government legislation ministry.Those subject to prosecution investigation included the former presidential chief of staff and Kim Kwan-jin, then head of the National Security Office  and vice chairman of the NSC, a Cheong Wa Dae official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Im earlier said the former NSO chief is believed to have ordered what he called an ""illegal"" revision of the government manual on crisis management.The presidential office also asked the prosecution to question Shin In-ho, then head of the crisis management office at Cheong Wa Dae, and others involved in the alleged manipulation of official documents and crafting false reports.""What exactly they may have violated will be determined by the prosecution following their investigation,"" the official said.","presidential office on friday ,deadly sinking of passenger ,the government mishandling ,friday requested the prosecution ,sinking of passenger ship","[""Park Geun - hye 's"", ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.65166926  0.21065889

Park was ousted from office and arrested in March on charges of bribery and abuse of power in connection with an influence-peddling scandal. Her six-month arrest warrant expires Monday. An additional warrant by the Seoul Central District Court can place Park under detention for up to another six months in accordance with the local code of criminal procedures.   Former President Park Geun-hye is escorted by a guard as she arrives at the courthouse in southern Seoul to attend trial in a bribery and corruption case on Oct. 10, 2017. Prosecutors asked the court to extend her detention late last month, saying it won't be able to finish courtroom interrogations of witnesses in the given time. Friday's trial is the 80th session of the court proceedings that began in May. They pointed out that if Park is released, there is a high chance that she will not appear in the trial, which will seriously hinder the progress of the trial at the center of public interest. Park stands accused of colluding with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, who has been also detained, in taking some 43 billion won  from top conglomerates, including Samsung, and letting her meddle in state affairs. The prosecution has claimed an additional warrant is possible based on the bribery charges related to two other conglomerates -- SK and Lotte. Park's legal counsel has opposed the extension, saying it is not necessary for a trial that is coming to an end. They also asked the court to take into account her health issues. Park has been allowed out twice for medical treatment for a toe injury and back pains.","six month arrest warrant ,ex president detention seoul ,arrest warrant expires monday ,her six month arrest ,month arrest warrant","['Seoul', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27092338  0.10104307

It allegedly includes key phrases Park used regarding Samsung Group, such as “simplification of management structure,” after she had a one-on-one meeting with Lee. Lee, Samsung Group’s de facto chief, is accused of asking for favors to tighten his control over Samsung Group in return for donations for entities controlled by Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil during the one-on-one meeting, which the court acknowledged as “tacit bribery.”The daughter of the “Molar daddy,“ accused of assisting her father to dispose of the body of her friend, allegedly killed by her father, arrives at the Seoul Northern District Court on Thursday for a hearing on her arrest warrant. She remains hospitalized after overdosing on sleeping pills together with her father. Whether the appeals court accepts the notebooks as evidence is seen as crucial to Lee’s fate, as they constitute the main sources of information to back the prosecution’s claims that Lee sought favors from then-President Park. Lee’s defense team said the notebook could not be accepted as evidence because Park, who had allegedly made the comments described in the notebook, could not confirm whether she actually had said the remarks. An was not present during the meeting. “An was not present at the meeting and took notes of what he heard from Park. Park has never confirmed that it is what she said and whether Park delivered exactly what was discussed during the meeting to An,” Lee’s lawyer said. “The notebook only displays a list of words without subjects or verbs,” Lee’s lawyer said. Park was asked to appear to testify in the first trial, but she refused. An earlier testified during a hearing on ex-Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo tied to the corruption scandal that what was written on his notebook was 100 percent what Park said. The criminal procedure law stipulates that testimony or evidence presented by a third party relying on what they saw or heard from others is not valid as evidence. Special Counsel, however, said that factual relations had been already constructed based on testimony made during court proceedings at a lower court and that the notebook, containing “indirect facts,” was valid as evidence. A lower court sentenced Lee to five years in jail on several charges, including bribery and embezzlement, acknowledging that he had anticipated support from Park. The Special Counsel asked the court to sentence him to 12 years in jail. Both sides appealed the decision.The main point of contention is whether Lee received favors from the Park administration in respect of Samsung Group’s leadership transfer from Lee’s ailing father, Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee, to himself.“Lee already secured a sufficient stake and took over the leadership, so there was no reason to push for the leadership transfer ,” Lee’s lawyer said. Lee has denied the charges, saying there were no favors to ask and the donations were made without his knowledge.The court found him guilty of providing 8.9 billion won  in kickbacks to a winter sports center controlled by Choi and to sponsor her daughter’s equestrian training, expecting Park to exert influence in backing the merger of two Samsung affiliates. Former President Park, in return for the alleged bribe, is suspected of having pressured the state-funded National Pension Service to vote in favor of the controversial merger, a crucial step for a smooth leadership succession from ailing Samsung Chairman Lee to his only soon Jae-yong. The largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, one of the two affiliates, was the NPS.“The succession plan was designed to inevitably maximize Lee’s own interest at the cost of its subsidiaries, shareholders and the subscribers of the national pension,” the prosecution said.The Special Counsel said that Lee was a main beneficiary from the money-for-favor scheme, saying it was “explicit bribery,” rather than being based on a tacit understanding.The counsel claimed that donations worth 22 billion won to the K-Sports Foundation and Mir Foundation -- to which other local firms also contributed money -- were also bribes, saying “Samsung was different” from other conglomerates in terms of its collusive ties to the former administration. Grim-faced, Lee walked into the courtroom at 10 a.m., wearing a black suit and carrying an envelope. It was his first public appearance since the lower court handed him a five-year prison term on Aug. 25. The corruption scandal, involving high-profile government officials and business tycoons, drove millions of people to the streets in protest late last year and led to former President Park Geun-hye’s removal from office in March.","state prosecutors clashed thursday ,bribery case samsung electronics ,bribery case samsung ,prosecutors clashed thursday ,prosecutors clashed thursday over","['Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Chong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.17494665  0.56316137

Former head of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser Korea and current CEO of Google Korea John Lee The court said while the ban would cause him “irreparable damage,” there is insufficient evidence to believe that allowing him to leave the country would adversely affect the public welfare.Thursday’s decision came after Lee who headed the local unit of the British company from 2005 to 2010 was acquitted of charges in connection to the company’s humidifier disinfectant products which were found to contain a toxic substance that causes permanent lung damage when inhaled. Lee was barred from leaving South Korea in May last year. The following month, state prosecutors demanded a 10-year jail term for Lee on charges of accidental homicide and falsely advertising the deadly products as being safe in the course of business operations. But the lower court found him not guilty in January this year, which was upheld on July 26 by an appeals court. Lee filed a petition to have the ban lifted in April this year.The toxic humidifier disinfectant scandal, which also involved several other household goods makers, came to the surface in 2011 when some pregnant women and young children died of what then appeared to be a mysterious lung disease.

A separate team searched the home of a former ranking defense ministry official, only identified by his last name Lim, it added.  The ministry's internal probe team earlier announced that the cyberwarfare command engaged in a broad covert political maneuver to sway public opinion in favor of the two previous conservative governments led by former Presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak. The two former commanders are accused of leading the operations between 2011 and 2013. Lim is suspected of being debriefed on the performance. The probe also found that the command regularly reported to the presidential office on their online activities. The justice ministry has banned former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin from leaving the country pending the investigation. The prosecution has been carrying out a sweeping investigation into allegations that government agencies, including the National Intelligence Service, illegally meddled in politics in support of conservatives under the two previous administrations.","prosecutors raided the residences ,prosecutors raid ex cyberwarfare ,political interference prosecutors raided ,interference prosecutors raided ,interference prosecutors raided the","[""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Yeon Je - wook']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26604554  0.64614445

Ha took out 651.4 billion won in loans and sold corporate debts based on the fraudulent balance sheet, they said.  Ha Seong-yong, former CEO of the Korea Aerospace Industries Co., is surrounded by reporters after arriving at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors` Office to face questioning over massive corruption and fraud at the company on Sept. 19, 2017. The 66-year-old stepped down as the CEO in July soon after the investigation began. Ha is also accused of embezzling about 7.3 billion won as bonuses, while siphoning at least 460 million won off company funds through buying gift vouchers in large quantities and ""laundering"" them in cash. The prosecution also believes he owns a major stake in KAI's subcontractor under a borrowed name.He was also solicited to recruit some 15 unqualified candidates into the company because they had special ties with influential people, such as politicians, military officials and a ranking public servant. He has denied any wrongdoing.In a statement released following Ha's indictment, the country's sole aircraft manufacturer made an apology to shareholders, investors and subcontractors. ""We will make an all-out effort to minimize the impact from the  scandal  and put our business and company back on track as soon as possible,"" KAI said in the statement.  Prosecutors have indicted a few KAI officials who were in charge of the key development projects for inflating the prices to gain illegal profits. KAI has been involved in aircraft manufacturing and selling their products, which are worth as much as 1 trillion won per deal, here and overseas. The government established KAI in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s by combining ailing private defense companies. It injected about 8 trillion won worth of taxpayer money to salvage the firm.","indicted wednesday on charges ,trial over corruption fraud ,faces trial over corruption ,bribery in major scandal ,over corruption fraud charges","['the Korea Aerospace Industries Co.', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'KAI']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05594686  0.10389749

Park, the first female president elected in South Korea, was expelled from power on March 10, arrested on March 31 and indicted on April 17 on a total of 18 charges. She has since been locked up in a solitary cell at a correction facility in a southern suburb of Seoul. Former President Park Geun-hye is escorted into the Seoul Southern District Court for a hearing. Her six-month detention ends next week. State prosecutors last month requested the court to issue an additional warrant to extend Park’s detention by another six months, citing her ongoing trial. Park’s attorneys, however, objected, citing her poor health.The ex-leader is accused of colluding with her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to take and solicit some 59.2 billion won  in bribes from large business groups, including Samsung. Other charges include abuse of power, coercion and leaking government secrets. A court verdict on Park is expected around mid-November. Samsung’s heir apparent Lee was given a five-year jail sentence on Aug. 25, as the court found him guilty of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee was accused of bribing Park and Choi to receive help for a controversial 2015 merger between the group’s two affiliates, which critics said was designed to strengthen Lee’s grip over the conglomerate. Lee denied any wrongdoing, saying the deal was to increase business competitiveness and that he had felt pressured by the then-president to make “donations” to certain entities, which were not meant to be bribes.

The Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office called in Won, who has been serving a four-year prison term for meddling in the 2012 presidential election, as a suspect to look into fresh allegations over his involvement in running an online smear campaign to influence public opinion and supporting the operation with state budget. Won, who served as the NIS chief from 2009-2013 under the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration, is at the heart of allegations surrounding the spy agency. Under Won’s direction, the spy agency is suspected of orchestrating an online smear campaign to help then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye to beat liberal candidate Moon Jae-in in the run-up to the 2012 election. It allegedly ordered some 50 “cyber” teams, consisting of psychological warfare agents and internet-savvy civilians, to post comments in favor of Park and critical of Moon online. Ex-President Park won the vote by a narrow margin. The prosecution was set to grill Won over allegations that he misappropriated state budget funds worth some 7 billion won  to support the cyber teams for the covert operation. Based on suspicions that Won had one-on-one meetings with Lee, prosecutors were to ask whether he received an order from then-President Lee and how often he reported to him. The probe is expanding to former President Lee, after Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and a group of cultural figures, who were on the Lee administration’s blacklist, filed a complaint against him. The ruling Democratic Party also called for a probe into Lee and his aides on Monday, claiming Lee had been the mastermind behind the spy agency’s alleged interference in domestic politics. The probe is gaining pace, with a team of 15 prosecutors looking into several accusations. The spy agency faces other allegations that it cracked down on Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who was a vocal critic of the Lee government, blacklisted left-wing cultural figures to deprive them of access to state-led projects, peddled influence over broadcasters and paid right-wing civic groups to hold rallies supporting the government. The prosecution summoned Shin Seung-kyun, a former official at the NIS, for questioning Tuesday and raided homes of two former NIS officials over allegations surrounding the blacklist a day earlier.After President Moon took office in May, the NIS formed a task force and conducted an internal probe into the agency’s alleged wrongdoings under the past conservative governments. The investigation into the NIS began after the task force released documents, presumably written under then-NIS chief Won’s direction. The documents showed that the NIS blacklisted 82 liberal artists and had plans to oppress Seoul Mayor Park and his policy. One of Moon’s key campaign pledges was to free the spy agency -- which is required to maintain political neutrality -- from political pressure and make its focus intelligence activities outside the country.","jailed ex spy chief ,tuesday amid sprawling investigation ,irregularities including election manipulation ,service for questioning tuesday ,jailed ex spy","['Won Sei - hoon', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'the National Intelligence Service']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23728673 -0.09474197

The prosecution made the request during a court hearing, saying it won't be able to finish courtroom interrogations of witnesses in the given time. Former President Park Geun-hye ""The defendant's case is the heart of the influence-peddling scandal. The defendant has denied all charges, and an additional investigation into evidence is needed,"" the prosecution said.Among other charges, Park stands accused of colluding with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in taking some 43 billion won  from top conglomerates including Samsung, and letting her meddle in state affairs.The prosecution claimed an additional warrant would be possible based on the bribery charges related to two other conglomerates -- SK and Lotte. If issued, Park can be detained for up to another six months. Yoo Yeong-ha, Park's lawyer, objected the prosecution's request, arguing that a warrant is not necessary for a case that is coming to an end.The court asked the prosecution and defendant to each submit a written statement regarding the additional arrest warrant for Park. The Seoul court has been on a tight schedule to proceed with Park's trial, which has been held four times a week since June. But too many witnesses -- some of whom refused to testify -- and Park's absence at a number of sessions due to health issues, have dragged the pace.

Her accomplice, surnamed Park, who had no direct part in the murder itself, was sentenced to life for acting as an accomplice. The court ordered them to each wear a location-tracking device for 30 years. The prosecution also requested the 20-year prison term for Kim and a life sentence for Park. In a rare move, the court fully accepted it without lowering the sentence. Under the law, murdering a person younger than 13 can lead to the death penalty or life imprisonment. But both Kim and Park are entitled to protections as minors under the juvenile law, as they are under 19 years old.The juvenile law stipulates that those aged under 18 can avoid a death penalty or life imprisonment. Kim, who is 17 years old, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, the maximum possible punishment. But her accomplice Park, 18, was not entitled to such a protection and was handed down a life sentence.According to the prosecution, Kim lured the girl to her place from a nearby park, telling her that she would let her use her phone as the girl was seeking to call her mother. Kim strangled the victim to death in her home, chopped the body into pieces and disposed of the body on her apartment’s rooftop in Incheon, west of Seoul, in late March. The court dismissed Kim’s claims that she had been in a “feeble-minded state” at the time of the crime. Kim’s defense team admitted to the charges, but asked for leniency, saying Kim suffered from Asperger’s syndrome, a type of autism, and multiple personality disorder. They said it was an “impulsive crime” without motive.The court acknowledged that Park was closely involved in the process. Before Kim murdered the victim, she sent a text message to Park, saying, “I am going out hunting.” After killing the victim, Kim told Park that she might have killed a girl. Park then texted Kim, saying, “Give me a piece of the corpse as a gift.” Kim gave Park part of the dismembered body in a paper bag, according to the prosecution.Kim, a high school dropout, initially claimed that she had acted alone. She later changed her statement and said Park, whom she met on social media, was the mastermind behind the murder and she only followed Park’s orders. The prosecution added murder to Park’s charges based on Kim’s testimony. Park has admitted to involvement in abandoning the body, but not to the murder. The case shocked the public for its cruelty and the young offenders’ apparent aloofness about the crimes they committed. It also triggered debate over whether sentencing guidelines giving leniency to underage offenders and those suffering from mental illness should be revised.By Ock Hyun-ju","for child murder teens ,friday for murdering ,imprisonment for child murder ,child murder teens local ,murder teens local court",['the Incheon District Court'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25642893 -0.05196276

According to police, the body of Kim In-sik, who was in charge of KAI’s overseas business as vice president, was found at his home in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province. A three-page suicide note was found near his body.  Kim’s death came a day after KAI Chief Executive Ha Sung-yong was arrested for accounting fraud. He is accused of directing the manipulation of financial records of the company‘s oversea projects and granting contracts to suppliers without a fair bidding process in return for kickbacks. “I have done my best, but it’s so unfortunate that things didn’t work out,” Kim said in the note, according to investigative officials. Kim had been a close aide to Ha since he joined the company in 2005 after leaving the Air Force as a brigadier general.Prosecutors on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for Ha, who had been detained without a warrant. Investigators are expected to focus on finding out whether Kim was involved in the charges circling Ha, who has denied most allegations.One of the allegations facing Ha is that that the company made at least 24 billion won  in illicit profits by inflating development costs for Surion utility helicopters, T-50 supersonic trainer jets and FA-50 light attack planes.The prosecution is also believed to be looking into the possibility that Ha embezzled about 1 billion won from the company’s funds by creating false documents. The money was allegedly doled out to Ha and the board members. Elected as KAI chief in 2013, Ha is also suspected of creating slush funds and inappropriately lobbying Cheong Wa Dae officials and lawmakers for his reappointment in May 2016, when former President Park Geun-hye was in power. Before joining KAI in 2005, Kim had assumed various posts in the Air Force, including commander of the 8th Fighter Wing and executive officer to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was also in charge of an aircraft procurement project in the Defense Acquisition Program Administration. He began his civilian career at KAI by working as a contractor in the United Arab Emirates. Since then, he has supervised most of the company’s overseas projects, including a deal to sell FA-50 jets to Iraq in 2013.

186,186,186, Prosecution opens probe into former leader Lee,"The prosecution on Wednesday began looking into a complaint filed against former President Lee Mung-bak that he masterminded the national spy agency’s alleged smear campaign against Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, then a vocal critic of him.

The former president has been under siege amid mounting accusations of alleged state-led irregularities during his 2009-2013 presidency, including the spy agency’s election manipulation and suppression of left-wing cultural figures. Former President Lee Myung-bak gets off a vehicle in front of his office in Gangnam, southern Seoul, Sept. 4. Ongoing prosecutorial investigations into these cases, however, are yet to reach Lee, despite suspicion that the former conservative leader may have been the one behind the illicit activities. But a direct inquiry of Lee now seems inevitable, as the mayor on Tuesday formally requested prosecutors to investigate him, along with 10 others including former National Intelligence Service director Won Sei-hoon, for possible charges of abuse of power, defamation and eavesdropping. More are set to follow suit, filing a complaint against Lee. Comedian Kim Mi-hwa and veteran actor and former lawmaker Moon Seong-guen on Wednesday made clear their intention to do so. The two are among the 82 figures allegedly blacklisted by the Lee government and unfairly deprived of access to various state-led projects.The NIS, under Lee as president and Won as chief, faces several seemingly grave allegations. It is accused of drawing up plans to suppress Seoul Mayor Park, then a human rights lawyer and civic activist; implementing a blacklist of cultural figures critical of the administration; and operating an online smear campaign to sway a 2012 presidential election in favor of then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye. An internal taskforce of the NIS has earlier revealed internal documents, presumably written under ex-NIS chief Won’s direction, which contained plans to crack down on Mayor Park and stymie his policy initiatives between 2009 and 2011. The taskforce was formed after liberal President Moon Jae-in took office in May to look into the intelligence body’s alleged interference in domestic politics. Moon won the election on a promise to eradicate “deep-rooted evil” laid bare by the corruption scandal that brought down former President Park Geun-hye. On Wednesday, the prosecution searched the residence of a former secretary general of an ultraright-wing civic group, which is suspected of receiving financial support from the NIS for holding rallies against the Seoul mayor. A separate fact-finding team under the Culture Ministry is looking into former President Park’s implementation of a similar blacklist aimed at disadvantaging liberal cultural figures. Ex-President Park, who succeeded Lee to elongate the conservative rule, was ousted from office in March following a sweeping corruption scandal. The prosecution is also investigating the election-meddling scandal surrounding the covert online operation by NIS personnel to help then-conservative presidential candidate Park Geun-hye beat her rival and incumbent President Moon. The prosecution is set to summon a NIS official, Lee Jong-myung, on Thursday. He was in charge of the secret operation at the spy agency under the order of former NIS chief Won, who was convicted of masterminding the online campaign to boost support for Park Guen-hye during his term between 2009 and 2013. Lee’s subordinate Min Byung-joo, leader of a psychological warfare unit, was arrested a day earlier for paying billions of state money to civilians to write comments and posts in favor of Park Geun-hye and critical of Moon on social media and news sites. Min already received a suspended term for the NIS’ interference in the 2012 election.According to the prosecution, the NIS ran about 30 “cyber teams” tasked with orchestrating the smear campaign, with each team composed of 20 to 30 NIS psychological warfare agents and internet-savvy civilians. Park Geun-hye defeated Moon by a narrow margin, to become the country’s first female president in the 2012 vote. She was removed from office over a corruption scandal, and is now detained while on trial facing charges including bribery and abuse of power.

Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon  filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office Tuesday, via his attorney, against a total of 11 -- former President Lee Myung-bak, former spy cheif Won Sei-hoon and nine others at the National Intelligence Service -- on possible charges of abuse of power, defamation and violation of NIS laws. YonhapThe liberal civic-activist-turned mayor filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office, via his attorney, against a total of 11 -- Lee, Won and nine others at the National Intelligence Service -- on possible charges of abuse of power, defamation and violation of NIS laws.This came after the NIS’ internal committee for reform last week confirmed the discovery of two documents detailing the spy agency’s covert scheme targeting Park, then a human rights lawyer. The documents were reportedly written under the then NIS chief Won’s direction.According to documents, the Lee government labeled Park pro-North Korea, and drafted internal reports on ways to block his political influence. The documents also contained ways to induce conservative civic groups to bolster their campaigns against Park’s key proposals and spread rumors online maligning him and his family from 2009-2011. Lee’s presidency lasted from 2008-2013. Park was elected Seoul mayor in 2011. Park said Tuesday that the NIS internal reports were evidence of political oppression not only against him and his family, but also against unemployed youths, non-regular workers who he sought to better protect and Seoul citizens as a whole. “Abuse of power must be stamped out as it hurts the foundation of democracy.  is not a move for the sake of the past, but one for a better future,” Park said.He demanded a thorough inquiry by prosecutors, insisting the covert operation against him must have continued throughout the Park Geun-hye administration. Park succeeded Lee in 2013, elongating the conservative rule. “Former President Lee abused his authority and power to spoil the national foundation and the essence of democracy,“ the mayor said.   Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon  and former President Lee Myung-bak Lee refused to comment. “We do not see the need for a response,” an aide was quoted by Yonhap News Agency. After liberal President Moon Jae-in took office in May, an internal NIS probe team was set up to investigate the covert smear campaigns allegedly led by Won. The prosecution is currently investigating the NIS’ alleged compiling of a so-called blacklist of some 80 cultural figures critical of the conservative government, following suspicions that two top ex-NIS officials were involved in giving such figures disadvantages.By Kim Da-sol","seoul mayor files complaint ,tuesday asked state prosecutors ,smear campaign seoul mayor ,seoul mayor files ,mayor files complaint against","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Lee', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office', 'Lee']",4,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.2344003   0.35133281

The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office sought a retrial for six cases, involving 18 people, who it said were falsely accused and convicted over confessions and evidence allegedly fabricated by the prosecution under military-backed governments between the 1960s and 1980s. It is the first time that state prosecutors admitted to their possible wrongdoings in the investigation process and asked for retrials, on behalf of victims, to seek acquittals for those who they indicted. The prosecution, the powerful law enforcement agency holding exclusive rights to indict, has been criticized for decades for aligning with authoritarian governments in stifling political dissent, falsely accusing dissidents and pro-democracy activists during the army-backed rule, which at times led to wrongful convictions and retrials.The six cases to be reopened are among the 73 cases which a fact-finding governmental committee, run between 2006 and 2010 and dedicated to investigating historically-charged and disputed incidents, recommended for retrials. The 18 people were the ones who did not ask for a retrial themselves. Others convicted in the six cases sought retrials and were already cleared of charges. Taeyongho is one such case. In 1968, fishing crews onboard Taeyoungho were captured near Yeonpyeongdo Island by North Korean coast guards while fishing and freed after a four-month detention. They were probed, tortured and convicted of espionage charges upon evidence, which later turned out to have been falsified by the then-military regime. This time, the prosecution asked the court to retry one of the victims, surnamed Park. He received a one-year prison sentence, suspended for two years. He was tortured, beaten and coerced into confessing to a crime he did not commit, according to the fact-finding committee.Five other victims in the Taeyongho case were cleared of their charges in the 2006 retrial.The prosecution said it will “strictly” gather evidence and evaluate it to see whether they were wrongfully convicted. It is widely expected to ask for acquittals for the victims in the courtroom. The prosecution plans to revisit all cases deemed short of abiding by legitimate procedures and protecting human rights, following a formal apology by Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il over the prosecution’s alleged abuse of power in probing political cases. He vowed to make the prosecution politically neutral and transparent as he took office in August. There are six other cases, involving 11 people, which the prosecution said will also ask for a retrial. Reforming the prosecution to free it from political influence is one of the major election promises by President Moon Jae-in. Public distrust of the prosecution hit rock bottom in recent months in the wake of the corruption scandal involving ousted ex-President Park Geun-hye and business tycoons, with critics accusing prosecutors of being lukewarm in investigating the case and favorable to the Park administration and major conglomerates.Park is standing trial for bribery, coercion and abuse of power, among other charges, with the ruling expected in October.","prosecutors office sought retrial ,retrial for six cases ,the prosecution on sunday ,court to reopen trials ,authoritarian governments month after",['the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29586795  0.55013961

It advised the government to replace them by having executives tender their resignations in masse and selectively receive them.In December 2009 MBC President Ohm Ki-young and other senior officials offered to resign. He was replaced by a figure close to the government. The documents indicated the NIS had checked the political stances of a number of executives of public broadcasters and interfered with their personnel changes. The probe panel also found documents that suggest the NIS created and managed a watch list of program makers and employees unfriendly to the government. In 2010 the agency pressured a broadcaster to drop a documentary made by a listed director from an annual awards show, according to the records. A radio program director on the list was assigned to a position in a regional branch that year.The prosecution plans to look into whether the plans were executed, which would constitute abuse of power and the violation of its duty of political neutrality. The prosecutors last week started an investigation into allegations that then NIS chief Won Se-hoon and other NIS officials managed a blacklist of artists and cultural figures unfriendly to the Lee government. On Friday, the ruling party called for a parliamentary probe into alleged attempts by the former governments to control local broadcasters. All of the 121 Democratic Party lawmakers signed a motion requesting the investigation into 37 cases involving the two administrations. Among the cases are purported political moves to meddle in the operations of three major broadcasters -- KBS, MBC and YTN -- and those involving journalists thought to have been unfairly sacked due to their political views.","prosecution looks into spy ,the prosecution said sunday ,blacklist of senior officials ,looks into spy agency ,spy agency alleged involvement",['the National Intelligence Service'],4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.05481122 0.21158049 0.20669566],Yonhap,Social affairs,9,2017,"extensive probes into alleged political ,the prosecutors last week ,political smear campaigns and gagging ,compiled blacklist of senior officials ,into alleged political meddling abuse","['the National Intelligence Service', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Moon Jae - in', 'NIS', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'NIS', 'Ohm Ki', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'NIS', 'Won Se - hoon', 'NIS', 'Lee', 'Democratic Party', 'KBS', 'MBC', 'YTN']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.05481122 0.21158049 0.20669566]

The Seoul High Court dropped the case filed by the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, in August last year, saying it does not fulfill the requirements to constitute a suit. The lower court gave the same ruling in March.Minbyun started the litigation after the National Intelligence Service had repeatedly rejected its demand for one-on-one meetings with the 12 defectors to ascertain their free will. The defectors, all women employees except for one male manager, escaped from a restaurant they had worked at in Ningbo, China, before arriving in Seoul.Pyongyang has urged Seoul to send them back to the North, claiming they were coaxed into moving to the South.  Minbyun questioned whether the defection came of their own will, calling for the need to confirm it through hearing from them firsthand. The spy agency said the defectors did not want to meet the lawyers.  It also raised doubts over the agency's equivocal attitude toward their settlements. The NIS later said they never underwent the state-run resettlement program like all other defectors, for protection as it's a very high-profile defection. Usually, North Korean defectors receive three months of resettlement education at the Hanawon facility after coming to South Korea.

The prosecution is investigating the election-meddling scandal surrounding the covert online operation by National Intelligence Service personnel to help then-conservative presidential candidate Park Geun-hye beat her rival and incumbent President Moon Jae-in. Min Byung-joo The NIS retirees formed the biggest team, comprising more than 150 people, out of about 30 such “cyber teams” tasked with creating comments and posts in favor of Park and critical of Moon on social media and news sites, according to the prosecution. Run by the NIS’ psychological warfare agents, each cyber team mostly had internet-savvy civilians as team members. A director of the NIS retirees’ team, surnamed Roh, reportedly said that the number of people involved in the illicit online campaign was about 20 to 30 in his unit, and later grew to 150. As the size of the team got bigger, Roh appointed two people under him to help manage them.The prosecution are considering whether to seek arrest warrants for two retired officials of the NIS, including Roh, given their team’s systematic and active involvement in the secret operation. Roh alone posted more than 9,000 comments on a portal site, a local news agency reported.In a rare statement, the prosecution criticized the court for rejecting the issuance of the arrest warrants for them and thus hampering its efforts to investigate a case deemed critical to public interest. On Wednesday, prosecutors summoned Min Byung-joo, ex-head of the psychological warfare team in the NIS, as a suspect. Min, who received a suspended term for the NIS’s interference in the 2012 election, faces allegations that he took charge of the secret operation to sway voters in favor of Park. In the first grilling session, which lasted for 14 hours last week, he admitted to running the operation under the orders of NIS chief Won Sei-hoon.Along with Min, Won, who led the NIS from 2009 to 2013 under the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration, was sentenced to four years in prison for ordering the online campaign to boost support for Park. Park defeated Moon by a narrow margin, to become the country’s first female president in the 2012 vote. She was removed from office over a corruption scandal, and is now detained while on trial facing charges including bribery and abuse of power. After President Moon took office, a task force was formed to look into the spy agency’s alleged interference in the election and domestic politics, as a part of his campaign to eradicate “deep-rooted evil” laid bare by a corruption scandal that brought down Park. Reforming the nation’s spy agency and freeing it from political influence was one of the key campaign promises made by Moon, who himself was the target of the smear campaign by the NIS. The probe is expanding to involve former President Lee and his staff, with the prosecution looking into the allegations that the spy agency also created a blacklist of liberal cultural figures to oppress them under the Lee administration.","over 150 retired spies ,the 2012 presidential election ,election meddling scandal surrounding ,150 retired spies joined ,2012 presidential election","['National Intelligence Service', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.45880646  0.22083521

But it remains unclear whether Moon will press ahead with his appointment amid objections even from within the ruling party ranks. This photo, taken Sept. 11, 2017, shows SMEs and Startups Minister nominee Park Seong-jin attending a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul. Since Moon tapped the 48-year-old professor at Pohang University of Science and Technology, to lead the newly minted ministry last month, criticism has raged over his past remarks and publications.One of the disputed remarks was that South Korea was founded in 1948, a view strongly advocated by the ousted former leader Park Geun-hye. Moon insists the national foundation dates back to 1919, when Korea's provisional government was established in Shanghai during Japan's colonial rule.Park was also attacked over his past activity as a member of the Korea Association for Creation Research, an entity that some argue denies evolution theory and specializes in creation science.  The nominee has also come under fire for tax evasion in 2015, for which he apologized during his hearing Monday.Opposition parties' disapproval of Park put the presidential office on edge and they escalated calls for overhauling the personnel vetting process.""We don't have any comments to make right now... We will watch the situation for the time being,"" a presidential official told Yonhap News Agency over the phone, declining to be named.Since Moon's inauguration in May, personnel issues have continued to bedevil him.The president's previous picks for the justice and labor ministers, and a court justice designate, renounced their nominations amid public disapproval. Two top security and science officials also bowed out amid controversies over their qualifications.","unfit in its report ,wednesday adopted negative assessment ,smes minister nominee unfit ,unfit in hearing report ,citing his controversial religious","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Seong - jin']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.01170047  0.51371557

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office last week to investigate the senior diplomat, who is suspected of having habitually used swear words when talking to her female secretary. The official, whose identity is being withheld, is also accused of physical assaults, such as throwing a pen and a tissue box at her subordinate, according to the ministry. The employee submitted some 20 hours of recorded conversations with her boss to the ministry audit team. She was apparently diagnosed as needing six months' treatment for stress caused by the verbal abuse and violence.  It is the latest in a series of cases involving South Korean diplomats overseas. On Monday, prosecutors said they started a probe into the ambassador to Ethiopia over alleged sexual harassment involving his female staff and volunteers.  Another official at the same embassy in the African country was fired in July after he was found to have raped a female staff member. The ministry has collected cases of its diplomats abusing their power over lower-ranking and lower-paid contracted staffers at overseas missions as part of efforts to strengthen discipline at work.About 40 such cases have been reported, 10 of which need internal investigations, according to the ministry.","alleged abuses seoul prosecutors ,in japan over allegations ,prosecutors office last week ,abuses seoul prosecutors ,abuses seoul prosecutors have","['Seoul', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.55722719  0.19227751

The ruling camp accused the opposition of acting ""irresponsibly and high-handedly, with Choo taking umbrage particularly at the People's Party.A day earlier, Choo upbraided the minor party for ""flaunting its presence and flexing its muscle through a shameless act."" She also criticized it for only insisting the ruling bloc take the initiative in strengthening cooperation with the opposition-led legislature.Such remarks only drew the ire of the opposition parties.""It makes me wonder if she, with such an immodest attitude, can be called a ruling party leader,"" Park Jie-won, the former leader of the People's Party, said during a radio interview. ""She should reflect on herself and seek an apology from the citizens .""Kim Kwan-young, the party's secretary-general, called on Choo to ""remain silent for the nation and president.""The conservative parties also pounced on her, calling for her to show ""humility.""""Her behavior yesterday was the ultimate case of one in the wrong shifting the blame to the other,"" Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, said, calling for her to take a period of self-reflection.Ha Tae-kyeung, a senior lawmaker of the Bareun Party, stepped in the fray.""I want to ask Choo if her main enemy is the North Korean regime or our opposition parties,"" he said in a statement dripping with sarcasm over the liberal ruling party's dovish stance toward the provocative state.The two-day confirmation hearing for the chief justice nominee continued Wednesday.Kim was grilled particularly over his ideological orientation, which conservative parties say could undermine the core judicial principle of political neutrality.At issue was Kim's previous role in leading a group of liberal judges. Thus, the president's designation of Kim has caused consternation among conservatives that fear it could fuel the judiciary's swing to the left. Kim's 2015 ruling in favor of a progressive teachers' union further reinforced the argument that the nominee appears politically skewed and thus incapable of rendering aboveboard rulings.  Kim's appointment requires consent from a majority of lawmakers present during a floor vote that can be set up by a majority of all 299 legislators. The ruling party is far short of a parliamentary majority, necessitating opposition support.","court nominee draws pushback ,controversy over his political ,party chief on wednesday ,tongued ruling party chief ,wednesday made rare appeal","[""the People 's Party"", 'Democratic Party', 'Supreme Court', 'Kim Meong - su']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41332823  0.03924694

No ...,"Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon abruptly called off a lunch meeting with the press planned to mark his 100th day in office Thursday amid violent clashes between police and villagers in a southeastern town over the deployment of additional launchers for the US THAAD missile defense system.Lee's office sent members of the press corps a mobile phone text message Thursday morning that the press meeting has been postponed. No specific reason was given, but sources said that tensions over the THAAD deployment were taken into consideration. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon speaks with Defense Minister Song Young-moo, Wednesday. Clashes broke out in the southeastern town of Seongju as villagers fought riot police to block the installation of four additional launchers for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery aimed at bolstering the defense against North Korean missile threats.Dozens of residents and police were injured.Despite the clashes, the launchers moved past the village and entered the deployment site. Thursday's installation, if completed, will mark the conclusion of a deployment that has plagued the nation for years amid intense opposition not only from residents but also from China.Two THAAD launchers had already been installed during the administration of ousted former President Park Geun-hye. Upon taking office, President Moon Jae-in put on hold the installation of the remaining four launchers pending an environmental assessment.But Moon ordered the deployment of the additional THAAD launchers soon after North Korea launched a second intercontinental ballistic missile in late July.China has long protested the deployment, saying THAAD hurts its security interests. Beijing has taken a number of economic retaliatory measures against the South as Seoul refused to give in to Chinese pressure to scrap the decision to host the system.Earlier this week, Lee said that South Korea should offer sincere explanations to China about its decision to host THAAD, saying Beijing sees the decision as a violation of trust and faith in its relations with Seoul.Since taking office on May 31, Lee has taken on a series of hard-to-tackle, contentious issues. His office is in charge of ironing out differences between residents and government over THAAD, but it is also responsible for gauging public opinion on a proposal to scrap the construction of two nuclear power reactors in the southeastern city of Ulsan.","office thursday amid violent ,called off lunch meeting ,thursday amid violent clashes ,abruptly called off lunch ,day in office thursday","['Lee Nak - yon', 'US', 'Lee']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57572109  0.1234455

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office said they are seeking to arrest them on charges of violating the election law. Former NIS chief Won Sei-hoon has recently been convicted for violations of laws regarding both elections and the intelligence agency by hiring civilians to write Internet comments to sway voters in favor of then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye. Park won the election against her liberal rival Moon Jae-in.She was ousted as the country's leader in March this year and now stands trial for corruption and abuse of power. The prosecution made the request for the warrants after an internal probe of the NIS found last month that the agency ran 30 such ""cyber teams"" to influence the public. The prosecution believes many NIS retirees were hired to lead the cyber teams comprised of Internet-savvy civilians from May 2009 till the election in December 2012. Some 48 leaders are suspected of being paid to train their team members to write online comments.The Seoul prosecutors' office has questioned over a dozen NIS officials and cyber team heads so far.

South Korea's anti-trust watchdog had investigated a total of nine freight shipping firms into the scheme and slapped them with 43 billion won  in fines in August. It referred the case to the prosecution last week. The prosecution said it indicted only two of them, citing the leniency program and expiry of the statute of limitations applied to the others. The car carriers from Japan, Norway, Chile, Israel and Korea are accused of having formed such a cartel for about 10 years. The price fixing was largely made for North America, Europe and Mediterranean-bound routes from South Korea, it added.South Korea's top automaker Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. are known to be their key clients.

Last month, Labor Minister Kim Young-joo decried a set of MBC cases in which some producers and reporters were assigned to other jobs outside the news production sphere.On Tuesday, unionized workers of the broadcaster voted to go on strike Monday demanding the president‘s resignation over his alleged political meddling in news production. Some 400 reporters, TV producers, video journalists and announcers have been boycotting news production, demanding he step down.Kim has come under fire for using his influence to produce newscasts favorable to the former Park Geun-hye administration.The Moon Jae-in administration, along with the ruling Democratic Party, has stressed the importance of public broadcasters’ objectivity and reliability.

Won Sei-hoon, 66, who led the National Intelligence Agency from 2009 to 2013 under the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration, was found guilty of election and NIS law violations. He was accused of directing his agents to conduct an illicit smear campaign online to sway voters in favor of then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye of the conservative ruling bloc.Former intelligence agency chief Won Sei-hoon is escorted to the courtroom at the Seoul High Court to attend his sentencing hearing Wednesday, while being surrounded by reporters. “Won had colluded  to spread pro-government opinions through online postings and support a specific political party and politicians, in clear violation of the NIS’ political neutrality,” the presiding judge said. Two other former NIS officials, who were tried alongside Won, both received prison terms of 2 1/2 years, suspended for four years. “We cannot accept the ruling. We will appeal,” Bae Ho-geun, Won’s attorney said. Won was taken into custody immediately after the ruling.It was a retrial after the Seoul High Court’s ruling in 2015 that gave the former spy chief a three-year jail term was overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court. The top court cited a lack of evidence as the prosecution failed to prove that Won masterminded the smear campaign. The top court’s decision got Won released on bail. The new trial was ordered in July last year.In the ruling Wednesday, the judge had left out pieces of evidence questioned by the Supreme Court, but saw other evidence, including hundreds of Twitter accounts used by NIS staff members, as convincing enough to convict Won. Recently, the NIS’ internal inquiry and state prosecutors under the new liberal administration revealed that the agency had hired internet-savvy civilians for the covert online operation. In the election, Park beat liberal rival Moon Jae-in by a narrow margin. Moon is now president, while Park was expelled from office in March and is now standing trial for corruption.

It also found Lee guilty of embezzlement, hiding assets overseas, concealment of criminal proceeds and perjury, all of which led to the impeachment and ouster of Park in March.

The ruli...","The conviction of Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong bodes ill for former President Park Geun-hye, who is on trial for receiving bribes from Lee, observers said Monday. The trial of the impeached president and her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil, who are at the center of the corruption scandal that removed Park from office in March and landed Lee in jail for a five-year term last week, is ongoing. The ruling is expected in October. In Friday’s ruling for Lee, the Seoul Central District Court acknowledged two things that could work against Park -- that Park and Choi are accomplices in receiving bribes from Lee and that Park actively and directly asked for money from Lee. Lee Jae-yong, Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil The disgraced Park and Choi, Park’s friend of 40 years, have been on trial since May for conspiring to receive bribes from local firms including Samsung Group to help Choi pursue personal interests. The court said that the 8.92 billion won  Lee paid in the form of donations to a Choi-controlled foundation and sponsorship to Choi’s horse-riding daughter had been a bribe, acknowledging the three-way money-for-political favors deal. “When a public servant conspires with a non-public servant to receive bribes and the non-public servant, who is an accomplice, takes the bribes, it is the same as the public servant taking it,” the judge Kim Jin-dong said, referring to the Park-Choi relationship. Ex-President Park has argued that she had not forced firms to donate money to the Choi-controlled entities and she had not shared any economic benefits with Choi. She claimed that the requests for donations were only a part of her policy drive to promote culture and sports in the country. According to criminal law, those who are found guilty of offering bribes are punished by a prison term of up to five years. Those who are convicted of receiving bribes, however, are subjected to a heavier punishment -- at least five years in prison and up to life sentence when the amount is more than 100 million won.“We can see that the ex-president followed up with the issue of Samsung Group’s leadership transfer and asked for financial support for  Chung. And the accused offered the money in anticipation of a favor from Park,” the judge Kim said.“Park was actively and considerably involved in Choi using the foundations as a means to pursue her personal interests,” he said. The court said that Samsung Group expected the ex-president to help Samsung Group achieve a smooth transition of leadership from its ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong through the 2015 merger of its two affiliates. And Lee was aware of Choi’s power and influence as Park’s confidante before donating the money, which is why the court saw it as a bribe. Out of 43.3 billion won -- the total amount of the money which the special counsel viewed as paid or promised by Samsung Group -- the court acknowledged only 8.92 billion won as a bribe. “In response to the president’s active demands, it seems that Samsung Group passively offered bribes,” the court said, adding such requests were made during three one-on-one meetings between Park and Lee.The court, however, did not see the donations worth 22 billion won for the Choi-controlled K-Sports Foundation and Mir Foundation -- to which other local firms also contributed money to -- as a bribe. The fate for Park remains to be seen, but the conviction of Lee is likely to take a toll on Park. Many of the key witnesses and her former subordinates have already turned their backs on the ex-president during court proceedings, saying that they had committed alleged wrongdoings under Park’s order. “Bribery always involves two parties -- one to give the bribe and one to take the bribe. As Lee was found guilty of bribery, Park is likely to be convicted, too,” Kim Nam-geun, a lawyer belonging to a left-wing civic group the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, told The Korea Herald. “The court did not consider the donations for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation as bribes because Lee only passively responded to Park‘s request. Given that, Park is likely to be found guilty of abuse of power for that.”Other than the bribery charge, Park is also accused of abusing her authority to help Choi’s business interests, exclude artists critical of Park from state support and sack government officials who refused to aid or abet her wrongdoings.“I think that the ruling heightened the possibility for Park to be found guilty as the court acknowledged that Park had played a leading role in taking bribes,” lawyer Jo Tae-jin from Seo Law said. “I think that Lee’s sentence will be reduced at the High Court.”The ruling for Samsung Group’s de facto chief is not yet final. Both Lee and Special Counsel Park Young-soo, who demanded the court to issue a 10-year prison term for Lee, appealed against the decision Sunday.

Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong enters the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho-gu, Seoul, to hear his verdict Friday. Lee, who has been detained since February, was found guilty of all five charges -- bribery, embezzlement, concealment of criminal proceeds, illegal transfer of assets overseas and perjury.The court said Lee and Samsung executives offered large bribes to the president, who held “immense power and the ultimate authority,” and embezzled company funds, hid assets overseas and concealed profits from criminal acts in the process, all expecting a favor in the form of Samsung Group’s smooth leadership transition. Lee is the first member of Samsung Group’s ownership family to be sentenced to jail. He is set to appeal the decision. The special counsel claimed Samsung had offered 43.3 billion won  in donations to three entities controlled by Choi and in sports sponsorships to Choi’s horse-riding daughter Chung Yoo-ra. It saw the money as a bribe to win the government’s backing for a controversial 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates -- Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T; -- which was a crucial step for a smooth leadership transition from the ailing Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. The merger was opposed by many shareholders who viewed it as only serving to help Lee tighten his grip. Former President Park, in return for the money, is suspected of having pressured the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, to vote in favor of the controversial merger, according to the counsel. Prosecutors sought a 12-year jail sentence for Lee. But the court acknowledged only part of the amount -- 1.6 billion won provided to a winter sports foundation and 7.3 billion won for Chung’s equestrian training -- as bribes. Donations worth 22 billion won to the K-Sports Foundation and Mir Foundation – to which other local firms also contributed money -- were not in return for favors, it said. The court said Lee had been closely involved in making the money-for-political favors deal with the then-president. But it said Lee “passively” accepted Park’s requests for donations, rather than actively seeking favors. Four former and incumbent Samsung Group executives, who stood trial along with Lee, were also jailed.Choi Gee-sung, the former head of Samsung Group’s now-defunct control tower Corporate Strategy Office, and his deputy Chang Choong-ki were sentenced to four years in prison for their “heavy” involvement in implementing the bribery scheme. But they were not direct beneficiaries from it, the court said. Former Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin received a three-year jail term, suspended for five years, and former Executive Vice President Hwang Sung-soo was sentenced to 2 1/2 years, suspended for four years.Lee was immediately taken to the Seoul Detention Center,  south of Seoul, where he has already served nearly six months. Choi and Chang, who had been on trial without detention, will be taken behind bars. “We cannot accept the verdict,” Lee’s lawyer Song Woo-chul told reporters following the ruling. “In the appeal, we are certain to have all charges proven not guilty.”  Handcuffed and bound with rope around his black suit, Lee stepped out of the Justice Ministry’s bus at around 1:36 p.m. to hear his verdict at courtroom No. 417. As the verdict was delivered, he showed no particular reaction. The courtroom is the same where his father Lee Kun-hee received a suspended jail term for bribery and tax evasion in 2008. Reflecting public interest, the room was filled with the accused’s family members, lawyers and reporters, as well as spectators. More than 450 people applied for just 30 seats in the 150-seat courtroom to witness what has been dubbed Korea’s “trial of the century.” Lee denied all charges, saying the donations were made without his knowledge. He also said all key decisions from the controversial merger to the donations to the Choi-controlled entities had been signed off on by his mentor, former Samsung Group Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung. Samsung did not deny donating money to the Choi-controlled foundations, but the four executives said they had been forced to donate out of fear of what Park and Choi could do to their business.The ruling is likely to deal a heavy blow to former President Park and her friend Choi, who are at the center of the corruption scandal that drove millions of Koreans into the streets last winter and eventually removed Park from office. They are on trial over charges of receiving bribes from local firms, including Samsung, with a ruling expected in October. The court said Park and Choi had a close relationship and the ex-president helped Choi pursue personal interests through the bribery scheme involving Samsung Group. “The ex-president conspired with Choi to actively and specifically ask for financial support through three one-one-one meetings from 2014 to 2016, and Lee met the demands in anticipation of Park’s help in the company’s leadership transfer,” the court said. The ruling on Samsung’s heir apparent is widely seen as a sign of growing intolerance toward decadeslong corrupt ties between politicians and family-run conglomerates, or chaebol.There had been pressure on the court to convict Lee, amid public anger in the face of the corruption scandal, which people believe symbolizes an unfair and unjust society that only benefits the most powerful in the country. Chaebol owners have long gotten away with light or suspended sentences, with courts citing their contributions to the nation’s economy. Lee’s father also had his terms suspended and was set free through a presidential pardon. About 800 riot police were deployed around the court to prevent possible clashes between protesters present both in favor and against Lee’s verdict. They were gathering to either call for a heavier punishment or his release from prison. By Ock Hyun-ju","years for bribery seoul ,jailed years for bribery ,district court convicted samsung ,samsung heir jailed years ,court convicted samsung","['Seoul', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung ’s de', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.18938124 -0.04422508

Won has been on trial for allegedly pulling the strings of secret operations to use Internet comments to sway voters in favor of then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye against then opposition candidate Moon Jae-in.Park won the vote by a thin margin and took office as president in early 2013. But less than four years into office, she was impeached and ultimately ousted from office over a massive corruption scandal. Moon was elected the new president in May's presidential election. Prosecutors reopened the investigation into the election meddling scandal after an internal probe of the NIS found the agency ran 30 such ""cyber teams"" involving Internet-savvy civilians for election-meddling operations. Officials said that Won's sentencing should be put off as more evidence is coming.""After the hearings are over , the NIS announced the results of its inspection and referred people for investigation. The prosecution has launched an additional investigation, raiding locations and summoning people,"" a prosecution official said.""The scope of civilian teams , which had not been fully known, has been confirmed and this needs to be reflected in the trial,"" the official said of the need to postpone Won's sentencing.It is up to the court to decide whether to accept the prosecution's request or not.Prosecutors have banned the 30 leaders of the election meddling teams as well as former and incumbent NIS officials suspected of involvement in the scheme from leaving the country. Investigators are tracing bank accounts to track down the money flow between the agency and the secretive teams.Depending on the results of the investigation, prosecutors could press additional charges against Won. Another focus of the probe is how far it will go, including who else, in addition to the former NIS chief, will be investigated.Some even speculate that top officials of the government of former President Lee Myung-bak, the predecessor of Park, could be targets.","scandal prosecutors asked thursday ,election meddling scandal prosecutors ,prosecutors asked thursday for ,prosecutors asked thursday ,spy chief in election","['National Intelligence Service', 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Won']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54234743  0.42364091

It was exhibited in a facility in the southern city of Changwon in commemoration of a 1960 civil uprising against election fraud. In April, the Masan branch of the Changwon District Court fined Kim, the leader of a local anti-Park group, 2 million won  for damaging public property and breaking into a building. This undated file photo shows a photo of then-President Park Geun-hye vandalized at a memorial hall of a 1960 pro-democracy movement in the southern city of Changwon. In Thursday's ruling, the high court said it finds it difficult to reduce the sentence for Kim as he has a probation record, even though the photo was restored without being physically damaged.Kim said he will appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the high court's ruling.On Dec. 14, Kim and his colleagues visited the hall and demanded the removal of the photo showing Park posing with children before he damaged the picture.Prosecutors initially filed a summary indictment. He defied it and demanded a formal trial.On March 15, 1960, thousands of students and citizens in the city rose up amid widespread allegations of vote rigging by the Rhee Syng-man government.

Choo Mi-ae made the remarks as Han was released from prison Wednesday after serving a two-year term for taking illegal political funds. Choo suggested that Han was convicted of trumped-up charges, and called for reforms to eradicate such ""judicial ills.""""The ruling party's leadership is disregarding the authority of the judicial branch and law, while portraying the unanimous decision by all 13 Supreme Court justices to convict  as ill and unfair,"" said Rep. Chung Woo-taik, floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party.""This shameless attitude is a new ill,"" he said.Former Prime Minister Han Lee Jae-man, a member of the party's Supreme Council, also accused Choo of denying the rule of law, and claimed that her calls for judicial reform could be the beginning of a ""reign of terror"" aimed at controlling the judicial branch.""If they attempt to tame the judicial branch, people won't just be sitting idly by,"" he said.He also called for President Moon Jae-in to state his position on the issue.The minor opposition People's Party also slammed the ruling party chief.""Former Prime Minister Han is neither... a pro-democracy fighter nor an independence fighter,"" Rep. Lee Yong-ho, the party's chief policymaker, said. ""She is just a person released after serving a prison term for taking black money.""Lee also noted that Han was convicted by a unanimous decision at the Supreme Court.""Denying this is denying the judicial system,"" he said. ""Stop remarks siding with crimes and treating the judicial branch as an illegal organization. If they think it's unfair, they should seek re-trial.""Lee also said the party could reconsider President Moon's nominee for the Supreme Court chief.Han, prime minister from 2006 to 2007, was put behind bars in 2015 after the Supreme Court convicted her of accepting about 900 million won  in illegal political funds from the head of a local construction company. But she has long claimed innocence, arguing that she never accepted the money and the charges against her were fabricated as part of political revenge by a conservative government against the former liberal administration of late President Roh Moo-hyun. The ruling party made no more comments on the issue as it sought to calm the situation. Some members even discounted Choo's remarks as a personal view, not that of the party, amid concern the remark could backfire and hinder the party's judicial reform drive.""As far as I know, the remark was made in her personal capacity because former Prime Minister Han was former party chief and suffered the hardship of imprisonment,"" a party official said on condition of anonymity. ""There is nothing the party can comment on this issue.""Rep. Won Hye-young also said in a radio interview that he believes Choo's point is to call for improving the judicial system as it has been politically swayed in the past. Won also said he doesn't think she made remarks on a specific case.","released from prison wednesday ,wrongfully indicted and convicted ,indicted and convicted rep ,illegal political funds choo ,prison wednesday after serving","['Democratic Party', 'Han Myeong - sook', 'Choo Mi', 'Han', 'Han']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10808305 -0.02625741

Lee’s final court session, which will not be televised in accordance with the court’s decision Wednesday, will begin at 2:30 p.m. Judges will deliver the verdict on Lee and four other former or incumbent executives of Samsung and if they are found guilty, will issue a sentence. This is a lower-court trial and either side could appeal. Competition for the 30 audience seats available for ordinary citizens reached 15:1 and the selection was done by a lucky draw. Here are a few things to know about Lee’s trial, dubbed the “trial of the century.” Who is Lee Jae-yong?The crown prince of Samsung, a towering business conglomerate that generates a fifth of South Korea’s gross domestic product, Lee was raised, educated and trained to one day succeed his father -- Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee. Ever since the senior Lee suffered a near-fatal heart attack in 2014, Lee Jae-yong, aka Jay Y. Lee, 49, has been stepping up as a leader, strategist and key decision maker in Samsung, while making moves to complete the transfer of group control -- equity ownership-wise -- to him. He currently holds the title of Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman and also sits on the firm’s board of directors. It seemed everything in Lee’s life was served on a silver platter, but since Feb. 17 he has been living in a 6.56 square-meter solitary cell, standing trial for bribery and other criminal charges. What are his charges?Lee faces a total of five charges: bribery, embezzlement, illegal transfer of assets overseas, concealment of criminal proceeds and perjury. Key to all five is his ties to now-impeached President Park Geun-hye, her close confidante Choi Soon-sil and Choi’s horse-riding daughter Chung Yoo-ra. Bribery: Lee is accused of paying or promising to pay a total of 43.3 billion won  -- 21.3 billion won in sponsorship for Chung’s equestrian training abroad and 22 billion won in donations to three foundations allegedly controlled by Choi. If convicted, Lee could face up to five years in prison. Embezzlement: The prosecution sees the 29.8 billion won actually paid -- the rest was promised but unpaid -- were corporate money misappropriated by Lee for personal gains. Embezzlement of such an amount carries a prison term of up to 8 years. Illegal overseas transfer of money: This is the gravest charge that could land Lee in prison for 10 years to a life sentence. The prosecution insists Samsung’s signing of a 21.3 billion won deal with Core Sports, a paper company based in Germany believed to be controlled by Choi, and actually wiring 7.9 billion won to the company were an attempt by Lee to sneak his assets overseas. Concealment of criminal proceeds: Prosecutors argue another 7.8 billion won paid was in fact used to buy an expensive horse for Chung, which was an attempt to disguise Lee’s bribery and embezzlement as a legitimate sports sponsorship deal. If convicted, Lee could face imprisonment of up to five years.Perjury: Appearing at a parliamentary hearing last year, Lee maintained his innocence and denied any knowledge of the group’s dubious donations. For this, he is charged with perjury, which carries a jail term of up to 10 years. What are key clashing points? It all comes down to one question -- whether Lee Jae-yong was a direct beneficiary of the alleged donations-for-political favors deal with President Park and whether he was a top decision-maker in the process. Special counsel argues that shady deals were made in three one-on-one meetings between Park and Lee from 2014 to 2016. Based on that, Lee ordered Samsung units to donate to Choi-controlled entities and support the equestrian sport and Park, in return, pressured the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, to vote in favor of the company’s 2015 merger with affiliate Cheil Industries. The merger was highly controversial at that time, seen as aiding Lee only to tighten his grip over Samsung Group, and minority shareholders campaigned to block it, although to no avail. Former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo received 2 1/2 years in prison in June for pressuring the National Pension Service to vote for the merger. But the verdict did not include the bench’s judgement on whether Moon had done so under Park’s order.Lee’s defense team fought hard to prove the money was not a bribe and the decision to donate was not made by Lee, since bribery is the central core of all the allegations against him. Four Samsung executives standing trial alongside Lee claimed they were the ones behind the donations or the equestrian sponsorship. They said they did so under pressure and out of fear of what the president and Choi could do to their business. If convicted, what would happen to Samsung? There are mixed views about the impact Lee’s possible absence from Samsung would have on the conglomerate. While some say it would be difficult for the group to paint a big picture without Lee, chaebol reformists call it an opportunity to end the long-standing problems of the chaebol model -- the opaque corporate governance and transfer of control within the group’s founding family, often involving illicit means. Although the de facto chief has been away since February -- detained in a correction facility -- the state of Samsung Electronics has never been better. In the second quarter of this year, the electronics giant was set to become the most profitable company in the world, beating Apple for the first time. The share price of Samsung Electronics has surged 32 percent this year. Rumors that Lee’s sister Lee Boo-jin might fill in for her brother still seem unlikely, as she has no allies within Samsung Electronics, the group’s flagship and cash cow, and does not have enough power or shares to control the tech giant. Lee Jae-yong holds 0.58 percent, while his sisters holds none. There is general consensus the conglomerate will not give up on Lee as its next leader whatever. Implications for Park Geun-hye? The ruling on Lee is expected to serve as a barometer for the fate of ex-President Park and her friend Choi, the two women who plunged South Korea into turmoil last winter with a sweeping corruption scandal which ended with the nation‘s first-ever impeachment of an elected president. Both are now arrested and standing on trial for a raft of charges, but at the core is again, their conspiring to extort donations from local firms including Samsung Group. Park, who was removed from office in March over the corruption scandal, is trial a total of 18 charges including bribery and abuse of authority. If Lee is found guilty of giving bribes, the persons who are accused of receiving the money -- Park or Choi -- are also likely to face conviction. The ruling on Park is expected in October.

Han was convicted of receiving some 900 million won in illicit political funds from a local businessman in 2007, during her stint as prime minister. Han, the country’s first woman to become prime minister and the first former premier to serve a prison term, was long considered a heavyweight within the liberal camp.As she came out from prison in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, at around 5 a.m., she was welcomed by liberal lawmakers and supporters. Han Myeong-sook  is greeted by supporters and fellow liberal politicians upon her release from a prison in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Wednesday. “The past two years have been painful but I am grateful that I am finally out into a new world,” she said in front of the prison. “I overcame hardship with the support and trust you  have given me.”At the scene were liberal political figures, including former Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan and the current floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, Rep. Woo Won-shik.At the time, her liberal party, New Politics Alliance for Democracy -- the forerunner of the ruling Democratic Party -- described the ruling as partial and political revenge by the conservative Park Geun-hye administration against the Roh administration.After the conviction, she was stripped of her parliamentary seat, and she later left the party. President Moon Jae-in, who was the chairman of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy at the time, had also expressed dissatisfaction over the conviction, saying that the ruling was inappropriate.Han’s release was met by calls for judiciary reform from the ruling party. “It was painful to see her  because we know the truth and trust her conscience,” Rep. Choo Mi-ae said at a party meeting. “The Moon administration has no intention to wield influence on the judicial branch, like Park did. We encourage the court to proceed with reform by itself,” she added.Opposition parties denounced the ruling party’s stance, accusing them of encroaching on the role of the judiciary body. “The remarks made by the ruling party’s leadership raise serious concerns, as they appear to be rejecting the decision made by the prosecution and the judiciary,” Rep. Kang Hyo-sang, the spokesman for the main opposition Liberty Korea Party said. Floor Leader Rep. Kim Dong-cheol of the minor opposition People’s Party also called Rep. Choo’s claims “irresponsible” and said that it is wrong to interfere with the independence of the judiciary.“We send our condolences to Han who had to serve a prison term at her age. But we cannot agree with the ruling party’s attitude toward this matter,” Floor Leader Joo Ho-young of the splinter conservative Bareun Party said. “If the ruling party’s claim is true, the government should run an investigation. If it is not, we cannot just laugh off the ruling party’s act of ignoring the constitution,” he added. Han was born in Pyongyang in 1944 and moved to Seoul with her parents when she was 5 years old. The 73-year-old was a prominent women’s rights activist before she entered politics. She also led the United Democratic Party, the forerunner of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy in 2012 after she served as prime minister.By Jo He-rim","year sentence over bribery ,released from prison wednesday ,her two year sentence ,local businessman in 2007 ,prison wednesday after completing","['Han Myeong - sook', 'Han', 'Han']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.04086176 0.08979645 0.39518964],Jo He-rim,Politics,8,2017,"two year sentence over bribery ,released from prison wednesday after ,released from prison wednesday ,prison wednesday after completing her ,year sentence over bribery han","['Han Myeong - sook', 'Han', 'Han', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Han', 'Uijeongbu', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Woo Won - shik', 'New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Democratic Party', 'Park Geun', 'Roh', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Han', 'Choo Mi', 'Park', 'Kang Hyo - sang', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Kim Dong - cheol', 'People ’s Party', 'Choo', 'Han', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Bareun Party', 'Han', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'the United Democratic Party', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Jo He - rim']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.04086176 0.08979645 0.39518964]

The Iksan Police Station in southwestern South Korea also booked an accomplice and the owner of a gas station involved in the alleged distribution of stolen oil without physical detention.The gang, including its leader surnamed Lee, met at a warehouse in the town of Okcheon in the province in March and began to dig the tunnel with shovels and hoes to access the supply pipeline of the state-run Daehan Oil Pipeline Corp.  This photo, released by the Iksan Police Station in South Korea`s southwestern province of North Jeolla on Aug. 23, 2017, shows a tunnel that a gang of oil pilferers dug in Okcheon, central South Korea. After 45 days of digging, the thieves reached an underground oil pipeline and started to steal oil through a rubber hose they linked to the pipeline, according to the police. They loaded 10,000 to 20,000 liters of the stolen oil a day onto a truck remodeled into a tanker.According to the police, the oil pilferers installed a CCTV near the tunnel to monitor for police crackdowns. In the last three months, they managed to steal 370,000 liters of oil worth 480 million won  from the pipeline.They sold the stolen oil to two gas station in Iksan, North Jeolla Province, at a price that was 200 to 250 won cheaper than the list price. The clandestine trade between the thieves and the gas stations was detected by the Iksan police in less than a month.The police, which noticed the transfer of the stolen oil to the gas stations, have secured the rubber hose and the CCTV.""In the past, many oil pilferers operated construction equipment to dig a tunnel, but the gang dug a tunnel more for than a month without construction equipment,"" a police official said, adding they have notified the state-run oil pipeline company of the theft and have been checking out to see where there are other similar theft cases.","six man theft ring ,digging 40 meter tunnel ,oil thieves nabbed for ,meter tunnel to steal ,underground pipeline iksan police","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Iksan Police Station', 'South Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44855812  0.19630352

She also called for reforms to make sure such ""judicial ills"" won't happen again.Choo said that the judicial branch has often colluded with governments in human rights violations, including the 1991 fabrication of charges against a student activist that he wrote a suicide note on behalf of a dissident who set himself on fire and died in protest of the government.The student, Kang Ki-hoon, was convicted of abetting a suicide and served three years in prison. But a government commission found in a 2012 reinvestigation that he was wrongfully charged. The Supreme Court ruled in a retrial in 2015 that Kang was innocent.Opposition parties slammed Choo for denying the court's ruling.""I can't help but be truly appalled,"" Lee Jae-man, a member of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party's Supreme Council, said in a Facebook posting. ""This amounts to the ruling party's chief trampling on the authority and dignity of the judicial branch. Do they think they can overturn court rulings now that they have taken power?""Rep.

They filed the suit after Kim stabbed their 23-year-old daughter to death in May 2016 “because he hated women.”“Our daughter died more than 60 years earlier than she was expected to die and we could not lead our daily lives because we were mentally shocked following the sudden death of our daughter,” they said. Korea Legal Aid Corp., which represented the parents, expressed hope that the verdict would serve as “consolation” to heal the wounds of the victim’s parents.Kim, who is now serving a 30-year term in prison, waited for about 50 minutes in the bathroom, while six men entered and left, before he killed the first woman who entered. He said he had committed the crime because he had been “ignored and belittled” by women in the past. The death of the young woman sparked public outcry over violence targeting women, leading women rights activists to rise up against misogyny, which they said is still prevalent in Korean society.Police denied the misogynic nature of the crime, citing the mental illness the convict was suffering as the reason behind the offense. By Ock Hyun-ju","murdering young woman last ,seoul court on tuesday ,year old victim killed ,convicted of murdering young ,pay w500m to victim","['Seoul', 'Gangnam Station', 'Seoul', 'Gangman Station', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'Suwon']",4,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.4592678   0.22958365

Won is on trial for allegedly pulling the strings of the cyber operations to influence the 2012 vote in favor of then-conservative candidate Park Geun-hye. Days before the presidential polls, members of the NIS' anti-North Korea psychological warfare team posted messages critical of then main opposition candidate Moon Jae-in and supporting Park on social networking and news websites. Park was elected by a narrow margin, according to the internal investigation.The NIS investigation team has handed over its findings to the prosecution.One of the key points in the prosecution's investigation is how far it will go, including who else, in addition to the former NIS chief, would be investigated.The prosecution is also expected to look into other illegal political activities of the spy agency. Some even speculate that top officials of the government of then President Lee Myung-bak could be a target of the investigation.President Moon Jae-in has vowed to reform the NIS by making it focus on collecting and analyzing intelligence and information on North Korea and foreign affairs.

The Gwangju District Court said that the wartime construction firm must pay 150 million won  in compensation to Oh Cheol-seok, a family member of the late victim Oh Kil-ae, 120 million won to surviving victim Kim Jae-rim and 100 million won to two surviving victims Yang Young-soo and Shim Seon-ae. They had demanded 150 million won from the Japanese firm, saying that they were forced to work without pay under appalling conditions at an aircraft manufacturing factory in Nagoya, Japan, after being deceived in 1944 on the false promise that they would be able to study and earn money in Japan.  Kim Jae-rim “I thought I would die there after being taken to Japan without knowing anything. I didn’t know something good like this would happen to me after all these years,” said the elderly Kim, following the verdict. “Thank you to all the people who made efforts for us.”It took three years from filing the suit to winning the case, which civic groups advocating forced workers say was a result of the company’s international foot dragging. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries issued an apology for the American and Chinese victims of forced labor, but denied its responsibility for Korean victims. The ruling comes two days after the same court ruled in favor of surviving victim Kim Young-ok and Lee Kyung-ja, a family member of the deceased victim Choe Jeong-rye. The court ordered Mitsubishi to pay 120 million won to Kim and 32.5 million won to Lee. The country’s district and high courts have ruled in favor of those forced to work for Japanese firms, following the top court’s historic ruling in 2012 which acknowledged forced workers’ individual rights to seek compensation despite the state-level treaty between Korean and Japan. Kim Jae-rim  Japan maintains that all colonial-era issues, including postwar compensation claims, were settled with a 1965 Seoul-Tokyo treaty, under which Japan offered money and low-interest loans to Korea and the two countries normalized relations. In 2009, Japan pushed for the UNSECO World Heritage listing of some Japanese wartime industrial sites that used forced labor from Korea and other Asian countries, saying they played a key role in the country’s industrialization. Korea strongly protested the move.Eight victims filed for compensation against the Japanese government and Mitsubishi in Japan in 1999 with the help of a Japanese civic group, but Japan’s top court rejected the case in 2008. Since 2000, a total of 14 wartime compensation suits have been filed against Japanese firms involved in the country’s wartime aggression in Korea, with four cases still pending at the nation’s top court.Civic groups advocating for the victims are calling for swift rulings on the pending cases as most of the victims are in their 80s and suffering from frail health. Though exact figures are not available, historians in Korea estimate at least 1.2 million Koreans were mobilized against their will in China, Japan and elsewhere, as forced laborers in mines, factories and construction sites under Japan’s colonial rule between 1910 and 1945. Japan also mobilized as many as 200,000 Asian women, mostly Koreans, as sex slaves for its troops during World War II.By Ock Hyun-ju","friday ordered the japanese ,compensation to korean victims ,pay 150 million won ,korean victims of japanese ,korean court on friday","['south korean', 'japanese', 'Mitsubishi Heavy Industries', 'korean', 'japanese', 'the Gwangju District Court']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36976141  0.48137775

The Gwangju District Court found the defendant, only identified by his last name Park, guilty of the sexual harassment charge and ordered his immediate detention.The former councilor of the South Korean Embassy to the Latin American country was indicted without detention in May for molesting a 14-year-old girl while he was in Chile. He apparently taught her Korean. He has been removed from his post by the foreign ministry.   The file photo, dated Dec. 19, 2016, shows the blurred image of the diplomat convicted of sexually harassing a minor while he was stationed in Chile. The captured footage was released by a Chilean broacasting company. The court said he has seriously undermined the integrity of diplomats as public servants and tainted the country's reputation. The ruling on Park is expected to affect the investigations and their subsequent court proceedings for other similar sexual assault cases involving diplomats that have been laid bare in recent months. A separate probe is under way into an ambassador to Ethiopia, after allegations were raised that he sexually harassed one of his subordinates at his home last month.

The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's ruling on Kim Hyung-joon, who was put behind bars for 2 1/2 years, and sentenced him to one-year imprisonment suspended for two years. Prosecutors had sought a seven-year prison term for Kim. The appeals court also reduced Kim's forfeiture from 27 million won  to 9.98 million won and his fine from 50 million won to 15 million won. Kim Hyung-joon, a former prosecutor convicted of receiving bribes from a friend, enters the Seoul High Court ahead of his appeals ruling on Aug. 10, 2017. Kim was found guilty early this year of receiving some 27 million won worth of bribes from his high school friend, identified only by his surname Kim. In return, the former prosecutor promised to lobby for him over the fraud and embezzlement allegations the friend had faced. Kim was removed from his post last year after the allegations surfaced. The high court also commuted the friend's sentence from eight months in prison imposed by the lower court to a fine of 10 million won and freed him. The upper court judged that part of the money Kim had sent to the former prosecutor was not kickbacks but a loan that was personally extended to a pal. It cited one of the text messages between the two defendants in which Kim was asking the ex-prosecutor to pay back the ""borrowed"" money. ""Although the defendant brought disgrace on his fellow prosecutors and undermined public trust,  took into account that the relationship of the defendants is based on friendship for more than 30 years, which may have made Kim overlook what's right and wrong, and be less wary,"" the judge said.","prison term for bribery ,bribery was freed thursday ,frees former prosecutor indicted ,prosecutor serving prison term ,prosecutor indicted for bribery","['Seoul', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Kim Hyung - joon', 'Kim']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.0938331  -0.09173848

At the press briefing held at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il issued the apology for prosecutors’ past wrongdoings for the first time as an incumbent chief prosecutor and laid out plans to reform the prosecution. “I apologize to the public for not fulfilling its duty to abide by the law and protect human rights in some of the political cases under the past authoritarian governments,” said Moon, who took office as the top prosecutor in early July.  Moon Moo-il The prosecution has been criticized for aligning with military-backed governments for decades until the 1980s and falsely accusing pro-democracy activists and political dissenters, which led to wrongful convictions and retrials. Moon referred to the Inhyeokdang case, or People’s Revolutionary Party case, as one of such cases. In 1975, 25 anti-government protestors were indicted for attempting to overthrow the authoritarian Park Chung-hee government under North Korea’s instruction in violation of the anti-communist security law. Eight were sentenced to death and executed the next day.The rest were acquitted in a 2007 retrial. A Seoul court said that they were coerced into making confessions by investigators‘ torture. The apology comes in line with the top prosecutor’s determination to make the prosecution more transparent and politically neutral. The prosecution has been accused of being politically motivated and holding too much power with its exclusive authority to indict. “For major cases attracting public attention, the prosecution will adopt a system in which external experts review the general process of investigation and indictments,” Moon said in reference to an independent body composed of outside experts. The prosecution will also launch a prosecution reform committee consisting of external specialists and introduce a system in which corruption and irregularities in the prosecution are inspected by an external force.The plans include an expansion of the range of investigation records open to the public and reduction of the size of units considered the most powerful within the organization, which have dealt with large-scale corruption cases and high-profile scandals involving top business groups and political bigwigs. The prosecution reform is one of the major election promises by President Moon Jae-in. Public distrust of the prosecution hit rock bottom in recent months in the wake of the corruption scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye, her confidante Choi Soon-sil, business tycoons and high-ranking government officials. There has been criticism that the prosecution was lukewarm in investigating cases in connection with the scandal and being politicized in favor of the Park administration and major conglomerates.Park and Choi, who are both arrested, are standing trial for bribery, coercion and abuse of power, among other charges, with ruling expected in October. As for a possible additional probe into the corruption scandal, the top prosecutor maintained a reserved stance. “The prosecution will decide whether to additionally investigate the case after reviewing investigation results, records and newly found evidence,” he said.

""I feel regrettable and do apologize that the prosecution did not fulfill its duty to adhere to legal procedures and protect human rights in some of the past political cases during authoritarian governments,"" Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il said at a press briefing. It is the first time in the country's history that an incumbent head of the prosecution has issued an apology over its own past shortcomings.  Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il speaks during a press briefing held in the Supreme Prosecutors` Office in southern Seoul on Aug. 8, 2017. South Korean prosecutors are blamed for having realigned themselves with military governments in the 1970s and 1980s that ordered brutal crackdowns on political opponents by accusing them of pro-communist tendencies. The new chief prosecutor, who was appointed by President Moon Jae-in late last month, has vowed to overhaul the law enforcement by boosting transparency and independence away from local politics. His pledge comes in step with the liberal president's policy to reform the prosecution that has long been blamed for being swayed by politics and monopoly of its investigative authority. He mentioned two cases as examples of such mistakes, both of which have led to a retrial of the defendants who were recently acquitted of their charges. To prevent the recurrence of such errors, Moon said he will turn the prosecution into one that keeps its political neutrality. ""I will make sure we work by the principle that we show everything over the course of the investigation in the way they are,"" he said. ""I will also adopt a probe review panel made up of outside experts who will review the process from the investigation to indictment for cases that draw public attention."" The chief prosecutor also stressed he will work to bring a change into the investigation process from relying on reports to judging by the evidence.","top prosecutor apologized tuesday ,korea top prosecutor apologized ,prosecutor apologized tuesday for ,top prosecutor apologizes over ,prosecutor apologizes over coercive","[""South Korea 's""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22796299  0.26851636

The court will rule on Aug. 25.At the final hearing held at the Seoul Central District Court, Special Counsel Park Young-soo said that the Samsung Electronics vice chairman was a direct beneficiary and final decision maker in the bribery scheme.“Samsung Group voluntarily offered funds rather than gave in to former President Park’s threats, expecting to get help in the group’s leadership transfer, after it received a request from  Park,” he said during the hearing, calling it “a typical case showing cozy relations between politics and business.”Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., enters the courthouse in Seoul on Aug. 7, 2017, for his trial over bribery and other charges in connection with former President Park Geun-hye. The 49-year-old billionaire heir was indicted on Feb. 28 on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury for allegedly seeking political favors from the Park administration in return for paying or promising to pay 43.4 billion won in donations to foundations controlled by Park’s close confidante Choi Soon-sil and in sports sponsorship to Choi’s horse-riding daughter.Special Counsel claimed that the money was a bribe to win the government’s backing for the 2015 merger of Samsung Group’s two affiliates -- Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T; -- a crucial step for a smooth leadership transition from its ailing chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son, Lee Jae-yong. Former President Park, in return for the money, is suspected of having pressured the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder in Samsung C&T;, to vote in favor of the controversial merger.“I have never expected or asked the president for any favors whether it was for my private interest or for myself,” Lee said in his tearful final remark during the hearing. “However foolish I am, how can I inflict damage on the national pension, which is our Korean ordinary people’s retirement savings?”Lee choked up with emotion and had to take a sip of water several times to calm himself during his five-minute speech as he vehemently denied all charges. “While standing trial for the past few months, it was difficult to grasp complicated legal arguments and I cannot admit to my charges, but there is one thing I realized. I have too many shortcomings, I did not take care of things I had to care of and it is all my fault,” he said.Lee has maintained that he had not been involved in making decisions to offer donations to the Choi-controlled entities, had no favors to ask for in return and was not even aware of Choi and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra’s existence.This composite photo, filed on Aug. 3, 2017, shows from L to R Samsung Group heir Lee Jae-yong; Choi Gee-sung, former head of Samsung`s control tower Future Strategy Office; Chang Choong-ki, then its vice head; and Samsung Electronics executives Park Sang-jin and Hwang Sung-soo. Lee’s lawyer Song Woo-chul called Samsung Group, the nation’s top conglomerate, a “victim” and dismissed the counsel team’s accusations as lacking solid evidence. “We think that the special counsel made a mistake of relying on the public sentiment,” the lawyer said, stressing the accusation is only based on the counsel’s “assumption” and “prejudice” toward Samsung Group and its young heir.On Monday, the prosecution also sought prison terms of seven to 10 years for four other Samsung former and current executives, including former Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung and former Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin. The officials have consistently argued that they had been forced to provide donations out of fear of former President Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil, and denied their chief Lee’s part in Samsung Group’s controversial decisions. A total of 59 witnesses were called in to testify and investigation records of about 30,000 pages were reviewed through 53 regular hearings and 3 preparatory hearings since the trial kicked off on March 9. The ruling, due later this month, is expected to serve as a barometer for the fate of ex-President Park and her friend Choi, who were arrested and put on trial in connection with the scandal. Park, who was removed from office in March over the corruption scandal, is on a total of 18 charges including bribery and abuse of authority. She is suspected of pulling strings to benefit Samsung.  If Lee is found guilty, it will likely deal a heavy blow to Park, who is accused of conspiring with Choi and Lee to make the alleged money-for-political favors deal. The ruling on Park is expected in October. It is not yet decided whether the verdict hearing for Lee and Samsung executives will be televised. According to a recent change in court rules, it is now possible to broadcast live sentencing hearings deemed crucial for public interest.

According to a special task force on the reform of the National Intelligence Service on Thursday, the NIS created as many as 30 units dedicated to posting online comments in favor of the then-conservative administration. The units then hired more than 3,500 civilians to post such comments on portal sites, such as Naver and Daum, and social media, such as Twitter. The teams were created in May 2009 and continued their work until December 2012, when the candidate from Lee’s ruling camp, Park Geun-hye, won the presidential election, the task force said. The findings appear to confirm the allegation that the NIS abused its power to interfere with domestic politics and add weight to the suspicion that former President Lee and his presidential office greenlighted the illegal activities.Lee and his aides had yet to make any public comments as of Friday afternoon. The NIS chief at the time of the suspected activity, Won Sei-hoon, is currently on trial for meddling in the 2012 election. Prosecutors demanded a four-year jail term for him. The top court is to rule on Aug. 30.“We believe  is the tip of the iceberg, but still it is extremely shocking,” said Kim Hyun, spokesperson of the current ruling, liberal Democratic Party of Korea. “Those involved should come forward and tell the truth before it is too late.” Dubbed “outer cyber teams,” the units consisted of civilians, such as retired military officers, office workers, housewives and self-employed entrepreneurs. They were paid up to 300 million won  per month and worked under the NIS’ psychological operations department. According to the task force, the NIS was also involved in monitoring the activities of liberal politicians from the then-opposition parties, such as Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and Sohn Hak-kyu, who headed the Democratic Party at the time. The spy agency documented their surveillance information and reported it to the presidential office of the Lee administration, the task force added. Besides eavesdropping on the politicians, the report also included an analysis of how to use social networks for a political campaign. “The report is designed to propose an election strategy for the ruling party’s candidates during general and presidential elections,” said the task force. The political meddling scandal involving the NIS was revealed for the first time in December 2012 when the nation was gearing up for the presidential election. Former NIS chief Won was indicted in 2013 on charges of ordering an online smear campaign against opposition candidates, mainly then-presidential candidate Moon Jae-in, who is now president. Won was sentenced to three years in prison by the Seoul High Court in early 2015. But the Supreme Court returned his case to the lower court in July, saying the evidence that led to his conviction could not be seen as valid.Prosecutors argued that Won was guilty based on emails retrieved from an NIS officer’s computer that contained hundreds of Twitter IDs and his instructions on online comments. But the top court overruled the claim, saying there was no evidence to substantiate the documents were written upon Won’s orders. By Yeo Jun-suk","election meddling scandal calls ,intelligence service on thursday ,500 member cyber team ,nis election meddling scandal ,election meddling scandal","['Lee Myung - bak', 'Lee Myung - bak', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'NIS']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22077565  0.18615359

During his trial at a Seoul court Thursday, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee denied the bribery charges, saying he had never expected or asked ...","Lee Jae-yong, Samsung Group’s heir apparent on trial over an alleged money-for-political favors deal with former President Park Geun-hye, said Thursday that he was scolded by Park for not offering enough support for equestrian sports during a one-on-one meeting in 2015. During his trial at a Seoul court Thursday, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee denied the bribery charges, saying he had never expected or asked for favors from the Park administration in return for donations to foundations controlled by Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil, or sports sponsorship to Choi’s horse-riding daughter.  Lee Jae-yong He said he was in no position to ask for any political favors from Park, as the former leader kept rebuking him on matters like the Korea Equestrian Federation or a local TV network that his uncle owns. He said he was “irritated” by Park’s behavior, because he thought it was not even “a big deal.” “I have been scolded often by my father and Chairman Lee Kun-hee. But I have never been scolded by anyone else. I don’t know whether it is appropriate to say, but it was my first time that I had been reproached by a woman,” Lee recalled while testifying at the Seoul Central District Court. Asked why he then told Samsung Group’s Park Sang-jin, a Samsung Electronics president who served as the head of the Korea Equestrian Federation to “handle” it, he said, “I could not completely ignore the president.” The de facto chief of Samsung Group, who is on trial for bribery, embezzlement and perjury, revealed more details of what had been discussed during his one-on-one meetings with Park to refute the prosecution’s accusation.The prosecution charged Lee Jae-yong with paying or promising to pay 43.3 billion won in donations to foundations controlled by Cho, and in sponsorship of the equestrian body. Much of the sponsorship was used for Choi’s daughter and dressage player Chung Yoo-ra, the prosecution said. While Samsung Group claimed that it had been forced to offer the donations out of fear of Park and Choi, and had no favors to ask in return, the prosecution sees the money as a bribe to win the government’s backing for a merger of its two affiliates -- Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T.; The prosecution argued that Samsung Group needed the state-funded National Pension Service, the largest stakeholder of Samsung C&T;, to be in favor of the 2015 merger, a crucial step for a smooth power transfer from its ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son, Lee Jae-yong. Asked whether he expected any help from the government in return for meeting Park’s demands, the junior Lee simply said, “No.” “It was not at all a situation” in which I could have brought up issues facing Samsung Group, he said of the meetings with Park on three occasions. According to Lee Jae-yong’s testimony, in the second meeting that took place in July 2015, Park scolded Lee, requesting more support for the equestrian body. The third meeting, which happened in February, was dominated by Park furiously criticizing news coverage critical of the Park administration by a cable-TV JTBC. Lee said Park asked him to stop Hong Seok-hyun, former head of JTBC and Lee’s uncle, from doing so. There were no mentions of specific names of Choi, Chung or any of the foundations controlled by Choi or her niece Chang Si-ho by Park during their meetings, he said. He did not even know of their existence and only found out that the sponsorship was mainly for Chung after the corruption scandal surfaced, he said.“I think I heard Park saying something about supporting sports and cultural prosperity, but I have no memory of her speaking about donations to foundations,” he said. Lee denied his part in the top conglomerate’s controversial decisions ranging from the merger to dubious donations, shifting responsibility to Choi Gee-sung, head of the now-defunct future strategy office, the group’s powerful organ in charge of key personnel appointments and general management. “From the beginning, I belonged to Samsung Electronics. I have never been part of the future strategy office. Some 95 percent of my work was related to Samsung Electronics and the group’s other affiliates,” Lee said during the trial Wednesday. Choi Gee-sung admitted that he had been the final decision maker for Samsung Group, saying Samsung Group’s heir apparent had no idea about any wrongdoings. Samsung Group’s former and current officials, who are on trial on charges of bribery along with their de facto chief Lee, all claimed innocence and denied Lee’s part in an apparent attempt to save their boss from the fiasco. The special counsel and Lee’s lawyers will make final arguments over key points in the courtroom Thursday and Friday. The prosecution is set to make a sentence demand for Lee and Samsung’s other officials during the final hearing Monday. The ruling is expected at the end of August.It is not yet decided whether the verdict hearing will be televised. According to a recent change in court rules, it is now possible to broadcast live sentencing hearings deemed crucial for public interest.

The prosecution said there was no evidence that the party’s co-founders Ahn and Park Jie-won, or Rep. Lee Yong-ju who led the campaign team, had been a part of the fabrication scheme. Four days ahead of the May 9 election, the centrist opposition party revealed that Moon, then the front-runner for the Democratic Party of Korea, peddled influence to get his son hired at a state-run agency in 2006. He was then a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. The party disclosed an audio file as evidence in which a person, who claims to be a schoolmate of Moon’s son, Joon-yong, from Parsons School of Design in New York, said Moon’s son had landed a job at the Korea Employment Information Service due to his father’s influence.The recording had been fabricated by the People’s Party’s Lee You-mi and the schoolmate of the younger Moon in the audio file turned out to actually be her brother, according to the prosecution. The party’s former Supreme Council member Lee Joon-seo willfully neglected the possibility that the tip-off had been falsified, it said.The prosecution filed charges against five people -- including Lee Joon-seo, Lee You-mi and her brother -- for conspiring to fabricate evidence to smear Moon on the campaign trail. The prosecution charged them with violation of the election law for spreading false information, saying the party officials had disclosed the phony audio file without any efforts to verify its authenticity. An internal probe by the People’s Party also concluded that the fabrication was Lee You-mi’s lone act. Lee, however, claimed the party’s leadership ordered her to do so. The People’s Party later formally issued an apology for the fabrication, promising to start anew, following a party meeting Monday afternoon.“We deeply apologize for causing trouble to the public with the tip-off fabrication case that took place during the presidential campaign,” it said in a statement, acknowledging its responsibility for failing to “filter illegal acts by a party member.”Allegations surrounding Moon’s son had been one of the key points of attack against then-front-runner Moon during the presidential campaign period.The scandal placed the People’s Party into a crisis 1 1/2 years after its launch. Its support rating stood at 4.9 percent, according to a survey by Realmeter on 2,448 people aged 19 or over from July 24-28.By Ock Hyun-ju","presidential campaign in may ,the prosecution concluded monday ,fake tipoff about president ,office indicted former lawmaker ,during the presidential campaign","['People ’s Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'May.', 'the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Kim Seong - ho', 'Kim In - won']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62288141  0.11745791

In a retrial against ex-National Intelligence Agency chief Won Sei-hoon, the prosecution also demanded a four-year disqualification on the defendant. Won was indicted in 2013 on charges of interfering in the 2012 presidential election by instructing his subordinates to post political comments online in a bid to sway public opinion in favor of then ruling party contender Park Geun-hye.  Former NIS chief Won Sei-hoon enters the courthouse for a retrial on his election-meddling scandal in Seoul on July 24, 2017. The 66-year-old was sentenced to three years in prison by the Seoul High Court in early 2015. But the Supreme Court sent back his case to the lower court in July, saying that the evidence that led to his conviction cannot be seen as valid.The prosecution argued that Won was guilty based on the attached email files retrieved from an NIS officer's computer that contained hundreds of Twitter IDs and directions on writing online comments. But the top court overruled the claim citing there was no evidence to substantiate the documents were written upon Won's order or that he was actually involved in the operations. Won headed the NIS from 2009 to 2013 under the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration. On Monday, the court accepted a fresh set of evidence submitted by the prosecution that includes an audio recording of an NIS meeting. According to the prosecution, the audio tape has Won mentioning the importance of ""psychological warfare on the public.""Won initially received a suspended sentence in 2014 for intervening in politics in breach of the NIS law. But he was additionally convicted of willful negligence and violation of election law in an appeal that had immediately put him behind bars.He served about eight months before he was released on bail in October 2015. ""I tried hard to stay neutral from politics and elections,"" Won said during the final hearing, denying the allegations raised against him. The court will deliver the final ruling on Aug. 30.","over election meddling prosecutors ,demanded four year disqualification ,four years in jail ,jail over an election ,election meddling prosecutors","['Seoul', ""South Korea 's"", 'Won Sei - hoon', 'Won']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.30039456 -0.05033146

The woman was known to have been excessively intoxicated when it happened.  An investigation is also underway into separate sexual harassment suspicions involving the country's ambassador to Ethiopia.The allegations were raised in the process of a probe into the rape case and a team of investigators will be soon sent to the African country to question the ambassador.

The Seoul High Court sentenced Jin Kyung-joon, an ex-senior official of the Justice Ministry, to seven years behind bars, ordering him to forfeit 500 million won  and pay a fine of 600 million won. He was given a four-year jail term by the lower court in December.The court also overturned the not-guilty ruling on Kim Jung-ju, the founder of South Korea's major online game publisher Nexon Co., and sentenced him to two years in prison with a three-year probation for offering bribes to Jin.  This graphic shows a photo of former prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon, convicted of bribery charges on July 21, 2017, superimposed over an image of a courtroom. Jin, 50, was indicted in July last year on charges of receiving some 950 million won in kickbacks from Kim, current chairman of Nexon's holding firm NXC Corp., from 2005 to 2014. They have been friends since college.He was also accused of peddling influence with the former vice president of Korean Air Lines Co. to sign contract deals worth some 10 billion won in total with a company owned by his brother-in-law. The lower court found Jin guilty only of the latter charge, saying that there is not enough evidence to prove Kim asked any favors or that Jin exerted influence for him.But the appeals court found the ex-prosecutor guilty of receiving a high-end sedan and some 50 million won from his friend for travel expenses. It sustained the prosecution's argument that Kim's offers may well have been intended as favors. The prosecution has claimed that Kim paid travel expenses for Jin's family on over a dozen separate occasions spread over more than 10 years. Kim also gave him the car that was leased under his company name for free, they said. Still, the court ruled Jin was not guilty of taking about 850 million won from a third party to purchase unlisted Nexon shares in 2005, citing a lack of evidence to prove that Kim provided the money. Prosecutors have said that Kim lent him the funds from his company assets and repaid the money on Jin's behalf. The purchase of some 8,500 shares in Nexon Japan turned into a jackpot, earning Jin some 12 billion won in profit after the company went public.","disgraced ex prosecutor guilty ,prosecutor guilty of bribery ,bribery disgraced former ranking ,finds disgraced ex prosecutor ,disgraced former ranking prosecutor","['the Seoul High Court', 'Jin Kyung - joon', 'the Justice Ministry']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28164896 -0.03053761

The complaint requests the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office to investigate presidential spokesperson Park Soo-hyun and others involved in two live press briefings held on the discoveries, in two batches, and the content of the dossiers, purportedly complied during the Park Geun-hye administration.  Presidential spokesperson Park Soo-hyun Cheong Wa Dae revealed on Friday and Monday that it has found documents, totaling over 1,600, that appear to contain information related to former President Park’s scandal, which led to her impeachment and is now being dealt with in a criminal trial. “Presidential spokesperson Park Soo-hyun on Friday and Monday  opened what handwritten memos contained,” the conservative Liberty Korea Party claimed in a press statement, calling for a prosecutorial investigation. “Park, colluding with unknown presidential officials, submitted the approximately 1,660 copies of the documents to special prosecutor .”Their actions were in violation of the Management of Presidential Archives Act, which prohibits concealing or divulging of presidential records without permission, the party claimed. A violation is punishable by a seven year imprisonment or a fine of up to 20 million won . Announcing the discoveries, Cheong Wa Dae claimed that the documents were not classified as records subject to the 30-year secrecy rule and that they contain information that could affect the ongoing trial. Not all presidential records are subject to the non-disclosure rule. Documents are classified into three categories and those classified as “regular” can be made public. Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of Liberty Korea Party, countered the presidential office’s claim. “Cheong Wa Dae claims they are not protected by the presidential record management law, but who determines whether a document is subject to the law or now. Certainly, it should not be those who are now occupying the Blue House,” he said. Its chief Hong Joon-pyo called the act a political vendetta against the previous administration. “The political retaliation  that has been repeating every five years under the five-year term presidency starts now,” he said. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea expressed regret over the opposition’s leakage claim. “The core of the problem is that the documents may contain the truth about the corruption scandal and that Cheong Wa Dae  was behind them at the time. It is regretful that the opposition is misleading it as only a mere leakage issue,” the party chief Rep. Choo Mi-ae said in the party meeting on Wednesday. The Presidential Archive under the National Archives of Korea announced in May the completion of the reception of some 11.06 million records created by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae and other agencies.By Jo He-rim","officials for leaking presidential ,for leaking presidential records ,leaking presidential records ,leaking presidential records of ,house officials for leaking","['Liberty Korea Party', 'Blue House', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Park Soo - hyun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19747952  0.00185511

Both Lee Jae-yong and the former president deny the charges. “We attempted to execute the warrant to take her to the court, but she refused the order by submitting a document citing health reasons,” the counsel team said.Park missed three out of four court hearings of her own trial last week, citing pain in one of her toes.

""No matter how deep you dig a well, it's nothing other than a failure unless you find water in the spring. I ask all of you to join and take the lead in completing the task toward reform to the end,"" he said in an inauguration speech.Park was officially appointed by President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday. The former university professor, well-versed in civic activism, was Moon's second pick after his previous nominee, law professor Ahn Kyong-whan, quit amid mounting criticism over his ethical lapses and past sexiest remarks. Justice Minister Park Sang-ki speaks during his inauguration ceremony held in the ministry building in Gwacheon, south of Seoul, on July 19, 2017. Park pledged to push reform drives to turn the ministry into a more independent administrative body away from the influence of the prosecution. He is only the second civilian to take helm of the Justice Ministry in the country's history. Most of the former ministers were picked from among prosecutors, hence giving the prosecution huge clout in the ministry as well as law enforcement. The new justice minister said he will make his best efforts in setting up an anti-corruption body to investigate cases involving high-level public officials, one of the initiatives put forward by the Moon administration as part of its bid to stamp out irregularities in ranking public servants. ""We should ask ourselves to be stricter, with fairness and integrity,"" he added. He also vowed to sternly deal with any wrongdoings, criticizing the massive corruption scandal in the defense industry currently under investigation by the prosecution. ""Corruption in the defense industry is a serious crime that hinders our military capabilities and benefits the enemy. We must root out anything that produces corruption through tougher punishment on high-profile cases,"" Park said.","an inauguration speech park ,in an inauguration speech ,an inauguration speech ,of revamping the prosecution ,inauguration speech park",['Park Sang - ki'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39462164 -0.10173269

The effects are reversible when the person stops taking the drug.South Korea became the first Asian country to introduce it in 2011, after several high-profile sex crimes against minors. The revision bill also seeks to allow those serving prison terms on the anti-libido medication to request for the termination of the treatment six to nine months prior to the end of their jail time. Whether this is allowed is determined through psychiatric assessment by mental health professionals and the chief of the probation office.However, opponents have raised questions over chemical castration due to the possible infringement of sex offenders’ human rights and the high cost of medication. Some medical experts also say that a clear cause-and-effect relationship between testosterone levels and sexual offenses remains uncertain, with a lack of sufficient research into the effectiveness and side effects of such treatments.According to data from the Justice Ministry, those who took sex hormone-regulating medicine saw their testosterone levels drop to a one-eighth level over a nine-month period in 2013.By Kim Da-sol","years for assaulting minors ,law convicted sex offenders ,on tuesday for submission ,15 years for assaulting ,for assaulting minors under","['South Korea', 'Cabinet']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.07867604 -0.16498312

Dozens of investigators were dispatched to the five firms mostly based in South Gyeongsang Province, also home to KAI, securing account books, supply-related documents and digital files and mobile phones of involved officials. KAI is suspected to have given contracts to the suppliers without a fair bidding process and taken bribery and kickbacks from them. Prosecutors also searched its Sacheon headquarters and Seoul office Friday over allegations that the company made at least 24 billion won  in illicit profits by inflating development costs for such products as the Surion utility helicopters, T-50 supersonic trainer jets and FA-50 light attack planes. The prosecution is also believed to be looking into the possibility that KAI Chief Executive Ha Sung-yong created slush funds and inappropriately lobbied Cheong Wa Dae officials and lawmakers for his reappointment in May 2016. He has been barred from overseas travel upon prosecutors’ request.The probe came as President Moon Jae-in steps up efforts to stamp out rampant industry corruption for which he unveiled plans on Monday to revive an intra-agency panel after a 10-year hiatus. Since the campaign period, he has singled out irregularities in military procurement deals as one of the “deep-rooted evils” to be eradicated. “Defense industry corruption is not just corruption but an act of benefiting the enemy that would punch a hole in national security,” the president said at a meeting of senior secretaries and advisers, calling for an independent audit and investigation, as well as institutional prevention measures by the panel.The sector has been blamed for cultivating a cozy relationship between former and incumbent military commanders and industry executives often involving kickbacks for fake performance certificates or slackened test rules. Among the raided five subcontractors, two were founded or owned by former KAI officials close to Ha. One of the firms was set up in 2013, shortly after Ha took office, and its annual revenues, most of which come from supplies to KAI, have since more than doubled to 9.2 billion won in 2016 from 3.9 billion won in 2014. A senior official at KAI is also alleged to have embezzled more than 20 billion won by giving inflated orders to a service contractor he established under the name of his brother-in-law. He has vanished since the probe was incepted.

""Had there been even 1 slight percent chance of the tipoff being made up, who would've dared to arrange a press conference?,"" Kim told reporters in strong denial of the accusation as he entered the prosecution building. Kim Seong-ho, a People`s Party member who was in charge of the election panel during the May presidential election, answers questions from reporters as he enters the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors` Office for questioning over his involvement in a fake tipoff scandal on July 18, 2017. He also said that Ahn Cheol-soo, former presidential contender for the party, is ""unrelated"" to the scandal and that the panel decided to disclose the tip-off. ""The panel made its best efforts in the verification,"" Kim added.The People's Party made the revelation four days before the election and accused Moon of exerting influence on the hiring as a presidential secretary at that time. Kim was one of the party members who went public with the disinformation in two press conferences, presenting as evidence an audio file and captured mobile chats the party had claimed to be from Moon's friend. The tipoff turned out to have been concocted by Lee You-mi, now-detained former campaigner for then-presidential contender Ahn Cheol-soo, as she confessed to doctoring the evidence. The prosecution accuses Kim of spreading false information in breach of the election law. They also believe that the election panel turned a blind eye to the possibility that the tipoff could be untrue and pressed ahead with exposing it. The prosecution said they will also investigate the extent to which Kim and others in the election panel had communicated with the party's leadership about the tipoff. On Sunday, they called in Kim In-won, then a vice head of the election panel, for questioning into the case. The prosecution has also arrested another party member, Lee Jun-seo, for suspected involvement in the case.","prosecutors on tuesday questioned ,tipoff prosecutors on tuesday ,fake tipoff prosecutors on ,smear campaign against president ,over fake tipoff prosecutors","[""People 's Party"", 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim Seong - ho', ""the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ' Office""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28046316  0.30565256

The discovery of the documents immediately drew spotlight as both Park and Lee are detained and standing trial on bribery charges in relation to the merger approval. The prosecution has accused Park of lending support to the deal in exchange for money from Lee. Presidential office Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun shows part of the documents purported to have been written by the previous Park Geun-hye government regarding the controversial merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, at a press briefing on July 14, 2017. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it received part of the documents from the independent counsel team in charge of the high-profile scandal and that it is planning to carry out a detailed analysis to verify the documents. The presidential office said earlier that they handed over copies of the documents to the special probe team. Following the authentication process, the prosecution is expected to decide whether they will submit any of them to the court as evidence against the former president and the Samsung scion. There is also a possibility that the prosecution may use the documents as probable cause to further tie Woo Byung-woo, then presidential secretary for civil affairs who is at the center of the scandal, to the case. Woo is being investigated without detention over a string of charges including dereliction of duty in connection with the scandal.","samsung prosecutors said monday ,documents on samsung prosecutors ,prosecutors launch probe over ,bribery scandal that removed ,friday the presidential office","['Park Geun - hye', 'Samsung', 'Cheong', 'Moon Jae - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.70754117  0.30628678

On Friday, the Blue House disclosed the discovery of documents in an unused cabinet in an office used by civil affairs aides. It also revealed the discovery of the memo reading “Samsung’s management rights inheritance” followed by an arrow pointing to the words “use as an opportunity.” According to Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Park Soo-hyun, the memo goes on, “Determine what Samsung requires in passing on management rights, and help  where possible. Seek ways for Samsung to contribute more to the country’s economy.”  Cheong Wa Dae`s spokesperson Park Soo-hyun. YonhapAugust 2014 is nearly three months after Samsung tycoon Lee Kun-hee suffered a near-fatal heart attack. He is still hospitalized. It is also one month before former President Park had a one-on-one meeting with Lee’s only son, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong. Special prosecutor Park Young-soo, investigating the former president’s alleged corruption, attempted to search Cheong Wa Dae on suspicions of money-for-political favors deals between the then-state chief and major conglomerates, including Samsung, but couldn’t gain access due to the office’s rejection. The former president and the Samsung heir are both now on trial on suspicion that Samsung provided bribes, disguised as donations and sports sponsorships, in return for the administration’s support of the group’s succession plan. August 2014 is also a time that Woo Byung-woo, pinpointed as a key figure in the former president’s scandal, was in charge of the civil affairs office at Cheong Wa Dae.

He said he would take ""political and moral"" responsibility, but apparently denied his involvement.","scandal prosecutors on saturday ,fake tipoff scandal prosecutors ,doctored tipoff against president ,prosecutors on saturday questioned ,election campaigner over fake","[""the People 's Party"", ""the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Kim In - won', ""Moon Jae - in 's""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42221233  0.41115928

On Friday, Lee Yoo-mi, a rank-and-file member of the People’s Party, was indicted on charges of fabricating evidence to smear President Moon Jae-in’s son during the presidential election. Lee was found to have fabricated evidence, including a voice recording, to back the allegation that Moon’s son Joon-yong was unfairly hired at a public agency with the help of his father. With a former member of the party’s supreme council, Lee Joon-seo, also under arrest, the possibility of party leaders becoming implicated is growing. “If the party is found to have intervened in the fabrication, I will lead the breakup of this party,” interim chief Rep. Park Joo-sun had said after the scandal broke out last month.  Rep. Hwang Young-cheul of Bareun Party Rival parties harshly criticized the party’s leadership, claiming the party leadership is trying to avoid responsibility over the incident and are trying to cut ties to the rank-and-file members.The former chief and presidential candidate Ahn Cheol-soo of the 40-member People’s Party had apologized over the party’s fabricated smear campaign on Wednesday. He said he would take both political and moral responsibility, but the party’s approval rating fell to the lowest among the parties in the Assembly. As the People’s Party faces the biggest crisis of its short existence, a heavyweight of the conservative Bareun Party has come under the scrutiny of the authorities. The Chuncheon District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday summoned Bareun Rep. Hwang Young-cheul over his suspected breach of the Political Fund Law. He is suspected to have spent 200 million won  from the salaries of his aids. The prosecution said he was investigated over whether he had ordered his secretary, only identified by her surname Kim, to collect the money to cover the office operating expenses. The 56-year-old secretary was arrested last month. The prosecution suspects that the three-term lawmaker had also used the money for personal uses, including is private trips. Hwang is reported to have denied the charges, saying Kim had acted independently. If convicted, Rep. Hwang will lose his lawmaker status, as the law stipulates. This would cost the Bareun Party much of its influence, as it would take the number of lawmakers below the quota needed to register as a negotiation body at the National Assembly. Obtaining the negotiation body status in South Korean parliament means the party is eligible for state subsidies and is given the power to reflect opinions on the operation of the parliament. The party members can also participate in the special committees. There are currently four political negotiation bodies -- ruling Democratic Party of Korea, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, People’s Party and Bareun Party. The progressive Justice Party also holds six parliamentary seats but is not registered as a negotiation bloc. The two minor opposition parties currently have less than 10 percent of an approval rating in polls. The centrist liberal People’s Party garnered 5 percent in the latest poll by Gallup on released Friday, as Bareun Party posted a slightly higher rate at 9 percent. The ruling Democratic Party leads the list with 49 percent, as the main opposition Liberty Korea Party follows along with its conservative rival at 9 percent.

Lee is suspected of handing over 43.3 billion won  in bribes to organizations controlled by Choi in order to get a contentious merger approved between Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries.Part of the money was provided to pay for horses for Choi’s equestrian daughter Chung Yoo-ra, as well as to sponsor Core Sports, a German agency run by Choi.A former health minister has been convicted of abusing his power by pressuring state-run National Pension Service, world’s third-largest pension fund and the largest shareholder of one of the two affiliates, to support the controversial merger of two Samsung Group-affiliated companies.During the investigation earlier this year, Kim, then-professor of international trade at Seoul’s Hansung University, testified to the independent counsel that the NPS has no panel of experts in asset management to speak up in the decision-making process, making it vulnerable to outside peddling influence.The probe team sees the merger a crucial step for Lee to smooth the transfer of power from his father and the group’s chairman Lee Kun-hee.The scandal later removed former President Park from office on March 10, which triggered the earlier-than-scheduled May 9 presidential election.Earlier on Wednesday, Chung Yoo-ra, Choi’s daughter, made a surprising visit to the Seoul Central District Court in the morning as a witness of the counsel team in Lee’s trial.Chung revealed details regarding Samsung’s support for her training, including the provision of three expensive horses.In her testimony, Chung said that her mother met former Samsung Electronics president Park Sang-jin and former executive director Hwang Sung-soo to discuss the sponsorship, dealing Lee a huge blow to the ongoing trial.The court will wrap up the trial of Lee in August.By Bak Se-hwan","bribery trial of samsung ,antirust watchdog testified friday ,friday at the bribery ,at the bribery trial ,korea antirust watchdog testified","['Kim Sang - jo', 'South Korea ’s', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.0581162  0.10014666 0.15291724],Bak Se-hwan,Social affairs,7,2017,"friday at the bribery trial ,korea antirust watchdog testified friday ,bribery trial of samsung electronics ,testified friday at the bribery ,escorted to the seoul courtroom","['Kim Sang - jo', 'South Korea ’s', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'Kim Sang - jo', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Seoul', 'Samsung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Choi', 'Samsung C&T', 'Cheil Industries', 'Choi ’s', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Core Sports', 'german', 'Choi', 'National Pension Service', 'Samsung Group', 'Kim', 'Seoul ’s Hansung University', 'NPS', 'Lee', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi ’s', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee', 'Chung', 'Samsung', 'Chung', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Park Sang - jin', 'Hwang Sung - soo', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Bak Se - hwan']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.0581162  0.10014666 0.15291724]

KAI was involved in multiple projects to develop homegrown aircrafts such as transport utility helicopter Surion and supersonic combat jet T-50. Prosecutors have looked into the alleged fraud since the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea in 2015 implied KAI had extorted some 54.7 billion won  in sum, partly by fabricating the source of investments from the state-run Defense Acquisition Program Administration in the development project of Surion. KAI claimed the money is not illicitly gained, citing the risk of brokering the investors.This marks the first investigation since reformist prosecutor Yoon Seok-yeol was appointed as head of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors‘ Office. Yoon was a member of an independent counsel team to probe impeached President Park Geun-hye and her administration on corruption charges.KAI is the nation‘s only aircraft manufacturer, with its major stakeholder, the Export-Import Bank of Korea holding 26.41 percent of shares as of June 30, after 18.68 percent of shares were handed over from the former major shareholder, the Korea Development Bank.

The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's ruling, which found retired Adm. Choi Yoon-hee guilty of receiving 20 million won in bribes  from an arms broker, identified only by his family name Ham, in 2014. Choi, 64, was indicted in 2015 for exerting influence as then chief of the Navy on the military to adopt an untested Anglo-Italian AW159 Wildcat as the country's new multi-mission maritime helicopter, which was officially picked in 2013. He served as the JCS chief from 2013-2015.  Retired Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a smiling face, shakes hands with his acquaintances after he was acquitted by an appeals court of bribery charges in connection with a military chopper lobbying scandal, in Seoul on July 13, 2017. The prosecution has claimed that the money was provided in return for the favor. Choi said it was given to his son as a business investment. The appeals court ruled that the evidence falls short of substantiating the bribery charge beyond reasonable doubt and that it is probable it may have been paid as part of a business deal. The court also found Ham and the former head of a local defense research institute, both convicted of the same charge, not guilty, citing a lack of evidence. The prosecution said it will appeal the decision.Choi has been detained since November when the lower court sentenced him to one year in jail, only for the bribery charge. It dismissed another charge that he instructed his subordinates to inflate the assessment report on the chopper, citing a lack of evidence.He was ordered to pay a fine of 40 million won and forfeit 5 million won.  Choi's graft scandal led to a series of arrests and the imprisonment of other military officials who were involved in the selection process. The arms broker, identified only by his last name Ham, is also serving a two-year sentence.","chairman of bribery charges ,million won in bribes ,chief acquitted of bribery ,military chopper lobbying scandal ,bribery charges in military","['Seoul', 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Choi Yoon - hee', 'Choi']",4,"[ 1.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -9.06533678e-04

The Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea said it has requested the subway operator to dismiss the official, a 57-year old surnamed Cho, and impose severe disciplinary action on two other individuals linked to Cho’s alleged wrongdoings. Seoul Metro Cho is suspected to have influenced the bidding process for a 210 billion won  contract to manufacture trains for Subway Line No. 2, to the advantage of the company. In return, Cho demanded the supplier sell unlisted stocks of its sister companies to his brother-in-law, while also making it hire one of his family members. Seoul Metro publicly announced a bid to replace 200 cars for Subway Line No. 2 in February 2015. The company in question was selected at the end of March in the same year. Cho was in charge of the deal at the time.The inspection found out that Cho and the representative of the company had been in contact since 2014. In addition, the company has asked for Seoul Metro not to limit the bidding process to companies with experience of having supplied subway trains. The firm was selected to run the project after it established a consortium with another company which had no experience in subway train production. The subway operator accepted the request, allowing the consortium to win the bid. It had previously limited its selections to companies that have experience in building the cars, from 2004 to 2007.The audit agency revealed that the subway operator’s selection was unreasonable, as the firm was in financial difficulties at the time and was in court receivership. The company’s 48 electric cars that ran for Subway Line No. 7 frequently malfunctioned, with its failure rate appearing to be 10 times higher than other trains in Subway Lines Nos. 5 to 8 in 2015. “When making a contract on the car purchases, citizens’ safety must be considered as the top priority,” a BAI official said. “Cho’s act has caused a loss of objectivity and fairness, providing preferential treatment to a company that was criticized for a high rate of malfunctions.”Cho’s nephew is also found to have unfairly been hired by the company two years ago, despite his lack of experience in the field. During the inspection, Cho is reported to have raised objections to the audit agency. He was also preparing for possible administrative litigation.

His appalling two years in the oppressive, isolated state have come to the fore once again in the wake of the tragic death of Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American student, shortly after his release from 17 months of detention. For Bae, Warmbier’s fate felt more brutal and unjust because unlike him, the youngster had probably visited the reclusive regime out of sheer curiosity yet with little knowledge about its notorious practice of using Americans as bargaining chips. So the missionary and activist, who had retreated from the public eye for a while, opted to emerge back into the world, vowing not to “let his death be in vain.”“It was heartbreaking thinking about how such a heinous thing has happened. He’s so young and didn’t go there for his faith or religious mission like I did,” Bae said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald at his office in Seoul. “I’m also concerned about the remaining hostages, and something must be done to get them out as early as possible. What happened is not new -- it’s something the 24 million North Koreans endure every day but now is just being highlighted by the death of one young man.”  Kenneth Bae speaks during a recent interview with The Korea Herald at his office in Seoul. Until being captured in November 2012, Bae had run a North Korea tour agency in the Chinese border city of Dandong chiefly for Christian travelers from Western countries. As he sought to get through customs for his 18th visit with a small group of tourists, North Korean authorities took issue with his external hard drive. Among the files inside were a documentary of a starving young defector digging through garbage waste, and a religious letter that they wrongly believed carried instructions for some kind of military operation. Bae was taken into custody for intense questioning over charges of “plotting to overthrow the state” for about three weeks and then transferred to a safe house in Pyongyang. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. The long, drawn-out confinement began to erode his mentality slowly. Sleep deprivation and hard labor were dwarfed by fading hope, with his prosecutor constantly telling him “Nobody remembers you,” from which he drew the title of his 2016 book, “Not Forgotten.” “I knew I would get out but not when. They were saying almost every week things like, ‘Two years have passed and we have only 13 years to go,’ and ‘You can’t go home. I look forward to your 60th birthday party.’ It was psychological torture,” he said. “They had probably also threatened Warmbier to extract his confession, not through beating or other forms of physical violence, but as they did to me, saying they would shoot me to death or cut my throat.” Yet pain, seclusion and the utter absence of freedom could not crush his sense of mission. Rather, while detained, he started to map out his post-release life, reaching the conclusion he would work for the marginalized and voiceless, focusing on North Korean defectors. His determination began to materialize last year, when he founded a nongovernmental organization called the Nehemiah Global Initiative in the US. He has since joined forces with Serving Life International, a Seoul-based nongovernmental organization, where he now serves as co-president. “I was denied freedom only for two years but the vast majority of the population wouldn’t even have it for a moment in their lifetimes. So I’d pledged myself not to turn away from the reality or sit on my hands,” Bae said.“This is the path given by the God for me to take, and I will continue this job in Seoul until the two Koreas are united. And after the unification, I will go to Pyongyang and help the North Koreans, so right now I’m getting myself ready here for that.” At Serving Life, Bae focuses on three priorities: linking defector hopefuls with specialists to help them out of the country; helping the new arrivals with trauma therapy, employment and English studies; and “rebuilding” their lives as South Korean citizens fully incorporated in society. With English language being one of defectors’ biggest challenges here, the organization plans to run an event called “English Unification Camp” from Aug. 7-12, under which they will receive one-on-one tutoring and mentoring. Among the reasons he left the tourism business is his belief that foreign nationals, especially US citizens, should not travel to the communist state, given the risks of being locked up there and used as a political card. Calls are growing in Washington for a tour ban, with a bipartisan bill proposed at Congress. Robert King, special envoy for North Korea human rights at the US State Department, raised the need for a “differential” ban that exempts medical and other humanitarian visits during an interview with Voice of America released Friday. “It is not right to go there until the North Korean government takes steps to ensure that all foreigners would be safe and not be detained for unreasonable purposes,” Bae said. He was also adamant that humanitarian assistance and exchanges should take place, saying it is “worth taking a risk” because it enables the two Koreas to restore trust in a way that a state cannot. President Moon Jae-in’s plan to restart relief aid is an upbeat sign, unless it involves cash or other components that may be siphoned off for military uses, he said.On the human rights front, however, he called for Moon to raise his voice, instead of “keeping a sensitive issue underground.” The issue put the liberal president in the hot seat during the election campaign after former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon in his newly published memoir that Moon, then the presidential chief of staff, instructed intelligence officials to seek Pyongyang’s opinion before abstaining from a 2007 UN Human Rights Council vote on a resolution. “The president should be able to demand the whereabouts of South Korean hostages be verified and they be returned as soon as possible. It’s implausible the government doesn’t even know whether they are alive or not,” Bae said. In its path to an eventual unification, South Korea may make preparations without the help of its headstrong northern counterpart. With most rank-and-file North Koreans cut off from the outside world, such programs as loudspeaker broadcasts and anti-North Korea leaflets play a key role in awakening them and driving more escapes, he said, referring to defector testimonies. The government, for its part, needs to expand its resettlement program for newly arrived defectors who could easily fall prey to fraud, trafficking, prostitution and other illicit schemes. More than 300 defectors have been jailed, Bae noted. Nearly 30,500 North Koreans have resettled in the South as of March 2017, some 70 percent of them young women, Unification Ministry data shows. “The constant influx of information is most urgent, so we should mobilize all available channels,” he said, adding Serving Life plans to launch a radio show where defectors would read the Bible and tell stories. “There’s a saying that for a defector, the first person she meets after leaving the Hanawon resettlement center is the most important one for her life. They need greater public attention, care and time until taking root here. We should bear patience and give them a chance.” By Shin Hyon-hee and Bak Se-hwan","years as nk hostage ,17 months of detention ,tragic death of otto ,year old american student ,rescue in november 2014","['Kenneth Bae', 'North Korea', 'US', 'James Clapper', 'Otto Warmbier', 'american', 'Bae']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1540084   0.36259767

He is accused of forcing franchisees of its Mr Pizza brand to buy the cheese from a food distributor run by his relative at higher costs than market prices. Chung is also suspected of having the company pay his family salaries when they didn't show up at work. Based on such allegations, the prosecution claims that he has bagged as much as 10 billion won  in unfair profits. Mr Pizza is an indigenous brand launched by Chung in 1990. It has grown into one of the top three pizza chains in the country, currently running over 300 stores nationwide, and some 140 branches in China.Chung recently resigned from the top post after prosecutors began an investigation last month, but has denied any wrongdoing. The suspicions came to the spotlight in March after a former franchisee in Incheon, west of Seoul, committed suicide, blaming the pizza chain for driving his restaurant into the ground. He apparently claimed that the headquarters opened a direct store next to his business as payback for cutting off the contract.","pizza chain founder arrested ,pizza franchise was arrested ,major south korean pizza ,malpractice embezzlement the founder ,arrested on thursday","['south korean', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Chung Woo - hyun', 'MP Group']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20263371  0.42371288

Kim was sentenced to seven years in prison by the lower court. But the higher court cleared him on part of the charges and commuted the sentence to five years in jail, saying that his role in the solicitation was not directly related to his job. The appeals court judged that Kim's role was as a middleman to arrange the solicitation for Jung as he was not in charge of the trials. Under the local criminal law, taking bribes is punishable by a much heavier sentence when it directly relates to the defendant's job. However, the court said he should still be held accountable for the misdeed and law violation that is too grave to be reconsidered. ""Regardless of whether the cases belonged to the defendant or someone else, it should not and cannot happen under any circumstances. It's beyond imagination for any judge,"" Judge Cho Young-chul noted. The court ordered him to forfeit some 126 million won and a Range Rover SUV, one of the gifts from Jung. Kim tendered his resignation, but it was rejected by the Supreme Court in accordance with rules that a resignation from a judge under investigation is not acceptable. He has been suspended from his post for one year, the highest level of disciplinary measure that can be brought upon the judiciary.","bribery case seoul appellate ,judge accused of bribery ,judge in bribery case ,court on thursday mitigated ,for judge in bribery","['Seoul', 'Soo - chun', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Jung Woon - ho', 'Jung']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.19517925 -0.19991128

Kang Ki-jung, incumbent Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the Democratic Party, former Reps. Moon Byung-ho and Kim Hyun  speak to reporters after they are acquitted by a higher court of charges over the illegal detention of an intelligence agent, in Seoul on July 6, 2017. The Seoul High Court ruled that Rep. Lee Jong-kul and three others from the ruling Democratic Party had no intention of holding the National Intelligence Service agent against her will. They were indicted in 2014 on charges of an unlawful confinement of the agent, identified only by her surname Kim, inside her residence in Seoul for about 35 hours. Kim was alleged to have taken part in an operation to influence public opinion by posting online comments in favor of the then conservative presidential front-runner Park Geun-hye. Then NIS chief Won Sei-hoon was sentenced by a higher court to three years in prison for ordering the operation in violation of the law that bans the intelligence agency from intervening in politics. The Supreme Court however ordered a retrial of the case in July 2015. In its ruling Thursday, the upper court agreed with the initial verdict that Kim had considerable ways and means to leave the house at her will even when the lawmakers were there with her. The defendants have claimed that they went inside her house out of concern that she may destroy evidence linking her to the suspected illicit influencing of public opinion. The court acknowledged their argument since Kim has in fact gotten rid of the files on her computer and that it is highly probable that she chose to stay inside because she was worried they would gain access to the evidence. They were acquitted by the Seoul Central District Court in July last year. The prosecution immediately filed an appeal.","court acquittal of four ,2012 presidential election ex ,court on thursday upheld ,presidential election ex rep ,lawmakers of illegal detention","['Kang Ki - jung', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'the Democratic Party', 'Moon Byung - ho', 'Kim Hyun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1202343   0.33118808

At the Seoul Central District Court, the special counsel asserted that Kim and Cho, two of Park’s core associates, “oppressed the freedom of expression protected by the Constitution” by colluding with her to create the list and use it as a basis for excluding dissident artists and cultural organization from state projects and funding. Some 9,500 local artists, film directors, musicians and organizations were included in the list.  Former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon is being escorted to the courtroom at the Seoul Central District Court to attend a final hearing, July 3, 2017. The counsel has also asked the court to hand down five-year prison terms to two other former ranking officials of the Culture Ministry and a former presidential secretary for political affairs for banning state sponsorship against the artists in collusion with the two.Kim and Cho were indicted in February over abuse of power and perjury for their role in systematically discriminating against people deemed critical of the government. The case led hundreds among those on the list to file a lawsuit against the former Park administration seeking compensation. It was part of a bigger scandal involving Park, her secret confidante Choi Soon-sil and others allegedly using state powers for personal gain.

The cousin reportedly told police that he was asked to drive a vehicle used in the crime and received 1 million won  in return. Police found ropes, tape, a fake license plate and a woman’s wig inside their car. The victim’s body was found Tuesday under a bridge in Jinju, some 200 kilometers from where she was kidnapped. She was strangled to death, an autopsy showed. Using her credit card, the couple withdrew some 4.7 million won. It is unclear whether the suspects had known the victim. Officers said that the trio had planned the crime earlier this month and visited several golf practice ranges in Changwon to look for a target.Tips on the whereabouts of Shim and Kang will be rewarded with cash of up to 5 million won, police said.By Kim Da-sol","for kidnap murder couple ,kidnap murder couple in ,kidnap murder couple ,wanted for kidnap murder ,murder couple in the","['Changwan', 'Kang Jung - im']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45758441  0.23191747

In the class action suit, filed in December with 5,001 plaintiffs including their legal representative Kwak Sang-eon, each demands 500,000 won  in compensation. Some 4,160 plaintiffs also separately filed a compensation suit in January, with its hearing schedule not yet confirmed. Some of the plaintiffs said they had suffered from depression, while others said they had their weekends taken away by the ex-president because they had to attend candlelight vigils on Saturdays. Among the plaintiffs are also business owners who want to be compensated for losses in sales due to the monthslong rallies. “We will look into whether the defendant’s illegal activities in performing her duty is serious enough for the public to be compensated, whether the mental damage was serious enough to be compensated, whether the mental stress was caused by the defendant,” the court earlier said of the case.Park’s lawyers have said the case should be dismissed, saying it is “uncertain” who the victims are. They also said factual relations are “unclear,” citing the ongoing criminal trial of Park. Park, who is in detention, is on trial on 18 charges including bribery and abuse of power in connection with the scandal involving her longtime friend Choi and local conglomerates. The scandal, which surfaced in October, triggered massive anti-Park rallies, leading the parliament to vote to impeach her in December. The Constitutional Court upheld her removal from office in a unanimous ruling in March.

According to the Gwangju District Court and the May 18 Memorial Foundation on Sunday, Chun has requested the case to be reviewed in Seoul, saying that the Gwagnju court may be influenced by public sentiment. According to court records, Chun filed a motion seeking to transfer the trial to Seoul from the current venue of Gwangju on Wednesday, stating his right to a fair trial due to the “strong” local public sentiment the city carries towards the May 18 civil uprising.Former President Chun Doo-hwan “I request to transfer the venue to a court that holds jurisdictions over my registered address in Yeonhui-dong, Seodaemun District,” the legal request filed by Chun showed. “The public sentiment in the vicinity of the trial may render a fair and impartial trial,” added Chun’s spokesperson. In response, the May 18 Memorial Foundation that sued Chun submitted a legal document on Friday to counter his request, stating that the trial should continue in the location in which any forthcoming compensations would be paid. The trial began on June 12 when the May 18 Memorial Foundation and three other similar civic groups filed an injunction against Chun to halt the memoir’s production and distribution, according to local media reports. The legal team representing the civic groups stressed that there was a collection of false claims related to the democratic uprising in the book’s chapters. In its pages, Chun describes himself as a “sacrifice to heal and pacify the wounds ,” and refers to the uprising as merely “Gwangju incident,” taking democracy out of the movement’s context. The former army general-turned-president also argued that the Gwangju Uprising was a riot intervened and manipulated by the North Korean regime and denied the martial army’s massacre of civilians. The writings questioned the Supreme Court ruling in 1997 that held him liable for the tragedy. “There was no such thing as an intentional and random massacre of civilians in Gwangju, and the supposed ‘firing command’ never existed at all,” Chun’s memoir read.Despite his claims, the National Forensic Service released a statement last year that a bullet mark on a building is strong evidence of a series of gunshots from a helicopter. The Moon administration recently vowed to lead a state probe to find out the truth behind the 10 days of uprising in 1980 with the political circle pledging to cooperate. “The new government will exert further efforts in finding out the truth about that day, including who ordered the first shot from the helicopter,” said Moon during a commemorative speech on May 18. Chun’s decision to publish a memoir became the subject of nationwide controversy, when it was first reported by media outlets in March, due to his notorious status as a former dictator. The book was officially published on April 5 with approximately 2,000 pages divided into three separate volumes. The memoir reportedly carries personal memos and records from his presidential term, which supports his side of the story on the May 18 Democratization Movement.By Jung Min-kyung","memoir lawsuit former president ,change over memoir lawsuit ,lawsuit former president chun ,dictator requests court change ,over memoir lawsuit","['Chun Doo - hwan', 'Seoul', 'the Gwangju District Court', 'Chun', 'Seoul', 'Gwagnju']",4,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.21535139  0.1855657

This is the 14th time the Supreme Court approved of imprisonment for those refusing military service on religious grounds so far this year. In the latest case, the 22-year old man identified by the surname Shin was tried for refusing to join the military after he received his draft letter in December 2015. The first court to try Shin had found him innocent, saying that forcing him to serve military duty against his religious beliefs was “demolishment of existential value” of Shin as a person. However, the appeals court sentenced him to an 18 month imprisonment, saying that that religion cannot be considered a justifiable reason for refusing military service under current laws, and social system.Protesters are trapped inside what looks like a prison in Seoul on May 15, 2017, as they rally to demand the government not punish conscientious objectors and introduce alternative service options for them in observance of the International Conscientious Objectors Day that fell on the same day. “Conscientious objection does not qualify as ‘justifiable reason’ for exempting from punishment under current laws,” the Supreme Court said in its ruling. “The UN Human Rights Committee recommendation against penalizing conscientious objectors is not legally binding,” it continued. The issue of conscientious objectors has been a subject of controversy for some years, and is currently under review by the Constitutional Court. Article 39 of the Constitution states that all Korean nationals have the duty of national defense under conditions stipulated in related laws. Under the Military Service Act, all able-bodied men deemed fit for service must serve in the military or in alternative services provided under the law. The Constitution, however, also provides for freedom of religion and protects against discrimination based on religious beliefs.By Choi He-suk","sunday upheld prison sentence ,prison sentence for man ,14th conscientious objector guilty ,on sunday upheld prison ,court approved of imprisonment","['the Supreme Court', 'the Supreme Court', 'Shin']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1428258   0.02346199

The file photo, dated May 3, 2017, captures Shin Yeon-hee, the head of the Gangnam District Office, delivering a speech at a cultural event in Seoul. Shin, who belongs to the conservative Liberty Korea Party, is accused of illegal electioneering and defaming Moon by spreading false information about him via messenger platform KakaoTalk on 83 occasions from Jan. 29-March 13, the prosecution said. Moon won the May 9 election.She allegedly sent messages such as ""Moon is responsible for the Sewol"", referring to a tragic ferry sinking in 2014 that claimed the lives of more than 300 passengers. Another circulated message said ""If you vote for Moon, the Republic of Korea will perish. He's a communist.""  The National Election Commission and Moon's campaign team filed a complaint with the police in March seeking an investigation into the allegations. Police later referred the case to the prosecution.

The same court rejected the prosecution’s initial request earlier this month due to a lack of evidence. The prosecution sought an arrest warrant for Chung on Sunday on three charges -- concealing criminal proceeds, enrolling at Ewha Womans University through illegal means and using fabricated documents to obtain a leave of absence from her high school “I told the judge everything as things are. I said I was not a flight risk,” she said in a teary voice after attending a hearing on her arrest warrant at the court Tuesday. She has denied any wrongdoing, claiming no knowledge of any illegal activities by her mother Choi and the ousted Park.  The concealment of criminal proceeds was an additional charge raised against Chung. The prosecution viewed that Chung had been involved in Samsung Group’s attempt to write up a fabricated contract to make its donation of horses for Chung look like a legitimate sponsorship.Samsung allegedly offered 7.8 billion won  to Choi-controlled entities to cover Chung’s equestrian training abroad and buy expensive horses in return for policy favors from the Park administration. Its de facto leader Lee Jae-yong is on trial on bribery charges.The prosecution said it had also found that Chung had attempted to obtain citizenship in Malta before being extradited to Korea. She reportedly told the prosecution that she gave it up due to cost.  Chung was extradited from Denmark to face questioning by the prosecution in May in connection with the corruption scandal. She face allegations that she was accepted into an elite school despite questionable qualifications and given special favors for academic records despite poor attendance on the back of her mother’s ties to Park. Her mother and the school’s officials are on trial for their roles in the alleged academic fraud. Her mother Choi is jailed and on trial on charges of colluding with former President Park to extort bribes and donations from local firms.

The 22-year-old had been treated for “severe brain damage” at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in his home state of Ohio since his return. His family did not specify the cause of death but said he had been “unable to speak, see and react to verbal commands,” blaming North Korea for the tragedy. “Unfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today,” the Warmbiers said in a statement released by the hospital.American student Otto Warmbier cries while speaking to reporters in Pyongyang, North Korea. US President Donald Trump offered “deepest condolences,” while condemning the regime’s “brutality.” “There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Otto’s family and friends, and all who loved him,” he said in a statement. “Otto’s fate deepens my administration’s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also issued a statement: “We hold North Korea accountable for Warmbier’s unjust imprisonment, and demand the release of three other Americans who have been illegally detained.”President Moon Jae-in sent a condolence message to the bereaved family on Tuesday, Cheong Wa Dae said, urging a swift repatriation of all detainees in the North. Currently 10 foreign nationals are being held captive there, including six South Koreans, three Americans and a Canadian, according to the Unification Ministry here. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha also plans to offer condolences during a phone call with Tillerson, the ministry said. “The president said it is extremely deplorable that North Korea does not respect human rights,” presidential spokesperson Park Soo-hyun said at a press briefing, taking issue with Pyongyang’s alleged failure to immediately inform his family about his condition and provide the best treatment possible. Warmbier’s death is also expected to darken the mood for the first summit between Moon and Trump, slated for June 29-30 in Washington, adding to unabated controversy over their perceived differences such as on North Korea’s nuclear program and a US missile shield.His shocking return has riled the US public, fueling calls for a travel ban and tighter sanctions against Pyongyang, which has a track record of jailing Americans as a bargaining chip. “North Korea took a healthy young man with a bright future as a convenient political bargaining chip, prosecuted him on trumped up charges in a kangaroo court, and then somehow killed him in custody. In doing so, North Korea again reaffirmed its position as one of the worst human rights abusing governments in the world,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. With the US and China set for diplomatic and security dialogue later this week, tougher sanctions would be high on their agenda, said Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, expressing hopes that the other three Americans are released.In Washington, a bipartisan bill was proposed in May, designed to ban American tourists from visiting the North and to mandate non-tourists to secure a special license. The Moon administration, in contrast, set its sights on a thaw with the unruly neighbor, having made its first dialogue offer last week and sought to restart humanitarian assistance. “It is an unfavorable factor for the summit under the current circumstances,” a senior Foreign Ministry official here said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “The US may move to slap a travel ban as part of its ‘maximum pressure’ strategy given that some 1,000 citizens visit the North every year and it would affect civic groups’ relief programs.” David Straub, a former State Department Korea expert who currently serves as the Sejong-LS Fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, said the situation could worsen if the North does not free the remaining hostages soon, pointing to the spread of “great anger” in the US. “The North Koreans’ actions in regard to  have only reaffirmed for most Americans their image of the country as brutal and fundamentally dishonest,” he told The Korea Herald via email.“In any event, what has happened makes it even less likely that the Trump administration will be open to resuming dialogue with North Korea or making concessions to it, unless and until it clearly signals a willingness to enter into genuine denuclearization negotiations.” However, Van Jackson, a professor in international relations at Victoria University of Wellington, warned against “politicizing” Warmbier’s death as a “convenient excuse” to impose a tour ban, which may limit necessary civilian exchanges and relief work. “I think US citizens should be free to travel anywhere they wish, but anyone with a basic understanding of North Korea would know that visiting the North for ‘tourist’ reasons is dangerous,” he said in an email interview.“My main concern with any kind of travel ban is secondary effects it might have on Track 2 diplomacy or the work of humanitarian NGOs. … A ban could still create barriers to what might be important or useful interactions with the North.”By Shin Hyon-hee , Yeo Jun-suk  and Jung Min-kyung","month detention died monday ,died monday prompting condemnation ,detention died monday prompting ,on moon trump summit ,detention died monday","['Otto Warmbier', 'US', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'US', 'the University of Cincinnati Medical Center', 'Ohio']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26243252  0.0562735

The prosecution sought to hold her in custody after she was extradited from Denmark in late May, where she had been detained at the request of the South Korean prosecution. Prosecutors are believed to have obtained fresh evidence against Chung, which can prove that she was aware of her mother's influence-peddling. Chung has denied any wrongdoing, saying that she knew nothing about what went on between her mother and Park. ""I'll tell the judge,"" Chung said as she entered the courthouse when she was asked by reporters about a media report that she tried to buy citizenship in Malta before her extradition. ""I'm no flight risk. I have my son here."" The court's decision on Chung's arrest warrant is expected to be announced early Wednesday, at the latest.","arrest warrant for daughter ,daughter of ex president ,daughter of former president ,corruption scandal that removed ,ex president friend seoul","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi Soon - sil']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50084054  0.13316791

She was extradited from Denmark late last month in connection with a massive corruption scandal centering on her mother that led to the ouster of the former president. Chung is suspected of receiving academic favors from Ewha Woman's University and illegal funding from Samsung for her equestrian training based on her mother's ties with Park. The prosecution sought an arrest warrant for Chung a second time on Sunday, after the initial request was denied by a court earlier this month. About the citizenship, Chung reportedly told the prosecution that she gave it up because it cost her too much, citing the fact that Malta grants a citizenship upon a contribution worth some 650,000 euros to the government. But the prosecution believes that Chung withdrew the plan as she knew she wouldn't be able to avoid extradition even if she acquired the citizenship. The prosecution will likely use this evidence to argue for the need to issue a writ on Chung since she is a flight risk. The court is due to have a hearing early Tuesday before deciding on the arrest warrant. Her mother, Choi, is standing trial, alongside Park, on charges of meddling in state affairs and coercing Samsung and other firms to ""donate"" large sums of money for Chung's equestrian training.","citizenship prosecutors the daughter ,her arrest warrantchung yoo ,daughter of former president ,prosecutors the daughter ,daughter of park friend","['Park Geun', 'Malta', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Denmark']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40487069  0.29594809

In 2014, a group of SPO members filed a complaint against Park with local police, claiming she had mistreated them. Park stepped down from the office shortly after the suspicions were formally raised, ensnaring the foundation in a nasty scandal. She denied any wrongdoing. But police later referred a case against the staff to the prosecution, since their investigation found a possible plot by the staff and wife of the Seoul Phil music director, Maestro Chung Myun-whun, to spread the rumors and force Park to resign.Park filed a petition with the prosecution, seeking an investigation into Chung and his wife on libel charges. Chung filed a counterclaim against Park on charges of defamation and false accusation.The legal wrangling led the 64-year-old maestro to step down as the orchestra's music director in 2015 after a decade of service.

They were demoted while they were being investigated by the ministry's inspection division over a dinner that they had with lower-level officials. In late April, Lee and Ahn went to dinner with their subordinates, where each offered envelopes with up to 1 million won  to each other's underlings. The incident was put under scrutiny since it involved prosecutors who were investigating a scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye. Lee had been in charge of the special probe team leading Park's case and Ahn is known to be close to a former presidential aide and a key figure in the scandal. Early this month, the ministry's inspection team requested the dismissal of Lee and Ahn as punishment for their wrongdoings. The decision came about three weeks after President Moon Jae-in ordered the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Prosecutors' Office to look into the incident. Lee and Ahn both claimed earlier that the money was not intended to elicit any favors in return but was a sort of customary incentive.Under local law, a dismissed prosecutor is banned from working as a lawyer for two years.","dismissed two ranking prosecutors ,prosecutors over cash scandal ,fires two ranking prosecutors ,friday over their inappropriate ,cash the ministry disciplinary","['the Ministry of Justice', 'Lee Young - ryeol', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Ahn Tae - geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40670124  0.0359749

The 57-year-old lawyer was a prominent prosecutor who investigated major corruption cases that involved the country's former presidents. Hong resigned from the prosecution office in 2011 and had since worked as a lawyer.Hong was found guilty by the Seoul Central District Court in June for receiving some 300 million won  in 2011 from a former head of cosmetics company to help cover up his overseas gambling charges. The lower court also found him guilty of taking another 200 million won in kickbacks from the same businessman in return for helping him win business deals. The higher court acquitted Hong of the former conviction, citing a lack of evidence to prove that the money was to solicit a business favor. The court upheld the initial ruling on the latter bribery count, as well as tax evasion. ""The defendant has failed to fulfill his duties as a legal professional and exerted influence gained through his long career as a public servant,"" the court said. Under the country's law, lawyers are prohibited from exerting influence with the prosecution to help their clients. The court ordered Hong to forfeit 200 million won for the unpaid tax.

Police said it appeared to be a nail bomb similar to that used in a recent terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England.The explosive, made from a coffee tumbler, gunpowder and four AA-size batteries, was “clumsily made” and looked like it was the work of an amateur, police said. However, it contained scores of screws 1 centimeter long or shorter to make it more lethal.The explosive, made from a coffee tumbler, gunpowder and four of AA-size batteries, is found inside a professor’s office in Yonsei University in western Seoul, Tuesday. A professor of mechanical engineering who opened the parcel suffered minor burns and was taken to a nearby hospital. The blast occurred at an office on the fourth floor of an engineering faculty building at around 8:41 a.m., police said. The police activated a special team to investigate the details of the explosion, suspecting it may be a terrorist attack. They reviewed surveillance camera footage installed on other floors of the building to investigate who sent the parcel. There was no camera installed on the fourth floor. The injured professor reportedly told police that a shopping bag containing a box 20 centimeters long and wide was hanging from the door knob of his office. It exploded when he tried to open it. Witnesses said they saw pieces of metal fly out upon the explosion.Police have cordoned off the site of a suspected parcel bomb attack at Yonsei University in western Seoul on June 13, 2017. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency’s Forensic Investigation dispatched a team of 70 officers to the scene to determine the exact cause of the accident and analyze the explosive.A team from the National Intelligence Service Korea’s Terrorism Information Integration Center and a military bomb squad were also sent to the scene.

Moon Hyung-pyo, health minister from 2013 to 2015, was convicted of abuse of power and perjury in a ruling that is likely to deal a heavy blow to Park and Lee, who are standing trials of their own for a suspected money-for-political support deal surrounding the merger. “Moon severely violated the independence of the National Pension Service by wielding pressure through the Welfare Ministry officials, which is subject to much criticism,” the Seoul Central District Court said in its verdict.Moon Hyung-pyo, health minister from 2013 to 2015 According to the court, Moon pressured the pension fund, South Korea’s largest institutional investor under the auspice of the ministry, to vote in favor of the merger of Samsung’s two affiliates, Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries, in 2015. NPS was the single largest shareholder of C&T.; The deal was highly controversial, as it was widely seen as a key step for Lee to consolidate his control over the nation’s largest conglomerate and ensure the smooth transfer of Samsung’s leadership from his ailing father, Chairman Lee Kun-hee, to himself. In return for the government’s backing, Lee is suspected of offering donations to entities controlled by former President Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and generous sponsorship of Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra for her equestrian training abroad. Lee, Park and Choi have all denied any wrongdoing.But the verdict does not include the bench’s judgement on whether Samsung offered bribes in return for the policy favor or whether Park gave Moon a direct order to sway the vote in favor of Samsung Group. The court also handed down a 2 1/2 year jail term for Hong Wan-sun, the former head of the NPS’ asset management division, for inflicting losses to the pension’s subscribers. The scheme is mandatory for all salaried workers in South Korea. The prosecution had sought a seven-year prison term for both Moon and Hong, saying the Samsung merger is the core of the corruption scandal. The conviction of Moon and Hong is likely to adversely affect the ongoing trial of ex-President Park and Samsung’s Lee. The prosecution believes that Park, through her Presidential Secretary An Chong-bum, directed Moon to wield influence on the Samsung merger. Moon had also spoken of an order from Park. Park is now on trial for soliciting or being promised bribes totaling 59.2 billion won  from local firms including Samsung.The ruling is also likely to further raise questions over the legitimacy of the merger of the two affiliates. Samsung C&T;’s shareholders, including American hedge fund Elliot Management, had opposed the merger, saying its unfair merger ratio hurt the interests of minority shareholdersPharmaceutical company Ilsung filed a suit against Samsung C&T; to invalidate the merger, with the trial underway and the final hearing to be held July 17.Park was impeached on Dec. 9 by the parliament over the scandal, which triggered massive street protests for weeks. The decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court in a unanimous ruling on March 10. Park, who is in detention, is fighting a total of 18 charges including bribery, abuse of power, coercion and the leaking of government secrets. By Ock Hyun-ju","convicted over corruption scandal ,minister convicted over corruption ,years in prison thursday ,over corruption scandal seoul ,scandal seoul court sentenced","['Seoul', 'Samsung Group', 'Park Geun', 'Samsung ’s de', 'Moon Hyung - pyo']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.21949337 -0.12823534

Lee Young-ryeol , former chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors` Office, and Ahn Tae-geun , ex-deputy minister at the Ministry of Justice “ acting Prosecutor General Bong Wook has formally requested the Ministry of Justice that former chief of Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office Lee Yeong-ryeol and Justice Ministry senior official Ahn Tae-geun be removed from office,” said an official from the audit team at a press briefing. In late April, Lee and Ahn gave cash to subordinates who took part in the investigation into a high-profile scandal that led to the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye.As for Lee, the audit team has decided to ask the prosecution to look into a suspected violation of the anti-graft law, the official added. The announcement came about three weeks after President Moon Jae-in ordered a probe, one of his first directives as the nation’s chief since taking office on May 10. The exchanging of cash bonuses between the two heads and their officials occurred on March 21 at a dinner table, just four days after Lee’s special investigation team closed up a political corruption scandal of former President Park and her key aide Woo Byung-woo. The prosecution indicted the hugely unpopular Park on 18 charges in mid-April, but was criticized for being soft on Woo, a former prosecutor who held sway over law enforcement authorities during his stint at the Cheong Wa Dae. At the table, Lee and Ahn gave envelopes each containing between 700,000 won  and 1 million won to the other’s subordinates, including the special probe team’s investigators present.The audit team concluded that Lee’s cash offering to the upper government body’s officials was against the country’s anti-graft law, which bans civil servants and other professions from giving or receiving certain amounts of money if there is a potential conflict of interest. Ahn is also suspected of exchanging telephone calls with Woo last year, as he allegedly tried to hinder the prosecution’s investigation into the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry. The two offered to step down last month upon the revelation of the cash scandal by local media outlets, but were demoted and transferred to local areas due to the ongoing audit.Apart from the audit, President Moon named reformist prosecutor Yoon Seok-yeol, who played a key role in the now disbanded independent counsel team to investigate the Park scandal, as the new chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, amid sour sentiment toward the country‘s most powerful law enforcement agencies. The Ministry of Justice and prosecution have drawn criticism for remaining in favor of the government and lenient in investigating Park’s corruption scandal. With Wednesday’s result of the internal investigation, the Justice Ministry’s 10-member audit committee will soon decide whether to follow its suggestion.By Bak Se-hwan","from office over scandal ,office over scandal two ,office over scandal ,disciplinary dismissals of lee ,removed from office over","['the Ministry of Justice', 'the Justice Ministry', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Lee Young - ryeol', 'the Seoul Central District']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22633883  0.16611271

Chun Doo-hwan in the southern city of Gwangju. He sentenced a bus driver to death after the driver charged a police line, killing four police officers and injuring four others. He also ordered a one-year jail term to a high school student who participated in the rally.Constitutional Court Chief nominee Kim Yi-su speaks during a parliamentary confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on June 7, 2017. Calling the Gwangju incident a democratic resistance against the anti-Constitutional regime, the nominee said the past experience is an excruciating scar in his life and judicial career. “On the other hand, it has become an inner mirror on which I reflect on myself as a judge. The desire for democracy and constitutional order witnessed in the Gwangju democratic uprising has become the pillar and support for my career,” he said. During the confirmation hearing, parliamentarians from opposition conservative blocs took issue with his “political bias,” citing a court case in 2014. In a landmark ruling, the nine-member Constitutional Court disbanded the far-left Unified Progressive Party for its pro-North Korean activities. Kim was the sole dissenter, opposing the forceful dismantling of the political party. He argued that individuals should be punished by the National Security Law and be expelled from the National Assembly, but not the party itself. When asked whether he respects the top court’s decision, he made it clear that he does. “I wanted to show what the fundamental spirit of democracy is by presenting a minority opinion. A society is healthy when minority opinions exist, and it also reflects the trust toward the Constitutional Court,” he said.Lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party sought to defend the nominee, complimenting him for not compromising his principles. However, the attack on Kim’s political identity was not the end of the dispute. Lawmakers from the main opposition Liberty Korea Party accused him of taking a left-leaning stance, citing over 18 more court cases in which he had presented his minority opinion. “You have made some minority opinions that go in line with the stances of the Democratic Party. How can we appoint a top court chief who would blindly follow the ruling party?” Rep. Kwak Sang-do of the conservative party said. Kim refuted the claim and called Rep. Kwak’s statement an insult. “I have never followed the Democratic Party to set my stance on anything. If you turn that logic around, that means the decisions made by other constitutional judges were also affected by other parties,” Kim said. In his opening speech, the 64-year-old nominee vowed to pursue the values of harmony and balance, considering the many ideological and social conflicts in Korean society. “The value of the Constitution should be protected by all the citizens. ... If I am allowed to head the Constitutional Court, I will do my best to fulfill the duty of protecting the Constitution.”President Moon Jae-in tapped Kim to head the nation’s top court on May 19. The top post has been vacant since former Court chief Park Han-chul retired in January. To be appointed, the justice nominee requires approval from a majority of lawmakers in the 299-member National Assembly.By Jo He-rim","apologized over controversial rulings ,nominee apologizes over 1980 ,protesters in democratic uprising ,hearing wednesday sincerely apologize ,apologizes over 1980 ruling","['Constitutional Court', 'Kim Yi - su', 'Kim']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03858296 -0.00845178

While the two cases may look similar, legal experts here said the perpetrator's intent to kill was what led to the contrasting ruling, which is never to be condoned in a law-abiding society.  A murder suspect  accused of killing his girlfriend and burying the body, only identified by his surname Lee, re-enacts the crime at an on-site inspection carried out by the police in the county of Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province, on Oct. 24, 2016. An appeals court in Daejeon, south of Seoul, sentenced a 39-year-old man, only identified by his surname Lee, on Thursday to three years in prison for beating his girlfriend to death and burying the body. His sentence was reduced from five years handed down by a lower court. In another trial, a lower court in North Chungcheong Province sentenced a 46-year-old woman, surnamed Kim, to 10 years in prison Friday for stabbing her daughter's teacher to death after she found out that he had molested her teenage child. The verdicts instantly sparked a barrage of tweets and comments denouncing the courts for giving a lighter punishment to Lee, who took a life of a woman by violence and buried the body in cement to conceal his crime. Many of the angry comments blamed the court for accepting Lee's argument that the death was accidental because he couldn't control his anger toward his girlfriend, who wanted to break up with him.""You call beating someone and pouring cement over the body accidental? Tell me who's more moral, a guy who was caught after four years of hiding or a mother who turned herself in after killing a man who'd harassed her little girl?"" Cho Yoon-hee said. The public outrage has intensified as it turned out that Lee bargained a deal based on a settlement he gave to the victim's estranged father, in return for a promise that he wouldn't seek punishment for Lee. South Korea has relatively lenient sentencing rules compared with countries like the United States. An involuntary manslaughter starts at a minimum of a three-year sentence, and a homicide can carry up to 30 years in jail. The public outcry aside, few experts disagreed with the rulings. The vengeful mother has been punished for what she deserved since she personally took the matter into her own hands.The court dismissed Kim's argument that she had no intention of killing the teacher, as her text messages and purchase of a tool prior to the murder proved it was premeditated. ""A personal revenge accords due punishment although the victim gave the suspect a motive for the crime,"" the court noted in the ruling.The prosecution only indicted Lee on a count of negligent homicide because the victim's body was discovered too late to retrieve any compelling evidence against Lee.""Our justice system provides clemency for criminal negligence.Although it may foment social discord, we cannot but say that the judge has honestly returned a verdict based on evidence,"" Rho Young-hee, a Seoul-based lawyer, said by phone.  ""The prosecutors' job is to prove as objectively as possible with evidence that are admissible by the court.

The Constitutional Court said in a unanimous ruling that the prosecution should cancel its decision to acknowledge the action as a criminal offense.  In South Korea, insulting an individual publicly is a criminal offense punishable by a prison term of up to one year or a fine of up to 2 million won .“It is hard to acknowledge that the complainant had any intention to insult or the expression was derogatory enough to tarnish a person’s social reputation,” the court said in its verdict. In May last year, the complainant, surnamed Lee, said “you are f---ing crazy” to himself in front of a neighbor, surnamed Kim, during a quarrel near his apartment building. Lee claimed that Kim, who looks much younger, attempted to start a fight. Kim then suddenly changed his impolite attitude as a security guard passed by. “It was then when I talked to myself  because the person’s sudden change of attitude was so ridiculous,” Lee said.The neighbor filed a complaint against Lee. The prosecution deemed the use of the words as a punishable crime of insult, though it did not arraign Lee. Since Lee was not formally charged, Lee did not face trial or receive any punishment. However, Lee filed a petition with the Constitutional Court to fight the prosecution’s judgment. In the ruling the top court said that the words could mean many things depending on the context. It said that “f---ing crazy” in the context had meant “you are not making any sense.”The prosecution may close the case with its indictment suspended in consideration of various circumstances including age and criminal motive, even when the crime is acknowledged.By Ock Hyun-ju","the prosecution should cancel ,local court said tuesday ,criminal insult local court ,prosecution should cancel ,punishable by prison term","['korean', 'the Constitutional Court', 'South Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32848653 -0.06357946

The Seoul Central District Court partially ruled in favor of five English teachers who filed a suit in September 2015 against their former employer, a private language education chain in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province which refused to acknowledge them as regular employees and offer severance pay. The group is made up of three US citizens, one South Korean and one Canadian.The verdict ordered the institute to give the plaintiffs a total of 187 million won  in severance pay, along with compensation for unused annual leave and vacation.In court, the institute’s attorneys argued the teachers were hired under “service contracts for instructors,” which provide wages at an hourly rate and consider them privately contracted workers. The contracts did not stipulate basic or fixed pay and a guaranteed registration of social insurance programs, nor require them to pay earned income tax. The team also insisted benefits like pensions were already included in the wage package. But the court dismissed such claims, stating that the terms of the contracts represented an “archetypal” employer-employee relationship. “The contract terms on codes of conduct regarding termination of contract, probation, and workplace punctuality policies represent the nature of direct employment,” the verdict reads. “Thus the contract should be viewed as an official labor contract.”By Jung Min-kyung","of five english teachers ,teachers who filed suit ,five english teachers who ,five english teachers ,severance pay court seoul","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.2575129   0.30794188

She has been in custody at the Nambu Detention Center in southwestern Seoul, where her mother is being held, following her arrival in Korea. Chung was extradited from Denmark and arrested onboard a Korean Air flight en route to Seoul on Wednesday to face questioning by the prosecution.

Samsung allegedly offered 7.8 billion won  to Choi-controlled entities to cover Chung’s equestrian training abroad and buy expensive horses.

This photo, taken on June 1, 2017, shows Fair Trade Committee chairman-designate Kim Sang-jo appearing at his office in Seoul to prepare for a parliamentary confirmation hearing. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party has called Kim unfit for the post to promote corporate transparency and fair competition, demanding he voluntarily give up his nomination. His appointment does not require parliamentary consent, but strong parliamentary opposition could pose a political burden on him.A major bone of contention is the allegations of his family's false address registration in 1997 and 2004. False residence registration is a legal offense that former high-level nominees had committed mainly for real estate speculation. Moon has cited it as one of the irregularities that he said would keep him from nominating anyone for a senior post.Kim is also alleged to have underreported to a district office the price of a Seoul house he bought in 1999. He is also purported to have worked at civic groups -- the Solidarity of Economic Reform and the Financial Research Center -- without permission from his school, Hansung University.Another allegation concerns his wife. She is suspected of getting a job as an English conversation instructor at a high school in 2013 despite the fact her English proficiency test score was lower than the requirement. Kim is also alleged to have copied his past academic research outcome to publish another paper in 2000, triggering accusations of self-plagiarism.","parliament to hold hearing ,to reform major conglomerates ,friday over his policy ,parliament due to series ,figure to lead president","['the National Assembly', 'Fair Trade Committee', 'Kim Sang - jo', 'Kim', 'Moon Jae - in']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49917737  0.16136605

She was arrested on her way back to South Korea a day earlier, following her extradition from Denmark.Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of former President Park Geun-hye's close associate, is brought to the prosecution in Seoul on June 1, 2017, for the second day of questioning on various allegations ranging from illegal university admission to foreign exchange law breaches. Prosecutors have until 4 a.m. on Friday to hold Chung at a detention center in Seoul where her mother is being held. It plans to ask the court to issue a warrant. With the court-issued writ, the prosecution can hold her for up to 20 days before filing charges over her alleged wrongdoings. The former national dressage team member is accused of receiving unfair treatment in entering Ewha Womans University and receiving dubious funding for equestrian training from Samsung Group. The 21-year-old is suspected of being illegally admitted to Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 2015 despite inadequate qualifications. The school’s former President Choi Kyung-hee is now on trial over her alleged role in the special favor granted to Chung. Prosecutors believe Choi, a longtime confidante of Park, was behind the illegal enrollment. After entering the school, Chung was also given good grades despite not attending classes, according to an inquiry conducted by the Education Ministry earlier. Choi is also charged with colluding with Park to take tens of millions of dollars from Samsung Group in return for the government’s support of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. Part of the money was used to fund Chung’s equestrian training in Germany. On Wednesday, an independent counsel’s probe team that looked into the scandal demanded the court for a seven-year prison term for Choi in connection to the admissions fraud for the sake of Chung. Park, who was removed from office on March 10, is on her own trial following last month’s indictment over bribery, extortion, abuse of power and other corruption charges in collusion with Choi, which could potentially send her to jail for life if confirmed.By Bak Se-hwan","korea prosecution on thursday ,office she was arrested ,prosecution on thursday summoned ,prosecution on thursday ,arrest of former president","['South Korea ’s', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Chung', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun - hyeAt', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutor ’s Office', 'South Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40676194  0.09572703

On Monday, while attending the third hearing of her trial, the impeached leader was seen dozing off for about 20 minutes. The 65-year-old impeached leader, who looked visibly tired throughout the day, was seen falling asleep near the end of the hearing, which lasted nearly 12 hours. Former President Park Geun-hye At that time, witness questioning was underway on Park’s role in the alleged money-for-favors deal with Samsung Group. The alleged Samsung bribery is a core part of the 18 criminal charges that prosecutors have raised against Park. If convicted, she could get life imprisonment. It was the first day of witness questioning since the trial began last week. Park is accused of receiving kickbacks from the country’s biggest conglomerate in return for her administration’s backing of a controversial merger of two Samsung units in 2015, which was seen as a crucial step to ease the transfer of power from the group’s ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.Also arrested, Lee Jae-yong, Samsung Electronics vice chairman, is being tried on the allegation. During Monday’s court session, Park remained quiet and calm, showing little reaction, while her attorney denied all the claims, saying she did not exert undue influence over the corporate merger. It was only at the end of the hearing when Park finally uttered a few words. Asked by the judge whether she wanted to question the witness by herself, Park said, “No I don’t.” The ex-leader’s verdict is expected to come mid-October following a tight schedule of three to four hearings per week.By Bak Se-hwan","dozing off during trial ,was seen falling asleep ,year old impeached leader ,hye seen dozing off ,leader was seen dozing","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.5114637   0.27144006

The parties had resisted their appointment citing ethical breaches that Moon had said would preclude people from top posts during the campaign.Following the president’s remark, and peace-making gestures in the legislature by his aides, the Bareun Party and the People’s Party withdrew their objections, making it likely that Prime Minister nominee Lee Nak-yon will be approved in a parliamentary floor vote on Wednesday.President Moon Jae-in But the biggest conservative group, the Liberty Korea Party, continued to voice its opposition.“I have no intention of damaging the basic principles ,” the president said during his weekly meeting with secretariat members.“I only ask for the opposition lawmakers’ and the people’s understanding over the fact that  did not have the time to set up tangible rules ”Prime Minister nominee Lee had come under fire for falsely registering a residential address in the past. Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kyung-wha and Fair Trade Commission Chairman nominee Kim Sang-jo were accused of similar wrongdoings.The Resident Registration Act states that one may be sentenced to a maximum term of three years or a fine of 10 million won  for falsely reporting one’s address. The key purpose of the regulation was to deter excessive real estate speculation, something high-profile public servant nominees have often been accused of in the past.In Lee’s case, his wife had temporarily changed her address, as she sought to get a job as an art teacher in a preferred high school in Seoul.Although deemed less serious compared to other cases of corruption, such incidents seemed to contradict the principle’s President Moon campaigned on.Moon had asserted that high-profile government posts should be denied to those involved in five types of corruption, including false residence registration.“I  believe that this rule is highly important in order to build a fair society. But what I said was a principle and for this to take effect in reality, we need more detailed standards,” Moon said.“Had there been a transition committee, we would have drawn detailed rules on personnel appointment in advance  but due to the lack of time and the consequently pressing schedule, the appointments came to face disputes.”President Moon took office on May 10, without a transition period right after the May 9 election, to fill in state leadership that had remained vacant since former President Park Geun-hye’s ouster by impeachment on March 10.Earlier in the morning, Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Jun Byung-hun made his way to the National Assembly to talk with Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and floor leaders of four parties.“It is true that the prime minister appointment was made in a hurry as we were trying to minimize the vacuum ,” Jun said in the meeting, offering an apology to the participants.This was the second apologetic gesture from Cheong Wa Dae, following that by presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok on Friday.With the inauguration of the Moon government, pressure escalated on the appointment of a new prime minister. With predecessor Hwang Kyo-ahn out of the position, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, who is also set to step down, is heading the Cabinet. The centrist People’s Party, which holds 40 out of the 299 parliamentary seats, embraced the president’s gestures.“While Lee has some problems, our party decided to cooperate in the appointment process,” said floor leader Kim Dong-cheol, urging the president to show some responsible actions hereafter.The minority conservative Bareun Party, too, gestured its consent for the nominations, though it also criticized the president, accusing him of inconsistency.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, however, held its ground and set to deter the prime minister’s appointment.“Our party platform is to refuse Lee’s appointment as prime minister,” said the party’s acting chief and floor leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik.“We are only asking the president to keep the promise he himself had made.”Despite the brawl over the president’s personnel decisions, public sentiment remained largely in support of the new state leader over the weekend.According to a survey released by pollster Realmeter on Monday, those in favor of President Moon’s state administration stood at 84.1 percent, up 2.5 percentage points from the previous week.By Bae Hyun-jung  and Jo He-rim","posts monday after president ,appointment citing ethical breaches ,campaign following the president ,resisted their appointment citing ,monday after president moon","['Cabinet', 'Moon Jae -', 'Moon']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34751529  0.08585133

Lee Yong-ho of the centrist People’s Party in the party‘s emergency meeting.”“The public have a right to know how and where Cheong Wa Dae used these special activity expenses.” Former President Park, now on trial over corruption allegations, has been widely criticized for her lavish lifestyle in the presidential residence. She purchased expensive beds and workout equipment and even treated her high-profile guests to luxury delicacies such as caviar, lobster and shark’s fin soup on taxpayers’ money. The allegation came a day after Cheong Wa Dae announced that it would cut spending on special activities by as much as 42 percent and President Moon would use his own money for family meals and personal items. Cheong Wa Dae, ministries, police, prosecution, spy agency and other important government bodies are given the special activity expenses which amounted to 887 billion won last year. The special activity expenses are supposed to conduct investigations and perform duties, which is crucial to national security and requires confidentiality. But the expenses are offered in cash and those who use the money do not have to provide receipts in the expense report, which critics claimed lacks transparency and was a key source of corruption.“The People’s Party will look in to whether the budget for special activities in the spy agency, prosecution and police is properly used and will push for drastically reducing it,” he said, adding that such spending should be limited to intelligence activities.

Arriving at the Seoul Central District Court Tuesday morning, Park made her first public appearance since she was indicted and arrested on 18 charges in mid-April. The charges against hear include bribery, abuse of power, coercion and leaks of government secrets to her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.She was handcuffed with her inmate number 503 attached to her navy suit, escorted by correctional officials.This composite file photo shows former President Park Geun-hye  and her confidante Choi Soon-sil  as they enter a courtroom at the Seoul Central District Court on May 23, 2017, to stand trial over a string of corruption charges. The photo on the left shows former President Chun Doo-hwan  and former President Roh Tae-woo  on Aug. 26, 1996, in prison uniforms in the same courtroom being tried on numerous counts of insurgency, graft and murder. She was escorted to the courtroom that was the stage for the 1996 trial of Chun Doo-hwan and his successor Roh Tae-woo, where they were tried for their roles in the 1979 military coup and corruption charges. The two were given the death penalty and 22.5 years in prison respectively in the first trial, but later were pardoned by former President Kim Young-sam. The courtroom has also been used for the trials of the country’s top business moguls. The list of the courtroom’s famous guests includes Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee, Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn on a variety of charges including embezzlement. Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman and the group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong is also in his own trial in the same courtroom under suspicion of having bribed Choi in return for Park’s aid in the controversial merger of two Samsung units. The merger was seen as a crucial step to smooth the transfer of power from his father and its chairman.The corruption scandal removed Park from office on March 10, which triggered the earlier-than-scheduled May 9 presidential election.The ousted ex-leader’s main charges include an allegation that she received bribes worth some 59.2 billion won  from three conglomerates -- Samsung, Lotte and SK -- to two foundations allegedly operated by herself and Choi. Also on Tuesday, Choi and Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin stood trial along with Park. The ex-leader’s verdict of the first trial is expected to come mid-October following tight-scheduled three-to-four hearings per week.By Bak Se-hwan","district court tuesday morning ,court tuesday morning park ,arrested on 18 charges ,the stand on tuesday ,tuesday morning park made","['Park Geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.00767836  0.48432943

Amid a barrage of camera flashes and with some 150 spectators looking on, Park entered the courtroom No. 417, where two of South Korea’s former presidents had also stood trial. The chief judge Kim Se-yun of the three-justice panel addressed her as “the accused Park Geun-hye” and asked her what her occupation is. She feebly responded, “I have no occupation.”Former President Park Geun-hye Park’s presidency ended prematurely in March after months of a humiliating scandal that the conservative president allowed her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, a daughter of a cult leader with no policy background, to meddle in state affairs and conspired to extort bribes from large conglomerates. Since late March, Park has been locked up in a solitary cell in a detention center. At the courtroom Tuesday, Choi sat beside Park. But during the three-hour hearing, the two, who were close for over 40 years, did not even glance at each other. They both looked straight ahead and at times talked to their respective lawyers. As widely expected, Park denied all the charges. Her lawyer Yoo Young-ha claimed that the scandal was based on “imagination” and that Park had no reason to commit such wrongdoings. Asked directly whether she agrees, Park said, “My stance is the same with my lawyers. I will say  afterward.” Prosecutors pressed a total of 18 charges against the former president. Among them, a key allegation is that she colluded with Choi to take bribes totaling 59.2 billion won  from three local firms -- Samsung, Lotte and SK -- and to extort donations from local firms for entities controlled by Choi in return for policy favors. The prosecution shot back, claiming that its investigation was based on factual relations it confirmed through evidence and testimony. Reading out the charges against Park and Choi, it said: “The former president standing trial is a part of unfortunate history. But it also shows that the rule of law in that a president can also be judged in the judicial sector if there are any irregularities.”Former President Park Geun-hye  and her now-jailed confidante Choi Soon-sil  sit in a courtroom in the Seoul Central District Court on May 23, 2017, to stand trial over a string of corruption charges. When the judge asked Choi whether she had anything to say, Choi fiercely defended Park.“I am like a sinner who made President Park Geun-hye, who I have been with for 40 years, appear in the courtroom,” she said on the verge of tears. “I hope this trial truly frees Park from accusations and lets her be remembered as a president who has devoted herself to the country.”Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin also took the stand with the two as an accomplice in the bribery scheme. He is suspected of offering kickbacks to the Choi-controlled entities and expecting Park to help his firm to secure the business rights for a duty-free shop.During the trial, the court refused to accept Park’s request to separate her trial from Choi’s. The judge said it was “inevitable” to try Park and Choi in the same courtroom, citing the same charges against them and a slew of common witnesses involved in the case. “We understand Park’s lawyer’s concerns, but we will hear the case in accordance with the law and the Constitution without any predictions or prejudice,” the court said. The hearings will be held twice to three times per week for the coming weeks to give Park’s lawyers enough time to review the 120,000-page investigation records. But the bench said it could “inevitably” hold up to four hearings per week to accelerate the proceedings.Park, who was indicted April 17, can be detained for up to six months from the date of the indictment, which means the court should make a ruling on the bribery case by mid-October at the latest.Escorted by correctional officers, Park arrived in handcuffs at the court at around 9:10 a.m. earlier in the day. It was her first appearance in public since she was taken into custody on March 31 over the corruption charges.Former President Park Geun-hye enters the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul on May 23, 2017, to stand trial over alleged bribery. Reflecting public interest in the historic trial, the No. 417 courtroom was packed with some 150 spectators and reporters. The court earlier held a draw to allocate spectator seats. “I applied for a seat because I wanted to see Park Geun-hye myself and attend the historic trial,” Lee Su-jeong, a 19-year-old student, told The Korea Herald. “I hope the trial can reveal the truth and help eradicate the past practices of corruption involving presidents and companies.”Outside the court building, some 200 supporters of the former president gathered, chanting “Release the president immediately!” As the bus carrying Park went past them at around 9 a.m., some dropped to the ground and wiped their tears.Park is also charged with abuse of power for letting Choi meddle in state affairs, helping her business interests and excluding liberal artists critical of her from state support as well as sacking government officials who refused to aid or abet her wrongdoings. Another major charge is leaking government secrets to Choi. The corruption scandal, which triggered massive street protests for weeks, led the parliament to impeach Park on Dec. 9, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term. The decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court in a unanimous ruling on March 10.Through a six-month probe into the corruption scandal, the prosecution indicted about 30 people including Choi, former presidential aides, ex-ministers and Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong in connection with the scandal. If convicted of bribery, which carries the heaviest punishment among all the charges, Park could be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of at least 10 years.Park, who was the first woman to reach the highest office in South Korea, is the third president to face trial on criminal charges, following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.By Ock Hyun-ju","trial hearing former president ,hearing former president park ,suit with her prison ,hearing former president ,begins for ousted president","['Park Geun', 'Park', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim Se - yun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21363561 -0.01253385

If convicted, she could face a prison term ranging from 10 years to life.In this file photo taken on March 31, 2017, former President Park Geun-hye arrives at a detention center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, after a local court issued a warrant to arrest her over a string of corruption allegations. The former president is also suspected of colluding with Choi and her aide to force dozens of companies from 18 business groups, including the three conglomerates, to pay a total of 77.4 billion won in ""donations"" to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, allegedly controlled by Choi. Lee Jae-yong, de facto leader of the country's largest business group Samsung, is standing trial for allegedly providing or pledging 43.3 billion won to Choi and in effect, to Park, in return for helping him secure group control through a merger of two key units. Of the total, 20.4 billion won went to the two foundations.Shin Dong-bin, the chairman of the country's fifth-largest business group Lotte, was also indicted for allegedly giving 7 billion won of donations to K-Sports, though the money was returned just before the retail giant was investigated over separate corporate crime allegations.The third-largest SK Group was asked to provide 8.9 billion won to the sports foundation but rejected the demand.Prosecutors suspect that Park promised favors regarding the two conglomerates' bids to operate duty-free shops and other pending issues in return for the money. Park is also accused of creating a blacklist of cultural figures deemed critical of the government to deny them state support from 2013 to 2016. Prosecutors said Park allegedly sacked three senior officials at the country's culture ministry for being reluctant to execute the blacklist.She was charged with attempted coercion for pressuring the resignation of food and entertainment giant CJ Group's Vice Chairwoman Lee Mi-kyung for TV shows and movies critical of her administration.In other cases of abuse of power and coercion, Park is suspected of abusing her authority to promote a bank official close to Choi and pressuring local firms to sign business contracts with Choi's companies. South Korea's top automaker Hyundai Motor signed a 1.1 billion-won supply contract with a firm belonging to one of Choi's associates between 2015 and 2016, and a 7.1 billion-won deal with an ad agency held by Choi last year. Leading steelmaker Posco was forced to create a fencing team to be placed under the control of one of Choi's companies in March 2016, prosecutors said. Telecom giant KT was pressured to hire figures close to Choi as the company's executives and to sign a 6.8 billion-won deal with Choi's advertising company, they said.Park was also charged with leaking 47 documents, including government secrets, to Choi from January 2013 to April 2016, through her longtime aide Jeong Ho-seong. During the two preparatory sessions held at the court, Park's lawyers denied all the corruption charges leveled against her. She did not appear at the two sessions as her attendance was not mandatory.Unlike preliminary sessions, suspects are required to attend formal hearings. Park is the country's third former president to stand trial over corruption allegations, after Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were convicted in 1996-97.","bribes worth 59 billion ,corruption charges in 18 ,president park faces corruption ,solicited bribes worth 59 ,trial tuesday on charges","['Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Samsung', 'Lotte', 'Choi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.02129181  0.36057973

The merger is said to have helped consolidate the Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong's control over the business group.  Former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo arrives at the Seoul Central District Court in the capital on May 22, 2017, for his sentence hearing over allegations he pressured the state-run pension fund to approve a controversial merger of Samsung Group's two affiliates in 2015. Moon is also accused of lying under oath for denying the allegation during a parliamentary hearing in November.The former minister was the first among dozens to be indicted by a special counsel who looked into the influence-peddling scandal that removed former President Park Geun-hye from office. Special prosecutors said the presidential office was behind the controversial merger and indicted Park on charges of bribery.Samsung's Lee is also standing trial over suspicions of giving kickbacks to Park's longtime friend Choi, and in effect to Park, in return for business favors.On the same day, prosecutors also sought a seven-year term for Hong Wan-sun, who led the asset management division of the NPS, for inflicting losses to the state-run pension fund by approving the merger. ""It is a severe crime that damaged the pension fund's independence and gave the owner family of a conglomerate profits based on people's pocket money,"" a prosecution official told a court. Both Moon and Hong are denying any legal wrongdoing.","scandal prosecutors on monday ,sought seven year prison ,prosecutors on monday sought ,prosecutors seek year term ,prosecutors seek year","['Samsung', 'Moon Hyung - pyo', 'the National Pension Service', 'Samsung C&T Corp.', 'Cheil Industries Inc.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53946584  0.0859484

She is obliged to show up at the Seoul Central District Court at 2 p.m. in southern Seoul for the first hearing of the high-profile case. The court held two preliminary hearings earlier, but she was not obliged to attend. Park, who was ejected from power in March with less than a year left in her five-year term, is accused of abuse of power, government secret leaks and bribery, among others. She claims innocence. Former President Park Geun-hye  leaves the prosecutors' office in a car as she is transferred to a detention center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, March 31, 2017. To see the former leader taking the stand, over 500 people had applied for the 68 seats available. At the upcoming trial, Park will sit side-by-side with Choi Soon-sil, Park’s friend of over 40 years and the central figure in the scandal that led to her disgraceful fall from power. Choi was indicted as an accomplice in many of Park’s alleged crimes, including the bribery scheme. “We deny all the charges, including bribes from Samsung,” Park’s top lawyer Yoo Young-ha said during a preliminary hearing.Choi’s attorneys asked the court to separate her trial from Park’s, citing emotional distress in facing Park in the same courtroom but were rejected by the court. Park is also under suspicion of allowing her friend with no title in the government to peddle influence in state ranging from nominating senior officials to deciding Park’s daily wardrobe choices.Choi herself is on her own trial for bribery and abuse of power, as is Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong who is under detention for allegedly bribing Choi in exchange for political support of a controversial merger of two Samsung units seen as a crucial step to smooth the transfer of power from his father and its chairman Lee Kun-hee.The scandal removed her from office on March 10, which triggered the earlier-than-scheduled May 9 presidential election.By Bak Se-hwan","tuesday since being indicted ,tuesday former president park ,court appearance on tuesday ,tuesday former president ,court tuesday former president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.32249478  0.51772594

Park was accused of receiving or demanding 59.2 billion won  in bribes from conglomerates, including Samsung Group. The court earlier had two preparatory hearings for the trial but Park did not have to attend. But Park will show up for the first hearing because it is mandatory for the accused to attend formal hearings. This would be her first public appearance since she was arrested on bribery and other charges on March 31. She was removed from office on March 10.Park, during the upcoming hearing, is expected to hold fast to her earlier position of denying all charges against her. There is also the possibility that she could directly defend herself. Her defense lawyers have claimed that the former president was not aware of the alleged illegalities committed by Choi and had not offered to help Samsung make a management transition between father and son. They have also made clear that Park has never directly demanded conglomerates donate a huge sum of money to two nonprofit foundations -- Mir and K-Sports -- that were reportedly controlled by Choi.Choi, who has denied all charges against her, is forecast to maintain that position.Prosecutors, in contrast, believe that the two have practically shared economic profits and Choi received financial support in exchange for helping Samsung's management rights transfer.The second formal hearing for Park's trial is scheduled for two days later. Park will be the only one to attend the hearing among those accused in the case as the court already finished hearing from Choi about her abuse of power and coercion charges. The court will review written evidence on Choi's charges.","hearing for tuesday park ,week former president park ,52 million in bribes ,the hearing for tuesday ,this week former president","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung Group']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.02573752 0.32016858 0.17339605],a2016032,Social affairs,5,2017,"hearing for tuesday park ,hearing of her corruption trial ,the hearing for tuesday park ,bribes from conglomerates including samsung ,scheduled the hearing for tuesday","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Samsung Group', 'Choi', 'Samsung', 'Park', 'K - Sports', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Samsung', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Choi']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.02573752 0.32016858 0.17339605]

Earlier in the day, acting justice minister Lee Chang-jae, who has headed the Justice Ministry since late November, also offered to step down, saying “I should be the first one to give up what I have to restore the public trust in light of the recent incident.” Lee and Ahn had dinner with the special investigation team on March 21 and gave cash bonuses to the investigators, only four days after the team ended the probe into the scandal, indicting several high-profile figures including ousted leader Park herself. But the team faced public criticism for its failure to arrest prosecutor-turned-presidential aide Woo Byung-woo, who is accused of being at the core of the irregularities. The cash bonus is suspected as kickbacks in return for saving Woo from detention. Upon the order by President Moon, the Justice Ministry and state prosecutors formed a 22-person team and opened an internal audit on Thursday into the alleged cash exchanges between Yoon’s predecessor and investigators. The team asked the prosecutors involved in the case to turn in a report to explain their stance.This combined photo shows Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office  and Ahn Tae-geun, ranking official at the Ministry of Justice. The two offered to resign on May 18, 2017, one day after President Moon Jae-in ordered an inspection into allegations they inappropriately exchanged money. Lee and Ahn have been demoted and transferred to Busan District Prosecutors’ Office and Daegu District Prosecutors’ Office, respectively. The presidential office earlier refused to accept their resignations, citing an ongoing audit into the officials.The new chief Yoon, a senior prosecutor at the Daejeon High Prosecutors’ Office, has until February served as one of the assistant prosecutors to Independent Counsel Park Young-soo for a 70-day probe into the scandal. Yoon has gained a reputation for having an uncompromising attitude toward the powerful after he publicly revealed that there had been outside influence in his investigation into the nation’s spy agency’s alleged meddling in the election. Since then, he has been excluded from major posts in the prosecution. “I took on a demanding role. I will think a lot and do my best,” Yoon told reporters after the announcement.The appointment of Yoon is expected to accelerate the reforms of the prosecutors‘ office, which has long been accused of holding too much power. The organization has also been accused of being politically motivated, and of abusing its powers. The revamp of the prosecution has been one of Moon’s key election promises.Public distrust of the prosecution hit a tipping point in the wake of the corruption scandal, with it criticized for being lukewarm in investigating cases related to ranking officials under the Park administration and being politicized in favor of the government. Moon is also expected to fill other posts in the prosecution in the near future as it has had a leadership vacuum after Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong and Prosecutor-General Kim Soo-nam, all appointed by ousted President Park, stepped down.By Ock Hyun-ju","friday named reformist prosecutor ,new chief of seoul ,major prosecutors office president ,former president park geun ,prosecutors office president moon","['Moon Jae - in', 'Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Moon', 'Yoon Seok - yeol', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56720513  0.653732

The Seoul Central District Court made the first ruling on figures implicated in the massive corruption and influence-peddling scandal centering on the disgraced former leader and her close friend Choi Soon-sil. Park was ousted and arrested in March. Dr. Kim Young-jae received 18 months in prison, suspended for three years, for giving cosmetic treatments to Park at the presidential office without keeping any official records from 2014 to 2016.Dr. Kim Young-jae leaves the Seoul Central District Court in the capital on May 18, 2017, after he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for three years, for treating former President Park Geun-hye without keeping official records. He was also found guilty of lying under oath for denying the fact during a parliamentary hearing in December.Kim and his wife, Park Chae-yoon, were convicted of giving some 18 million won  in bribes to Park's senior secretary An Chong-bum and his wife between 2014 and 2015. Kim's wife was also found to have given an extra 31 million won worth of kickbacks to the couple and 10 million won to another presidential aide between 2015 and 2016.She was sentenced to a year in prison, and Kim was ordered to pay a fine of 3 million won. Dr. Kim Sang-man was ordered to pay a 10 million-won fine for fabricating medical records to conceal his treatments of Park.The court took into consideration that he inevitably faked the records as the president asked that her identity be concealed and that he did not seem to have gained any profits through the wrongdoing. Medical professor Chung Kee-yang at Yonsei University was sentenced to a year in prison for perjury. He served as Park's dermatology consultant from 2013 to 2014. He is accused of denying during the parliamentary inquiry that he planned to give Park a beauty treatment that was developed by Dr. Kim Young-jae. ""The defendant lied to prevent possible backlashes to himself and his hospital,"" the court said. ""It is equivalent to lying to the whole nation."" Lee Im-soon, medical professor at Sunchunhyang University, who was also indicted for perjury, received a 10-month prison term, suspended for two years. The court considered her acknowledgment of her wrongdoing.At the parliamentary hearing she lied, denying that she introduced Kim Young-jae and his wife to Suh Chang-suk, CEO of Seoul National University Hospital.

Allegations that bribes were involved in Park and Lee’s interactions, among other claims of wrongdoing, led to the early election of a new South Korean president last week. “We had few opportunities to carry out face-to-face questioning of Park ,” said the investigation team at the court, referring to Park’s earlier rejection in February for questioning in person. The court justices said they would consider the request and when to summon her.If summoned, Park would have to testify at Lee’s hearing for his charges, which include having bribed Choi Soon-sil to the tune of 7.8 billion won  to fund her daughter’s equestrian training in Germany in return for favors from Park. Lee’s Samsung Group is also the biggest contributor to two foundations allegedly operated by Park and Choi -- the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- giving 20.4 billion won in return for the government‘s alleged backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. Park herself is under detention and undergoing her own trial after state prosecutors indicted her last month over bribery, extortion, abuse of power and other high-profile corruption charges in collusion with Choi. The charges, if confirmed, could potentially send her to jail for life.By Bak Se-hwan","scandal surrounding former president ,witness in the trial ,photo shows former president ,investigation team which indicted ,that investigated the scandal","['Park Geun', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Counsel', 'Lee', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44857982  0.12571342

At the dinner, the two senior officials offered envelopes, each containing between 700,000 won and 1 million won , to each other's underlings, Yoon Young-chan, Moon's chief press secretary noted.Woo was questioned over a range of allegations, but the prosecution's two attempts to arrest him were dismissed by a court.The court rejection prompted suspicions that the team did not throughly investigate the case involving Woo, who once served as a senior prosecutor. ""The internal investigation teams of the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Prosecutors' Office must thoroughly investigate the case to see if there have been any violations of the anti-graft law and make sure government officials remain disciplined,"" Yoon told a press briefing.The ministry official, Ahn Tae-geun, has also been said to have held hundreds of telephone conversations with Woo while the latter was still working at the presidential office but was subject to investigation by an independent counsel.Woo currently faces a trial over allegations that also include negligence of duty for failing to prevent Park's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil from interfering in government affairs and extorting tens of billions of won from local businesses.He is one of very few suspects in the case to face trial without physical detention, while the former president herself remains in custody.The justice ministry and prosecution earlier acknowledged the dinner and envelope full of what they called bonuses may have been inappropriate, but not illegal.The money, the justice ministry has said, ""was executed under related provisions for budget to partly help finance the prosecution's investigation following the end of an important case and such bonuses have been frequently given in the past.""Still, two justice ministry officials who were offered such envelopes by the chief of the Seoul Nambu District Prosecutors'Office, Lee Young-ryeol, returned the money to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office the very next day after they had dinner with Lee.Also following the announcement of the president's order, the justice ministry released a statement, vowing to carry out a thorough inspection.""The inspection body of the ministry will promptly establish plans in collaboration with our counterparts from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office and take the necessary measures after getting to the bottom of the case based on law and due procedures,"" it said.","probe against former presidential ,aide to ousted president ,against former presidential aide ,former presidential aide president ,president orders probe against","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Woo Byung - woo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.28929901  0.21553761

Wearing a Marine Corps uniform, Kim tried to break through the building's front doors by driving his truck back and forth some 10 times, but his vehicle was stuck between the doors before the police arrested him at the scene. The incident left JTBC's glass doors broken and the door frames warped, but caused no further damage.At the time of arrest, Kim was carrying a letter for JTBC's president and a placard on his truck, which recommended the JTBC head as the next South Korean president.Investigation later revealed that Kim has a record of receiving treatment for schizophrenia. In October, JTBC reported that Park leaked presidential speeches and other confidential documents to her long-time friend Choi Soon-sil. Park was removed from office on March 10 as the Constitutional Court upheld the parliament's impeachment.","prison wednesday for driving ,year in prison wednesday ,her impeachment the seoul ,jail term for slamming ,broadcasting firm over scandal","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Western District Court', 'Kim', 'JTBC', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.16061483  0.02438929

During the second preparatory session for her trial at the Seoul Central District Court, Park's legal representatives denied all charges leveled against her and said her case should be reviewed apart from Choi Soon-sil's case.The former president was indicted last month over a string of corruption allegations, including bribery and abuse of power, in many of which she was named as an accomplice to Choi, who has been already standing trial since last year. This file photo shows former President Park Geun-hye entering the Seoul Central District Court on March 30, 2017, to attend a hearing on her arrest warrant.  Prosecutors suspect that Park took or solicited bribes worth 59.2 billion won  from three local conglomerates -- Samsung, Lotte and SK -- for her or her friend.Park's indictment was delayed as she was immune from prosecution until the Constitutional Court dismissed her as the country's president in a March 10 ruling. ""Merging the two cases is inappropriate as it can prejudice the judges against the defendant,"" attorney Lee Sang-chul said. Her lawyers also pointed to the fact that Choi was indicted by a special prosecutor who was designated to look into the scandal, and Park was charged by state prosecutors. They claimed that the testimonies and evidence provided by the special prosecutor should not be used in Park's trial. Still, it is unclear whether the court will accept Park's request. ""The two defendants' criminal allegations, as well as the list of witnesses, perfectly coincide with each other,"" the presiding Judge Kim Se-yun said during the session. ""If we separate the cases, we need to summon the same witnesses twice."" Judge Kim also said there were precedents where a case filed by a special prosecutor was merged with a case filed by the prosecution. He said he will further review the request and make a decision. Park was absent from Tuesday's session as her attendance was not mandatory.The first formal hearing is slated for May 23. It will be the first public appearance made by the former leader, who has been jailed since March 31.She is the country's third former president to stand trial over corruption allegations, after Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were convicted in the early 1990s.","representatives denied all charges ,tuesday asked seoul court ,park legal representatives denied ,former president park geun ,to separate her trial","['Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Park']",4,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.29356012  0.33092126

In South Korea in 2015, a bank opened to help modern-day Jean Valjeans, poor petty offenders who go to jail because they can’t afford to pay a few million won in fines and penalties. “As long as their offenses are not grave, we consider lending,” Oh Chang-ik, head of the Jean Valjean Bank said during an interview with The Korea Herald.  Oh Chang-ik, head of Jean Valjean Bank poses in an interview with The Korea Herald. Every year, approximately 40,000 small-time offenders go to jail and endure prison labor because of their failure to pay penalties, he explained. Since its inception two years ago, the microcredit scheme has offered some 460 minor criminals loans totaling 8 billion won . Of them, 66 debtors have fully paid off their loans, while 241 others are in the process of doing so, as of this week, according to Oh. The bank provides up to 3 million won per person, with no interest and no collateral. Debtors are asked to repay six months to a year later. All it asks for is a written statement of why they need the money and a copy of the applicant’s family registration document via email or mail. Of course, it has its own screening standards. “We look at how much they need the money and their family situation, for example whether the applicant is a single mother with young children,” said Oh who doubles as the secretary-general of Citizens’ Solidarity for Human Rights, which initiated this project in February 2015. “We do not give out loans to offenders of sexual crimes or those caught for drunk driving. The money is for offenders of a crime that did little social harm,” he said. Those who committed heinous crimes such as murder and robbery, economic crimes like bribery and embezzlement and habitual offenders are also ruled out. Oh said the bank receives approximately 180 applications monthly. Priority is given to teenagers living by themselves, young heads of the family, recipients of the basic livelihood security benefits and people living just above the poverty line.“Personally, I want to help young offenders in poverty so that they don’t have to spend time behind bars,” he said.The microcredit bank started with just 10 million won from Citizens’ Solidarity for Human Rights. Relying entirely on donations, Oh had some concerns in the beginning that the bank may run out of funds, if donations fall short or loan defaults rise. “But thankfully, that has not happened,” Oh said. Quite to the opposite, its loan pot has grown to 800 million won at this moment, as donations grew and many debtors paid off in full. Nearly 4,300 individuals and groups have made contributions. Among them are some former debtors. “Interestingly and gratefully, some people, a few years after they received our loans, sent us their donations from 10,000-20,000 won,” Oh said.Oh’s ultimate dream is that one day Jean Valjean Bank is not needed anymore. “If no one goes to prison because of poverty, our bank will have no work to do. I hope that day will come,” he said.The activist also said that the government has a key role to play. Under the current law, one who is sentenced to a financial penalty must make the full payment in 30 days. “I believe the current disciplinary provision has a lot to improve. Making criminals do labor in prison just because they cannot afford to pay fines is meaningless and gives them unnecessary pain.” Quoting Article 11 of the Constitution that all citizens are equal before the law, Oh stressed that the system is unfair for poor offenders. Rich offenders walk free, while poor ones go to jail to make up for the financial penalty which is set regardless of one‘s income level. “In our society, income inequality is leading to unequal punishment.”By Kim Da-sol","prison for stealing loaf ,his sister starving children ,in prison for stealing ,million won in fines ,19 years in prison","['Jean Valjean', 'South Korea', 'Jean Valjeans']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19206668 -0.15079333

The newly elected president has also issued a directive to allow a song, banned under the previous conservative administrations, to be sung at the upcoming event that marks the 1980 pro-democracy uprising in Gwangju. With the presidential order, “March for the Beloved” will likely be sung for the first time in nine years. “The president has ordered a withdrawal of state-published history textbooks,” presidential secretary Yoon Young-chan said in a briefing. “The decision shows Moon’s firm will to block any attempt to use history education for political purposes.” Textbooks were to be introduced at middle and high schools nationwide in 2018.  Chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan speaks at a press briefing at Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on May 12, 2017 With the withdrawal, schools choose from books published by state-approved private publishing companies and written under some guidelines of the government, according to Yoon.Former President Park had pushed for “correct” history education through state-combined books, claiming “a left-leaning, pro-North Korea bias” in private publishers’ textbooks. The plan faced immediate backlash from liberals and local schools as an attempt to glorify the military regime of Park’s father, President Park Chung-hee. “As  remains strongly against Park’s education policies, he is willing to reform them one by one, including the shift from the controversial state-authored textbooks,” Ministry of Education deputy spokesperson Jeong Seung-hwa told The Korea Herald.Also on Friday, Moon accepted the resignation of Prosecutor-General Kim Soo-nam, who tendered his resignation a day earlier.  Yoon said the president had agonized over Kim‘s resignation. He had seven months left in his two-year tenure.“But in the face of an unprecedented impeachment of a president and the launch of a new government following an early election, the president decided to respect Prosecutor-General Kim’s decision to resign so as not to place any burden on the new government,” the presidential official said.By Bak Se-hwan","impeached former president park ,scrapping of state textbooks ,of impeached former president ,impeached former president ,history textbooks signature project","['Moon Jae - in', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.10699795  0.01027774

The archives began the transfer last month with an aim to complete it before the launch of the new president's official term Wednesday. President Moon Jae-in's five-year term began immediately as the rare presidential by-election on Tuesday was aimed at filling the top elected office after Park was ousted in a corruption scandal. Of the total documents, 204,000, or 1.8 percent, have been designated as restricted access for a period of 15 years, or up to 30 years. By law, the president can designate such records. The authority was given to former Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn after Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9. The number is less than 260,000 documents from the Lee Myung-bak administration and 340,000 from the Roh Moo-hyun administration, the archives said. Some critics have voiced concerns over possible access restriction to documents that may hold key evidence in relation to the presidential scandal. Park was arrested and indicted over a string of allegations involving her friend and aides.

Citing a ministry official, the broadcaster said the ministry was suspected of delaying the operations to win favors from Moon in terms of expanding its staff number and affiliated organizations.SBS later offered an apology to Moon and the bereaved families and deleted all the relevant reports on its website.Moon's liberal Democratic Party immediately dismissed the report as groundless and filed a petition with the prosecution.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it has allocated the case to its public security department, which is in charge of investigations into election law violations.Prosecutors said the case will be dealt with in accordance with the routine procedures, though some watchers forecast a full-scale investigation could be put off until after the May 9 presidential election.Following the broadcaster's apology, the ministry has said that the official quoted in the news report just delivered what he read on the Internet.The National Election Commission said it has opened its own probe into the TV report to determine whether the broadcaster or the official violated election laws by disclosing false information to prevent the election of a particular candidate.In a related move, conservative presidential candidate Hong Joon-pyo and his Liberty Korea Party have filed a separate petition, asking prosecutors to open investigations into whether Minister of Oceans and Fisheries Kim Young-suk and ministry officials violated the principle of political neutrality in elections.Hong and the conservative party also asked prosecutors to investigate whether Moon's camp strong-armed SBS into deleting the Sewol ferry report and issuing a public apology.","seoul prosecutors said saturday ,violations surrounding recent television ,slander presidential front runner ,ferry salvage delay seoul ,prosecutors said saturday","['Seoul', 'Moon Jae - in', 'the Ministry of Oceans', 'Moon']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.3691633   0.61187577

He claimed Park's powers were suspended in December after the parliament passed an impeachment motion, but the prosecution made it appear that she exercised presidential authority until the Constitutional Court ruled to dismiss her in March.Prosecutors concluded last month that the former president took or solicited bribes worth 59.2 billion won  from three conglomerates -- Samsung, Lotte and SK -- for herself or her friend.Attorneys for Choi and Lotte Chairman Shin Dong-bin were also present at the hearing.Park is also accused of creating a blacklist of cultural figures deemed critical of the government who were then denied state support, and abusing her power to force local firms to sign business contracts with Choi's companies.The former president has denied all charges.If convicted, she could face a prison term ranging from 10 years to life.The trial comes after a six-month probe that followed revelations of a tablet PC allegedly used by Choi. The device, obtained by a local TV channel, contained documents related to state affairs, some of which the prosecution concluded were official secrets.Lee Jae-yong, de facto leader of the nation's largest business group Samsung, was also arrested on charges of providing or pledging 43.3 billion won to Choi and, in effect, Park, in return for her help in securing group control through a merger of two key units.Park is the country's third former president to stand trial over corruption allegations, after Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were convicted in the early 1990s.The court is expected to hold two or three more preliminary hearings before opening the first formal hearing around June.","lawyer denies all corruption ,her trial tuesday park ,of her trial tuesday ,her trial tuesday ,denies all corruption charges","[""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Yoo Yeong - ha']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.09854574  0.00715601

The bags were confiscated immediately at the site.  Bags of methamphetamine confiscated by the prosecution. The shipment, estimated to be worth at least 13 billion won , was allegedly intended to be delivered to an unidentified Korean-American man for 3.5 million won. The soldier had borrowed his colleague’s army post office address for $1,000 and designated him as the mail recipient in the crime, according the court document. The suspect’s colleague was acquitted of all charges. “The offence is serious as it holds the potential to spread negative influence, such as the side effects of drug abuse, and  inspire similar crimes in society,” the Uijeongbu District Court said. “However, the fact that the drugs were seized before being released to the public and his faithful service in the army were considered in the ruling.” The prosecution failed to identify the Korean-American called Jason, who is accused of orchestrating the crime. The case is closely linked to another drug trafficking crime at around the same time that involved another group of soldiers who tried to smuggle illegal drugs into Korea by hiding them in cereal boxes.

The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011. A government-led investigation later confirmed a connection between scores of people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.The Seoul High Court said it cannot acknowledge that the professor intentionally omitted data and inappropriately reached a conclusion for Oxy. ""The report released by Cho also included probe results that were very unfavorable to Oxy,"" it said. A lower court had sentenced Cho to two years in prison, viewing the 12 million won  he received from the company as a de facto bribe in return for the report which it said was biased. The appeals court, however, acknowledged the money as a legitimate consultancy fee.Still, the high court upheld the district court's ruling that convicted Cho of fraud and sentenced him to a year in prison, suspended for two years.

Later in his life, however, he moved into information technology by developing the nation’s first anti-virus software V1 in 1988 and founding AhnLab in 1995.Once Ahn chose to devote himself to politics, it meant he absolutely had to achieve something tangible -- in this case the presidency -- and is not likely to give up easily on his determined path, according to Kim.“After all, he already had to retreat twice, first in the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election and then in the 2012 presidential election,” he said.“The straight-A student that he is, Ahn has become more resolute than ever to get his way and to prove his qualities to the audience.”Such strong target consciousness explains his recent acquisition of an aggressive vocal tone and speech manner, reflecting his efforts to “grasp victory at all costs.”The psychologist also suggested his views on other candidates -- Hong Joon-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party, Yoo Seong-min of the Bareun Party, and Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party.“Hong is an ‘arsonist’ type of character, mostly motivated by personal anger, which makes him more fit for a prosecutor than a politician,” he said.He described Yoo as an “elite sniper” type who is used to being second-in-command, and Sim as a champion who struggles against society and its inequalities.May 9 electionPublic sentiment always seeks to eliminate the most oppressive issues in society. In the early 20th century, it was Japanese colonial rule, and in the 1960s-80s it was the military dictatorship.But for those living in 2017, the greatest pain is the loss of dignity, Kim explained.“The state scandal last year set off the public’s complaints over discrimination and disrespect,” he said.“Facing the revelation that a corrupt few monopolized power and placed the burden on the majority, the people took to the streets in vexed protests.”The monthslong candlelight protests urging for the ouster of Park, as well as the consequent earlier-than-planned presidential election, are all part of the process of “healing” the wounded national pride of the Korean people, he explained.“What now remains during the upcoming weeks leading to Election Day is for the people to clearly face their options and make a choice which may redeem the past setbacks.”By Bae Hyun-jung","psychology in choosing president ,presidents is always difficult ,psychology of prospective presidents ,election 2017 herald interview ,extensive corruption scandal involving","['Kim Tae - hyung', 'the Korea Herald']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4244099   0.71736652

Jung Ok-keun, chief of Naval Operations from 2008 to 2010, arrives at the Seoul Central District Court in the capital to stand trial over bribery allegations. Ending a two-year legal battle, the Supreme Court confirmed his conviction of third-party bribery.A lower court sentenced him to 10 years in prison for bribery and an appeals court reduced it to four years. The highest court in June last year ordered a retrial saying that Jung did not directly receive the money. The prosecution changed his charge to third-party bribery, which applies to a person who exerts influence to help a third person or entity take bribes. In February, he received four years in prison on that charge. He raised an objection, which the top court dismissed. The court also confirmed the lower court's ruling of a suspended two-year term for his son named as accomplice in the crime.","four years in prison ,navy chief for bribery ,prison for taking kickbacks ,thursday dismissed former navy ,his son yacht firm","['Navy', 'Jung Ok - keun', 'STX Group', 'Jung Ok - keun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44703281  0.05726579

I wasn’t actually involved but used the episode in my book to describe my younger days,” Hong told reporters Friday.“The reason that I cannot reveal the actual name of the main person involved is because he is currently of the top tier in influencing the nation’s economy.”In his autobiography, “I Want to Go Back,” published in 2005, Hong recalled a case of one of his friends looking out for an aphrodisiac used on pigs in his attempt to have sex with his crush.He also claimed he and his friends got hold of the drug, but the rape attempt eventually ended in failure, an episode he recalled with partial amusement and some regret.The related story immediately vexed the public when reported by the media late Thursday. Hong canceled some of his pre-planned campaign events upon the news spreading.But apart from that, the conservative candidate retained control, claiming his innocence.“Nobody called it into question when the book was published 10 years ago,” he added.“Now that everybody cares so much, it seems that I am indeed becoming an important  candidate.” An image of Hong Joon-pyo's autobiography “I Want to Go Back,” published in 2005It was the People’s Party, affiliated with candidate Ahn Cheol-soo, which raised its voice against Hong’s lack of qualifications.“Hong, who was previously handed down a criminal sentence for taking illicit political funds, turned out to have another criminal experience as a joint offender in attempted rape during his student years,” the party said through a statement, urging Hong to resign from the presidential race.“Hong should no longer call himself a conservative politician, as he is an ex-convict of the Public Official Election Law, suspected violator of the Political Fund Law and a confessed offender of sexual violence, not an advocate of conservative values.”Hong’s approval rating stood around 10 percent as of Friday -- 9 percent according to Research View and 11.4 percent according to Gallup Korea.Of them, a considerable number are expected to shift to centrist alternative Ahn of the People’s Party in case Hong renounces his candidacy or further loses the favor of the public.Rep. Roh Hoe-chan, floor leader of the progressive minority Justice Party, also raised his voice to urge for Hong’s ouster, referring to him as the “worst-ever conservative candidate, who needs to be isolated from society.”Nonchalant in the face of vicious criticism, Hong continued to appeal to the conservative voter pool and pledged to complete the race without dropping out before votes are cast.“Currently, many conservative voters are leaning toward Ahn, but should they find out the truth about him, they will withdraw support and return ,” Hong said in a debate at the Kwanhun Club, an association of senior journalists.He also expressed confidence in achieving 15 percent or more in the election, claiming recent polls failed to precisely reflect voter sentiment, as was often the case in past elections. Candidates who receive over 15 percent in the presidential vote will have campaign funds refunded after the election.Bae Hyun-jung","party on friday denied ,presidential candidate ,korea party on friday ,the upcoming may election ,friend attempted rape using","['Hong', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Hong', 'Hong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54540628 -0.03413308

An official at the Korea Equestrian Federation said that its discipline committee had a meeting on Monday and decided to permanently ban Chung, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, which prevents her from competing in any equestrian events either domestic or international. Chung, formerly known as Chung Yoo-yeon, is a former member of the South Korean national equestrian team. She won the gold medal in the team dressage equestrian event at the Incheon Asian Games in 2014. Chung has been accused of receiving undue favors in admissions and academic affairs at Ewha Womans University in Seoul thanks to her mother’s influence. The KEF code says those who commit wrongdoings in college admissions are permanently barred from the sport. The audit from the Korea Sport & Olympic Committee and the Ministry of Culture Sports and Tourism last year found that Chung also received undue favors from the KEF based on her mother’s ties with Park. Choi is currently standing trial on charges of meddling in state affairs and amassing profits using her connection to the former president. The audit showed that the KEF doctored documents for Chung in the past and the 20-year-old equestrian rider took advantage of it.In 2015, she received a national team training allowance even though she didn’t appear at training. The KEF discipline committee ordered that Chung should pay back the money that she earned from faking training. Chung is currently in Aalborg, Denmark, after being arrested by local authorities in January. A Danish court on Wednesday upheld prosecutors’ decision to extradite her, but it remains uncertain whether or when Chung will be deported to Seoul, as she appealed to a higher court.","impeached south korean president ,banned from equestrian competitions ,park friend permanently banned ,competitions following her irregularities ,permanently banned from equestrian","['Chung Yoo - ra', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Korea Equestrian Federation', 'Chung']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47169402  0.01342858

Hwang Pil-sang  speaks to reporters at the Supreme Court in Seoul on April 20, 2017, after the top court ruled against huge taxes levied on his donation. Under the Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax Act, a donation made to a foundation for public interest is not subject to taxation, but if the contribution is worth more than 5 percent of the total stakes, it is taxable.Still, the law also stipulates that if the contributor is not the largest stakeholder, the donation is exempt from taxation.

Yoo was hunted by authorities following the Sewol accident that left more than 300 dead or missing, but he was found dead in a field in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province.Yoo borrowed a total of 220 billion won from various financial institutions after Semo Group, the now-defunct predecessor of Chonghaejin Marine, went bankrupt in 1997. KDIC compensated the creditors in his place after Yoo claimed he was incapable of repaying his debts. KDIC billed a total of 14.7 billion won to Yoo, including interest, but the former Semo chairman only repaid 650 million won before declaring bankruptcy. He signed a debit note pledging to pay off his debt and 14 billion won was written off upon the request. However, prosecutors found that Yoo had been hiding assets worth more than 1 billion won under borrowed names, including his children, through an in-depth probe involving the Sewol ferry disaster. The KDIC has been pursuing debt recovery since, which eventually led to a lawsuit against Yoo’s two children through the US legal system in 2015. The court ruling is a summary judgment which does not grant KDIC full authority over the amount owed. The state-run institution will have to take further legal steps to fully recollect its debt.Meanwhile, KDIC expects Yoo’s two children to file an appeal. “Yoo Hyuk-ki and Yoo Sang-na hired A-list attorneys to represent them at the summary court and they’re expected to file an appeal,” said a spokesperson for KDIC. Yoo Byung-eun and members of his family have been implicated in the sinking of the Sewol, due to their alleged mismanagement of Chonghaejin Marine and disregard for safety.By Jung Min-kyung","late sewol ferry owner ,must repay korea deposit ,lawsuit against family members ,insurance corp 19 billion ,orders late sewol ferry","['Yoo Byung - eun', 'Korea Deposit Insurance Corp.', 'New York', 'South Korea ’s', 'KDIC', 'Yoo', 'Chonghaejin Marine']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14446951  0.14579335

With the indictment, the prosecutors ended a six-month, multifaceted probe into the corruption scandal that forced Park out of office last month. They also indicted Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin -- without physical detention -- for bribery, while clearing SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won. Woo Byung-woo, who was Park’s key aide in civil affairs while the alleged corruption took place, was also sent for a criminal trial for abuse of power.Former President Park Geun-hye “The prosecution has questioned ex-president Park six times, searched seven places, traced 30 bank accounts and investigated 110 people in a 150-member a special investigation unit including 31 prosecutors to clarify suspicions surrounding Park and  Choi Soon-sil,” the Seoul Central District Prosecutors‘ Office said in a statement. Park, who has been in custody since late last month, is accused of colluding with her confidante Choi to extort donations worth 77.4 billion won from local firms for the K-Sports and Mir foundations, allegedly controlled by Choi, in return for political favors, the prosecution said. The prosecution said that Park solicited or was promised to receive bribes totaling 59.2 billion won -- 43.3 billion won from Samsung, 7 billion won from Lotte and 8.9 billion won from SK -- for Choi-controlled entities.Lotte tycoon Shin, who is already on trial for embezzlement and breach of trust in a separate case, faces bribery charges. He is the second chief of a local firm to be put on trial in connection with Park’s scandal, following Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong. Woo, who served as a presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016, is charged with assisting or condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs, disrupting a probe into Choi’s manipulation of power and exerting undue influence over personnel appointments under the Park administration. Through the six-month probe into the corruption scandal, the prosecution indicted more than 20 people including Choi, who is already on trial for coercing donations from local firms, former presidential aides, ex-ministers and Samsung’s Lee in connection with the corruption scandal. The prosecution initially investigated the scandal before handing over the probe to an independent counsel team in December, naming Park as an accomplice to Choi in abuse of power in extorting donations from local firms. But the independent counsel, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, concluded that part of Samsung’s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong is on trial for offering or promising to offer bribes to Park and Choi in return for helping him tighten his control over his firm through a merger of two key units.The ousted former President Park Geun-hye's longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil Park is also charged with abusing her authority to help Choi’s business interests, exclude artists critical of Park from state budget and sack government officials uncooperative with her wrongdoings. Another major charge is leaking government secrets to Choi. Park will face court proceedings while remaining in detention. The criminal trial of Park is expected to begin after the May 9 presidential election to minimize the political impact it could have on the election campaign that officially began earlier in the day.Park has denied all the charges. She said local firms voluntarily donated the money and claimed no knowledge of any illegal activities by Choi and her inner circle. In another blow to Lotte Group, whose family members are already standing trial for their involvement in embezzlement, tax evasion and fraud, its chief Shin was indicted for seeking a favor from Park to secure a business license for its duty-free shop by contributing 7 billion won to the K-Sports Foundation.The prosecution has expanded its probe into other local firms who contributed money to the Choi-controlled entities, but only Shin and Samsung’s Lee were indicted for providing the donations which the prosecution saw as bribes in exchange for favors. The prosecution, which also brought in SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won for questioning, did not file charges against him. SK was under suspicion that it sought a special pardon for its chief. “Lotte Group was found to have offered money, though it was later returned. But as for SK Group, we confirmed that the company was asked to offer money, but it did not actually provide the money,” the prosecution’s spokesman Roh Seung-kwon told reporters during a briefing.Park was expelled from office on March 10, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term, in a unanimous decision by the Constitutional Court to finalize her parliamentary impeachment over the corruption scandal. Park, who was the first woman to reach the highest office in South Korea, ended up becoming the nation’s first president to be removed from power by impeachment and the third to be arrested, following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.

The official campaign period kicked off earlier in the day, with 15 hopefuls vying for the top elected office. The former president went through five rounds of questioning at a detention center, south of Seoul, after she was arrested on March 31 on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion and leaking government secrets.Park is accused of colluding with her friend Choi Soon-sil in coercing large conglomerates into donating to nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi and receiving tens of billions of won in bribes from Samsung.Park reportedly denied all the charges during her in-prison questioning.Woo Byung-woo, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016, is expected to be put on trial, along with Park, for his alleged involvement in the scandal, the sources said. He is accused of aiding and abetting Choi in meddling in state affairs and amassing profits using her ties to Park, though a local court refused to issue a warrant to arrest him last week. Eyes are also on whether chiefs of South Korea's conglomerates Lotte and SK will stand trial on charges of bribery.Prosecutors have been expanding their probe into the business groups after indicting Lee Jae-yong, Samsung Group's de facto leader, on charges of giving kickbacks to Choi in return for business favors. Choi and Lee, as well as the other business tycoons, are flatly denying the allegations.","scandal prosecutors will indict ,will indict ousted president ,prosecutors will indict ousted ,monday on bribery ,may presidential election","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.34904683  0.33267939

The court issued the writ the next day on a string of corruption allegations. Critics said it was a preferential treatment given to the former president considering that she was, after all, an arrested criminal suspect under investigation. The detention house, however, said it was an ""inevitable"" decision to avoid Park's contact with other inmates, citing security reasons.The repair works reportedly included replacing wallpaper in Park's cell. There have been suspicions that a cell refurbishment was requested by the former president, but the detention house denied them, insisting that the wallpaper had not been replaced since 2013. Park was formally arrested late last month over a string of allegations including bribery, abuse of power, coercion and leaking government secrets. Prosecutors are expected to level formal charges against her next week.","prison guards for two ,fire friday over allegations ,to park local detention ,corruption scandal that removed ,offices for prison guards","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Detention Center', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34516829  0.05908949

The cell features a foldable mattress on the floor, a television and a toilet with a cold-water sink.Twice a week, all inmates, including Park, are allowed to use communal hot bathing facilities in the detentnion building. The ousted ex-leader has been taken into custody since March 31, a dramatic fall for someone who spent years living at the country’s sprawling presidential palace.Her detention came after the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment motion against Park on March 10 for allegedly colluding with her jailed friend Choi Soon-sil in a bribery scheme.By Bak Se-hwan","jail former president park ,at the seoul detention ,in jail former president ,six inmates demanding ,special treatment in jail","['Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Park']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.3403998  -0.12728313

Ko, who used to work with Choi Soon-sil, was arrested Tuesday over a number of allegations including one that he received some 20 million won  from an official at the Incheon-based customs office in exchange for exerting influence on the agency's personnel management.Prosecutors asked the Seoul Central District Court to issue a warrant to formally arrest Ko. The court will hold a hearing later in the day on the decision.Ko, who made some clothing items and bags for Park, revealed the controversial relationship between Park and Choi last year, claiming that Choi received and edited the ex-president's speeches in advance. Choi had no policy experience nor did she hold any official post in the Park administration. While Ko was praised by some as a whistleblower, others raised suspicions that he made the revelations to gain control of a company owned by Choi.","over corruption scandal prosecutors ,scandal prosecutors on friday ,chief questioned over corruption ,corruption scandal prosecutors ,prosecutors on friday questioned","['Park Geun', 'Chun Hong - uk', 'the Korea Customs Service', 'Ko Young - tae', 'the Korea Customs Service', 'Chun Hong - uk']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46663573  0.46070164

He waited for about 50 minutes alone for a woman to show up in the unisex bathroom to commit the crime, in a premeditated murder targeting women in general, according to the prosecutors.The prosecution acknowledged the seriousness of the crime and had originally demanded life imprisonment. However, the lower court condemned Kim to 30 years in prison, considering he was suffering from a mental illness at the time he committed the crime.Kim and his attorney appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that he “lacked the ability to distinguish good from evil due to schizophrenia.” But the court dismissed it as he didn’t seem to be mentally ill at the time of his crime, when various factors were considered.Kim was reported to have been hospitalized multiple times after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2009.The hate crime shocked the country and was referred to as the “misogynistic murder case at Gangnam Station,” spurring the idea of feminism nationwide.Following the incident thousands of people took to the streets to pay their respects to the victim.By Byun Hee-jin","30 years in jail ,man convicted of stabbing ,gangnam murder the supreme ,convicted of stabbing woman ,upholds 30 year prison","['the Supreme Court', 'Gangnam Station', 'Kim']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28795195 -0.10531623

The couple wrapped the body of the boy and kept him hidden for 10 days on their veranda before moving and burying his body at a mountain in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The lowest court had handed down a 20-year jail term to the stepmother and a 15-year term to Shin’s biological father. But a high court imposed a heavier punishment, saying, “The accused neither mourned the child’s death nor regretted it, and they were only busy destroying and fabricating evidence out of fear that their wrongdoings might come to light.” The prosecution had requested a life sentence and 30 years in jail for the boy’s stepmother and his biological father, respectively.

Ko, who was once a close associate of Choi, is accused of receiving kickbacks in return for wielding influence on personnel appointment at the nation’s customs agency. He was taken into custody at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday evening after the court issued a warrant Monday. Prosecutors can hold him for up to 48 hours.Ko Young-tae, an associate of Choi Soon-sil, who is suspected of having meddled in state affairs and peddled influence on various state projects by using her close relationship with former President Park Geun-hye, is surrounded by reporters after undergoing a probe at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in the capital. Ko cried foul, calling for the Seoul Central District Court to review the legitimacy of his arrest. He was adjusting the schedule with the prosecution to turn up for questioning when the arrest was made, his associates and lawyers said. The closed-door court hearing is to be held at 2 p.m. Thursday.“Ko cut off contact with us and went into hiding since last week. So the arrest warrant was issued Monday,” an official from the prosecution told reporters, defying claims from Ko’s lawyers. Ko offered key testimony about Choi’s close relationship with Park and her meddling in state affairs, which triggered the scandal that eventually forced Park out of office.While some hailed him as a whistleblower, the lawyers for Choi and Park, as well as the ousted president’s loyal supporters, have denounced Ko as a conman who attempted to capitalize on the Park-Choi relationship. After that fell through, Ko turned to the media seeking revenge, they said. Ko is suspected of using his close ties to Choi to receive some 20 million won  from an official at Korea Customs Service’s Incheon office in exchange for peddling influence to promote the official’s acquaintance to the top post, the prosecution said. In one of the 2,000 voice recordings unveiled during the trial of Choi, Ko was heard saying to his acquaintance: “I spent money to promote the official to the chief post. I am not trying to earn money, but just to get back the money I spent. There will be a call soon.”Ko, who served as a director at Choi’s paper company The Blue-K, was among the first whistleblowers to reveal that Choi had access to Park’s presidential speeches and had edited them. He also claimed that Choi had been behind illicit fundraising from local firms. He has since been summoned for questioning by the prosecution and took the witness stand during Park’s impeachment trial and Choi’s criminal trial. Choi is on trial on charges of extorting donations from local firms for the Mir and K-Sports foundations. Ko has also been called Choi’s “boy toy” by supporters of Park and Choi, who have said the scandal was sparked by Choi’s adulterous affair with the 40-year-old former fencing champion.He has denied the rumors, saying he first met Choi through his company, to provide bags and clothing items to the ex-president.Ko Young-tae A day after Ko’s arrest, the Seoul Central District Court rejected an arrest warrant for Woo Byung-woo, the former presidential aide for civil affairs, for a second time Thursday, citing the charges against him were “debatable.”Woo, formally a prosecutor, is suspected of abetting or condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs and exerting undue influence over the government’s personnel management and the prosecution to sway investigations in favor of former President Park.The court’s decision not to arrest Woo, one of few people who have avoided legal action in connection with the scandal, drew criticism from the public and opposition lawmakers. They took issue with the prosecution’s purportedly slipshod investigation.“I don’t think our investigation into Woo was poor. It is a shame that the warrant was rejected, but that’s the court’s decision. We did our best,” an official from the prosecution said. The prosecution said it will review whether to seek an arrest warrant for Woo again.By Ock Hyun-ju","arrested south korean prosecutors ,scandal arrested south korean ,prosecutors on wednesday arrested ,in corruption scandal arrested ,korean prosecutors on wednesday","['south korean', 'Ko Young - tae', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Ko', 'Choi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39849541  0.24178328

It took place at the detention facility, south of Seoul, where she is being held over charges of bribery, abuse of power and the leaking of government secrets to her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. A key focus of the high-profile investigation has been the allegation that Park colluded with Choi to extort donations from local business groups, including the nation’s largest Samsung Group, for Choi-controlled foundations. The investigators suspect the money to be bribes offered in exchange for favors. Park fired more than two-thirds of her lawyers earlier this week and is said to be recruiting new ones to prepare for trial. The probe team is also looking into whether to indict Park’s former aide Woo Byung-woo, before closing the investigation into the Park scandal. Woo, 50, a former presidential secretary under suspicion of helping irregularities committed by Park and Choi, avoided detention Wednesday as the court dismissed it, saying the evidence was not enough to issue a warrant, a move seen as a major blow to the prosecution.

A page from declassified documents explains North Korea’s alleged involvement in the death of a daughter of the Myanmarese judge who tried North Korean suspects in the 1983 Rangoon Bombing. The 230,000-page document, released by the South Korean government Tuesday, does not reveal the circumstances of her death, but suspects the North’s retribution for her father’s rulings. “It was a case that we could not get to the bottom of. Hints of North Korean cigarettes were found at the scene and the victim did not show any signs of suicidal tendencies prior to her death,” reads the document, which was a diplomatic cable sent by then South Korean Ambassador to Geneva Lee Sang-ok after meeting Myanmar’s envoy in December 1986. The Rangoon Bombing was a failed attempt by the North to assassinate former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, who was expected to pay tribute to Myanmar’s independence hero Aung San at the national cemetery. The attack killed a total of 17 South Korean high-ranking officials and four Burmese at the scene, including South Korea’s deputy prime minister, foreign and trade ministers. Chun survived due to traffic congestion that delayed his arrival. The Myanmar police identified three North Koreans as suspects. One of them was killed in the process of arrest and the other two identified as Kim Jin-soo and Kang Min-chul were captured after Kim’s unsuccessful suicide attempt. Kim was sentenced to capital punishment and was executed in 1984, while Kang was sentenced to life imprisonment for his cooperation with the investigation. The bombing scarred Myanmar’s reputation in the global society for its incompetence in security during a diplomatic event. The document said, “Myanmar found it necessary to prove they were capable of initiating a proper investigation on their own and in result, South Korea’s patience with the process was an act of respect for Myanmar’s bruised ego.”By Jung Min-kyung","murder of judge daughter ,daughter dossier declassified diplomatic ,terrorist agents to death ,judge daughter dossier declassified ,in murder of judge","['North Korea', 'myanmarese', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'southeast asian']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40212473  0.08541385

Senior Prosecutor Lee Won-seok questioned Park on Monday at a detention facility south of Seoul where she has been in custody since March 31, in her fourth interrogation session in jail, zeroing in on the bribery allegation.The ousted president's attorney Yoo Young-ha  and Park Geun-hye The prosecution is pushing to indict Park this week, before her arrest warrant expires on April 19. It is also hoping for a swift closure to the high-profile investigation, as the next presidential election is slated for May 9. Meanwhile, an official from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office confirmed Monday that Park has fired more than two-thirds of her lawyers. “Park’s legal team has sent out dismissal notifications for the seven lawyers,” an official from the office told reporters, adding that the reason was not stated. The move comes after the repeated failures of her defense team, first during her impeachment trial and then the court hearing on her arrest. Park has steadfastly denied all allegations. While refusing to attend any of the impeachment hearings at the Constitutional Court, Park had refused to cooperate with state prosecutors and an independent counsel. On March 30, the ousted leader attended a court hearing on her arrest, but failed to avoid detention, with a judge acknowledging worries raised by prosecutors that she might destroy evidence.The two remaining in her legal team are Yoo Young-ha and Chae Myung-seong, who have been accompanying Park in questioning sessions in jail, the prosecution official confirmed. The discharged lawyers, most of whom were hired during the top court’s impeachment trial, are known to have had conflicts with the two while coming up with legal strategies for Park, seemingly a major cause behind their recent dismissal. The alleged bribery scheme of Park involves her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is undergoing her own trial. Park is accused of colluding with Choi to extort donations from major local business groups for Choi-controlled foundations, which the prosecutors say were bribes to Park.Another former confidante of Park, Woo Byung-woo, will attend a court hearing on his arrest on Tuesday morning, as he is accused of abetting irregularities allegedly committed by Park and Choi, while serving as presidential secretary for civil affairs in 2015 and 2016.Woo is the latest high-profile figure to face criminal charges in connection to the scandal involving Park. So far, a total of 30 have been indicted.

Woo, however, maintains he had no knowledge of Choi’s alleged wrongdoings and that his only knowledge of Choi has come from information circulated through the media. This marks prosecutors’ second attempt to obtain an arrest warrant for Woo. The special counsel that investigated the scandal had filed for a warrant, but was rejected by the court that ruled the connection with the former presidential aide and his alleged crimes was unclear. Since the end of the special counsel investigation on Feb. 28, the prosecution has launched a special team looking into the scandal. Woo was summoned for questioning for the third time on April 6, and dozens of individuals including serving prosecutors have been grilled in connection to the case. Woo is the last of the high-ranking government officials, including Park, implicated in the scandal to remain free. Park was arrested March 31, while former chief of staff Kim Ki-chun and Culture Minister Cho Yun-sun were arrested early on in the special counsel investigation. Woo is also accused of intervening in personnel appointments in the government to remove officials uncooperative with the irregularities committed by Park and Choi. The prosecution suspects him of attempting to cover up the scandal. Woo is separately being investigated for alleged embezzlement involving his family members.

Park is known to have denied any wrongdoing during the first session in prison that lasted for nearly 11 hours on Tuesday. The second probe occurred two days later.Park was named an accomplice in her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil's bribery allegations involving South Korea's largest business group Samsung.She is also suspected of colluding with Choi in pressing local conglomerates into donating tens of billions of won to two non-profit foundations allegedly controlled by Choi.Lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha accompanied her during the inquiry Saturday, as he did previously.A Seoul court has approved prosecutors' request to extend the detention of Park until April 19 for further questioning.South Korea's justice ministry transferred Choi, who was held at the same location as Park, to another detention house earlier following the prosecution's request.Meanwhile, prosecutors are considering seeking an arrest warrant against Woo Byung-woo, Park's former senior secretary for civil affairs, as early as Sunday, according to sources.He is one of the last figures embroiled in the scandal that has avoided detention so far, while a number of Park's former aides were arrested and are standing trial.

On the same day, prosecutors sought to extend the arrest of the ousted president and questioned Lotte Group chairman Shin Dong-bin on a related allegation -- providing donations to foundations allegedly controlled by Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil. Lee is brought to court in handcuffs. The investigators suspect Lee and Shin offered bribes, not donations, to the entities controlled by Choi, Park’s friend of 40 years, expecting political favors from the Park administration. At the courtroom on Friday, Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, denied the accusation.  Handcuffed and wearing a gray suit, the heir and only son of Samsung Group chairman attended the first hearing of his trial at the Seoul Central District Court, along with four other executives from the conglomerate, who are facing the same charges.“We secured enough evidence to prove that Lee sought favors from former President Park to achieve a smooth transfer of power and tighten his control on the Samsung Group,” special counsel Park Young-soo said during the hearing. “The Samsung’s bribery case was a typical form of cozy relations between politicians and businessmen to pursue private benefits,” he said. The prosecution suspects that Lee, who was arrested in February, gave or promised to give 43.3 billion won  to Choi that she used for her private interests. He is accused of using the company money to make donations for a winter sports center and the K-Sports and Mir foundations, all allegedly controlled by Choi, and sponsoring Choi’s daughter and equestrian Chung Yoo-ra for overseas training and the purchase of horses. In return for Samsung’s financial support for Choi, the ousted Park is suspected of using her power to ease regulations, revise relevant laws and pressure a state-run agency to back a controversial merger of two key Samsung units. The merger was a crucial step for the company’s smooth transition of leadership from its ailing chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. “Without the president’s help, it was impossible to achieve a smooth transition of power,” the prosecution said during the hearing, adding the bribery links were formed through three face-to-face meetings between Park and Lee from late 2014 to early 2016. Lee, through his lawyers, said that he had already firmed up his control of Samsung Group and did not need any help from the president in this regard. “The donations were made upon the president’s request without any favors in return,” his lawyer Song Woo-chul said. He did not know who Choi Soon-sil was and that she was behind the foundations, according to the lawyer. Lee’s defense team also took issue with the prosecution’s indictment, saying there was no solid evidence to back the charges against Lee and that they were based on prosecutors’ presumptions and prejudice. As Park was arrested on March 31 on charges including bribery and abuse of power, the prosecution has focused on investigating former presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo and corporations that contributed money to the Mir and K-Sports foundations. Shin Dong-bin, chairman of retail giant Lotte Group, appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office Friday morning to be grilled. The prosecution is looking into whether the donations worth 11.5 billion won made by Lotte for the Choi-controlled foundations were bribes in return for a favor in the company’s bid for a business license for its duty-free shop. Woo, who is suspected of abetting or condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs and exerting undue influence under the Park administration, was questioned at the prosecution’s office a day earlier. Park is under suspicion that she colluded with Choi to extort donations worth 77.4 billion won from local firms to help Choi’s business interests. The Constitutional Court removed her from office over her role in Choi’s manipulation of power on March 10, which stripped her of presidential immunity to criminal investigation. Park has so far been questioned twice in jail over corruption allegations. The prosecution Friday requested her detention to be extended by another 10 days to until April 19. The prosecution will grill her again inside the Seoul Detention Center, where she is in custody, Saturday, it said.By Ock Hyun-ju","trial of samsung heir ,seoul court on friday ,scandal that removed president ,most prominent businessman samsung ,yong on bribery charges","['Seoul', 'Samsung Group ’s de', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun', 'Lotte Group', 'Shin Dong - bin']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.07467392  0.13132732

Woo, a prosecutor-turned-presidential aide, turned up at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at 9:54 a.m. to be questioned for the third time. He has been grilled twice since the scandal broke out -- once by state prosecutors and then by an independent counsel.Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, appears Thursday at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office in Seoul, after being summoned as a suspect. Woo is a key figure in the corruption scandal involving ousted President Park Geun-hye and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. “I will answer all these questions while faithfully undergoing the questioning,” he told reporters, looking nervous and fragile. He came under fire for his seemingly arrogant attitude and lack of remorse when he showed up for the previous prosecutorial questioning.“I feel heartbroken about the president,” he said, when asked if he had anything to say to the public. Woo has maintained that he had not been aware of Choi Soon-sil and her alleged meddling in state affairs. Choi’s manipulation of power behind the scenes as well as the Park administration’s botched efforts to rescue more lives during the Sewol ferry disaster are major reasons the parliament voted to impeach her on Dec. 9. Park was arrested on March 31, three weeks after she was forced out of office and lost her presidential immunity to criminal investigation. She is suspected of extorting donations from local firms to help Choi’s business interests. Park was also questioned in jail for the second time Thursday over the corruption allegations. Despite his failure to perform his duty to stop corruption in the civil service and the influence he wielded over the Park administration, Woo has so far avoided being arrested and indicted. A number of ex-ministers, presidential aides and Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong are standing trial in connection to the corruption scandal. Woo, who faces eight charges including abuse of authority and negligence of duty, is also accused of intervening in personnel appointments in the government to sack officials uncooperative with irregularities committed by Park and Choi. The prosecution also suspects him of attempting to cover up the scandal. He is separately being investigated for alleged embezzlement involving his family members. Special counsel Park Young-soo, whose 70-day investigation ended on Feb. 28, had suspected Woo as a key figure in the corruption scandal. But he avoided legal action due to the special counsel’s limited investigation period. Its request in February for a warrant to arrest Woo was also rejected, with the court saying his charges are “debatable.” The prosecution said it had questioned about 50 people as witnesses as part of the probe into Woo.

In the second questioning, the prosecutor was accused of even tying up the handcuffed Lee with a rope.The prosecutor, who has since moved to another district prosecutors' office, countered, saying he had no choice but to use handcuffs and a rope for Lee, as one of his accomplices attempted to hurt himself during prior questioning.The current law allows the use of handcuffs and other equipment if the danger of suicide or self-injury exist.But the court said an attempted self-injury by a suspect cannot justify the use of handcuffs and rope for his or her accomplice because the existence of such dangers is unclear in the case.In 2005, the Constitutional Court ruled against forced application of handcuffs, ropes and other equipment to detained suspects during questioning by prosecutors.","lawsuit in may 2015 ,forced to wear handcuffs ,handcuffs south korea supreme ,launched lawsuit in may ,court on tuesday ordered","[""South Korea 's"", 'Supreme Court', 'Lee Young - chun', ""Korean Confederation of Trade Unions '"", 'Goyang', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.17295936 -0.19908632

The man, identified by his surname Jeong, is accused of hijacking a police bus and ramming it against bus barricades during a protest near Anguk Station on March 10. His action caused a 100-kilogram police speaker to fall and hit a fellow rally participant from the same group. A 66-year old pro-Park supporter, surnamed Jeong, hijacks a police bus during a rally following Park Geun-hye’s impeachment ruling on March 10. The victim, 72-year-old Kim Wan-sik, was rushed to Seoul National University Hospital, but was pronounced dead 80 minutes after arrival, due to fatal injuries on his skull and aorta. Prosecutors said that Jeong has been charged with assault, obstruction of police duty, property damage, and the illegal use of a motor vehicle. The police said that the act caused at least 8.54 million won  in property damage.Jeong fled the scene afterward, but was arrested in his house located in Dobong-gu, northeastern Seoul, on the same day.Regarding the incident, pro-Park forces held a press conference Tuesday asserting police negligence contributed to Kim’s death. Attorney Kim Ki-soo, the spokesperson for the conference, said, “The police did not provide aid to the victim despite having been present at the scene for at least 10 minutes before retreating.” Two pro-Park protestors, including Kim, died after sustaining fatal injuries from a rally following the Constitutional Court’s unanimous decision to oust Park last month.

Park was taken into custody on Friday after a court issued a warrant for her arrest. She faces charges of colluding with her friend Choi Soon-sil in a bribery scheme involving the country’s largest conglomerate Samsung Group.Former President Park Geun-hye The prosecution is also considering relocating Choi, who is being held in the same facility as Park, to another place, in order to keep the two from encountering each other.“We will begin the questioning at around 10 a.m., tomorrow  although the exact venue  is not yet decided,” said an official at the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office during a press briefing.“Senior Prosecutor Han Woong-jae will lead the questioning,” he added. Park’s attorneys requested the interrogation to take place at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, to minimize public attention, the official revealed. The imminent interrogation of Park is part of the prosecution’s effort to accelerate the inquiry before the arrest warrant expires in two weeks, and indict her over the country’s biggest scandal that led to her expulsion from power last month.Park is accused of receiving bribes from big business groups, disguised as donations to two foundations run by Choi, as well as leaking state secrets to Choi. The bribery conviction could lead to life in prison.Meanwhile, police are considering arresting the chief of a group of staunch Park supporters for violent protests. Jeong Kwang-yong, head of an organization supporting the former leader, is accused of instigating violence during the protest on the day of Park’s impeachment decision on March 10. Three protesters died of injuries and heart problems during and after the rally. An official from the Jongno Police Station in Seoul told reporters that they “will soon send Jeong a third notice” to submit himself for questioning. Jeong turned down the authority’s summons on March 22 and 28. If Jeong refuses to turn up again, the police will consider requesting an arrest warrant against him, the official added.

Former President Park Geun-hye The former president will be questioned at her detention center south of Seoul on Tuesday, the prosecutors said.Park underwent a marathon questioning session last month after the Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment by parliament on March 10.She has denied all wrongdoing and claimed no knowledge of Choi's alleged crimes.The prosecutors said they initially planned to question her on Monday, but postponed the date after her lawyers requested more time to prepare. They had also asked her to come to their office, but the lawyers requested the questioning take place at the detention center in consideration of Park's mental condition and security issues.Prosecutors are widely expected to focus on determining the truth behind the bribery allegations involving Park, Choi and Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong.Lee is suspected of giving or promising some 43.4 billion won to Choi -- in effect to Park -- as kickbacks in return for business favors.Both Choi and Lee are in custody.Park is also accused of creating a blacklist to deny state support to cultural figures who were critical of her policies, and of pressuring conglomerates such as Hyundai Motor, POSCO and KT into signing contracts with Choi's firms.The prosecutors are expected to level formal charges against Park by mid-April before the arrest warrant expires.She is the third former president to be arrested over criminal allegations following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.","prosecutors this week prosecutors ,arrest over corruption scandal ,her arrest over corruption ,week prosecutors said sunday ,warrant for her arrest","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Samsung Group']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26102492  0.31859225

In a dramatic downfall, the former president now must eat and sleep in a jail cell, locked up in the same prison where her longtime friend and aides are being held. Park, who was the first woman to reach the highest office in South Korea, ended up becoming the nation’s first president to be removed from power by impeachment and the third to be arrested.  Ousted President Park Geun-hye In the early hours of Friday, the Seoul Central District Court issued the arrest warrant to detain Park for corruption charges, after a nearly nine-hour hearing the previous day and marathon deliberations. The court said her charges were clarified and there is risk of Park destroying evidence. Park left the prosecutor’s office at 4:29 a.m. to be transferred to a detention facility south of Seoul, where her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and Samsung Group’s de facto chief are in custody. Locked up in a solitary cell at the detention center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, the former president would go through a grueling investigation by the prosecution and, if indicted, a trial. To be put in a cell, she had her identity checked, received a medical check-up, changed into a prison uniform and had her mugshot taken. She will have to eat alone and wash dishes herself, like any other prisoners. With the arrest warrant, the prosecution can hold her for up to 20 days before indicting her. Prosecutors are expected to file charges against her by mid-April, mindful of the impact Park’s arrest will have on the presidential election campaigns. Park faces a total of 13 charges including bribery, coercion, abuse of power and leaking government secrets, with bribery carrying the heaviest punishment among all the charges. If convicted of bribery, she could be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of at least 10 years. Park is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won  from local firms, including Samsung Group, for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. An independent counsel team, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, concluded that part of Samsung’s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung’s de-facto leader Lee Jae-yong is standing trial for offering or promising to offer bribes to Park and her friend Choi.Park’s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against artists with liberal views.Park has denied all the charges. She said local firms voluntarily donated the money and claimed no knowledge of any illegal activities by Choi and her inner circle.Former President Park Geun-hye's hair  not coiffed as she leaves the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in a car on March 31, 2017, to be transfered to a detention house after a court issued a warrant to arrest her in connection with a corruption scandal that led to her removal from office. Park was seen emerging with the cropped chignon style  that is her trademark, after attending the court's hearing to determine whether to approve the warrant the previous day. With Park’s arrest, the prosecution has two remaining tasks – wrapping up a probe on Woo Byung-woo, the former presidential secretary for civil affairs, and other local firms suspected of donating money for the K-Sports and Mir foundations. Other companies including SK and Lotte are also accused of seeking favors from the Park administration in return for contributing money to the foundations allegedly controlled by Choi. SK is under suspicion that it sought a special pardon for its chairman Chey Tae-won and Lotte allegedly wanted to secure a business right for its duty free shop.Woo, prosecutor-turned-government official, is suspected of assisting or condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs during his term at the presidential office. He is also accused of peddling undue influence over the prosecution and disrupting a probe into the sinking of the Sewol ferry.Park was expelled from office on March 10, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term, in a unanimous decision by the Constitutional Court to finalize the Dec. 9 parliamentary impeachment. The Constitutional Court acknowledged Park’s role in letting Choi, who holds no government post, meddle in state affairs and manipulate power from behind the scene.South Koreans showed mixed reactions to the former president’s arrest. “The arrest is a natural consequence for the corrupt leader. We are paying the price for picking a wrong leader,” Lee Chan-ki, a 43-year-old office worker told The Korea Herald, accusing Park of not showing any remorse. “It is humiliating that no president in the country seems to have honorably stepped down from their post.”Some echoed hope for a fairer and more democratic society after justice is served for Park.“Park’s arrest made me believe that everyone can be equal before the law,” said a 30-year-old student Jung Sung-hoon. “I hope politicians fear its people and finally work for us who are the owner of this country.”But Park’s loyal fans have had difficulties coping with Park’s arrest.Some of her supporters staged a rally outside the prosecution’s office and a detention center overnight waiting for Park to appear. They cried out loud, chanting her name and demanding her release. “The prosecution and court are unchallenged power. Why should they make the president wear a prison uniform when a trial without detaining her is also possible?” said Joo Ok-soon, a head of pro-Park civic group, in front of the detention facility. Friday was also the day when the raised Sewol ferry was brought to shore, nearly three years after it sank off the nation’s southwest coast and killed 304 people. Once the ferry is moved onto a dry dock, the salvage team plans to investigate the ferry to find the causes behind its sinking and find the nine missing bodies. Park’s failure to save more lives and properly respond to the nation’s worst maritime disaster was one of the reasons that led the parliament to vote to impeach her in early December.

Charges against Park include bribery, abuse of authority, coercion and leaking government secrets. Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong Park is largely suspected of colluding with Choi to force dozens of local conglomerates to ""donate"" a total of 77.4 billion won  to two dubious foundations -- Mir and K-Sports -- allegedly controlled by Choi.Samsung's de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, was arrested in mid-February on charges of giving or promising some 43.4 billion won to Choi, and in effect to Park, as kickbacks in return for helping him secure group control through a merger of two key units.Of the total, 20.4 billion won went to the two foundations.Lee, vice chairman of tech behemoth Samsung Electronics Co., has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that the presidential office coerced Samsung into providing financial assistance to Choi and her daughter.Following the detention of Park, Samsung officials voiced concern that a local court in charge of the trial against Lee may not accept his allegation and the trial may be drawn out.But they expressed confidence that Lee may be cleared of the bribery charge when the Seoul Central District Court starts the trial against Lee fully in early April. The third preliminary hearing on Lee's trial was scheduled for Friday afternoon at the district court. The formal trial against him is slated to start on April 7.A business source said he doesn't expect the arrest of former President Park to affect Lee's trial should it proceed purely based on evidence. ""It is important for the court to determine whether Lee is guilty or not,"" he said. ""But more important is that it should carry out the trial as quickly as possible.""","president park was arrested ,with massive corruption scandal ,friday after marathon court ,ousted south korean leader ,massive corruption scandal","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Samsung Group', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.36562526  0.45338801

It is unlikely, though, that Park will come across any of them during her stay. “Our rule is to strictly separate not only the men and women, but those who are suspected to have been in complicity,” said an official of the Justice Ministry.But some speculated that Park and Choi -- perhaps Cho as well -- may end up after their trial in Cheongju Women’s Prison, the only exclusively female prison here.The former president is expected to be put into a solitary room, just like her longtime confidante Choi and her predecessors Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.She will remain in segregation, with no access to personal security or assistance of any kind, and be left to perform daily tasks all on her own.The provided facilities in the confinement room include a folding mattress, a blanket, shelves, a television and a desk, along with a washstand and a toilet.After each meal, mostly comprising of rice and three side dishes within the budget of 1,414 won , Park will have to wash her food tray and return it, just like every other prisoner.Her attire will be an olive prison uniform, which will be replaced by a lighter-colored summer version starting from June.She may later decide to purchase her own uniform, just like Choi, who chose to wear an ivory-colored uniform when showing up at court.It has not yet been confirmed whether Park will be offered exclusivity as her imprisoned predecessors.Park, however, is likely to be allowed an unlimited range of visits by her lawyers, possibly in an exclusive visiting room. Visits by those not part of the legal representation will be limited to 10 minutes per day.The public’s attention was also on how the detained Park would get her signature hairstyle done, with the sarcasm reflecting allegations that Park spent several hours on April 16, 2016 -- the day that the Sewol ferry sank -- fixing her hair before appearing in public.Facing the court’s decision to issue an arrest warrant early on Friday morning, Park undid her hairdo and washed off her makeup, before leaving for the detention center, according to officials.By Bae Hyun-jung","scandal the seoul detention ,arrested former president park ,convicted prisoners ,the seoul detention center ,of ill famed celebrities","['the Seoul Detention Center', 'Park Geun', 'Uiwang City', 'Seoul', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Se']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.54524541  0.18607736

The former leader was put into a detention center on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion and leaking government secrets, after a marathon hearing the previous day.Former President Park Geun-hye leaves the Seoul Central District Court in the capital on March 30, 2017, after a hearing on a warrant to arrest her. The court issued the warrant the next day, citing the necessity and the graveness of the alleged crimes. Park's arrest warrant is valid for 20 days since execution and the prosecutors have to file formal charges against Park by mid-April before the period expires.The prosecutors are also likely to seek to conclude their investigation into the scandal as soon as possible to reduce its impact on the May 9 presidential election, sources said. Park is suspected of having colluded with her close friend Choi Soon-sil to force dozens of local conglomerates to donate a total of 77.4 billion won  to two dubious nonprofit foundations allegedly controlled by Choi.The prosecution has charged only Samsung's de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, among business moguls who are suspected of having provided funds to the organizations for business and policy favors. Lee was arrested for giving or promising some 43.4 billion won to Choi, and in effect to Park, in return for the government's support for the group's merger of two affiliates, which helped tighten his control of the nation's largest business group. The state prosecutors have been expanding their probe into other conglomerates, including SK, Lotte and CJ groups.SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won was grilled by prosecutors two weeks ago. The conglomerate donated a total of 11.1 billion won to the foundations. The prosecution is looking into whether it was in return for a presidential pardon for Chey, who was then serving a prison term for embezzlement and other charges. The prosecutors are also stepping up their investigation into Park's former senior secretary for civil affairs, Woo Byung-woo, on suspicions that he aided and abetted Choi in meddling in state affairs and disrupted a special presidential inspector's investigation into the scandal.Last Friday they attempted to raid the presidential office as part of a probe into Woo, but were denied entry by presidential officials who cited security reasons. Woo also allegedly used his influence to block a prosecution probe into failed rescue efforts during the 2014 sinking of ferry Sewol, which killed 304 people. He is also suspected of having interfered with appointments and inspections of government officials.","government secrets after marathon ,after arresting park prosecution ,speed up corruption probe ,secrets after marathon hearing ,was arrested early friday","[""Park Geun - hye 's"", 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.34699088  0.05520657

If convicted, she could face life in prison. After a grueling nine-hour hearing, Judge Kang Boo-young acknowledged the need for her arrest, saying there is probable cause to charge her and a concern of evidence being destroyed. Former President Park Geun-hye's hair  not coiffed as she leaves the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in a car on March 31, 2017, to be transfered to a detention house after a court issued a warrant to arrest her in connection with a corruption scandal that led to her removal from office. Park was seen emerging with the cropped chignon style  that is her trademark, after attending the court's hearing to determine whether to approve the warrant the previous day. The gravest are bribery charges. Park is suspected of colluding with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in forcing dozens of local conglomerates to ""donate"" a total of 77.4 billion won  to two dubious foundations -- Mir and K-Sports -- allegedly controlled by Choi.Samsung, among others, is accused of giving or promising some 43.4 billion won to Choi, and in effect to Park, as kickbacks in return for business favors. Of the total, 20.4 billion won went to the two foundations. If convicted, Park can be sentenced to 10 years or more in prison.Park is also accused of being involved in blacklisting cultural figures deemed critical of her policies and prohibiting government agencies from providing financial support to them. Her former close aides were arrested for their roles in creating and managing a list of more than 9,000 artists, writers, filmmakers and entertainment figures.Prosecutors allege that the former president abused her power by pressuring her aides to sack culture ministry officials who resisted discriminatory measures against those on the blacklist. She is also suspected of exerting undue influence on private companies' personnel management and hectoring them to sign contracts with Choi's firms, according to prosecutors.The country's food and entertainment conglomerate, CJ, for one, was told to dismiss its vice chief executive for movies and TV content apparently supportive of liberal politicians, they said. South Korea's top carmaker, Hyundai Motor Co., was also pressured to sign a 1.1 billion won supply contract with a mid-sized company belonging to one of Choi's associates and another 7.1 billion won advertising deal with an agency owned by Choi, prosecutors said.Telecoms firm KT Corp. was allegedly bullied to hire executives close to Choi and to award a 6.8 billion won advertising deal to her agency. Steelmaker POSCO was compelled to create a fencing team and to sign yet another contract with one of Choi's companies, though that contract was not realized in the end. Prosecutors are looking into whether the business groups were seeking favors in return. The conglomerates, however, have been claiming that the president and her aides twisted their arms to make such decisions favorable to Choi.Prosecutors also said Park allegedly violated the law on managing government secrets by leaking them to Choi. There have been suspicions that Choi was involved in making key state decisions, despite having no policy experience. Park's longtime aide Jeong Ho-seong is currently standing trial and in custody for his alleged role in the process. Park moved out from the presidential office, Cheong Wa Dae, earlier this month after the Constitutional Court removed her from office in a historic ruling on March 10.","hye arrested early friday ,13 cases ousted leader ,need for her arrest ,prison after grueling nine ,faces charges including bribery","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kang Boo - young']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.30144611  0.06659052

Following the decision, the prosecution took Park to a detention facility in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, where her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and others involved in the corruption scandal are in custody.Former President Park Geun-hye is taken to a detention house in Uiwang on Friday morning. The decision came after a court hearing on Thursday to review the legality of her arrest that lasted eight hours and 40 minutes, making it the longest hearing of its kind in the nation’s history.After the marathon hearing, Park had waited for the result at a makeshift detention facility set up on the 10th floor at Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. With the arrest warrant, the prosecution can detain her for up to 20 days. The prosecution asked the court on Monday to issue the arrest warrant on 13 charges, citing the gravity of her charges, the possibility of her destroying evidence and the precedent that other key figures tied to the scandal had already been arrested. Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is at the center of the corruption scandal, is already on trial for coercing donations from local firms. Former presidential aides, ex-ministers and Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong have also been arrested and are standing trial.Park arrived at the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul in a black sedan at around 10:20 a.m. and walked into the courthouse without answering any questions from reporters. Looking tense and grim-faced, Park walked out of the courtroom at 7:11 p.m.She is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won  from local firms including Samsung Group for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. An independent counsel team, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, concluded that part of Samsung’s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung is accused of providing or promising funds totaling 43.3 billion won to Park’s friend Choi and her business interests in exchange for the Park administration’s backing of a 2015 merger of its two affiliates. The merger was largely seen as a crucial step for the smooth transfer of management from the Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong. If convicted of bribery, which carries the heaviest punishment among all the charges Park faces, she could be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of more than 10 years. Park’s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against artists with liberal views. Park has denied all the charges. She said local firms voluntarily donated the money and claimed no knowledge of any illegal activities by Choi and her inner circle. Park was expelled from office on March 10, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term, in a unanimous decision by the Constitutional Court to finalize the Dec. 9 parliamentary impeachment. The ruling stripped her of the immunity that had shielded her from criminal investigation.Park became the country's third former president to be arrested over criminal allegations, following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.By Ock Hyun-ju","park arrested over corruption ,arrested over corruption scandal ,corruption scandal former president ,detention facility early friday ,morning on the corruption","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'the Seoul Central District Court']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.2496988   0.0500397

Seven pro-Park lawmakers including Reps. Choi Kyoung-hwan and Cho Won-jin of Liberty Korea Party waited for her outside. She allegedly told the lawmakers, “I am sorry because of me. Why did you come … you must be busy.” On Wednesday, some 82 lawmakers, mostly from the LPK, signed a petition calling for a rejection of the arrest warrant. They said that there was no possibility of Park destroying evidence and no need for the arrest as she is effectively detained in her residence.

The prosecution can detain her for up to 20 days until it indicts her.Hundreds of her loyal supporters greets former President Park Geun-hye, waving national flags. As Park got out of her residence in southern Seoul at around 10:10 a.m., hundreds of her loyal supporters greeted her, waving national flags. Some 30 supporters lay down on the pavement, shouting “We will have to save our president even if we die.” Earlier in the morning, Park’s brother Park Ji-man and his wife paid a visit to see her. Seven pro-Park lawmakers including Reps. Choi Kyoung-hwan and Cho Won-jin of Liberty Korea Party waited for her outside. She allegedly told the lawmakers, “I am sorry because of me. Why did you come … you must be busy.” On Wednesday, some 82 lawmakers, mostly from the LPK, signed a petition calling for a rejection of the arrest warrant. They said that there was no possibility of Park destroying evidence and no need for the arrest as she is effectively detained in her residence. Park is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won  from local firms including Samsung Group for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. An independent counsel team, which ended its 70-day probe into the scandal on Feb. 28, suspected that part of Samsung’s donations had been bribes made in return for political favors. Samsung is accused of providing or promising funds totaling 43.3 billion won to Park’s friend Choi and her business interests in exchange for the Park administration’s backing of a 2015 merger of its two affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the smooth transfer of power from the ailing group Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. If convicted of bribery, which carries the heaviest punishment among all charges facing Park, she can be sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of more than 10 years. Park’s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against liberal-leaning artists. Park has denied all the charges. She said local firms voluntarily donated the money and claimed no knowledge of any illegal activities by Choi and her inner circle. Park was expelled from office on March 10, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term, in a unanimous decision by the Constitutional Court to finalize the Dec. 9 parliamentary impeachment. The ruling stripped her of the immunity that had shielded her from criminal investigation.By Ock Hyun-ju","friday morning former president ,park arrest still underway ,hearing on park arrest ,in seoul on thursday ,arrest still underway court","['Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Park']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.50505567  0.27530381

She has denied any wrongdoing.This photo, taken on March 29, 2017, shows a triangle of yellow tape laid down at the entrance of the Seoul Central District Court in the capital, which will serve as a place marker for former President Park Geun-hye to stand at when she attends a hearing to determine whether or not to approve an arrest warrant for her a day later. Park, dismissed as president on March 10, faces an investigation on 13 counts of corruption allegations that range from bribery to abuse of power. Both sides are gearing up for marathon arguments given the complexity of the cases, the number of those involved and her stubborn defiance, according to observers.Park stayed at the prosecution office for 21 hours during her first interrogation from Tuesday to early Wednesday last week.The focus of the court arguments is likely on bribery suspicions. Park is suspected of colluding with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in forcing dozens of local conglomerates to ""donate"" a total of 77.4 billion won  to two dubious foundations -- Mir and K-Sports -- allegedly controlled by Choi.Samsung, among others, is accused of giving or promising some 43.4 billion won to Choi, and in effect to Park, as kickbacks in return for business favors. Of the total, 20.4 billion won went to the two foundations. If convicted of the charges, Park can be sentenced to 10 years or more in prison.Park is also accused of being involved in blacklisting cultural figures deemed critical of her policies and prohibiting government agencies from providing financial support to them. Her former close aides were arrested for their roles in creating and managing a list of more than 9,000 artists, writers, filmmakers and entertainment figures.Prosecutors suspect that the former president abused her power by pressuring her aides to sack culture ministry officials who resisted discriminatory measures against those on the blacklist. In other cases of abuse of power and coercion, she is suspected of exerting undue influence on private companies' personnel management and hectoring them to sign contracts with Choi's firms, according to prosecutors.The country's food and entertainment conglomerate CJ, for one, was told to dismiss its vice chief executive for movies and TV content apparently supportive of liberal politicians, they said. South Korea's top carmaker Hyundai Motor Co. was also pressured to sign a 1.1 billion won supply contract with a mid-sized company belonging to one of Choi's associates and another 7.1 billion won advertising deal with an agency owned by Choi, prosecutors said.Telecoms firm KT Corp. was allegedly bullied to hire executives close to Choi and to award a 6.8 billion won advertising deal to her agency. Steelmaker POSCO was compelled to create a fencing team and to sign yet another contract with one of Choi's companies, though that contract was not realized in the end. Prosecutors are looking into whether the business groups were seeking business favors in return. The conglomerates, however, have been claiming that the president and her aides twisted their arms to make such decisions favorable to Choi.Prosecutors also said Park allegedly violated the law on managing government secrets by leaking them to Choi. There have been suspicions that Choi was involved in making key state decisions, despite having no policy experience. Park's longtime aide Jeong Ho-seong is currently standing trial and in custody for his alleged role in the process. After reviewing arguments from the prosecution and Park, the Seoul court will make a decision around midnight or later. If the court issues the writ, Park will be the country's third former president to be arrested on criminal charges following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan. She moved out from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae earlier this month after the Constitutional Court removed her from office in a historic ruling on March 10.","battle grueling legal battle ,arrest warrant on monday ,court battle grueling legal ,for fierce court battle ,thursday of an arrest","['Park Geun - hye', 'park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.06905612 -0.00767074

Despite speculation that the Samsung-CJ rivalry may have been behind the sex tape scandal, the prosecution said it could not find evidence on whether the blackmailers were acting under the direction of CJ Group, headed by Samsung Group chair‘s nephew Lee Jae-hyun.Revealed by a local news outlet last year, the video shows the Samsung chief giving envelopes to several women and engaging them in conversation suggesting he had paid for sex at his residence and a luxury villa under Samsung SDS executive’s name in southern Seoul. The prosecution indicted a total of six people for their involvement in shooting the video and blackmailing Samsung Group with the clips. It said it will continue the probe into CJ‘s alleged involvement in making the sex tape. Prosecutors found that a total of 90 million won  had been wired from Samsung chairman’s bank account under a borrowed name to the jailed CJ employee, surnamed Seon, in 2013. Seon, who allegedly took a lead in the blackmail scheme, was an executive at CJ Group’s affiliate CJ Cheil Jedang and was alleged to be close to Maeng-hee, CJ‘s honorary chairman and Kun-hee’s elder brother. There have been allegations that CJ, which used to be part of Samsung and separated from it in 1993, orchestrated the creation of the video to sabotage Samsung. When the videos were filmed between December 2011 and June 2013, Maeng-hee, who died of lung cancer in 2015, was going through a court battle against Kun-hee to claim some of the hidden shares left behind by their father and Samsung Group founder Lee Byung-chull.The revelation of the sex video not only tainted the moral reputation of the global company, but also put him at risk of facing a punishment for his illegal activities. In South Korea, paying for sex is subject to a jail term for up to 1 year and a 3 million won in fine.CJ Group has maintained that the recording of the sex video has nothing to do with the company. Samsung Group said that it had received threats from the CJ employee, but ignored them.The history of the rivalry between the Samsung empire’s sons goes back decades to when they fought for the leadership to the nation‘s biggest conglomerate. Lee Byung-Chull, who founded Samsung in 1938, had three sons and five daughters. Defying the country’s long-held practice to pass a family business onto the eldest son, Lee picked the youngest son Kun-hee as his successor. It is not fully known why Lee chose Kun-hee, instead of the eldest son Maeng-hee, to take over his business. But he later described Maeng-hee as incompetent in his autobiography, saying that the company was plunged into “chaos” under Maeng-hee‘s leadership.Maeng-hee briefly took the helm of the company following the founder’s resignation in 1966 after Samsung Group‘s fertilizer affiliate was caught smuggling Sakhalin, disguised as construction material, into the country. Three years later, the founder’s second son Chang-hee told the Blue House through a letter about his father’s creation of slush funds and embezzlement. Maeng-hee‘s relationship with his father soured as the founder allegedly saw Maeng-hee as being involved in the tip-off. Kun-hee was named as an heir to Samsung Group in 1976.The ties between the Lee brothers have allegedly severed since then. Maeng-hee filed a suit against Kun-hee to claim 4.5 trillion won in shares of Samsung Group’s affiliates, saying that Kun-hee secretly hid the late father’s assets from the siblings.By Ock Hyun-ju","sex video scandal samsung ,chief sex video scandal ,samsung chief sex video ,sex video scandal ,scandal samsung group paid","['Samsung Group', 'CJ Group', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'Samsung', 'CJ Group', 'Samsung Group']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32144251  0.27757683

Ko claimed that Choi received and edited the former president's speeches in advance.While he was hailed by some as a whistle blower, some raised suspicions that he made the disclosure to gain control of a company owned by Choi.

Malaysian and Japanese news reports said Monday that the body of Kim, the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was transferred to a crematorium outside Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, and the remains will be handed over to Pyongyang envoys who are visiting the country for secret talks with Malaysian authorities.A Malaysian policeman controls traffic outside the forensics wing of Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where the body of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, lies in Kuala Lumpur on Monday. China Press, a Malaysian Chinese-language newspaper, said four police officers visited the North Korean Embassy for 2 1/2 hours on Sunday to question three suspects staying within the compound. They are Hyon Kwang-song, a second secretary at the mission; Kim Uk-il, a Koryo Air employee; and Ri Ji-u, all of whom are suspected of having played a role in Kim’s murder. While at least five suspects had already fled or been deported to their home country, the North Korean authorities have been protecting the trio, refusing to cooperate with the probe. Kim was killed last month shortly after VX nerve agent was smeared on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Two women, each from Vietnam and Indonesia, have been arrested for carrying out the attack. North Korea and Malaysia have been at loggerheads, as Pyongyang opposed Kim’s autopsy and called for a handover of his body. They have ousted each other’s ambassadors and scrapped a visa-free travel accord. Pyongyang also barred Malaysians from leaving the country, prompting Kuala Lumpur to expel North Koreans from its soil.With their ties quickly deteriorating, the two countries have been engaged in closed-door negotiations since early this month. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Hui-chol and former Deputy Ambassador to the UN Ri Dong-il took part in a meeting Friday, according to Japanese broadcaster ANN. Sunday’s expected cremation is believed to be part of their settlement, along with the officers’ visit. For Malaysia, the case has been a domestic and international political burden, with nine of its nationals being locked in the communist state, while its investigation has hit a snag in the face of an uncooperative Pyongyang. But the latest development stoked controversy as it will likely leave many questions unanswered over Kim’s death. Malaysian authorities have failed to confirm that North Korea was the mastermind behind the assassination, though they did present some evidence suggesting it. Pyongyang argues he died from “natural causes,” accusing Malaysia of manipulating the investigation. The discussions are “ongoing” but a decision should be reached “very soon,” Malaysian Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam was quoted by Malaysia’s New Straits Times as saying early Monday, adding that the investigation will continue regardless of the agreement.

409,409,409,Arrest warrant sought for ousted Park,"South Korean prosecutors on Monday sought an arrest warrant for former President Park Geun-hye on charges including bribery and abuse of authority in connection with the corruption scandal that led to her impeachment.

Whether Park will be taken into custody now depends on the Seoul Central District Court, which will hold a hearing at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday to review the application. The ruling is expected early Friday.Former President Park Geun-hye arrived at the prosecutors' office on Feb. 21 to be questioned over a string of corruption allegations. “The case is too serious, as the suspect has abused her status and authority as a president to receive money from companies, violated the freedom of business activity and leaked confidential information related to the government,” the prosecution said in a statement. “It would be unfair not to request a warrant considering that her accomplice Choi Soon-sil, as well as those government officials who followed her orders and the ones who offered her kickbacks have all been detained.” Key figures involved in the scandal, including her longtime confidante Choi, former presidential aides, ex-ministers and Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, have been arrested and are standing trial. Park has denied all the charges, claiming no knowledge of any illegal activities by Choi and her inner circle. The request for the arrest writ came six days after the prosecution questioned the impeached president for 14 straight hours on a total of 13 charges.She is suspected of extorting donations worth 77.4 billion won  from local firms including Samsung Group for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Choi in return for political favors. Park’s other charges include allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, leaking government secrets to her and discriminating against liberal-leaning artists. The most controversial charge is bribery, a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or a term of more than 10 years.Prosecutor-General Kim Soo-nam While the prosecution viewed local firms as victims of Park’s extortion of donations, an independent counsel saw Park as an active player in the bribery scheme involving Choi and Samsung Group. The independent counsel suspected that Samsung Group offered or promised to offer funds totaling 43.3 billion won to Choi and her business interests in return for the Park administration’s backing of a 2014 merger of its two affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the smooth transfer of power from the ailing group Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Lee Jae-yong. Park was expelled from power on March 10, with less than a year remaining in her five-year term, in a unanimous decision by the Constitutional Court to finalize the Dec. 9 parliamentary impeachment. The ruling stripped her of the immunity that had shielded her from criminal investigation.South Korea’s liberal parties welcomed the decision, while the former ruling party expressed regret. “Requesting an arrest warrant for Park on charges of bribery and others is a historic decision. It is a reasonable conclusion, given the law and principles,” said Youn Kwan-seuk, spokesperson for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea in a briefing. The centrist People’s Party showed its expectation for the court to issue the warrant, praising the prosecution for showing that the law does not yield to power.The conservative and pro-Park Liberty Korea Party, however, said through a statement that “it is very regrettable for the party which had been hoping for an investigation without detention.”The smaller conservative Bareun Party also expressed regret about the “unfortunate history” of the nation’s presidents being arrested after leaving the office. But it said, “We hope this is a chance to remind ourselves of the spirit of liberal democracy that nobody is an exception before the law and principle.”If the writ is issued, she will become the nation’s third former president to be arrested, following Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan.By Ock Hyun-ju","korean prosecutors on monday ,monday sought an arrest ,prosecutors on monday sought ,prosecutors on monday ,her impeachment whether park","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Frida']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.02800217  0.45884064

Attorneys said he could be released from a Wisconsin detention center as early as Monday.Judge Samuel Cole issued a 13-page decision Friday, more than two weeks after Yee’s closed-door hearing on the asylum application.“Yee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore,” Cole wrote.Yee left Singapore with the intention of seeking asylum in the US after being jailed for several weeks in 2015 and 2016. He was accused of hurting the religious feelings of Muslims and Christians in the multiethnic city-state. Yee is an atheist. Many of his blog and social media posts criticized Singapore’s leaders. He created controversy in 2015 as the city-state was mourning the death of its first prime minister and he posted an expletive-laden video about Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew just after his death.Such open criticism of political leaders is discouraged in Singapore. The case raised questions about free speech and censorship and has been closely watched abroad.Cole said testimony during Yee’s hearing showed that while the Singapore government’s stated reason for punishing him involved religion, “its real purpose was to stifle Yee’s political speech.” He said Yee’s prison sentence was “unusually long and harsh” especially for his age.Officials at Singapore’s embassy in Washington, D.C., have not addressed the case and messages left for the government on Saturday morning in Singapore weren’t immediately returned.The ruling was praised by others.“I think this is a major embarrassment for the government, that all along claimed Amos’ persecution was not political,” Kenneth Jeyaretnam, an opposition politician who gave testimony supporting Yee’s asylum, told The Associated Press.Jeyaretnam said the decision “may create waves in Singapore. It may show Singaporeans that there’s nothing to be afraid about. The Singapore government is a paper tiger. We don’t have to swallow the brainwashing that is constantly put out.”This file photo taken on May 12, 2015 shows Amos Yee leaving the state court in Singapore. Yee, a Singaporean teenager who was jailed twice after insulting the island's late leader Lee Kuan Yew and religious groups, has been granted political asylum in the United States, his US lawyer said on March 25, 2017. Yee, 18, shocked Singaporeans in March 2015 after posting an expletive-laden video attacking Lee as the founding prime minister's death triggered a massive outpouring of grief in the city-state. His father, the late J.B. Jeyaretnam, attained folklore stature in the country’s politics and was bankrupted after contesting a series of lawsuits by the ruling People’s Action Party.The party has dominated national politics since Singapore’s independence in 1965 and its detractors often were taken to court on defamation or other charges.US-based Human Rights Watch applauded the asylum decision.“Singapore excels at creating a pressure cooker environment for dissidents and free thinkers who dare challenge the political, economic and social diktats from the ruling People’s Action Party. It’s clear the Singapore government saw Amos Yee as the proverbial nail sticking up that had to be hammered down,” said a statement from Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director.Yee’s attorney Sandra Grossman said her client was elated.“He’s very excited to begin new life in the United States,” Grossman said.Yee told AP in a phone interview from jail this month that he feared returning to Singapore. But he said he’d continue to speak out and had already planned a line of T-shirts and started writing a book about his experiences.“I have an infinite amount of ideas of what to do,” he told AP.Department of Homeland Security attorneys had opposed the asylum bid, saying Yee’s case didn’t qualify as persecution based on political beliefs. It was unclear whether they’d appeal the decision or if Yee would have to remain imprisoned if they did. Attorneys have 30 days to appeal.Officials with Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t immediately return messages Friday. A spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees US immigration courts, declined comment.","released from wisconsin detention ,singapore teen blogger chicago ,immigration judge grants asylum ,jailed for his online ,blogger chicago ap blogger","['CHICAGO', 'AP', 'Singapore', 'the United States', 'Amos Yee', 'Chicago', 'Wisconsin']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05853823  0.19611494

The special investigation headquarters under the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office raided three of the offices affiliated to the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, starting from 4:40 p.m. Friday, according to the Blue House and prosecution officials.The raid, which was the third such attempt since the Choi scandal broke out late last year, was thwarted upon the resistance of the Blue House.“Prosecution officials reached the Yeonpoong Gate , where they are discussing the detailed means of the search,” said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk in a text message sent out to reporters.The presidential office, which is temporarily steered by acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, retained its previous stance that no forceful entry may be allowed due to state security reasons.The post of senior presidential secretary for civil affairs was previously occupied by Woo Byung-woo, who is currently under investigation over his suspected connivance or assistance in Choi’s meddling in state affairs.Though his arrest warrant was earlier dismissed by the court, the former presidential legal affairs chief is still considered a central figure in the extensive corruption scandal which led to Park’s ouster upon her impeachment on March 10.The allegations related to him, if proven, are expected to add momentum to the prosecutors’ ongoing investigation of Park, possibly encouraging them to file for her arrest warrant early next week.“We are thoroughly reviewing all documents and evidence related to former President Park, but due to the complexity of the case,  is not likely to come within this weekend,” an official of the investigation team told reporters Friday afternoon.The ousted president returned to her private house on Wednesday morning after an intense 21-hour inquiry on criminal charges in connection to Choi.Investigators are expected to make an indictment early next week, upon which they will decide on whether to ask the court to issue a writ on Park.By Bae Hyun-jung","prosecutors search ex presidential ,office prosecutors on friday ,search ex presidential legal ,byung woo former presidential ,prosecutors on friday seized","['Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun', 'Cheong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29761878  0.28196865

For now, the investigation team has not revealed details on how the remaining probe will go or who will be summoned. It is also keeping mum on whether Park will be arrested and which charges she additionally faces during the briefing Wednesday. Former President Park Geun-hye returns to her home in southern Seoul early Wednesday morning after 21 hours of interrogation by state prosecutors. “We are not in a stage to tell you ,” an official from the prosecution said. “We will make a decision based on law and principle after thoroughly reviewing the investigation records.”But speculation lingers that the prosecution will likely decide on the arrest by early next week and indict her in mid-April to minimize the impact the probe might have on the May 9 presidential election. With Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong already standing trial for giving bribes to Park and her friend Choi Soon-sil, the prosecution is to focus the investigation on other local firms, including SK and Lotte Group.The firms are suspected of offering donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- allegedly controlled by Park’s jailed friend Choi -- in return for the Park administration’s political favors.SK allegedly sought to have its chief pardoned while Lotte Group looked to win a business license for its duty-free shop in exchange for the donations, which the prosecution suspects as bribery. Woo is next in line. The prosecutor-turned-presidential aide is accused of condoning Choi’s meddling in state affairs and exerting undue influence over the prosecution to hinder a previous investigation into the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014. The Park administration was heavily criticized for its botched rescue operations during the accident, which left more than 300 dead or missing. Park headed home in the morning after over 21 hours of questioning by the prosecution as a suspect on a total of 13 charges, including bribery, abuse of power and leaking of government secrets in connection with the corruption scandal. “The probe went smoothly,” an official from the prosecution told reporters Wednesday. “She reviewed the statement in detail while consulting her lawyers. Park appeared to be cautious and meticulous.”After entering the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office at 9:25 a.m., the questioning went until 11:40 p.m. It took about seven hours for the ousted president to review statements she made during the interrogation. She allegedly denied all charges, claiming no knowledge of Choi and her inner circle’s wrongdoings. She also actively defended herself, thoroughly reviewing the statements and asking the investigation team to revise them when needed. The prosecution allegedly focused on grilling her over her role in coercing local firms to make donations to the Choi-controlled entities and giving them political favors in return, which could determine whether she will be charged with extortion, abuse of authority or bribery. Park declined to comment as she left. She made an apology and vowed to the public to go through the process sincerely before heading into the interrogation room Tuesday. “We express our respect to the prosecutors and their families who made efforts to reveal the truth,” said Park’s lawyers. They said the questioning proceeded in a “rational” and “calm” way, unlike the probe by an independent counsel who they denounced as “politically biased.”The questioning came 11 days after Park became an ordinary citizen upon the Constitutional Court’s decision to remove her from office on March 10 over a corruption scandal. The ruling stripped her of the immunity that had shielded her from criminal investigation.

Former President Park Geun-hye leaves the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in the capital on March 22, 2017, after over 22 hours of a prosecution probe on corruption allegations that removed her from office earlier this month. She is known to have denied all charges during the questioning, though prosecutors did not confirm her stance.Park's supporters were waiting for her from early in the morning, some stayed through the entire night, near the prosecution compound. Waiving national flags, they chanted, ""Nullify the Impeachment!"" as the car carrying her passed by.A group of other supporters also gathered near Park's private home. Park smiled and waved to them as she arrived home.Park was grilled over multiple allegations, including that local business groups donated huge sums of money to two foundations allegedly controlled by Park's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for business favors.Prosecutors summoned Choi and two of Park's jailed former aides -- An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong -- on Tuesday, but all three declined the call, citing personal reasons. Prosecutors refused to comment on whether the summons was for a cross-examination with the former president.Prosecutors will now mull over whether to seek an arrest of the ex-leader. They have so far avoided directly mentioning the possibility of seeking Park's detention.Park is the country's fourth former president to undergo questioning over criminal allegations, following Roh Tae-woo, Chun Doo-hwan and the late Roh Moo-hyun.""I feel sorry to the public,"" Park said as she arrived at the prosecution.

Former President Park Geun-hye The special investigation headquarters of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday started its marathon inquiry of the former president, seeking to prove her role in the extensive scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.“We expect the questioning to wrap  as planned, though our prediction may not be entirely precise yet,“ senior prosecutor Roh Seung-kwon told reporters in the afternoon briefing.Though he largely reserved detailed answers to most of the questions, citing confidentiality of the ongoing inquiry, the prosecutor suggested that the questioning process was under control.When asked whether the summoned former president either refused to speak or lost her temper, Roh claimed that she remained composed and answered questions in a sincere manner.But as investigators previously gestured to focus on bribery, which is the most disputed of all suggested charges, questions continued on how Park denied her allegations. Former President Park Geun-hye heads to prosecution for questioning over corruption scandal on Tuesday. Park’s intermediary role – bribery or not?Since taking over the case from the independent counsel team in late February, state prosecutors have been focusing on proving that Park shared economic interests with Choi and that her role in Choi’s profiteering constitutes bribery.Steering the inquiry are two veteran prosecutors specializing in corporate corruption cases -- Lee One-seok and Han Woong-jae, both sternly advocating Park‘s liability.Lee was the one to figure out Park’s involvement in the back-scratching relationship between Samsung Group and Choi, laying the grounds for indicting Park on bribery.The nation’s top business unit allegedly offered some 43.3 billion won  to Choi, her family members and a number of business organizations controlled by Choi. In exchange for the sponsorship, Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong is suspected of having used Choi’s influence upon the president to facilitate his corporate succession.One of Park’s defense arguments was that she did not profit from the Samsung-Choi ties and she had never coerced anyone for the funds.But by deeming Park and Choi an interdependent unit with shared economic interests, Lee established the legal logic that Park’s abuse of power for Choi’s sake equally constituted bribery.Han, who was also part of the previous investigation team before the independent counsel took over, played a key role in proving Park’s role in extorting conglomerate funds for the Mir and K-Sports foundations, both of which were controlled by Choi.It was Han who led the questioning up to late afternoon, thus raising speculations that the investigation team primarily focused on Park’s allegations related to the foundations‘ funding.The former president has constantly denied the alleged connection to Choi, seeking to take a step back from the entire corruption scandal pivoting on her former confidante.“I have been framed,” Park told reporters in a closed-door briefing on New Year’s Day, sternly refuting her suspected involvement in the Samsung-Choi ties.As for the two foundations, she repeatedly claimed their purpose was to promote the nation’s culture and sports sectors, denying knowledge of Choi’s illicit profiteering.While bracing to collect the former president’s testimony in a rare face-to-face questioning, prosecutors also pledged to lead a fair investigation, ruling out prejudices or political intentions.“The top priority is to confirm the facts, after which we shall decide which legal principles are to be applied,” said senior prosecutor Roh Seung-kwon in a briefing on the previous day.Park is also charged with a series of other law violations, such as leaking confidential state documents, illicitly expelling specific civic servants upon Choi’s request, and establishing a so-called blacklist so as to exclude anti-government artists from subsidies.Corporates, victim or bribegiver?Another key issue that prosecutors expect to prove through Park’s inquiry is that the conglomerates that funded Choi and her businesses are also wrongdoers in bribery, regardless of the political coercion they received from the former president.The investigation team had earlier concluded that the conglomerates, including Samsung, had been forced by Park and Choi to offer donations, thus excluding them from bribery charges.The successive independent counsel team, however, claimed the corporate funds were in compensatory relation with other benefits and thus constituted kickbacks.For instance, Samsung had Park exert influence in a disputed merger of its affiliates so as to increase the share of heir apparent Lee Jae-yong, in exchange of its sponsorship for Choi’s equestrian daughter Chung Yoo-ra and to Choi’s business units.The nation’s third-largest conglomerate SK Group is suspected of offering similar benefits to Choi in exchange of having its jailed chief Chey Tae-won pardoned, while Lotte Group allegedly sought benefits for its duty-free shop business.Reflecting the independent counsel’s view, state prosecutors are considering indicting Park on both coercion and bribery, on the claim that the two charges do not contradict one another, according to sources.Under such circumstances, corporations are likely to face punishment for their active role in the triangular bribery framework -- seeking their business interests through Park while offering corresponding kickbacks to Choi.This logic of double liability will also increase the possibilities of Park’s arrest, which will put the former president on the same position as her arrested former aides.The list of arrested key figures include Choi, Samsung Group chief Lee, former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon, former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, former Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum and former Presidential Personal Secretary Jeong Ho-seong.Investigators had sought to hold a cross examination between Park and her arrested aides, but the attempt was thwarted.”We have summoned Choi, Jeong and An but all of them submitted non-attendance statements, refusing to show up,“ said an official of the investigation team.Prospects on arrest Prosecutors are expected to decide whether or not to seek an arrest warrant for Park as early as this week or early next week. The conventional custom for prosecutors is to make the decision within three days from the inquiry of the key suspect.The general view among legal circles is that the investigation team will make the request to the court in consideration of the seriousness of the case and Park‘s constant denial of charges.Prosecutors have also expressed concerns on the destruction of evidence, pointing to Park’s refusal to be questioned and of the raid of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in the past months.The Criminal Procedure Code states that a criminal suspect may be investigated under custody should he or she lack a fixed residence or if there is the possibility of destroying evidence.But concerns also persist that an unconventional arrest of the former president may take public attention away from election agendas.With Park’s ouster from power, an earlier-than-planned presidential election is set to take place on May 9 to select the next state chief.By Bae Hyun-jung","bribery grilling former president ,park liability for bribery ,over the corruption allegations ,investigators over the corruption ,grilling former president park","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",4,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.03307011 0.17873104 0.18060692],Korea Herald,Politics,3,2017,"over corruption scandal on tuesday ,corruption scandal on tuesday park ,corruption scandal on tuesday ,her arrest former president park ,scandal on tuesday park intermediary","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Roh Seung - kwon', 'Roh', 'Park', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Lee one - seok', 'Han Woong - jae', 'Lee', 'Samsung Group', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Samsung Group ’s', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Choi', 'Park ’s', 'Samsung - Choi', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Lee', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Han', 'Park ’s', 'K - Sports', 'Choi', 'Han', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Samsung - Choi', 'Choi ’s', 'Roh Seung - kwon', 'Choi ’s', 'Choi', 'Samsung', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Samsung', 'Park', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Choi ’s', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi ’s', 'SK Group', 'Choi', 'Chey Tae - win', 'Lotte Group', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park ’s', 'Choi', 'Samsung Group', 'Lee', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Culture', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Policy Coordination', 'Chong', 'Presidential Personal', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Jeong', 'Park', 'Park', 'Park', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",0,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.03307011 0.17873104 0.18060692]

Escorted by security guards and her lawyers, Park arrived at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul at 9:23 a.m. to undergo an interrogation expected to last past midnight. Former President Park Geun-hye “I am sorry,” Park said before entering the building. “I will sincerely cooperate with the investigation.“It is the first time she has made a public appearance since she moved out of the presidential residence on March 12. The disgraced leader, after arriving at her private home, said through a spokesperson that the truth will come out someday. Coming two days after the court ruled to expel her on March 10, it was widely taken as a hint at her unwillingness to concede. While in office, Park refused to undergo face-to-face questioning and blocked a raid on the presidential office. Upon the court's ruling, she was stripped of the immunity that has shielded her from criminal prosecution. The prosecution are set to grill Park over a total of 13 charges, including bribery, abuse of authority and leak of government secrets. Park heads to prosecution from her private resident in Samseong-dong, for questioning over corruption scandal on Tuesday. Before heading to the interrogation room, Park is expected to have a short meeting over tea with Roh Seung-kwon, a deputy chief of the special probe team into the scandal, at his office on the 13th floor. She is set to be questioned in the investigation room on the 10th floor, equipped with video and audio recording facilities. The prosecution assigned senior prosecutors under the special probe team -- Han Woong-jae and Lee Won-seok. They investigated the corruption scandal until the probe was handed over to an independent counsel Park Young-soo in December. Park’s loyal supporters gathered around the prosecution’s office in the morning to hold a rally and greet the ousted leader. Waving national flags, they called for the impeachment to be invalidated.

She is suspected of colluding with her friend Choi Soon-sil and former aide An Chong-bum in pressuring local conglomerates to donate some 77.4 billion won  to two dubious foundations -- Mir and K-Sports -- allegedly controlled by Choi. State prosecutors accused Park of abuse of power and coercion and an independent counsel later concluded that such an act constitutes bribery. After a monthslong investigation, the independent counsel team indicted Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of Samsung Group, on charges of bribing Choi, and in effect Park, in return for business favors. Special investigators viewed the 20.4 billion won the business group donated to the two foundations, as well as its other business transactions with Choi's company, as kickbacks. The state prosecutors are now expanding their probe into other conglomerates. This photo, taken on March 20, 2017, shows a triangle of yellow tape laid down in front of a stairway at the entrance of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in the capital, which will serve as a place marker for former President Park Geun-hye to stand at when she appears for questioning a day later. Park, dismissed as president on March 10, faces an investigation on 13 counts of corruption allegations that range from extortion to abuse of power. SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won was grilled by prosecutors on Saturday over suspicions the conglomerate donated a total of 11.1 billion won to the foundations in return for a presidential pardon for him. Chey was then serving a prison term for embezzlement and other charges. A senior prosecution official earlier said they will decide whether such collection of money can be deemed as coercion or bribery after getting the facts straight based on Park's questioning. The former president has also been named an accomplice in blacklisting cultural figures deemed critical of her administration to deny them state support. Former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun and Park's ex-chief of staff Kim Ki-choon are standing trial for allegedly orchestrating the creation and management of the list, which is known to have over 9,000 people's name on it.Another former presidential aide Jeong Ho-seong was indicted on charges of leaking government documents, including confidential information, to Choi under the direction of Park. There have been allegations Choi, who held no official government post nor has any policy experience, peddled influence in key state affairs using her ties to the former president. Prosecutors also accuse Park of abusing her authority to fire government officials who were not supportive of such alleged irregularities carried out in the past years and peddling influence to give business favors to those close to Choi. Park has flatly denied all suspicions against her Park and has so far rejected a direct investigation, as the Constitution stipulates that an incumbent president has immunity from prosecution.

424,424,424,Park braces for tough questioning on bribery,"Former President Park Geun-hye will deliver a message in public before undergoing questioning by state investigators Tuesday, addressing the public directly for the first time since her impeachment.Former President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)“Former President Park has prepared a message, which she will deliver on her way to the prosecutors’ office,” her lawyer Sohn Beom-kyu told reporters Monday, claiming to have no f...","Former President Park Geun-hye will deliver a message in public before undergoing questioning by state investigators Tuesday, addressing the public directly for the first time since her impeachment.Former President Park Geun-hye “Former President Park has prepared a message, which she will deliver on her way to the prosecutors’ office,” her lawyer Sohn Beom-kyu told reporters Monday, claiming to have no further knowledge of the content of the message. Park, the nation’s first elected leader to be ousted upon impeachment, is to attend prosecutorial questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Tuesday morning.While Park’s aides kept quiet over the expelled president’s current status or strategy in responding to prosecutors’ questions, observers speculate she would once again deny all charges, especially the bribery charge related to conglomerates.The last time that Park was exposed to public view, though in a confined environment, was in her surprise New Year’s Day press talk, in which she claimed to have been “totally framed.”In her final hearing statement of the Constitutional Court’s impeachment trial, which her lawyer read in proxy, Park reiterated her stance that none of the charges are true.Expecting repeated denials from the former president, prosecutors have been focusing on investigating the conglomerates allegedly connected to Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil.The special investigation headquarters Sunday summoned Jang Sun-wook, head of Lotte Duty Free, on charges of offering bribes to Choi and Park in exchange for benefits in obtaining a license in the duty-free shop business.The team also earlier called in executive officials of SK Group, the nation’s third-largest conglomerate, for allegedly providing kickbacks so as to have Chairman Chey Tae-won pardoned from his jail term due to embezzlement.The prosecutors’ goal is to successfully prove the compensatory relation between the conglomerates and the former president, so as to indict -- and possibly arrest -- Park on bribery charges.The dilemma for Park’s aides, on the other hand, is that Park has mostly refrained from speaking in public ever since the influence-peddling scandal broke out late last year.Even during her three public addresses and surprise press interview, Park’s way of speech and logic fell short of answering the allegations raised against her -- most of which will resurface at the prosecutorial questioning.“We are investing efforts in preparing  for the expected questions, as well as for an outbreak of situations,” Yoo Young-ha, a key member of Park’s legal representative team, said earlier.In an apparent move to ramp up last-minute preparations and strategy meetings, Yoo was seen visiting Park’s house early on Monday morning, following an eight-hour visit the previous day.Although Yoo refused to answer reporters’ questions, her other lawyer Sohn explained to reporters earlier that “Yoo is preparing for detailed hearings, while other lawyers are focusing more on the big picture.”By Bae Hyun-jung","her impeachment former president ,by state investigators tuesday ,impeachment former president park ,bribery former president park ,on bribery former president","['Park Geun', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Sohn Beom - kyu']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.04433656  0.19331294

Chey Tae-won, chairman of South Korea's third-largest conglomerate SK Group, appears at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul to undergo questioning over a corruption scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye and her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil on March 18, 2017. The 56-year-old tycoon was quizzed over suspicions that his group donated large sums of money in 2015 to two nonprofit organizations controlled by the former president's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, in return for a presidential pardon for Chey, who was then serving a prison term for embezzlement and other charges.He was given a presidential pardon that year. The chairman reportedly denied all allegations of him donating money in exchange for his pardon.Chey's latest summons came as the prosecution is accelerating a bribery investigation into the former president after the Constitutional Court dismissed her on March 10.The prosecution is suspecting that local conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics Co., bribed Choi, and in effect Park, through the donations. Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was arrested in February on charges of bribery and embezzlement.In its historic ruling, the court noted Park had systematically and continuously aided her friend in the latter's pursuit of personal gain.","impeached president scandal ,korea third largest conglomerate ,impeached president scandal the ,in impeached president scandal ,chairman left the seoul","[""South Korea 's"", 'SK Group', 'Park Geun', 'Chey Tae - won', 'SK Group', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55164331  0.32859677

It is believed that Choe had played some role in  dismissal of the spy chief,"" the report said.Choe is one of the close aides to the North Korean leader. But, to maintain his monolithic regime, Kim Jong-un does not allow any officials to exert excessive influence.The report said that Choe has remained low-key since he was reinstated after being punished for his mishandling of a power plant project in late November 2015.""To maintain his clout as a heavyweight, Choe needs a practical influence in appointment, but he is facing limitations, as Kim Jong-un has restricted his role  to prevent him from expanding his power base,"" the report added.In another sign of a power struggle, Choe is said to be at odds with Hwang Pyong-so, director of the general political bureau of the Korean People's Army. Hwang is widely viewed as the No. 2 man in North Korea.Hwang reported to the North's leader about the possibility that Choe could lead a revolt when he served as the director of the KPA's general political bureau in the past, it said.""Choe is known to be seeking revenge against Hwang on the belief that the report led to his dismissal,"" it added. Meanwhile, Hwang is seeking to prevent the dismissed spy chief and Kim Yong-chol, a key official handling inter-Korean affairs, from exerting an influence on the military.""Among North Korean officials, there is a rumor that the relationship between Hwang and Kim Won-hong, the ex-state security minister, is like a dormant volcano whose timing for eruption is hard to predict,"" the report said.Gen. Kim Yong-chol was appointed as the party secretary handling inter-Korean affairs, doubling as the head of the United Front Department at the ruling party. He previously led North Korea's reconnaissance bureau.In the past, Kim Yong-chol had a good relationship with the spy chief, but his ties with Kim Won-hong and military official Hwang frayed as he sought to abuse his authority, the report added.","dismissal of spy chief ,was fired as minister ,fired as minister ,fired as minister of ,country spy chief report","['Choe Ryong - hae', ""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Kim Won - hong', ""the Workers ' Party of Korea""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41161254 -0.10697927

Camera stands and ladders belonging to media companies are set up at the entrance of Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office in southern Seoul, Wednesday. The prosecution officially summoned former President Park Geun-hye for in-person questioning set for next Tuesday. The special investigation team affiliated with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office drafted hundreds of key questions on Park’s extensive set of corruption allegations, according to sources at the investigative agency on Friday.Most of the questions were based on the three private talks between Park and Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, as was recorded in the business notebooks and testimonies of arrested former presidential aides.The team is also working on a variety of investigation scenarios, each depending on the former state chief’s answers and remarks.Investigators on Wednesday demanded that Park show up at the prosecutors‘ offce in Seocho-dong, Seoul at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, marking the fourth questioning of a former president in the nation’s history.Park, who was ousted upon the Constitutional Court’s decision on Mach 10, is currently facing 13 criminal charges in total, most of them related to her former civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil.But she has so far denied all of the allegations raised against her and claimed that “the truth will eventually come to light,” apparently denying the justice of the ongoing prosecutorial investigation and her impeachment ruling.Anticipating her repeated denial, prosecutors also closed in on their questioning of An Chong-bum, former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, as well as conglomerates officials allegedly related to Park’s wrongdoings.Three former and incumbent senior executives of SK Group, the nation’s third-largest conglomerate, were sent back home early on Friday morning after some 18 hours of intense questioning.The group allegedly donated 11.1 billion  to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Park’s confidante Choi in 2015-2016, an amount which investigators saw as kickbacks for a presidential pardon for SK Chairman Chey Tae-won who was serving a jail term for embezzlement.The group is also suspected of having sought illegitimate benefits such as the authorization of its duty free shop business, exemption of tax investigation on some of its affiliates, and easier acquisition of a mobile carrier unit.The summoning of SK officials indicated the prosecutors’ move to expand their probe into conglomerates other than Samsung. The independent counsel team, which had led the investigation from December last year up to late last month had focused on Samsung and its heir-apparent Lee.“The general consensus within the team is that an arrest warrant request is inevitable, considering the seriousness of the charges, Park’s constant denial, and the fact that all of her key accomplices are under arrest,” said a prosecutorial official.Prosecutor General Kim Soo-nam also urged the special team to “remain unshaken in its belief,” alluding to an uncompromising investigation upon the former president.By Bae Hyun-jung","state prosecutors on friday ,arrest warrant for park ,prosecutors on friday ,prosecutors on friday made ,park alleged bribery charges",['Park Geun'],4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.20247306 0.44059655 0.10728198],Korea Herald,Politics,3,2017,"hye state prosecutors on friday ,southern seoul wednesday the prosecution ,repeated denial prosecutors also closed ,kickbacks for presidential pardon for ,state prosecutors on friday","['Park Geun', 'Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Park', 'Park', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park', 'Seocho - dong', 'Seoul', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'an Chong - bum', 'Park ’s', 'SK Group', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Chey Tae - won', 'Samsung', 'Samsung', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Kim Soo - nam', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",2,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.20247306 0.44059655 0.10728198]

Chung Yoo-ra was arrested in the European country's northern city of Aalborg in January as the Korean investigators put her on a wanted list. It was suspected that she received inappropriate academic and financial favors based on her mother's close ties with the former leader.    Still, it is unclear whether she will immediately return home, as she may appeal the decision.""Chung Yoo-ra has three days to decide whether she will bring the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions before the Danish courts,"" the prosecution said. ""If that happens, the District Court of Aalborg will be the first instance."" South Korea's independent counsel team that looked into the massive scandal asked Denmark to send Chung home for questioning on a series of alleged wrongdoings. A number of former and current professors at Seoul-based Ewha Womans University have been arrested and indicted in relation to undue favors given to Chung. She has so far refused to voluntarily return home to face the probe.  Her mother Choi Soon-sil, whose alleged irregularities led to Park's ouster, is currently standing trial over suspicions she meddled in state affairs and amassed profits using her ties to the former leader. The ex-president is now waiting to undergo an interrogation next Tuesday over a string of corruption allegations by state prosecutors, who are looking into issues that remain unresolved by the special counsel team.""I know that the case has been subject to great attention in South Korea,"" said Deputy Director Mohammad Ahsan from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Denmark.

In the latest legal victory for wartime forced laborers, the Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of  Lee Chun-myeon, 86, who filed the case against Nichi-Fujikoshi Corp. in May 2015. The court ordered the Japanese firm to pay 100 million won  to the plaintiff in compensation for her coerced work at a factory in Toyama Prefecture in the 1940s.""Japan mobilized forced laborers for the military industry during its unlawful wars, such as the Sino-Japanese War or the Pacific War, and Fujikoshi actively joined the bandwagon,"" Judge Ryu Jong-myeong said.

The victim, in fact, worked 10-12 hours a day, six days a week, and was ordered to carry out dangerous tasks, according to the court.""Fujikoshi has the obligation to compensate for the mental suffering Lee endured,"" the judge said. The court did not accept the defendant's claim that the Korean laborers no longer have the right to seek compensation from their former Japanese employers, as the issue was closed under the 1965 treaty between the two countries to normalize diplomatic ties. The court said the treaty did not terminate an individual's right to seek compensation.The same court also ruled in favor of five other victims in a similar case last year.

Samsung Group’s de facto chief is suspected of having offered kickbacks to Choi-controlled foundations in return for political favors from the the Park administration.Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong  Judge Lee Young-hoon, who is currently trying Lee and other Samsung officials, is the son-in-law of Lim Jung-pyung, 76, who is close to Choi, an opposition lawmaker revealed on a radio program. “When I went to Germany to dig into the Choi Soon-sil scandal, I was told that a doctor, surnamed Lim, asked a Korean elder there to help Choi,” Ahn said, calling Lim a “guardian” for Choi. “Lim is the father-in-law of the senior justice, surnamed Lee, who is trying Lee on charges of bribery.” “Though it might not have been intentional, there must be controversy over the fairness of the trial,” An added. The Seoul Central District Court confirmed that the justice is the son-in-law of Lim, who in the 1980s introduced a young Choi to his acquaintance residing in Germany to help her settle there. “Lee did not know that his father-in-law had a link to the Choi family until media reports surfaced,” the court explained. “It is not true that Lim had served as a guardian for Choi.”Lim met Choi Tae-min, Choi Soon-sil’s father and a religious cult leader, only once. He has not been in touch with the Choi family since Park Chung-hee, Park‘s father and former president, was assassinated in 1979, the court added. Lim is an honorary professor at Dankook University and has also served on the board of directors for the Jeongsoo Scholarship Foundation set up by Park Chung-hee for about four years. It was also once headed by Park Geun-hye.The court said it is not considering reassigning the case to another judge. It allocated the bribery case to the current Justice Lee through an agreement, not random selection. The bribery case was initially assigned to Judge Cho Eui-yeon, who once rejected an arrest warrant for the Samsung Group’s de facto leader. The court changed the judge upon Cho’s request. The Samsung Group’s de facto leader is being tried for bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee is suspected of offering bribes of 43 billion won  to Choi in exchange for the state pension agency’s backing of the merger of two Samsung affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the young tycoon -- the only son of bedridden Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee -- to tighten his grip on his family’s massive corporate empire.

""With the investigation set to reach its peak now, a raid for the sake of a raid seems meaningless."" Park allegedly colluded with her friend Choi Soon-sil in extorting money from local conglomerates.""I am doubtful if it is right  when we have already sent a summons to her and are preparing for an interrogation,"" he added. On the same day, prosecutors questioned three former and incumbent executives of SK Group in connection with the ongoing probe over bribery allegations. Prosecutors are looking into whether the nation's third-largest conglomerate donated a total of 11.1 billion won  to two dubious foundations, allegedly controlled by Choi, in return for business favors.","prosecutors rule out raid ,corruption involving former president ,park home prosecutors investigating ,home prosecutors investigating allegations ,senior prosecutor told reporters","['Park Geun', 'Cheong', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10771503  0.36831281

Lotte was selected by the KCS to operate the shop, along with five other conglomerates, in December. SK was not included in the list. Prosecutors attempted to delve into the allegations last year, raiding the headquarters of Lotte, SK and other government offices, but had stopped after an independent counsel team was launched to investigate the scandal in December.The independent counsel team, however, wrapped up the probe late last month, leaving the issues implicating SK and Lotte unresolved. Meanwhile, Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of the country's largest business group Samsung, was arrested and indicted on charges including bribery and embezzlement following the probe.","over park scandal prosecutors ,prosecutors questioned two employees ,park scandal prosecutors ,conglomerates over park scandal ,last week prosecution official","['the Korea Customs Service', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1812434   0.31952652

An image of a flag of Prosecution Service and former President Park Geun-hye Park is suspected of having colluded with her friend Choi Soon-sil to extort money from Samsung Group and other conglomerates. The scandal led to her impeachment by parliament in December and the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision to permanently remove her from office last week.Earlier in the day, a special prosecutors team probing Park's scandal said that it will decide on Wednesday when to summon Park and inform her. ""We will let you know once we are prepared,"" an official of the team told reporters.Park faces 13 criminal charges, including bribery and abuse of power. The official said the team will decide on the date after considering its review of investigation records transferred from an independent counsel who looked into the scandal for 70 days until the end of February, and after drawing up a list of questions for the former president.It will then inform Park of when she should appear for questioning, the official said, dismissing questions about whether the two sides have discussed a mutually convenient date. ""We will decide on the method as well,"" he said.Independent Counsel Park Young-soo concluded at the end of his investigation that Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong paid or promised some 43 billion won  to Choi, and in effect to Park, in exchange for business favors.Park, the first South Korean leader to be ousted, has denied all the charges against her. In case she fails to appear, the official said, it's difficult to say at this stage what steps the prosecutors will take.Park was requested to face questioning as a suspect in earlier investigations by state prosecutors soon after the scandal emerged in October, and by the independent counsel later. She refused both requests.By law, suspects can be taken in by force with a court warrant if they ignore a summons without a legitimate reason. Park's ouster has triggered an early presidential election, which many expect to take place May 9.""It looks like the prosecution took various factors into consideration in deciding on the investigation timetable, including the political situation surrounding the election and its plans for future investigations,"" said an official working in the legal circle.The team plans to look into whether other local conglomerates, including SK, Lotte and CJ, also bribed Park.On Monday, Rep. Kim Jin-tae of Park's Korea Liberty Korea argued that the prosecution should postpone its investigation into the former president until after the election.The probe will proceed without consideration of the election, the official with the team said. Park returned to her private home in southern Seoul on Sunday.","her attorney said tuesday ,corruption probe attorney ousted ,tuesday hours after investigators ,corruption scandal her attorney ,probe attorney ousted president","['Park Geun', 'Son Bum - kyu', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37015864  0.34051102

436,436,436,Malaysia says Kim Jong-nam’s body has been embalmed,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Tuesday that the body of Kim Jong-nam, who was killed last month, has been embalmed to better preserve it, and that about 50 North Koreans whose work permits have expired will be deported.News of the deportations was a surprise as the countries have barred each other’s citizen from leaving amid a diplomatic standoff over Kim's death....","KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Tuesday that the body of Kim Jong-nam, who was killed last month, has been embalmed to better preserve it, and that about 50 North Koreans whose work permits have expired will be deported.News of the deportations was a surprise as the countries have barred each other’s citizen from leaving amid a diplomatic standoff over Kim's death. Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Tuesday that the body of Kim Jong-nam, who was killed last month, has been embalmed to better preserve it. Malaysian authorities say the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed Feb. 13 after two women smeared his face with the banned VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur’s airport. North Korea -- widely suspected of being behind the attack -- rejects the findings.Zahid said Kim's body was taken out of the hospital morgue at a Kuala Lumpur hospital for the embalmment procedure and has been returned. He declined to say when it was done.""As it is kept in the mortuary, the body might decompose, so we did this to preserve the body,"" he told reporters in Parliament.Health officials have said Kim’s relatives will be given two to three weeks to claim his body before deciding what to do with it.North Korea has demanded the body back and objected when Malaysia conducted an autopsy. Pyongyang also has refused to acknowledge that Kim Jong-nam was the victim and has referred to him as Kim Chol, the name on the passport Kim was carrying when he was attacked in a crowded airport terminal.Malaysian police said Friday that Kim Chol and Kim Jong-nam were the same person, but refused to say how they confirmed that.Relations between the countries have deteriorated sharply since Kim‘s death, with each expelling the other’s ambassador. Last Tuesday, North Korea blocked all Malaysians from leaving the country until a ""fair settlement"" of the case was reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil.Zahid, who earlier said negotiations were ongoing, said Tuesday that about 50 North Koreans detained in eastern Sarawak state for overstaying their work permits will be sent back to Pyongyang soon. He didn't give details nor say why they would be deported amid the exit ban. There are nine Malaysians in North Korea -- three embassy staff members and their family members. About 315 North Koreans are in Malaysia, according to Malaysian officials.Both countries also scrapped visa-free travel for each other’s citizens.Although Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea of being behind the attack, many speculate that Pyongyang must have orchestrated it. Experts say the VX nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory, and North Korea is widely believed to possess large quantities of the chemical weapon.Four of the seven North Korean suspects being sought by Malaysia are believed to have left the country the day Kim was killed. Police say the other three, including a North Korean diplomat, are believed to be in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.North Korea on Monday sought to shift the blame for Kim's death to the United States and South Korea.North Korea’s deputy UN ambassador, Kim In-ryong, said in New York that ""from A to Z, this case is the product of reckless moves of the United States and South Korean authorities,"" who he said are trying to tarnish the North‘s image and bring down its social system.The ambassador said the US is one of the few countries that can manufacture VX, and has also stockpiled chemical weapons in South Korea, which could have provided the chemical agent for the attack on Kim Jong-nam.The attack was caught on surveillance video that shows two women going up to Kim and apparently smearing something on his face. He was dead within 20 minutes, authorities say. The women -- one Indonesian, one Vietnamese -- have been charged with murder but say they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank.","was killed last month ,standoff over kim death ,killed last month ,will be deported news ,work permits have expired","['KUALA LUMPUR', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysia', 'Ahmad Zahid Hamidi', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'North Koreans', 'Kim']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37587097  0.19387259

Park lost her immunity as of Friday, after the court upheld her impeachment by the National Assembly.""We have not yet delivered a summons to Park,"" a prosecution source said, asking not to be named. ""We have not made any decision on anything."" Prosecutor-General Kim Soo-nam is known to be listening to various opinions from senior prosecutors and elders in the legal circle.There has been speculation that the prosecution could delay the investigation until after the upcoming presidential election which will likely take place in May. Still, considering that the trials of major figures embroiled in the scandal, such as Park's friend Choi Soon-sil and Samsung Group's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, are underway, the prosecution may seek to speed up its investigation of the former president, experts say.They said that Park can be summoned as early as this week, if prosecutors are determined to conclude her questioning and indictment by the end of March or early April.Prosecutors have been reviewing the investigative materials over the scandal handed over from an independent counsel team, led by Park Young-soo. Park's team wrapped up its probe last month, after putting 30 suspects on trial. The special counsel team had unsuccessfully sought to hold a face-to-face interrogation of Park at the presidential office.A protracted legal battle is expected down the road as the president has denied all criminal charges leveled against her.In a statement released after she left the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Sunday, Park Geun-hye said ""the truth will certainly be unearthed someday, though it will take time.""","prosecutors mull over investigation ,presidential immunity last week ,impeachment sources said monday ,into ousted park prosecutors ,lost her presidential immunity","['Park Geun - hye', ""the Constitutional Court 's"", 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.60598898  0.40351105

Now as a civilian, Park has no means to evade the investigation. Prosecutors can summon her for questioning and seek to arrest her if she does not show up. They can also ban Park from leaving the country.Moon Jae-in, a leading presidential candidate from the liberal opposition Democratic Party of Korea, on Sunday said the prosecution has no reason to delay its investigation into Park as she is now deprived of presidential immunity. “Some say the investigation should be delayed until after the presidential election. But given that ex-President Park is not a candidate, there is no reason to do so,” Moon said. “She should make sure not to destroy or bring presidential archives from Cheong Wa Dae ,” Moon said. The disgraced leader left the presidential residence and relocated to her private home in Seoul on Sunday evening.Prosecutors may seek to raid Cheong Wa Dae, as she has moved out, some local media outlets speculated. Previous attempts to search the presidential compound had failed due to the objection of Park’s office, citing national security.Cheong Wa Dae “The presidential office is categorized as a national security facility, which handles military and state secrets, so we cannot accept any raid,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said earlier this month, denying access to the special counsel’s team that was seeking to enter the compound. The counsel, at that time, hoped to find evidence on Park’s “missing seven hours” on the day of the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014, which left more than 300 dead or missing, and other remaining cases involving former Senior Presidential Secretary Woo Byung-woo and major conglomerates.But hurdles remain as Cheong Wa Dae officials can reject search requests based on the Criminal Procedure Act. Article 110-111 states that “seizure and search shall not be conducted at a place in respect of which military information shall be kept confidential, unless approval from the person in charge is obtained.”Woo, another key person in the scandal, allegedly abetted Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil’s abuse of power while serving as a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016.The court rejected last month the investigator’s proposal to issue an arrest warrant for Woo on grounds of insufficient evidence.“ could have figured out how Woo abused his power if we had been able to seize and search ,” independent counsel Park Young-soo had said while closing down the special investigation.By Kim Da-sol","sitting president park formerly ,prosecutors to resume park ,park investigation state prosecutors ,investigation of former president ,former president park geun","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.19604483  0.25090986

Amid a burst of camera flashes, the most intriguing component of the scene were two tiny pink hair rollers still attached to the back of her bobbed curly hair. The image went viral in no time, despite court officials’ plea with the media not to use it, giving birth to a flurry of memes. Lee Jung-mi, acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, has rollers in her hair. Lee, 55, is retiring from the court Monday as her six-year term comes to a close. As the only female justice in the nine-member bench, she became the youngest person in history to take on the coveted job in 2011. Her nomination by then Supreme Court head Lee Yong-hoon also gained traction as she is a graduate of Korea University, an atypical feature in a community overwhelmingly dominated by Seoul National University male alumni. The soft-spoken, strong-minded Lee maintained a low profile throughout her career, but was credited for siding with the vulnerable in society. Among her landmark verdicts include a 2003 ruling in favor of a mother who died after a cesarean operation without being sufficiently informed of the surgery’s risks by her doctor. In 2007, she ordered a builder and a bank to compensate residents of rental apartments allotted for the low-income bracket for slack construction. “A constitutional justice bears the duty enshrined in the Constitution to mediate between various values and conflicts in society so as to achieve social integration in a more developed form,” Lee said upon her assumption of the constitutional judgeship. “Accordingly he or she has to be delicate and considerate, and have a solid sense of balance, so that the minority and the disadvantaged in society will not be sacrificed.” At the Constitutional Court, Lee oversaw a controversial 2014 case that disbanded the far-left Unified Progressive Party, concluding that its members sought to overthrow the country with the assistance of North Korea. Lee Jung-mi, acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, delivers the ruling confirming the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in Seoul on Friday. She mostly provided a majority view, including on the constitutionality of legislation banning a majority party from ramming through a hotly contested bill, and an anti-graft law that bars the members of civil agencies, private educational institutions and the media from giving and receiving free meals, presents or monetary gifts respectively worth 30,000 won , 50,000 won and 100,000 won or higher. But she upheld the adultery charge that was ruled unconstitutional in a 7-2 vote in 2015, saying it helps protect the social system of marriage based on monogamy, as well as the family community. Following former court President Park Han-chul’s retirement last January, the takeover of the top job placed Lee in the nationwide spotlight. But it also brought immense political and public pressure from both camps for and against the impeachment, with Park supporters circulating her home address online and churning out threats to attack her. Lee will continue to be guarded by police around the clock even after her retirement, due to persistent safety concerns. Nonetheless, she left a crucial mark in the country’s history at the doorstep of her retirement with the historic ruling. The hair roller episode shored up her image as a hardworking, devoted professional, in contrast to the disgraced former president whose perfect hairdo at a delayed public appearance during the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking incurred the wrath of the people. Delivering the impeachment verdict, Lee called for reconciliation and an end to the deepening national divide, stressing the significance of the rule of law as a “value that must be protected in any case.” “We hope this will serve as a foundation for us to put an end to a further split in public opinion and take the path of reconciliation and healing.” By Shin Hyon-hee","friday acting chief justice ,11 on friday acting ,on friday acting chief ,courthouse earlier than usual ,on friday acting","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Jung - mi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69887602  0.26908585

Its judgment was that Park’s wrongdoings -- ranging from leaking confidential state documents and complicity in Choi’s crimes to noncooperation with investigation -- were reasons enough to immediately expel her from power.The judiciary, however, took a passive approach to Park’s other charges, especially with regards to the controversy that she neglected her duty as state leader on the day of the Sewol ferry sinking tragedy back in 2014. Choi Soon-sil “The negative aftermath of the president’s acts is so grave that the benefits of her expulsion are overwhelmingly greater ,” said acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi, in delivering the court’s written sentence Friday.The nation’s top court unanimously ruled on the day that Park should be expelled from her elected post, upholding the impeachment resolution filed by the National Assembly late last year.“Park’s breach of the Constitution and of the law is a betrayal to the people’s trust and therefore may not be tolerated in terms of constitutional protection,” the presiding justice said.The court’s announcement came after it looked into the allegations that Park allowed her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil -- now renamed as Choi Seo-won -- to meddle in state affairs and make illicit profits by using her high-profile connections.By ordering civil servants and presidential officials to assist in Choi’s businesses, Park abused her presidential status and powers, and therefore violated the Constitution, as well as the Civil Service Act and the Public Servants’ Ethics Act, according to the court.Her assistance in extorting funds from local conglomerates to establish two dubious foundations controlled by Choi infringed on the corresponding companies’ freedom of business management, the acting chief justice added.In short, the eight-member court acknowledged most of Park’s charges related to her confidante. Choi is currently under trial over her criminal charges, along with a number of former presidential aides. The court’s announcement also came in line with the special prosecutor team’s conclusion earlier to book Park as accomplice to Choi’s bribery and over her abuse of power. The decision of the court, however, holds no direct influence on the state prosecutors’ ongoing investigation.“Not only did Park thoroughly conceal Choi’s meddling in state affairs, but she also consistently denied the given allegations and lashed out at those who raised suspicions, thus making it difficult for the legislation and the media to keep a monitoring watch ,” Lee said.Such illicit acts by the former president were in clear breach of representative democracy and the rule of law, the court asserted, before announcing Park’s expulsion.But in contrast to its firm stance over the collusion between Park and Choi, the court took a prudent approach to other charges.The most controversial among the dismissed agendas was Park’s alleged negligence of duty as state chief on April 16 2014, the day of the Sewol ferry tragedy.Park had come under fire for supposedly staying in her residence, instead of the presidential office building, on the day of the accident which left more than 300 dead or missing. While her absence on that day was never fully explained to the skeptical public, Park constantly denied suggestions that she had gotten her hair done and underwent cosmetic surgeries during those mystery seven hours.“Park was under the responsibility to properly exercise her rights so that the state may fully protect the people’s lives and physical safety,” Lee said in the ruling.“But this does not directly obligate her to directly participate in rescue activities in emergency situations.”Also, a president’s constitutional duty to perform the given role “in good faith” is too abstract a reason to justify an impeachment, she added.“As tragic as the Sewol accident was, Park’s performance of duty on that day is not subject to the impeachment judgment.”But two of the justices, while agreeing that the issue was not reason for impeachment, added some words about Park’s response to the tragedy.“If Park had made more effort, she would have been able to grasp the seriousness of the Sewol accident by 10 a.m. at the latest,” said Kim Yi-soo and Lee Jin-sung in a concurring opinion.“Her claim that she only realized the full gravity of the situation at 3 p.m. is unacceptable.”The fact that she had continued to stay in her residence for several more hours after receiving the initial report shows that Park did not pay due attention to the case, they claimed.The court also dismissed the former state chief’s alleged abuse of rights to appoint public servants and infringement upon the freedom of the media, citing the lack of evidence.The Constitutional Court has often been seen as conservative in its key decisions, hesitating to make radical social changes by overturning conventional systems.There had been concerns that the court might have tilted toward the conservative state chief as five of the eight-member bench were classified as right-leaning.Observers had pointed out that a conservative propensity had led the court to agree on dissolving the Unified Progressive Party in 2014, acknowledging its pro-North Korea doctrine and conspiracy to overthrow the South Korean administration.However, the court reached a rare unanimity in ruling Park out of power, a decision which is to call for an earlier-than-elected presidential election within the next 60 days. Pundits say that May 9 is a plausible date.By Bae Hyun-jung","ousted former president colluded ,leaking confidential state documents ,that park wrongdoings ,an ousted former president ,to impeach an incumbent","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park ’s', 'Choi ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37620836  0.42743397

He has been in custody since last month.Samsung Group heir Lee Jae-yong The special probe team suspects that Lee gave or promised 43.3 billion won  in kickbacks to Park's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the government's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015.The business merger was seen as critical to the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.Special prosecutors viewed Samsung's donation of 20.4 billion won in 2015 to two sports and culture foundations controlled by Choi as bribes.Lee has consistently insisted that Samsung's donations to Mir and K Sport foundations were made customarily in compliance with government requests, while its financial support for Choi and her family was forced by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.His lawyers repeated the same claims of innocence throughout the opening hearing.The lawyers said Lee's instructions to group executives following his one-on-one meetings in 2015 and 2016 with President Park remained unclear. They urged special prosecutors from resorting to presumptions in handling Lee's case. Lee's lawyers also raised questions over the participation of former prosecutor members of the special counsel team in the court hearing, saying the tenure of the special prosecutors already expired at the end of last month.The first hearing was finished after one hour amid fierce confrontation between lawyers and prosecutors.The Seoul district court is expected to give its ruling in late May.","in seoul on thursday ,heir denies all criminal ,corruption scandal involving president ,samsung heir denies all ,denies all criminal charges","['Samsung Group', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun', 'Seoul', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.55497772  0.43439931

Park is not expected to attend the hearing, which will be televised live from the main courtroom. Lee Jung-mi , acting chief of the Constitutional Court, arrives at the court in Seoul on March 9, 2017, one day before the court will announce its ruling on the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. If the court upholds the impeachment, Park will be permanently removed from office, and South Korea is required to hold a presidential election within 60 days. Local pundits predict the election will fall on May 9.She would also become the first South Korean president to be ousted by impeachment.If the court rejects her impeachment, Park will be immediately reinstated to serve out her term through February and the election will be held in December as scheduled.There are eight justices currently deliberating on the president's impeachment after Chief Justice Park Han-chul retired in January upon completing his term. Park's ouster requires the approval of at least six of them.The eight justices have held deliberations almost every day since the final hearing on Feb. 27 to gather their opinions and write draft rulings both for and against the impeachment.It is unknown whether the justices have already reached their verdict, but they are expected to meet again later in the day to make final adjustments to the rulings.Then, they may meet one last time Friday morning to cast their votes before Lee reads out the verdict, according to sources with knowledge of the proceedings.The scandal has prompted millions of South Koreans to take to the streets to demand Park's ouster or reinstatement.It also led to the indictment of 30 people suspected of involvement in the crimes, including Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong.Park was named an accomplice to Choi in taking bribes from the nation's top conglomerate in exchange for business favors. She has not been indicted, though, as a sitting president is immune from criminal prosecution.If she is unseated, she will lose that immunity and face prosecutorial questioning and possibly arrest. Skepticism remains, however, over whether such prospects are likely.","park impeachment the constitutional ,thursday as the justices ,her to extort millions ,rule on park impeachment ,on park impeachment","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Samsung G']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19296031 -0.01413177

The court has been reviewing the impeachment to determine whether to permanently oust or reinstate Park, with the ruling expected to be made no later than Monday.If the court follows past practice, it will announce the date of its ruling about three days in advance, which in the case of the impeachment would be Wednesday.Dozens of pro-Park activists shouted their opposition to the impeachment outside the court, claiming parliament's impeachment resolution was an ""illegal con game"" that should be dismissed entirely.Kim Pyung-woo, an attorney who defended the president during earlier hearings, called the trial void as long as the court has a vacancy on its nine-member bench. He demanded again that the court delay its ruling and open additional hearings until the vacancy is filled.The deliberations have been conducted by eight justices since Chief Justice Park Han-chul retired in January upon completing his term.

The Seoul Central District Court is now hearing Choi’s case in which she is charged with bribery and abuse of authority, among others. Choi, Park’s friend of 40 years, is suspected of extorting donations from local firms including Samsung Group and siphoning off the money for her personal gain. If the court accepts the petition, the court can refer the case to the Constitutional Court. While it deliberates on Choi’s claim, the trial will be suspended. The counsel team wrapped up its probe on Feb. 28, naming President Park an accomplice to Choi in receiving bribes from local firms. The president is now awaiting a decision on whether she will be removed from office, with the ruling expected Friday or early next week. Choi has also claimed that the special counsel forcibly questioned her and abused her rights, calling it “undemocratic.”Choi’s petition corresponds to President Park’s stance, which claims the special counsel was “politically-motivated” in the first place.

The counsel’s team -- the largest in South Korean history -- wrapped up its 70-day investigation into President Park on Feb. 28, handing its findings to state prosecutors. It has indicted a total of 30, including Choi, Lee, and some of Park’s former aides. The counsel booked President Park as a criminal suspect, but did not take any further action, as the sitting president has immunity to criminal liability.  Independent counsel Park Young-soo speaks during a press conference at the special prosecutor's office in Seoul on Monday, to announce the results of its 90-day investigation of President Park Geun-hye, her confidante and aides. The presidential office protested immediately, calling the findings a work of “imagination” and questioning the political neutrality of the special counsel. Samsung denied any bribery.The connection of President Park, Choi and Samsung has been the focal point of the team’s sweeping investigation into the scandal, which has consumed Korea since October and led to the president’s impeachment by the parliament. The probe concluded that the president helped Choi found the Mir and K Sports foundations and collaborated with her to extort 77.4 billion won  from conglomerates, including Samsung, in the name of donations. Both entities are suspected to be covers for channeling money to Choi. The counsel said part of the money given by Samsung should be seen as bribes, as they were offered with the purpose of winning Park’s support for a disputed merger between two group affiliates -- Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries. The merger, seen as a step designed to help Samsung’s heir apparent tighten his control of the group, was given crucial support by the National Pension Service, a major C&T; shareholder, which voted in favor of the deal despite opposition from minor shareholders.Lee is in detention awaiting trial, along with four other Samsung executives. The counsel also said the Park administration’s blacklisting of cultural figures was “a systematic crime” conducted under the instruction of the president herself. Seven have been indicted in relation to the list, which was used to discriminate against artists and cultural entities deemed unfavorable to the conservative president. They include former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun.The multifaceted probe had also looked into the admissions fraud surrounding Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra, President Park’s secret medical treatment from unauthorized doctors as well as her use of a borrowed-name phone, among others. The counsel had sought to extend the probe period to investigate several remaining suspicions but was not granted an extension by acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. The special counsel’s team will not dissolve at least for a few months in order to lead the trials of those indicted. The public prosecution said Monday that their investigators will pick up where the counsel has left off. Lee Yeong-ryeol, head of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, will once again lead a team of 33 designated state prosecutors, which had initiated the probe into Park’s scandal before the appointment of the independent counsel last December. Key subjects of their investigation include Park’s former presidential senior adviser for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo as well as local conglomerates SK and Lotte, which the counsel had failed to properly investigate.

Independent Counsel Park Young-soo's team announced the results of its probe into the massive presidential scandal, claiming Park is a suspected accomplice to her friend Choi Soon-sil in taking bribes from Samsung Group's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong. The investigators also linked her to an allegedly illegal blacklisting of cultural figures. In this file photo taken on Oct. 25, 2016, South Korean President Park Geun-hye closes her eyes after making a public apology over the leak of some confidential documents, including presidential speech drafts, to her confidant Choi Soon-sil to get advice from her at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. Her lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha rebutted all the allegations denouncing the special prosecutors as ""politically biased.""  In a statement released immediately after the probe team's final press briefing, he said the independent counsel announced the probe result belatedly, ""only to influence the impeachment trial on the president."" The independent counsel team finished the probe last Tuesday. President Park is awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on her impeachment after the parliament voted to oust her in December.The ruling Liberty Korea Party also said it is worried about the probe team's announcement ""based on biased public opinion.""Independent Counsel Park earlier said the delay of the announcement of the results was due to time constraints.""The decision not to extend the investigation period came just one day before it expired,"" he said. ""We had to finalize our indictments of figures including Lee Jae-yong and Choi Soon-sil and prepare documents to be handed over to the state prosecution. It was just physically impossible to announce the probe results on the last day of the investigation."" Lawyer Yoo said Park has no knowledge of a contract between Samsung and Choi and that she was not involved in creating or managing the alleged blacklist.

The top court’s eight justices are currently deliberating on the 13 charges leveled against Park by the parliament which voted on Dec. 9 to sack the conservative state chief over a scandal involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. The judges will decide if the president breached the country’s Constitution and laws and if the alleged violations are serious enough to warrant her removal. To gauge the seriousness of her misconduct, they will use two yardsticks -- whether she should be ousted for the sake of protecting the Constitution and whether the president has lost too much public trust to maintain her presidency. The Korea Herald takes a look at Park’s key charges and each party’s  arguments in the impeachment trial.  President Park Geun-hye. The main chargesIn her closing argument read by her legal representative, Park pleaded not guilty, saying she acted purely in the national interest and claiming no knowledge of any illegal activities conducted by her acquaintances, including Choi Soon-sil. The parliament’s representatives, however, insist that she extensively broke the Constitution and the laws, and that a permanent dismissal is unavoidable, as her betrayal of public trust and abuse of authority are simply too serious. - BriberyOne of the key charges against Park is that she played a major role in extorting donations worth 77 billion won  from local firms for the K-Sports and Mir foundations her friend Choi allegedly controlled. Park insists that she helped establish the two foundations only to promote culture and sports and she never coerced companies to make donations. “I have never received any bribes or gave any illicit favors to businessmen, including Samsung Group’s Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong,” she said in the closing argument. “If I knew anything about irregularities involving my acquaintances including Choi Soon-sil, I would have sternly punished them before anybody else.” The parliament, however, claims that Park was deeply involved in running the foundations and extorting donations and helped Choi pursue personal benefits using paper companies. “President Park, along with Choi, made decisions on the amounts of corporate donations, personnel appointments at the foundations and other organizational matters and gave orders to An Chong-bum  as she was told by Choi,” the parliament’s lawyer Hwang Jeong-geun said.- Violation of the rule of law and popular sovereigntyThe parliament accuses the president undermining popular sovereignty and representative democracy by letting her associates influence key decisions in running the country.President Park claims that she had overly trusted Choi Soon-sil, who she said had been by her side for 40 years and helped her with private matters like buying clothes and goods. “I should have not lowered my guard against Choi Soon-sil,” she said. “But it is not at all true that I give confidential documents about state policies, personnel appointments and diplomacy to Choi Soon-sil and let her meddle in state affairs,” she said, adding it is “unthinkable” to consult with her in running the state. But the parliament argues that ex-presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong leaked confidential documents to Choi under Park’s order, giving as evidence 171 documents Jeong emailed to Choi between March 2013 and December 2014.Leaking the documents was not one-off or accidental, it was “systematic and intentional,” the parliament claims.“It is beyond simply seeking the opinion of a close friend. She used her authority, endowed by the public through an election, through unofficial channel and abetted Choi’s manipulation of power,” the parliament’s lawyer said. - Abuse of presidential authority “I am in charge of appointing officials at government posts. I never named anyone at the recommendation of Choi,” Park said, denying the claims that she arbitrarily ordered the dismissal of officials at the Culture Ministry who did not give favors to Choi’s family.But the Hwang argued that the dismissals, of working-level officials, were made without proper justification, and that the only apparent reason was their interference in “Choi’s illicit profit-making activities.” He added that Park also forcibly ordered the resignation of Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong for refusing to cooperate in creating a blacklist of liberal artists.“President Park condoned Choi’s meddling in personnel appointments and let her place people under her influence at key posts in the culture and sports sectors to help her pursue personal gain,” Hwang said, citing TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek, ex-Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok and ex-Vice Culture Kim Chong, all allegedly recommended by Choi. - Violation of duty to protect people’s lives President Park argues that she had been continuously briefed about the situation at the time of the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry on April, 16, 2014, the nation’s biggest maritime disaster that claimed more than 300 lives.“I ordered the chief of national security and the chief of maritime police to do their best to save the passengers and prevent further casualties multiple times,” Park said. “It is not true at all that I received plastic surgery or medical treatment at the presidential residence.“But I waited for a report on the rescue operation because I thought excessive intervention in the field situation by a president, who is not a disaster or rescue expert, would not help the operation at all.”The parliament argues that this amounts to Park offloading her presidential responsibility to save people’s lives onto the maritime police and other relevant ministries.“President Park thought that it was the maritime police’s job to save the people in danger, not the president’s,” the parliament’s representative said. “We still don’t know what Park did on the day of the sinking of the ferry. What we know is that she did not do what she had to do.“It was 8:52 a.m. when authorities first learned about the Sewol accident. The presidential secretariat knew it from media reports at 9:19 a.m. and the presidential national security secretary shared the news at 9:24 a.m.“The last person escaped from the ferry at 10:19 a.m., which means more passengers could have been saved before the ferry capsized if there were proper rescue operations during the 87 minutes.” The Constitutional Court has expressed dissatisfaction with Park’s account of events, saying she has failed to give details on what she was doing as she was being briefed, as well as when and how she first learned about the accident.- Violation of press freedom One of the charges is Park’s alleged crackdown on the press. She is accused of exerting undue influence to sack a president of a local daily which has reported on a document revealing Choi’s husband Jeong Yoon-hoe’s covert meddling in state affairs in 2014.“I only asked for a thorough investigation into how the presidential office’s secret documents were leaked. I did not restrict the Segye Daily’s reporting or intend to violate the press freedom,” Park said. “I have neither ordered my secretaries to demand the Segye Daily dismiss its president Cho Jan-kyu nor condoned it.”Jeong was one of Park’s longest-serving confidants who assisted Park when she entered politics in 1998 and was her chief secretary in 2002 when Park founded her own political party. “Since the Segye Daily reported on Jeong’s interference in state affairs, the presidential secretary’s office discussed a plan to attack the paper by mobilizing the prosecution and tax audit agency,” the parliament said, adding such action to clamp down on the paper was under her orders.Lingering dispute over impeachment process Aside from the charges, another contentious issue is the legitimacy of the impeachment trial itself. Park’s lawyers, after its efforts to delay the trial process were thwarted by justices, took issue with the political neutrality of the Constitutional Court itself in the last few hearings. Amid a sharp divide among the public over Park’s impeachment, complaints about the fairness of the trial and legality of the impeachment process, critics say, could lead Park and her supporters not to accept the court’s verdict, should it be not in their favor. Park’s lawyers argued that it is unfair for her to be judged by the current eight justices, not nine. The court now has eight justices following the retirement of ex-Chief Justice Park Han-chul. “ additional vacancy of justices during the trial played a role in rushing the proceedings, which restricted President Park’s defense rights,” Park’s lawyer Lee Dong-heup said, with another lawyer going as far as to call for a retrial. But the parliament points out that the Constitutional Court Act stipulates that trial can proceed and a verdict can be made with the attendance of a minimum of seven justices.Park’s defense team also claim that the passage of the impeachment was based on fabricated evidence and biased media reports. “Evidence submitted to the court were illegally collected and fabricated. We have never seen the tablet PC in reality. We cannot agree to the court which accepted it as legitimate,” said Park’s lawyer Lee Joong-hwan, citing a tablet, supposedly owned by Choi Soon-sil and obtained by the prosecution, and An Chong-bum’s notebooks. A local cable TV’s reports on the tablet PC, which include presidential speeches and policy drafts Choi edited and Park’s private photos, triggered the scandal in late October. An’s handwritten notes detail Park’s instructions to An to collect specific amounts of donations from local conglomerates for the Mir and K-Sports foundations alleged to be under Choi’s control. “The parliament has passed the impeachment based on media reports as well as an indictment, in which President Park was named as a suspect, for Choi Soon-sil, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong and investigation result by the prosecution,” the parliament said.

It sought to extend the inquiry by another month to continue to look into unresolved issues, but faced a dead end due to acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn’s rejection and the ruling conservative party’s objection.During its term, the team had demanded for an arrest warrant for former Blue House official Woo on charges of abetting the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil in her meddling in state affairs. The request, however, was turned down by the court.“The investigation  had been ongoing for a while. It is just that we didn’t reveal the details until wrapping up the  blacklist case,” Park explained, in answer to questions on whether the team had taken too much time before closing in on Woo.The blacklist case, which referrs to the allegations that the government had been keeping a list of anti-government artists so as to keep watch on them and exclude them from favors, ended with the arrest of high-profile figures. Former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun were arrested, though the president’s connection was never fully proven in the process.Woo’s case is to be handed over to state prosecutors, who are expected to revive the former special investigation headquarters on Park’s corruption case.Concerns persist, however, that former senior prosecutor Woo may still hold influence over the organization, deterring officials from aggressively looking into his charges.By Bae Hyun-jung","gotten an arrest warrant ,the investigation into president ,woo arrest just needed ,former top presidential aide ,arrest warrant for former","['Park Geun', 'Civil Affairs Woo Byung - woo']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54276913  0.20235243

466,466,466,[News Analysis] Bribery charge key in Park probe,"The biggest point of dispute throughout the special investigation on President Park Geun-hye’s corruption allegations was whether or not the state chief could be held liable for bribery charges.If proven, it is this offense that may confirm the key suspicion that she indeed abused her powers as state chief to confer benefits upon her civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil.The intricate monetary connection is also what li...","The biggest point of dispute throughout the special investigation on President Park Geun-hye’s corruption allegations was whether or not the state chief could be held liable for bribery charges.If proven, it is this offense that may confirm the key suspicion that she indeed abused her powers as state chief to confer benefits upon her civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil.The intricate monetary connection is also what links the Choi scandal to an extensive political agenda, involving not only the president but a number of high-profile public officials and conglomerate leaders.On Tuesday, the special team led by independent counsel Park Young-soo indicted Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and heir apparent of Samsung Group, on charges of handing over some 43.3 billion won  in bribes to President Park and Choi.It also booked the president on related charges and set to handing the case back to state prosecutors. Park, as incumbent president, holds immunity to criminal indictment, a right which is to vanish if the court approves her impeachment.  President Park Geun-hye The bribery allegations involving Park, Choi and Lee are that Park exerted power on Choi’s behalf, while Lee offered benefits to Choi.This three-way connection is also an important factor for the conservative camp and Park’s supporters in their claims that the president made no personal profits during the process.“We had no choice but to offer support  due to President Park’s unconcealed pressure,” Samsung chief Lee said repeatedly during the investigation.He therefore admitted the wrongdoings of the president and her associate, while denying his own involvement in bribery. Lee’s claim was that he was a victim in the power game, not a counterpart seeking benefits in return.Park, too, denied any compensatory relations with Lee or any of the other conglomerate chiefs, asserting that her push for funds was only for the sake of public interest. “I have never accepted any illicit request ,” the president said through a written statement, submitted by her lawyers to the Constitutional Court on Monday.She also repeatedly denied having any knowledge of Choi’s influence-peddling, describing herself as being “betrayed” by her longtime friend.While the president faces a number of other charges, such as receiving illegal cosmetic treatment on the day of the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014, those alleged faults are largely considered insufficient in proving her deficiency as state chief.There is also the ongoing trail involving suspicions that the government kept a list of anti-government artists, but investigators have not yet succeeded in proving its link to the president. Former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun were earlier arrested on their involvement in this blacklist. For such reasons, the bribery charge was deemed a key reason why the independent counsel team decided to hand over the case to prosecutors -- so Park may face criminal indictment and sanctions, if she is removed from power. The court’s final ruling on her impeachment trial is expected to be delivered on March 10 or 13.By Bae Hyun-jung","analysis bribery charge key ,news analysis bribery charge ,bribery charge key in ,geun hye corruption allegations ,liable for bribery charges",['Park Geun - hye'],4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.02005559  0.11424283

467,467,467,What now for Park’s impeachment trial?,"The countdown to the ruling on the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye has begun, as the Constitutional Court heard the final arguments of Park and the parliament on Monday.

The court reviewing the legality of Park’s impeachment held its first closed-door session Tuesday to deliberate on whether Park has broken the law and the Constitution and whether the violations are serious enough to impeach her.President Park Geun-hye Q. What process do the justices go through to reach a verdict?The eight justices are expected to hold a closed-door session to review all the evidence, statements, more than 50,000 pages of investigation reports and testimony made by 25 witnesses through the 17 hearings and exchange their opinions every day.Through the discussion the justices will write up of two versions of the verdict -- for and against the impeachment.For security reasons, they are expected to vote on whether to uphold or reject the impeachment at the last minute, right before making a ruling. The sessions will take place in a conference room on the third floor at the Constitutional Court, which will strictly deny entrance to anyone other than the eight justices and go through security checks on a daily basis to prevent wiretapping.Q. When will the verdict come?“We will inform both sides of the date of the ruling,” said the acting chief justice during the final hearing. The court usually announces the date of the ruling three or four days in advance. It is expected to take two weeks for the bench to deliberate on the case and write up a verdict after the final hearing, as based on the case of former President Roh Moo-hyun. In the Roh case, the final hearing was held on April 30 and the verdict was delivered on May 14. There is a general expectation that the ruling will be made on March 9 or 10 or even 13, the day acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi steps down.Q. Why before March 13?The originally nine-judge court, which now has eight justices following the end of the term of ex-Chief Justice Park Han-chul on Jan. 31, will have another vacancy, as acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi’s term is set to expire March 13. The Constitutional Court has accelerated the proceedings to avoid the worst scenario -- the seven justices, the minimum required to make a ruling, deciding on whether to unseat or reinstate Park.The ruling to confirm the impeachment of Park needs approval from at least six justices. Former Chief Justice Park stressed the need for a fair and prompt ruling on Park’s impeachment, saying an additional vacancy on the bench could lead to a “distorted ruling.” Q. What about the security of the justices?As the ruling on President Park’s impeachment is approaching, tensions have heightened inside and outside the courtroom in recent days among pro-Park and anti-Park factions. During the final hearing held Monday, some of Park’s supporters, mostly senior citizens, created a ruckus, demanding the court dismiss Park’s impeachment. Police stepped up security around the court and dispatched officers to guard the eight justices. A 24-year-old man was recently booked after hinting at his willingness to kill acting Chief Justice Lee. He said on a fan site for Park: “Lee Jung-mi should be removed before the ruling. I will have no regret even though I die now if I can save this country.” Q. What will happen after the verdict?If the court upholds Park’s impeachment, President Park will be removed from office immediately. Under the Constitution, the country would be required to hold a presidential election within 60 days. If the court rejects the impeachment, Park will be reinstated as president. The presidential election then would be held in December as originally scheduled. Q. What are the charges against Park?The justices will review the 13 charges leveled against Park to see whether her alleged violations of the law and the Constitution are serious enough to throw her out of office.The charges include that Park let her close friend Choi Soon-sil, who holds no government post, meddle in state affairs to help her pursue personal gains and that Park colluded with Choi to extort donations from local conglomerates for the K-Sports and Mir foundations. She is also accused of failing to protect citizens during the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014, which left more than 300 dead or missing.By Ock Hyun-ju","for park impeachment trial ,session tuesday to deliberate ,impeachment trial the countdown ,to impeach her president ,park impeachment trial","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'Par']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09367346 -0.05127785

From left are independent counsel Park Young-soo, investigation team leader Yoon Seok-youl, and assistants Park Choong-kun, Lee Kyu-chul and Lee Yong-bok. The charges against Park are expected to be handed over to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office for further inquiry, he explained.The suspended state chief, who is currently awaiting the Constitutional Court’s final ruling on her impeachment, still has constitutional immunity to criminal prosecution.But with the state prosecution taking on the case, she may now face summons once she is permanently removed from power. The court decision on whether to oust Park is expected to come between March 10 and 14.Investigators also confirmed they will send 17 more suspects to trial, over their alleged connection to the presidential corruption case. The list included key Samsung officials, as well as Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee. This puts the total number of indicted suspects indicted at 30, the largest-ever since South Korea first introduced an independent counsel system in 1999. As for the detailed results of its past 90 days of investigation, the team is to make an official report Monday, Lee said.The billionaire heir to the Samsung Group is now indicted on charges including funneling tens of millions of dollars to nonprofit foundations run by Choi in exchange for political favors that would help him tighten his control over the company.The group’s controversial merger between two affiliates in 2015 was allegedly made with the help of the state-run National Pension Service, the largest shareholder of Samsung C&T;, which is one of the affiliates. Other charges against Lee include having provided -- or pledged to provide -- a total of 43 billion won  to Choi’s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, in the form of sponsoring her equestrian career in Germany. In connection to the investigation, four other senior executives of Samsung, including corporate strategy office Vice Chairman Choi Ji-sung and President Chang Choong-ki, were indicted on the same day.Also on the arraignment are the so-called “secret doctors” of President Park, including the general practitioner Kim Young-jae and former presidential consulting physician Kim Sang-man -- both of whom are accused of secretly performing cosmetic treatments on the president -- the former President of Ewha Womans University Choi Kyung-hee and other professors for allegedly giving favors to Choi’s daughter in university admission. As for Choi, who was indicted by state prosecutors last November on charges of abuse of power, coercion and attempted fraud, the probe team said it has added more charges against her, including taking bribes and concealing criminal proceeds. In the meantime, the special prosecutor’s probe into Park’s former aide Woo Byung-woo still remains unresolved, though it is ready to be handed over to state prosecutors from Tuesday. Woo had allegedly abetted -- or at least condoned -- Choi’s attempted fraud and abuse of power while serving as a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016. Following massive street rallies amid South Korea’s biggest political corruption scandal, President Park approved the launch of independent counsel Park Young-soo’s team last December before she was suspended of powers. In addition to Tuesday’s indictment, the probe team had indicted 13 high-profile figures, including Choi, former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Choo Yoon-sun.

Four other senior executives -- Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung and President Chang Choong-ki from the group's future planning headquarters and President Park Sang-jin and senior executive Hwang Sung-soo from the electronics giant -- will stand trial without detention.Following the announcement, Samsung said Choi and Chang resigned from their posts. The group said it will abolish the future strategy department, a de facto group control tower, and its affiliates will run independently.Choi Soon-sil, the woman at the center of the scandal, will additionally be charged with bribery on the same day. She has been standing trial over a series of other alleged irregularities committed with the president's former secretaries.The spokesman Lee said they will seek to have Choi forfeit her illegally earned assets. He declined to comment on whether the property of Park, who was named an accomplice in Choi's alleged wrongdoing, will also be subject to seizure.A former university president suspected of offering favors to Choi's daughter and a doctor believed to have provided unauthorized medical treatments to Park will also be indicted.A total of 17 suspects will be officially charged by the probe team on the final day of the investigation, according to the spokesman. Two of them include Choi and An Chong-bum, who are already standing trial based on an investigation from state prosecutors. There are 13 other suspects that have been charged since the launch of the special counsel team in December.The investigation team was given 70 days with another 20 days preparation to look into a broad range of alleged irregularities committed by President Park and her friend Choi.

VX is a deadly compound banned around the world as a chemical weapon. This picture compiled with photos released by the European news photo agency EPA on Feb. 22, 2017, shows three North Korean suspects who are at large in Malaysia in connection to the death of the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Hyon Kwang-song , 44, is the second secretary of the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The next photos show a 30-year-old man identified as Ri Ji-u  and Kim Uk-il , a 37-year-old employee at Air Koryo, the North's flag carrier. Malaysia's foreign ministry is believed to have sent an official document requesting the North Korean mission to cooperate in the investigation as Hyon and Kim are wanted for questioning, according to the source.Both are thought to be inside the embassy, with Hyon having diplomatic immunity.""Despite Malaysia's request, it is very unlikely that North Korea would cooperate with the inquiry,"" the source said.Malaysian police earlier said that eight North Koreans are suspected of being involved in the death of Kim Jong-nam, the first son of late former leader Kim Jong-il.They arrested one North Korean man while looking for three others, including Hyon and Kim. Four others are believed to have escaped to Pyongyang after fleeing Malaysia on the day of the attack.South Korea earlier said that it is highly likely that North Korea is behind the latest death.Seoul's unification ministry on Monday slammed Pyongyang for using VX nerve agent, which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations.""We strongly condemned North Korea for using a chemical weapon against a civilian,"" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing.

""Such a behavior would be based on its calculation that it can get what it wants by stoking fears and terrors.""Malaysia said Sunday that Kim died within 20 minutes of being poisoned with VX.North Korea blamed Malaysia for pressing ahead with conducting an ""illegal and immoral"" autopsy on Kim's body. It claimed that Malaysia colluded with South Korea on the probe.A diplomatic row is deepening between Malaysia and North Korea as the Southeast Asian country got angry at Pyongyang's ""baseless"" claim over the collusion. There is growing speculation that Malaysia will cut off its diplomatic ties with Pyongyang.Pyongyang and Kuala Lumpur have maintained diplomatic ties for more than 40 years and each have an embassy in the other country.Malaysia is one of the few countries that North Koreans can travel without visas.","said monday malaysian police ,probe into kim death ,monday malaysian police said ,monday malaysian police ,police said last week","['Malaysia', 'the north Korean Embassy', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'malaysian', 'Hyon Kwang - song', 'Kim Uk - il']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37009773  0.52403849

472,472,472,Park will not show up at final hearing: lawmaker,"President Park Geun-hye is not likely to attend the Constitutional Court’s final hearing Monday, which means she would end her impeachment trial without her direct testimony, lawmakers said Sunday. The disgraced president has so far been absent from all of her impeachment trials while avoding face-to-face questioning by the special investigation team. President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)“(President Park) would not w...","President Park Geun-hye is not likely to attend the Constitutional Court’s final hearing Monday, which means she would end her impeachment trial without her direct testimony, lawmakers said Sunday. The disgraced president has so far been absent from all of her impeachment trials while avoding face-to-face questioning by the special investigation team. President Park Geun-hye “ would not want to face questions from the justices or the plaintiff, as she can make her defense through a written statement,” said Rep. Kweon Seong-dong of the Bareun Party.Rep. Kwon is the chairman of the parliamentary impeachment committee and therefore the plaintiff representative in Park’s impeachment trial.The parliamentary committee members and their lawyers held a joint meeting at the National Assembly on Sunday to draft their final plea and to provide against Park’s possible actions.The court earlier requested Park to show up at court and confirm her stance by Sunday.But the president did not attend the first pleading held on Feb. 3 and has persistently delayed her decision on showing up at the final pleading. According to the Constitutional Court Act, the defendant in an impeachment case is under no obligation to appear in court. Even former President Roh Moo-hyun did not attend his impeachment trial in 2004.Despite the pressing timeline and mounting speculations on the president’s nonattendance, Cheong Wa Dae and Park’s lawyers refrained from confirming Park’s stance Sunday.As for the speculations that Park’s lawyers may also boycott Monday’s pleading so as to cause further delays, the lawmaker claimed that such a move would be “meaningless.”“The court has questioned most of the witnesses requested by the defendants, so there is now no reason for  representatives to miss out on the final pleading or to resign en masse,” he said.“Nor will nonattendance or resignation  do any good to the defendant.”The lawmaker also made a detailed rebuttal of the claim made by Park’s lawyers and a number of the members of the ruling conservative Liberty Korea Party that the entire impeachment process was inappropriate.“When it comes to presidential impeachment, the sooner the process  the better,” Rep. Kweon said, dismissing protests that the trial was handled in a rushed manner. “A whole three months from the passage of the impeachment resolution until the court’s final ruling is not so short a period.”He also denied arguments that the impeachment judgment should be made in a complete nine-judge system. The Constitutional Court is currently operated in an eight-member system under the chairmanship of acting Justice Lee Jung-mi, due to the retirement of former Chief Justice Park Han-chul in late January.By Bae Hyun-jung","sunday the disgraced president ,end her impeachment trial ,court final hearing monday ,final hearing lawmaker president ,impeachment trial without her","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.56569272  0.34625068

She is known to be carefully reviewing the move,"" said a presidential aide.The top court is examining the legality of the impeachment motion following the eruption of the scandal centered on Park and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Park is alleged to have colluded with Choi in extorting money and favors from local conglomerates. She is also suspected of allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs. The president has rejected all such claims as being false and exaggerated.The court, now with an eight-member bench, is widely expected to deliver a ruling by March 13 when acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi is set to retire. Her departure will create another vacancy on the nine-member bench, with former Chief Justice Park Han-chul retiring last month.The court earlier asked Park's lawyers to reveal whether she would appear at the final hearing by Sunday. Some political watchers cautiously said that she could reveal whether to attend early Monday.The ruling Liberty Korea Party, meanwhile, raised questions about the fairness of the eight-member bench, claiming a new judge should be appointed.The court, however, dismissed reports Friday that a new justice needs to be named to the bench, saying Park's impeachment trial will move forward within the preset time frame.","final impeachment hearing president ,last argument session monday ,impeachment hearing president park ,her lawyers said sunday ,her impeachment trial slated","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Yonhap)""Park']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01566218 0.38378465 0.44812337],KH디지털2,Politics,2,2017,"sunday some political watchers cautiously ,the last argument session monday ,week her lawyers said sunday ,her impeachment trial slated for ,december by parliament over corruption","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Choi', 'Lee Jung - mi', 'Han', 'Park', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Park']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.01566218 0.38378465 0.44812337]

Special prosecutors questioned Lee, who is now in custody, on Sunday for the second straight day on allegation that he gave or promised to offer billions of won worth of bribes to Park's jailed friend Choi Soon-sil in return for business favors.On Feb. 17, Lee was formally arrested amid suspicion that the kickback to Choi amounted to bribes to Park. Sunday's questioning marked the fifth one since his arrest. Lee has denied the allegation.The president is accused by the independent counsel of ordering her health minister to press the state pension fund to back a merger of two Samsung units, a key step for the smooth management succession to Lee from his ailing father Lee Kun-hee.The deadline for the special inquiry is set for the end of this month if Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn does not approve an extension. Hwang is likely to clarify his stance over the deadline extension on Monday.The number of suspects indicted for involvement in the scandal is expected to surpass 20, the largest-ever since 1999 when the country first introduced an independent counsel system.In December last year, the National Assembly voted to impeach Park over the scandal which has rocked the country for months and unleashed weekly rallies against her.The Constitutional Court is reviewing the legality of the impeachment motion and plans to listen to final arguments on Monday.As the deadline for the independent counsel's investigation probe is nearing its end, the possibility is growing that the special prosecutors will fail to conduct face-to-face questioning of Park over the scandal.The president earlier vowed to cooperate with the investigators' inquiry, but their previous attempts to carry out the questioning of Park have been thwarted as investigators and Park's lawyers could not narrow the gap over how and when to conduct the inquiry.The team led by special counsel Park Young-soo said that it is likely to announce the conditional suspension of the indictment against Park when its probe ends without being extended.The move will lead local prosecutors to decide whether to indict her at a later date if she is ousted from power. Under the country's law, incumbent presidents have legal immunity from prosecution.Park's lawyers said that the president has yet to decide whether to appear at the final impeachment session.The Constitutional Court is widely seen as delivering a ruling by March 13 when acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi is set to retire.If Park is ousted, South Korea is required to hold a presidential election within 60 days. If she is reinstated, an election will be held in December as scheduled.","samsung heir over scandal ,prosecutors to indict samsung ,this week special prosecutors ,to indict samsung heir ,scandal this week special","['Samsung Group', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Electronics Co.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58690095  0.37430581

In 2015, the number of illegal riders stood at 42,289, paying about 1.5 billion won in fines.The most frequent tricks were bypassing the turnstiles without tagging a metro card, going through the special turnstile designed for the handicapped or tagging someone else’s transportation card.The rise was especially conspicuous in the number of those using the discount pass of a family member -- who is either aged 65 or above, a student or physically handicapped -- according to Seoul Metro.“While the number of those who hopped on a train without tagging a metro card seems to be diminishing, those who use someone else’s card to receive a price discount has largely gone up,” said the SMRT official. “Senior passes, only distributed to citizens 65 years or older, are frequently used by elderly people at a younger age, or even by their grandchildren.”Another subway official said it is physically difficult to crack down on such illegal riders, as it frequently leads to quarrels between subway staff and passengers.“Even when they are caught, many of the illegal riders refuse to give their personal information and even reproach subway staff members for levying fines on them,” a Seoul Metro official surnamed Park who works at City Hall station told The Korea Herald.“Clashes often break out as we are neither the police nor have the official right to interrogate passengers,” Park added.According to the Seoul Institute released report last year, 724 billion won worth of extra burden is needed each year to manage Seoul’s subway operations during times of congestion.To reduce the burden, Seoul’s subway operators should consider adopting a differential fare system, charging passengers more during peak times, the report suggested.By Kim Da-sol","combat rising illegal subway ,won million in fines ,814 passengers illegally hopped ,rising illegal subway rides ,42 814 passengers illegally","['Seoul City ’s', 'Seoul Metro', 'Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit', 'Subway Lines']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.33345109 0.01043763 0.14959359],Kim Da-sol,Social affairs,2,2017,"42 814 passengers illegally hopped ,almost billion won in fines ,814 passengers illegally hopped ,rise subway operators said friday ,than 42 814 passengers illegally","['Seoul City ’s', 'Seoul Metro', 'Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit', 'Subway Lines', 'Seoul Metro', 'SMRT', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Kim Da - sol']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.33345109 0.01043763 0.14959359]

The final hearing has been scheduled for Monday, after which justices are expected to take up to two weeks to write their opinions and deliver the ruling. Park, who was impeached in December over a corruption scandal centered on a close friend, has appeared to be trying to stall the proceedings by requesting a large number of witnesses and ignoring various deadlines set by the court. Her ouster requires the approval of at least six justices, and there are currently eight after one retired last month. Once Lee retires, Park will need only two justices on her side to be reinstated.The local daily JoongAng Ilbo reported that Supreme Court Chief Justice Yang Sung-tae plans to name Lee's successor after the final hearing, which could be as early as Tuesday.Park's lawyers welcomed the plan, saying the announcement weakened the court's argument that the trial should conclude by March 13. By law, the court has until early June to decide whether to oust or reinstate the president.""The Supreme Court's nomination of a successor brings a huge change to the impeachment trial,"" Son Bum-kyu, one of Park's attorneys, said in a phone call with Yonhap News Agency.

The court asked President Park to decide by Sunday whether she would make a closing statement at the final hearing scheduled for 2 p.m. on Monday, with Park’s lawyers reportedly having persuaded her to turn up and plead her innocence. President Park, who has been absent from the trial since it formally began on Jan. 3, is said to be seriously considering attending the final session in a last-ditch effort to defend herself. But she is allegedly worried about facing the embarrassment of being questioned by the parliament. Another option for her is to resign voluntarily before a verdict is reached in early March to avoid further disgrace and retain entitlements, including her pension as a former president, amid growing speculations the ruling is leaning towards upholding her impeachment.Earlier this week, Rep. Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of the ruling Liberty Korea Party, said in a radio interview the presidential office has reviewed the option of having the president resign voluntarily.Rep. Lee Choon-suak, a member of the parliamentary impeachment committee, said that the scenario for Park’s lawyers appears to be for her to resign one or two days ahead of the ruling to avoid an ouster through the legal process. The presidential office dismissed the rumors as “baseless.”The last option for Park seems to be questioning the fairness of the court proceedings and the bench, which critics say hints at her possible disobedience of the ruling against her. Park’s lawyers during Wednesday’s hearing called the court “biased” and slammed it for siding with the parliament. They went as far as calling Justice Kang Il-won another “head lawyer for the parliament,” and even asked the court to exclude him from the trial. Asked whether Park would accept the outcome of the impeachment trial, one of Park’s lawyers, Lee Joong-hwan, told reporters, “As the result is not out yet, we are not in a position to answer.”Whatever option Park chooses is no longer likely to affect the court proceedings.It usually takes about two weeks for the bench to hold a discussion, cast a vote and write up a ruling beyond the final hearing, boosting speculation the verdict will likely be made on March 9, 10 or even 13. Upon the ruling, the nation will get into full swing for the presidential election, which is to be held within 60 days, under the law. President Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9 over allegations she let her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil meddle in state affairs and colluded with her to extort donations from local conglomerates.The court, which now has eight justices following the departure of ex-Chief Justice Park Han-chul on Jan. 31, has picked up pace with the proceedings, as it will soon face an additional vacancy. The ruling to impeach Park needs approval from at least six of the current eight justices. President Park has been seen as trying to prolong the court proceedings, which critics have called an attempt to raise the chances of her removal from office. With the departure of the acting chief justice, Park would needs only two justices to side with her to regain her legitimacy as president.

Chances, however, remain slim as Hwang has persistently expressed disapproval on granting the extra period to the investigators. Rep. Chung Woo-taik , floor leader of the ruling Liberty Korea Party, walks past main opposition Democratic Party of Korea lawmakers urging for the extension of the investigation on President Park Geun-hye. The floor leaders of rival parties visited Parliamentary Speaker Chung Sye-kyun in the morning to discuss having the speaker exercise his authority and motion the revision bill of the Independent Counsel Law, so as to extend the investigation period from the current 70 days to 120 days.But they failed to reach a consensus, mostly due to resistance from the ruling Liberty Korea Party, the home party of the suspended president.Speaker Chung, too, is said to have reiterated his earlier claim that the current circumstances do not meet the prerequisite for a direct call for a full parliamentary vote, though he did add that the acting president needs to acknowledge the need to extend the investigation.As for the investigation team, it earlier submitted a request to the acting president to ask for a one-month extension in the investigation period, but was only faced with inaction from Hwang.“, we have not received any notification from Hwang,” said Lee Kyu-chul, the spokesperson representing the probe team, at a press briefing Thursday.Hwang’s apparent unwillingness to approve the request has received backlash from the opposition.“If Hwang does not give the approval, he would be violating his authority, which constitutes as grounds for impeachment by parliament,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the Democratic Party. As prospects of the extension to its term faded, the probe team looks set to wrap up its investigation with key allegations remaining unresolved. The lack of time also led the investigators to give up on carrying out a raid of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.After failing to seize and search the Blue House earlier this month, the team filed a lawsuit to the Seoul Administrative Court to nullify the presidential office’s rejection -- a case recently dismissed by the court.Faced with the nearing end of its tenure, the independent counsel’s team decided not to make an appeal against the court decision, its spokesperson told reporters. The key challenge, above all, is to summon the suspended president for a face-to-face questioning.“We are still in talks  over how to proceed with the questioning,” Lee said, implying that nothing has been decided yet on the schedule.

""I have no idea why such rumors keep surfacing when nobody  has ever discussed it.""Despite her aides' repeated denials, the rumors have persisted that Park could voluntarily bow out on certain conditions, namely a political deal to relieve her of any possible legal liability related to the scandal.The speculation was fanned by Rep. Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of the ruling Liberty Korea Party, last Monday when he called for a ""political solution,"" saying the incumbent leader's impeachment is a ""national misfortune.""Rep. Joo Ho-young, the floor leader of the Bareun Party, a splinter group from the ruling party, echoed the view on Tuesday, saying that rather than relying only on the court's decision, a political remedy should also be sought.The calls for a political resolution came amid growing concerns that the court's decision could further polarize an already divided public and plunge the country into another period of confusion.Critics, however, suspect that Park supporters appear to be working on a political ploy to pave the way for her ""orderly"" departure from office, which would allow her to escape punishment and receive privileges as a former president after retirement. The Constitutional Court is expected to deliver a ruling next month. It has set Feb. 27 as the date for closing arguments, which will be followed by the justices' closed-door deliberations, a process likely to take some two weeks.If the court upholds the parliamentary impeachment, the country must hold a presidential election within 60 days. Should it decide to reinstate her, the election will come in December as originally scheduled.Park is suspected of allowing her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs and extort money and favors from local conglomerates including Samsung Group. Both have flatly denied the allegations.","her resignation presidential official ,voluntary resignation the presidential ,thursday dismissed growing rumors ,office on thursday dismissed ,her resignation presidential","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4838613   0.08911295

Lee said the presidential aide is suspected of helping therapists enter the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae without leaving official records to give treatments to the president. He declined to elaborate on further details. The probe team, looking into a broad range of alleged irregularities committed by President Park and her friend Choi Soon-sil, is preparing to wrap up the investigation with the deadline slated for Tuesday.The special counsel has asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend the period for a month, but it is unclear whether he will approve the request.The team has decided not to appeal a recent court ruling that refused to allow it to search the presidential office. The investigators brought the case to the court earlier this month, after its attempt to raid the president's office on Feb. 3 was halted by presidential aides due to security reasons.","prosecutors to arrest presidential ,presidential aide over scandal ,to arrest presidential aide ,arrest an incumbent presidential ,arrest presidential aide over","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'Independent Counsel Park Young', 'Lee Young']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.39086145  0.12417614

This restaurant, located in the Yanbian autonomous prefecture with a large population of ethnic Koreans, is believed to have been the initial workplace of 13 North Koreans who defected to the South together the previous week. After the group of 13 North Koreans fled to the South en masse in April last year, the lawyers asked the spy agency six times to allow them access to the defectors. The NIS, however, rejected the request, saying the defectors do not want to have a meeting with them.The NIS had protected the defectors without sending them to a state-run resettlement facility, saying that the case was a very high-profile defection and Pyongyang was using it as propaganda tool.Usually, North Korean defectors receive three months of resettlement education at the Hanawon facility after coming to South Korea.The lawyers claimed that the defectors should be brought to court to testify whether it was their will not to have a meeting with them. The court, however, said it is a matter to be proved by the NIS.The spy agency has argued that there is no point in carrying out the suit as the defectors are no longer under its protection and have resettled in South Korea since August. The court will hold a verdict hearing on March 23. A total of 1,414 North Koreans came to South Korea last year, compared with 1,275 tallied for 2015, according to a preliminary data provided by the Ministry of Unification.The total number of North Korean defectors in South Korea reached 30,208 as of end-December.","overseas restaurant defectors seoul ,restaurant defectors seoul court ,restaurant defectors seoul ,court on thursday rejected ,interrogate overseas restaurant defectors","['Seoul', 'North Koreans', 'China', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'the Lawyers for a Democratic Society', 'the National Intelligence Service']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40565801  0.50353205

Park was impeached by the parliament in December for her alleged link to the corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.If the Constitutional Court approves the ouster, South Korea has 60 days to pick a new president. The ruling party has been protesting the extension apparently in fear that the prolonged probe would adversely impact its chances in the presidential election and benefit the opposition bloc.","parties on thursday failed ,corruption scandal involving president ,scandal involving president park ,counsel investigating corruption scandal ,probe south korea parliamentary","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun - hye', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Liberty Korea Party', 'Democratic Party']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47868317  0.23973508

The court, which at one point warned Park’s lawyers to watch their language, rejected their requests for the exclusion of Justice Kang Il-won from the impeachment trial and additional hearings to question witnesses. It, however, did heed their call for more time to prepare for the final hearing, rescheduling it from Feb. 24 to Feb. 27.“The Constitutional Court has been clearly in favor of the parliament during hearings. That will only lead to the self-destruction of the court,” said Kim Pyung-woo, a judge-turned-lawyer who recently joined Park’s defense team, during Wednesday’s hearing of Park‘s impeachment trial.Kim even called Justice Kang Il-won -- who has served as lead justice during the impeachment trial -- a “head lawyer for the parliament,” condemning him for taking sides with the parliament, which voted to impeach the president over a corruption scandal in December.Kim Pyung-woo , a judge-turned-lawyer who recently joined Park’s defense team The Constitutional Court reviewing the legality of Park’s impeachment expressed strong regret over such claims, asking Park’s lawyers to refrain from making “insulting” remarks to the court and to cooperate with the trial. “Your remark crossed the line. Be careful with what you say. How dare you say that here?” acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. Park’s lawyers even filed for a petition to exclude Justice Kang Il-won from the trial, which the court dismissed as “a clear attempt to delay the proceedings.”“We filed for the petition to remove Justice Kang Il-won from the trial as he has proceeded in a high-handed manner and he could harm the fairness of the trial,” Park’s lawyers said, citing the restriction for Park’s defense rights and disapproval of their stance as reasons. “We reject the request because the intention behind the petition is clearly to delay the proceedings,” acting Chief Justice Lee responded. The provocative action is seen as Park’s defense team’s final shot at stalling the court proceedings amid growing expectation that the ruling on whether to unseat or reinstate the scandal-ridden president will be made in early March. Park’s lawyers again asked for 20 witnesses including National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and ex-Chief Justice Park Han-chul a day earlier. They claimed Park Han-chul had caused chaos among the public by calling for the verdict to be made before acting Justice Lee Jung-mi’s term ends on March 13 to prevent a “distorted” result. They spent more than three hours in the courtroom taking issue with the procedure of the impeachment and the fairness of the trial, blasting the parliament for “abusing” the law to impeach the president. President Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9 over allegations that she let her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, who holds no government post, meddle in state affairs and colluded with her to extort donations from local conglomerates. “The impeachment charges even include the ones some lawmakers were against. I ask for experts on the Constitution to be called in to testify in the courtroom,” Park’s lawyer Kim said, adding all the 13 charges in the impeachment motion should have been reviewed and voted on separately.Kim referred to the president’s negligence of duty in protecting people’s lives during the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014, which left more than 300 dead or missing. “Many lawmakers openly opposed the Sewol ferry incident in the impeachment motion. If it was voted on separately, it would have not been included in the motion.” President Park has appeared to try to delay court proceedings, which critics see as an attempt to raise the chances of her avoiding being forced out of office. With the departure of Lee, she needs only two justices against the impeachment to maintain her position. The court, which now has eight justices following the departure of ex-Chief Justice Park Han-chul on Jan. 31, has picked up pace with the proceedings, as it will soon have an additional vacancy, with acting Chief Justice Lee’s term ending on March 13. The ruling to impeach Park needs approval from at least six of the current eight justices.Earlier in the day, An Chong-bum, ex-presidential secretary for policy coordination, reiterated his claims that he had only followed an order from President Park in raising donations from local firms for the Mir and K-Sports foundations controlled by Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil.An, who was brought in to testify last month, appeared again at the court as the very last witness for the historic impeachment trial. Choi, who also testified last month, was called to the hearing, but refused the summons, saying she has nothing more to testify. An and Choi, key figures in the corruption scandal, are standing trial on charges of forcing some 50 local firms to donate a total of 77.4 billion won to the Mir and K-Sports foundations. President Park was named as an accomplice, one of the key reasons behind her impeachment. An also said that the local firms had never been forced to make donations for the Mir and K-Sports foundations, saying the business lobby group Federation of Korean Industries actively participated in the fundraising campaign.“I had closely consulted with the FKI Vice Chairman Lee Seung-cheol for the fundraising and he was very actively participating,” he said. “It was Lee who first came up with an idea to hide the presidential office’s involvement in the fundraising activities.”Lee testified that the FKI had been under pressure from the presidential office to solicit corporate donations and the presidential office had forced him not to reveal its role in raising the donations.

In the latest twist of the high-profile probe, Kim Young-jae, a general practitioner who runs an anti-aging clinic in southern Seoul, reportedly confessed that he performed cosmetic treatments on the president, although he is not part of Park’s official medical staff.Kim Young-jae, a general practitioner who runs an anti-aging clinic in southern Seoul “Kim has been under investigation in connection with violating medical law and we have notified the National Assembly about perjury,” said Lee Kyu-chul, the spokesperson representing the probe team. At last year’s parliamentary hearings, the doctor had consistently denied giving such procedures to Park, although he acknowledged multiple visits to Chong Wa Dae. Two other doctors will also likely be charged with perjury for allegedly giving false testimony at the parliamentary hearing, during which they claimed they did not give anti-aging treatment to Park. Controversy has surrounded Kim as he had ties with Choi Soon-sil, the president’s infamous friend. Local media outlets reported that Choi and her family frequented his clinic. Kim was later hired by a major local hospital for outpatient care in 2016, a position usually given to specialists with training and expertise in a specific area, rather than general practitioners. Kim has been seen as a key suspect that could shed light on the whereabouts of President Park during the “missing seven hours” on the day of the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014, which the presidential office has failed to clarify. Park has been denying the secret treatment allegedly performed by Kim and other therapists.

Special counsel Park Young-soo looks likely to indict the former elite prosecutor in the coming days on charges of abuse of power, neglect of duty and perjury, despite the court’s refusal late Tuesday to issue an arrest warrant for him. “Before the deadline, we will continue looking into Woo’s allegations and if the deadline is extended, we plan to request the writ again,” the counsel’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul said at a press briefing.President Park Geun-hye’s former aide Woo Byung-woo If the team’s mandate finishes on Feb. 28 as scheduled, they will “either indict him without arrest or hand over the case to state prosecutors,” Lee added. In a late night decision, the Seoul Central District Court denied the proposed arrest of Woo on grounds of insufficient evidence. “It is hard to acknowledge the reasons and necessity of the arrest based on the current investigation of  criminal offenses,” Judge Oh Min-seok said. Woo, 51, has been under suspicion of having abetted, or at least condoned, a wide range of corruption allegedly committed by President Park’s shadowy confidante Choi Soon-sil. As the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 until last October, he was supposed to monitor and inspect, if needed, irregularities in civil service, including the presidential office. President Park was impeached in December last year over accusations she let Choi interfere in a host of government affairs, colluded with Choi to extort money and favors from local businesses and leaked confidential data to Choi. Choi is being tried criminally. Woo has repeatedly said he had never met Choi and didn’t even know who she was before the scandal broke. Investigators, however, suspect Woo may have been Choi’s personal choice for the Blue House job. Multiple media reports have shed light on a connection between Choi and Woo’s mother-in-law, who were golf buddies and shared swimming lessons at a hotel, the reports claimed. Woo is also suspected of having wielded influence to hinder a special inquiry into the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 out of fear it might invoke negative public views of Park’s administration. However, it is unlikely the special investigation team will find fresh momentum to delve deeper into Woo’s alleged misdeeds, as it nears Tuesday’s deadline for its investigation. The counsel earlier asked acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to allow a one-month extension of its 70-day mandate, but Hwang has been seen as reluctant to approve the measure. Once the team is dissolved, the remaining cases will be handed over to state prosecutors, who originally initiated the investigation into the scandal and led it until the independent counsel was appointed. So far, the counsel has arrested 20 suspects in connection to the scandal, including Samsung Group heir apparent Lee Jae-yong, Park’s former chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two former culture ministers, Cho Yun-seon and Kim Jong-deok.

The Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant for the business tycoon on Friday, dealing a blow to the country's largest business group that had never seen its leader put behind bars in a criminal case.Lee faces allegations that he gave or promised some 43 billion won  worth of bribes to the president's jailed friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the government's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. The merger was seen as critical for the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong. The younger Lee is known to be denying all charges leveled against him.Also on Wednesday, prosecutors grilled another Samsung executive Lee Soo-hyung. The investigation team has been accelerating the probe as its deadline is slated for Tuesday. The special counsel has asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend the period by a month, but it is unclear whether he will approve the request.","arrested over bribery allegations ,jailed samsung heir questioned ,prosecutors on wednesday questioned ,jailed samsung heir ,corruption probe special prosecutors","['Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Group', 'Park Geun', 'Independent Counsel Park Young', 'Samsung Electronics Co.']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28212982  0.10656397

Chung’s detention is set to end at 9 am on Wednesday.South Korean investigators suspect that Chung received undue favors in admission to Seoul-based Ewha Womans University and other academic affairs. A number of professors, including the school’s former President Choi Kyung-hee, have been arrested over their alleged involvement in the irregularities.

Woo stood at a court hearing for his possible arrest Tuesday, accused of turning a blind eye to irregularities surrounding Park and her shadowy confidante Choi Soon-sil and abuse of power while serving as a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs from 2015 to 2016.  Woo Byung-woo The hearing came after independent counsel Park Young-soo asked the court to issue an arrest writ against Woo on Sunday, following an intensive, 19-hour questioning session. The court’s decision on whether or not to allow his detention was expected to come around midnight Tuesday or early Wednesday.Woo repeated his earlier denial of any wrongdoings at the hearing. “I never knew who Choi Soon-sil was ,” the 50-year-old former prosecutor told reporters before entering court. It was not the first time Woo has denied his involvement in the scandal that led the National Assembly to impeach Park last December. During a nationally televised parliamentary hearing following the president‘s impeachment, Woo insisted he had been neither involved in the scandal nor neglected his duty as civil affairs secretary to monitor irregularities in the presidential office. President Park and Choi are accused of collaborating to extort donations from major business groups to funnel to Choi-controlled entities, among other charges. The two are being tried separately, with Park at the Constitutional Court as part of the presidential impeachment process and Choi in a criminal court. Choi is also accused of taking advantage of her four-decade relationship with Park to have her daughter illegally admitted to the elite Ewha Womans University in Seoul. The special counsel team is investigating whether Woo peddled influence in the management of personnel of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Fair Trade Commission, and attempting to hinder a lawful inspection into the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 out of fear it might churn up negative public views of the Park administration. The investigators have been accelerating the probe to meet the team’s deadline set for Tuesday. So far, 20 suspects have been put behind bars, including Samsung heir apparent Lee Jae-yong. Meanwhile, the team said Tuesday that it could take longer than initially expected to bring Chung Yoo-ra, Choi’s daughter, home for questioning. Chung, 21, is currently under the custody of Danish authorities, which are expected to announce soon whether they will extradite her to South Korea. “Whether or not the Danish court decides to send Chung, the process could take additional months if Chung files a petition against the court decision,” Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesperson representing the special prosecutor’s team, told reporters at a press briefing.By Bak Se-hwan","his possible arrest tuesday ,arrest tuesday accused ,possible arrest tuesday accused ,arrest tuesday ,arrest tuesday accused of","['Woo Byung - woo', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2331491   0.4023217

The ruling conservative camp, on the other hand, asserts that the investigation team has a “political motivation” in asking for more time. President Park Geun-hye But the real underlying issue is that investigators, if they are granted an extra month, may have a chance of summoning Park after the Constitutional Court’s impeachment decision, as a former state chief, no longer as an incumbent one with presidential immunity.In defense of the embattled president, the ruling conservative Liberty Korea Party on Monday adopted an official statement opposing the extension. “It is up to Prime Minister  Hwang Kyo-ahn to decide, but our party decided to stand against the extension of the investigation,” Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik told reporters after the party’s general meeting.The investigation team, led by independent counsel Park Young-soo, is to end its term next Tuesday but may gain an extra month for its investigation upon the approval of the acting president.The ruling party’s statement came in response to the opposition parties’ call the previous day for the acting president to approve the extension by Tuesday.The four opposition parties, including the ruling party’s splinter Bareun Party, also intend to revise the independent counsel law in order to prolong the 70-day investigation period to 120 days, but such legislation is likely to be thwarted by the ruling party.Their intention is to allow the investigators to dig into unsolved key issues, especially Samsung chief Lee’s bribery allegations connected to President Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil.The extension plan also reflects the investigation team’s hope to summon the suspended president for a face-to-face questioning, a move which would become more plausible if the court upholds the impeachment.So far, Park and the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae have been out of the investigators’ reach, largely due to the president’s immunity to forceful summoning and the Blue House’s role in national security. But once ousted from her elected post, Park will no longer hold such powers and consequently face questioning as a former president.The opposition also chose to close in on the prime minister who, despite his passivity on the issue, is also facing public pressure to cooperate in the corruption investigation.“We sternly warn that  will be blamed for acting as accomplice , unless he consents to extend the special investigation,” said Rep.

It was his first public appearance in three months since he underwent state prosecutors' questioning over the scandal centered on Park and her friend Choi Soon-sil. Ahn Bong-geun , a former presidential secretary for public relations, arrives at the special prosecutors' office in southern Seoul on Feb. 20, 2017, to undergo questioning over the latest influence-peddling scandal centered on President Park Geun-hye and her friend. Ahn has rejected summons to testify before the Constitutional Court' hearings on the president's impeachment.Investigators suspect that Ahn helped Choi and others, such as therapists, freely enter the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae without leaving official records. He declined to comment on the allegations as he entered the building.Ahn is among three ex-presidential officials dubbed Park's ""doorknob"" secretaries for their close relations with the president. Jeong Ho-song, one of the officials, is currently standing trial over allegations he leaked government secrets to Choi and let her intervene in making key decisions. Choi had no policy experience nor held any official post in the Park administration.On Tuesday, the Seoul Central District Court will hold a hearing to decide the legality of arresting Woo Byung-woo, a former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. Woo is accused of abusing his power in relation to the government's personnel management and the prosecution's investigations. The probe team, led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo, has been accelerating its investigation as the set deadline approaches on Feb. 28. The special counsel has asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend the investigation period for a month, but it is yet unclear whether he will approve the request.","prosecutors on monday questioned ,monday questioned former aide ,special prosecutors on monday ,corruption scandal rocking the ,scandal probe special prosecutors","['Park Geun', 'Ahn bong - geun', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22697368  0.21843228

Depending on her decision, the court will determine whether to hold the final hearing Friday as planned, or postpone it to March 2 or 3 as requested by the lawyers, Lee said.""Please confirm the president's attendance or absence before the next hearing ,"" Lee said. ""There are various things we need to prepare, including issues of courtesy, as it concerns the attendance of a president, not an ordinary citizen.""The president faces charges of letting her friend Choi Soon-sil meddle in state affairs, as well as colluding with her to extort money from Samsung and other conglomerates. She is also accused of neglecting her duty during the 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people.Park and her lawyers have long debated the issue of whether she should appear at her final impeachment hearing to plead innocent.It could help rally her supporters and shift the court's ruling in her favor, but there are also concerns she could fail to properly respond to questions from justices and the National Assembly impeachment panel.Lee made clear that the justices and the parliamentary panel will have the right to ask questions under relevant laws.""It will be to the president's advantage to actively respond to questions,"" she said, adding that the court will not accept requests to schedule an additional hearing for the president after the final one has concluded.""The president must attend  on a date scheduled by the court,"" she said.The court also rejected the lawyers' request to again summon Ko Young-tae, a former associate of Choi, who they suspect triggered the influence-peddling scandal and the president's impeachment out of spite after his plans to take over Choi's businesses failed. Ko has ignored repeated summonses by the court.A request to adopt audio recordings of Ko's phone conversations as valid evidence in the trial was also turned down.Park's lawyers immediately questioned the fairness of the proceedings. ""We think it is very regrettable,"" Lee Joong-hwan, an attorney for the president, said in a press conference after the hearing.""Would it be good for our national status if the president were to be questioned in court?""Under the current timetable, expectations are high that the court will deliver a verdict by March 13 before Justice Lee retires and creates a second vacancy on the nine-member bench. This is because justices are expected to take up to two weeks to finalize the proceedings after hearing the final appeal.After March 13, chances are higher that Park will be reinstated with only two justices required to reject her impeachment instead of three. Park's ouster requires the approval of at least six justices.The first vacancy was created upon the retirement of Chief Justice Park Han-chul last month.If Park is ousted, South Korea is required to hold a presidential by-election within 60 days.

President Park Geun-hye Their claim is that the current timeline -- examining the witnesses for the last time, submitting a written statement and holding the final pleading in just three days -- is insufficient, considering the urgency of the issue.Despite mounting suspicions that the impeachment judgment may dwindle away, the court confirmed last week that it would wrap up the interrogation and pleading process by this week and move onto its decision.But, at least five to 10 days are needed from the last witness interrogation to the final pleading in order for the lawyers to validly review all of the testimonies and evidence, Park‘s lawyers said.Such call for more time also came in line with their earlier request for key witnesses -- absentees whom the court had ruled out of the trial for the sake of time-saving. Of them was Ko Young-tae, a former close aide to Choi Soon-sil, the presidential confidante who triggered the entire corruption scandal and the consequent impeachment calls on Park.Park’s legal representation also inquired whether the president may attend the final pleading to deliver her official statement, without facing questions from the parliamentary impeachment committee or the court.Since the top court took on her impeachment case, Park has offered to cooperate with the trial, as well as with the special investigation, but has so far failed to make her presence in either.The timeline delay, if accepted, is likely to cause a setback in the court’s decision-making process, especially as Justice Lee Jung-mi, who is currently acting as chief justice, is due to retire on March 13.Once she steps down, the court will be operated in an interim seven-member system, in which case the impeachment may be dismissed upon the disapproval from a mere two justices. The Constitutional Court ruling to impeach an incumbent president requires a quorum of at least five justices out of the standing total.The decision on whether or not to delay the trial by a week is to be announced on Monday, during the 15th pleading session.By Bae Hyun-jung","impeachment trial be rescheduled ,delay impeachment hearing amid ,court to delay impeachment ,saturday park lawyers demanded ,to delay impeachment hearing","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park ’s', 'Park Geun - h']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52047253 -0.05439707

The neighbors said he was an average father.Malaysian authorities have already arrested three suspects, including two Asian women, in connection with the death of Kim Jong-nam.Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who has a different mother from the current leader, was killed in an airport in Malaysia on Monday after being attacked by two women who are suspected to have used some sort of poison.It has yet to be confirmed whether North Korea was behind the latest killing, but Seoul's spy agency said Wednesday that Kim Jong-un issued a ""standing order"" to murder his sibling after he assumed power in late 2011.Meanwhile, Associated Press reported that a second autopsy on Kim Jong-nam started Friday night because the results of the first one were inconclusive, quoting an unidentified Malaysian official.Still, there are conflicting media reports about an additional autopsy.

The impeachment trial is taking place at the Constitutional Court.Woo is also under suspicion of spearheading the ousting of former special presidential inspector Lee Seok-soo, who resigned after looking into Choi's alleged unwarranted involvement in state affairs. Investigators are also expected to grill Woo on allegedly embezzling funds from a real estate company run by his family.

In making a second request, the prosecutors added charges of hiding criminal proceeds and violating a law on transferring assets abroad.""It's unclear which of the  led the court to issue the warrant,"" said an official working with Park's lawyers.""I think the additional allegations have nothing to do with the president.""Prosecutors suspect Lee offered the bribes to Choi in exchange for the government's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which was seen as crucial to the heir apparent's management succession plan.The National Assembly impeachment panel, which serves as the prosecution in the trial, hailed the arrest as a reflection of the court's suspicions about the president's bribetaking.""The argument that President Park's lawyers have made that she did not seriously violate the law because she did not make personal gains will lose ground,"" said an official involved in the panel.The Constitutional Court is expected to deliver a verdict in early March after concluding the trial's hearings next Friday. If Park is ousted, South Korea is required to hold a presidential by-election within 60 days. If she is reinstated, the election will be held in December as scheduled.","arrested friday on suspicion ,samsung arrest prompts questions ,arrest of samsung group ,samsung arrest prompts ,the arrest of samsung","[""Samsung Group 's"", 'Park Geun - hye', 'Samsung', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.41729727  0.09304386

Lee, Samsung Electronics vice chairman, was arrested early Friday morning, after a court approved the second request from the counsel to issue a warrant. He is suspected of offering 43 billion won  to Choi Soon-sil, Park’s longtime friend, which the investigators see were in effect bribes to the president. Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., leaves the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul on Feb. 16, 2017, after a hearing on the legitimacy of his arrest sought for the second time by special prosecutors for alleged bribery related to the merger of two of Samsung's affiliates involving impeached President Park Geun-hye. The billionaire tycoon is now locked in solitary confinement at a detention facility in Uiwang, southwest of Seoul. He will be summoned for questioning Saturday, Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for the counsel said. “After an additional investigation, we will likely press charges against him before the probe’s  deadline,” he added. Prosecutors can detain him for up to 21 days before formally indicting him.Lee is the first head of the country’s conglomerates to be taken into custody in connection with President Park’s corruption scandal. He is accused of bribery, embezzlement, perjury, the concealment of criminal proceeds and illicit transfer of assets abroad. The arrest of Samsung Group’s de facto leader was a much-needed boost for the special counsel team, which in recent days had hit a snag in its efforts to investigate the dubious connection between Park, Choi and Samsung Group. Last week, the presidential office had unilaterally cancelled a scheduled face-to-face session between Park and investigators. The same office had earlier blocked the team’s search of its compound, citing security reasons. On Thursday, a local administrative court dismissed the counsel’s request to suspend the presidential office’s refusal to be searched, dimming prospects of the raid taking place.  Buoyed by Lee’s arrest, however, the independent counsel will likely press ahead with the direct interview of President Park who the team views as being at the core of the alleged bribery. The counsel’s spokesperson said Friday that the team is in talks with Cheong Wa Dae to decide on the location and timing of Park’s questioning, which would mark the first time in Korean history for a sitting president to be interrogated. The team’s first attempt failed after Park abruptly called it off, accusing the team of leaking the schedule to the media.The counsel team suspects that President Park, in return for the money provided to Choi, may have supported Samsung Group's founding family to smoothly transfer power from the ailing group chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.  Lee has denied all charges, saying he was forced to make donations to entities controlled by Choi, including the K-Sports and Mir foundations, and did not seek any business favors in return. A key remaining variable for the special counsel is whether it will be granted an extension in the investigation period which is to end on Feb. 28.The team said during the briefing that it will call in Woo Byung-woo, an ex-presidential secretary for civil affairs, as a suspect on charges of abuse of authority Saturday. Woo is suspected of condoning Park’s friend Choi’s meddling in state affairs and exerting undue influence in personnel appointments in the government.It has yet to decide whether to investigate other companies including Lotte, SK and CJ Group that offered donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, considering the remaining time for the probe, the team said. The team Thursday formally requested an extension of the probe by a month to acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. It remains unclear whether Hwang, who was appointed by the president herself, will approve it.The arrest is also expected to take a toll on President Park who is awaiting a decision on whether she will be impeached at the Constitutional Court. Park has denied the bribery allegations, a key charge behind her impeachment.President Park’s legal representatives said that the arrest of Lee will have no impact on the ongoing impeachment trial. “It is premature to say, but the arrest will have no impact on the impeachment,” Park’s lawyer Sohn Beom-kyu said Friday. “Lee’s charges of embezzling company funds, concealing criminal proceeds and hiding assets abroad is not at all related to the reasons behind Park’s impeachment.”With the Constitutional Court setting Feb. 24 for the final hearing of Park’s impeachment trial, speculation is growing that the court’s ruling will be made in early March before acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi’s term ends on March 13. President Park has appeared to try to delay court proceedings by asking for a long list of witnesses and additional hearings, which critics see as boosting chances for her to be reinstated.After the departure of the acting Justice Lee, President Park will only need two of the remaining seven justices on her side to avoid impeachment. Her ouster requires the approval of at least six justices. Welcoming the court’s decision to arrest Lee, the opposition bloc has also stepped up pressure on Hwang to extend the term of the probe. “The independent counsel is doing its best, but it is only halfway through the probe. Hwang should make a decision on whether to extend the probe term for follow-up measures,” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea told reporters.

The decision means the court saw that Lee was behind the tech giant’s donation of 43.3 billion won  to President Park Geun-hye’s confidante Choi Soon-sil in exchange for business favors. Cheong Wa Dae is accused of having played a role in a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates -- Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries -- which facilitate Lee’s takeover of corporate control from Lee Kun-hee, his incapacitated father and the group’s chairman.  Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. After the court’s initial dismissal of the arrest warrant on Jan. 19, the special investigators had been striving to fortify its reasons for the arrest request. The smoking gun came early this month when the team secured an additional 39 journals used by An Chong-bum, a jailed former senior presidential secretary. In the documents were detailed instructions made by Park from June 2014 to November 2016, including papers for her meeting with Lee last February, the third round of one-on-one talks following sessions in September 2014 and July 2015. During the gatherings, Lee asked for help with the management succession, and Park requested support for Choi’s culture and sports foundations, which were practically her slush funds, the prosecutors argue. Samsung’s succession issues broke out after the elder Lee abruptly fell ill in May 2014. In broadening Lee’s charges, the team newly raised suspicions that the presidential office forced related state agencies to change rules to assist a 2015 intra-group stake sale and a 2016 initial public offering of Samsung Biologics, a biodrug unit. In 2015, the Fair Trade Commission sparked controversy after overturning its initial order for Samsung SDI to sell 10 million shares in C&T;, which reflected concerns over the group’s recurring cross-shareholding. Cheong Wa Dae allegedly pressured the antitrust watchdog to cut the amount by half. Korea Exchange, the nation’s top bourse, is suspected of offering favors when Samsung Biologics was about to go public, despite its operating loss for a third straight year, which disqualifies the firm for an IPO. As part of the efforts, the investigators raided the FTC and the Financial Supervisory Commission on Feb. 3. Judge Han Jeong-seok at the Seoul Central District Court said in his ruling that the arrest was necessary, citing the “newly composed facts of criminal charges and additionally collected evidence.” “The previous time, the bribery charges were chiefly comprised of the compensational relations over the merger between Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries. And after three weeks of investigation, we concluded that not only the merger but the overall succession was the overarching issue,” counsel spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul said at a news briefing. “There were three rounds of one-on-one talks, which provided further grounds for our claim, so we changed the criminal facts, increased the amount related to the embezzlement and added other charges such as a concealment of proceeds of crime and the flight of domestic properties.” By Shin Hyon-hee","arrest warrant for samsung ,rewoven bribery charges propped ,tightly rewoven bribery charges ,rewoven bribery charges ,the tech giant donation","['Samsung ’s de', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Lee', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.00249164 0.40041056 0.33541113],Shin Hyon-hee,Social affairs,2,2017,"the prosecutors argue samsung succession ,funds the prosecutors argue samsung ,rewoven bribery charges propped up ,prosecutors argue samsung succession issues ,an arrest warrant for samsung","['Samsung ’s de', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Lee', 'Park Geun', 'Dae', 'Samsung', 'Samsung C&T', 'Cheil Industries', 'Lee', 'Lee Kun - hee', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Electronics Co.', 'an Chong - bum', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Choi ’s', 'Samsung', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Samsung Biologics', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'Samsung', 'C&T', 'Dae', 'Korea Exchange', 'Samsung Biologics', 'FTC', 'the financial Supervisory Commission', 'Han Jeong - seok', 'Samsung C&T', 'Cheil Industries', 'Lee Kyu - chul', 'Shin Hyon - hee']",0,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.00249164 0.40041056 0.33541113]

Park was impeached by the parliament in December on allegations her confidante Choi Soon-sil exerted influence on state affairs without any seat in the administration and pursued personal benefits under her nose.Samsung earlier admitted to making contributions to two nonprofit foundations -- K-Sports and Mir -- allegedly controlled by Choi and her Germany-based firm, but denied the move came with the intention to win the government's backing for a merger between two of its affiliates.""It is shocking.

The president has denied the charges. This photo shows the 14th hearing of President Park Geun-hye's impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Feb. 16, 2017. ""The court plans to conclude the hearings on Feb. 24 after completing the questioning of witnesses,"" acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said during the 14th hearing. ""I ask both sides to submit their final statements by Feb. 23 and prepare for the final defense during the hearing on Feb. 24.""Park's lawyers protested the announcement, saying even ""ordinary trials"" allow for more time between the submission of the final statement and the final oral defense.Justice Kang Il-won, the lead justice for the case, refused to reverse the decision immediately but offered to discuss their argument with the other justices should they submit it in writing.""The Constitutional Court has been pressed for time and set the date for the final hearing in a rush,"" Lee Joong-hwan, an attorney for Park, said in a press conference after the hearing. ""It's very dangerous if the Constitutional Court reaches a decision in a short period of time without sufficient review.""Meanwhile, Rep. Kwon Seong-dong of the parliamentary impeachment panel welcomed the court's announcement, saying he hopes the justices maintain their position and bring a swift conclusion to the nation's political turmoil.If the final hearing is held on or around Feb. 24, expectations are high that the court will deliver its verdict before March 13, before the retirement date of the acting chief justice.Justices are expected to finalize the proceedings over a period of 10-14 days before casting a vote to determine the president's fate. Her ouster requires the approval of at least six justices.There are currently eight following the retirement of Chief Justice Park Han-chul last month.March 10 is seen as a likely date for the court's ruling, as it is the last working day before Lee's retirement.If Park is removed from office, South Korea is required to hold a presidential by-election within 60 days. If she is reinstated, the election will be held in December as scheduled.For Park, a ruling after March 13 heightens the chances of her reinstatement, as only two justices will have to reject her impeachment instead of three. It is also expected to help her avoid interrogation by special prosecutors who are digging into the scandal under a Feb. 28 deadline. While in office, the president is immune from prosecution.Her lawyers have been accused of delaying the proceedings by repeatedly requesting additional hearings. Whether Park will attend the final hearing has also been a focus of the trial. While some say it could have a positive impact on the court's decision and on public opinion, others worry she could be grilled by the justices and the parliamentary panel, which could be to her disadvantage.Park's lawyers said they will discuss the issue with the president but ruled out the possibility of her being questioned.","impeachment hearings next week ,verdict on park impeachment ,december over allegations she ,constitutional court said thursday ,hye impeachment hearings next","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09593653  0.43705863

The arrest of Samsung Electronics vice chairman came shortly after a court issued a warrant in the second attempt by the special counsel to arrest him.  Lee Jae-yong “It is acknowledged that there is a need and reason for the arrest, given a newly added criminal charges and additional evidence,"" the Seoul Central District Court said. The same court last month rejected the counsel team’s earlier request, citing lack of evidence. Upon the ruling, the special counsel looking into the scandal involving President Park and her close confidante Choi immediately placed Lee behind bars at a detention facility in Uiwang, southwest of Seoul, where he had been awaiting the court's decision.  Lee, the 48-year-old Samsung Electronics vice chairman, is charged with bribery, embezzlement, perjury, concealment of criminal proceeds and illicit transfer of assets abroad. The court, however, rejected an arrest warrant for Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin. Park was allegedly the key party in facilitating support for Choi.  ""Given the suspect's status, authority and the actual role he played, it is difficult to recognize the necessity and reason for the arrest,"" the court said. Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin Lee is suspected of offering bribes worth 43 billion won  to Choi in return for the Park administration’s backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the ailing chairman Lee Kun-hee’s power transfer to his only son Jae-yong.The team also suspects the Fair Trade Commission and the Financial Services Commission of pushing for policies in Samsung Group’s favor to help its founding family tighten its grip on its affiliates and smoothly transfer power. Looking tense and grim-faced, Lee left the courtroom at around 7 p.m. on Thursday after the hearing that lasted more than seven hours, taking an unusually long time for a warrant review hearing.Lee has denied all charges, saying he was forced to make donations to entities controlled by Choi, including the K-Sports and Mir foundations, and did not seek any business favors in return.Samsung Group said Friday in a brief statement that it will do its best to ensure that the truth is revealed in future court proceedings.  The arrest of the Samsung executive is a severe blow to global electronics giant Samsung Electronics, which has suffered from a leadership vacuum in recent weeks due to the de facto leader’s involvement in the alleged bribery. President Park will also likely take a hit, as the alleged Samsung bribery is a key charge under review at her impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court. Lee is the first high-ranking businessman to be arrested over the scandal. Several other Korean conglomerates also made donations to Choi’s foundations, although the investigation has not extended to them yet.

Should the court uphold the ouster of the president over the corruption scandal involving her close friend Choi Soon-sil, the nation will then face an earlier-than-expected presidential election within 60 days -- in this case, in late April or early May.“We plan to wrap up the witness interrogation process  and to hold a final pleading on Feb. 24,” said Justice Lee Jung-mi, who is currently acting as chief justice.The last witness examination is expected to involve the scandal’s central figure Choi, as well as former Senior Presidential Secretary for Policy Coordination An Chong-bum. The president‘s attendance, however, is yet certain.Lee also demanded that both parties -- the president’s legal representation and the National Assembly’s impeachment committee -- submit their final written statement by Feb. 23.The court’s decision to speed up the trial process came after it interrogated Jeong Dong-chun, the former chairman of the K-Sports Foundation, one of the organizations affiliated with Choi.Jeong was the only witness to show up, with three others missing. Those who were absent were immediately ruled out of the witness list.The court has recently made it clear that it would rather exclude such unavailable witnesses from the trial, seeking for a speedy procedure.“Should the nonattendance statement lack sufficient grounds, we shall carry on with the trial without resummoning the corresponding witness,” said Justice Lee during the 12th round last Thursday.As Lee is due to retire on March 13, speculations are mounting that the court will hand down its ruling by then.The defendant, however, let out complaints over the quickened pace of the impeachment trial.“ should take sufficient time to review the suggested evidence and to let  prepare for the final pleading,” said Park’s lawyers.The court replied that it would later consider rescheduling, but refused to immediately alter its timeline.Also, the court ruling may be on any weekday, not necessarily the last Thursday of the given month as is the custom, a court official explained.Meanwhile, whether or not President Park will attend the trial continued to remain a question mark.“We will discuss the issue when the final date is confirmed,” said Park’s lawyer Lee Jong-hwan earlier, refraining from giving a definitive answer.Rep. Kweon Seong-dong of the Bareun Party and chairman of the parliamentary impeachment committee anticipated that the president is likely to shun the trial up to the end.By Bae Hyun-jung","hye impeachment on feb ,final pleading on president ,impeachment pleadings on feb ,impeachment on feb 24 ,constitutional court said thursday","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun - hye‘s', 'Constitutional Court', 'Lee Jung - mi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33779338  0.32044017

516,516,516,Counsel requests extension of probe into scandal,"The independent counsel team looking into the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil on Thursday officially requested an extension of its investigation. “We took into account that we cannot complete the probe into those involved in the scandal (by the given end date of the investigation),” the independent counsel’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul told reporters. “...","The independent counsel team looking into the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil on Thursday officially requested an extension of its investigation. “We took into account that we cannot complete the probe into those involved in the scandal ,” the independent counsel’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul told reporters. “We can more efficiently use the investigation period if we know in advance whether the extension will be approved.”The independent counsel’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul The move comes as the counsel team, which was initially given 70 days for the investigation, only has 12 days left until the Feb. 28 deadline. The investigation can be extended for a month with the consent of acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.The team has accelerated the probe into allegations that Park gave favors to local firms in return for bribes, seeking again an arrest warrant for Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong. But it remains unclear whether Hwang, thought to be a key ally to President Park and who was appointed by her, will accept the request. “We will review it. But it is difficult to give a specific answer on whether to extend the probe at this stage,” an official from the prime minister‘s office was quoted as saying. Some 63 lawmakers from the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea presented a revision to the independent counsel act to give the team an additional 50 days, regardless of Hwang’s approval. The bill is pending at the National Assembly.Earlier in the day, Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee attended a court hearing for his possible arrest on charges of bribing President Park. The same court last month blocked the counsel‘s previous move to arrest Lee, citing a lack of evidence.A decision was expected to come early Friday morning. The alleged Samsung bribery is a primary charge behind President Park’s impeachment, which is under review at the Constitutional Court. Looking tense and grim-faced, Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, appeared at the Seoul Central District Court at around 10 a.m. The hearing for Lee ended at around 6 p.m., taking an unusually long time for a warrant review hearing.Lee faces five charges: two fresh charges -- concealment of illicit proceeds and illegal transfer of assets -- on top of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. After three weeks of additional investigation, the independent counsel said it had secured additional evidence that could prove Lee’s involvement in the alleged bribery.Lee is suspected of offering bribes worth 43 billion won  to the president’s longtime friend Choi in return for the Park administration’s backing of a merger between two of its affiliates. The merger of Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries in 2015 was considered a crucial step for the ailing Chairman Lee Kun-hee’s power transfer to his only son Lee Jae-yong. The team also suspects the Fair Trade Commission and Financial Services Commission of pushing for policies in Samsung Group’s favor to help its founding family tighten its grip on its affiliates and smoothly transfer power. Lee was summoned again Monday morning and was released after a 15 hours of questioning. Lee has denied all charges, saying he never sought any favors by donating the money and he was forced to make donations to entities that include the K-Sports and Mir foundations controlled by Choi. Park Sang-jin, Samsung Electronics’ president in charge of external relations, also appeared at the court to attend a hearing on an arrest warrant for his involvement in the irregularities.

The Seoul Administrative Court dropped the case on the grounds that the independent counsel, as a state authority, cannot lodge an administrative lawsuit against the action or decision of another state authority.  Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for special counsel Park Young-soo, said before the court’s decision, “We have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to search the Presidential Office under the current law if the court drops or rejects the case.”With the raid foiled, the counsel is likely to focus on investigating President Park in person. “Regardless of the probe period, we will conduct the questioning if possible,” the counsel team said, adding it is taking “necessary measures.” But it declined to share details just yet. The counsel team has been investigating the massive corruption scandal that led to Park’s parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9. Some of the key allegations include that the president colluded with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to extort donations from local firms for the K-Sports and Mir foundations, directed the government’s systematic discrimination of left-wing cultural figures and allowed Choi to meddle in state affairs including the appointments of key offices. The team said it will question Park over the bribery allegations regardless of whether an arrest warrant is issued for Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong.The counsel team was awaiting a court’s decision on its request for an arrest warrant for Lee. Samsung was the biggest corporate sponsor of Choi, providing over 40 billion won , the team said. Also on Thursday, the team officially asked acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend the probe for a month. The investigation deadline is set for Feb. 28. In the hearing held Wednesday, the independent counsel said the search on the presidential compound was necessary to obtain evidence, citing that President Park had hundreds of phone calls through a burner phone with Choi, even when Choi was on the run in Germany in late October amid the scandal. Two main points raised during the hearing were whether the counsel team has the legal mandate to file a suit against another government body to invalidate an administrative action and whether the search is in national interest. The counsel team filed a lawsuit last Friday after presidential aides refused the team’s entry into the presidential compound on Feb. 3, citing security reasons. Under Korean law, searching top security sites with state secrets requires approval from the person in charge of the location. But the law prohibits the person from stopping the search unless it undermines national interest.

Independent Counsel Park Young-soo sought to suspend and nullify the presidential aides' rejection. But after an hour-long hearing Wednesday, the court dismissed the case, concluding that the independent counsel is not qualified to file such a request. The decision can't be appealed, effectively precluding the prosecutors' search of the presidential office. The investigation team's spokesman Lee Kyu-chul earlier said a search of Cheong Wa Dae will become impossible if the suit is turned down by the court.

On the same day, the special prosecutors asked Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to extend their investigation by one month. The current deadline is Feb. 28 and an extension can only be granted once.  An aide to Hwang refused to give a detailed answer, tersely saying the acting president will review the issue.During a parliamentary interpellation session last Friday, Hwang called on special prosecutors to ""do their best"" until the end of their probe period rather than hastily calling for an extension.","corruption probe of president ,court on thursday refused ,prosecutors search of presidential ,refuses to allow prosecutors ,seoul court on thursday","['Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Cheong']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36820838 -0.00125355

She said she thought she was pulling a prank on the man at the time.Even if she was telling the truth about being lied to, the web of deceit could be far more intricate.Police are now looking for four men and the other woman assassin.The five had been with the arrested suspect in a hotel in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi not far from the airport but had abandoned her a little later. She reportedly then decided to head for the airport to take a flight home.Her story opens up the possibility that the other five had been the real killers who had planned the execution while the arrested woman was the pawn in their plot.Police believe the five are still in the country and have vowed to hunt them down.To add to the intrigue, North Korea has objected to the autopsy on Jong-nam’s body but Malaysian authorities have gone ahead with the post-mortem.It has been completed and it is believed that the poison used to kill Jong-nam has been identified.Among the possible poisons are ricin, a lethal chemical found in the seeds of castor oil plants or tetrodotoxin, which is the killer ingredient in pufferfish.The former is a slow working poison while tetrodotoxin is known to paralyse and kill victims fairly quickly.Deputy Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Noor Rashid Ibrahim said the arrested woman had been “detained in connection with the death of a North Korean man at the airport on Monday.She was identified based on CCTV footage at the airport and she was alone at the time of the arrest”.The woman, whose passport stated that she was from Nam Dinh, Vietnam, is being held at the Selangor police headquarters and police are checking the validity of her nationality.“We are not ruling out the possibility that more suspects will be picked up in the coming days,” he said.The taxi driver who is presumed to have driven the suspect out of the airport It is learnt the taxi driver has since been released after his statement was recorded.The arrest of the woman also puts to rest earlier reports that the two assassins had committed suicide.“We have caught one suspect and we are hunting the other one,” he vowed.Sources said that upon her arrest, Doan, who led police to the hotel in Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi, told police that she was convinced by the female friend and four men to play a prank on a man .She claimed it was never her intention to kill or even hurt the man as she thought it was just a harmless joke.It is learnt that Doan came to Malaysia with the five others for a vacation.However, after the “prank”, the woman alleged she was abandoned by her companions.Among the items seized from the suspect were the T-shirt with the word “LOL” and a light blue Dior handbag. In the bag was a bottle containing what may be the poison that killed Jong-nam.","taxi driver was arrested ,plane to vietnam taxi ,intrigue in assassination tale ,old woman at klia2 ,assassination of kim jong","['KLIA2', 'Kim Jong - nam', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'vietnamese', 'Doan Thi Huong', 'Vietnam']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34901416  0.11349442

The suspects are accused of transforming 24.3 billion won worth of gold bars into small beads and putting them in their rectums, and smuggling them in and out from January 2015 to last month.They brought in 415 kilograms of gold bars, worth some 21.4 billion won, from China and smuggled out some 61 kg of the precious metal to Japan during the cited period, according to its officials. The suspects were given 100,000 won for delivering one and usually carried five to six beads at a time, the officials said. The Incheon customs office detected the suspects while analyzing information of those who frequently visited particular regions or those who have a record of violating customs law.

The special counsel looking into the influence-peddling scandal centered on Park filed the lawsuit with the Seoul Administrative Court on Friday after its attempt to raid the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae was halted by her secretaries earlier this month for security reasons.After hearing arguments from both sides during the hour-long session, the court ordered them to submit additional opinions by midnight.The court is expected to speed up deliberation, as the probe team's investigation deadline is slated for Feb. 28 and a court-issued search warrant is also valid until the same day.The probe team's spokesman earlier said the raid of Cheong Wa Dae will become impossible if the suit is turned down by the court.Under the country's law, military facilities and other areas that handle confidential information cannot be searched without approval from the person in charge of the location.

It is the second time he was summoned to the prosecutors' office over alleged bribery related to the merger of two of Samsung's affiliates in 2015. Seeking the arrest of Lee for a second time, the prosecutors also asked the court to issue a writ for Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin over his involvement in the alleged irregularities, according to the probe team.The court will hold a hearing on Thursday 10:30 a.m. to decide the legality of their detention. The investigation team said more criminal charges have been leveled against Lee compared to the last time it sought his arrest.It declined to elaborate further, saying its spokesman will give more details during a regular press briefing on Wednesday afternoon.Prosecutors accused Lee of giving or promising some 43 billion won  worth of bribes to the president's jailed friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the state-run pension fund's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. The business arrangement was seen as critical for the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.The Samsung scion has denied the allegations raised against him. Lee was questioned for a second time on Monday, as the special prosecutors accelerated their probe into an influence-peddling scandal centered on President Park, with the investigation deadline slated for Feb. 28. The period can be extended once for a month with the consent of Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.","arrest for samsung heir ,prosecutors on tuesday sought ,seek arrest for samsung ,prosecutors again seek arrest ,samsung heir in corruption","['Samsung Group', 'Park Geun', 'Independent Counsel Park Young', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29951361  0.1747368

President Park Geun-hye “Concerning the face-to-face questioning of the president, our team is making the necessary measures,” said Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for the independent counsel.Just on the previous day, Lee had said that the team had “no contact whatsoever” with the presidential office, denying speculation of possible under-the-table negotiations.The official, however, refrained from offering details, either on the questioning timeline or the related negotiations.“It is inappropriate to let out detailed reports until details are fixed,” he said.President Park was earlier slated to face summons on Wednesday-Friday last week. But upon reports the date was set for Thursday, her lawyers and aides called off the interview, claiming the investigators had leaked the information.This last-minute refusal of the summons not only dampened the already-sensitive relationship between the presidential office and the investigators, but also blurred the outlook for the remaining investigation.With increased uncertainties on the direct inquiry of the president, investigators once again focused on Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and heir apparent of the group.After questioning Lee on the previous day for some 15 hours, investigators requested the court for an arrest warrant for the top businessman.The investigation team had earlier sought to have the conglomerate chief arrested on charges of offering benefits to Choi in exchange for the president’s support in facilitating his corporate succession, but the request was dismissed by the court.Special prosecutors also vowed to focus on Samsung Group only and to leave out other conglomerates, such as Lotte, SK, and CJ -- all of which allegedly had monetary connections to Choi -- due to lack of time.But in case both Park and Lee steer clear of the investigators once again, possibilities rise the independent counsel may fail to prove the state chief’s bribery charges within the given period.“We have sent out a written statement to the National Assembly that an extension of the investigation period is necessary,” the counsel’s spokesman said.“Without the period extension, it is quite evident that we may no longer make tangible progress from what we have so far.”The team, led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo, is set to operate until Feb. 28, but can be extended by another month upon the approval of acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn.Hwang, who is currently considered a plausible presidential candidate for the conservative camp, has been passive on supporting the investigation.During the parliamentary interpellation session last Friday, he offered his opinion that “it is not yet time to consider an extension for the independent counsel,” hinting at his disapproval of letting the investigators carry on.By Bae Hyun-jung","team tuesday began rescheduling ,arrested over bribery charges ,tuesday began rescheduling the ,investigation team last minute ,tuesday began rescheduling","['Park Geun', 'Samsung', 'Lee Jae - yong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44415057  0.38045573

Lee, 48, is suspected of bribing Park’s longtime confidante Choi Soon-sil to win political support for a controversial merger between two Samsung affiliates in 2015. The Samsung C&T-Cheil; Industries deal was made possible chiefly by the support of the state-run National Pension Service, which was the largest shareholder of Samsung C&T.; Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong take an elevator up to the special counsel Park Young-soo’s office on Feb. 13, 2017. The bribery allegations are part of a massive scandal that led the National Assembly to vote overwhelmingly in favor of impeachment Park last December. “We will decide soon whether to retry arrest of Vice Chairman Lee,” its spokesman Lee Kyu-chul told reporters, as the questioning continued into afternoon. It is the second time that the billionaire heir has been grilled over the group’s generous provision of support for Choi’s interests and her horseback rider daughter. The team, after questioning Lee on Jan. 12, sought to arrest the executive last month, but was blocked by a local court, which cited a lack of evidence.In the second round of questioning, the probe team is said to be focusing on new suspicions about the dubious Samsung-Choi Soon-sil ties. One involves the Fair Trade Commission’s 2015 directive to Samsung SDI to reduce its equity holdings in Samsung Electronics. The FTC ordered Samsung SDI, a Samsung unit, to dispose of 5 million Samsung Electronics shares to comply with the country’s regulation on cross-shareholding amongst affiliates, three months after the merger in 2015. The counsel team suspects that the presidential office exerted influence to reduce the size of required stock disposal by half from an original 10 million shares. Earlier this month, the investigators raided the home and office of Kim Hack-hyun, a former vice chairman of the FTC, and questioned him over the suspicion. According to the probe team, Samsung Group provided or pledged to provide a total of 43 billion won  to Choi and her daughter, Chung Yoo-ra. Part of the money was delivered in the form of a horse sponsorship for Chung, a former national team dressage competitor. The special counsel is trying to repatriate Chung for questioning. She is currently being held under arrest in Denmark. Former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo was indicted last month on charges of pressuring the National Pension Service to support the Samsung merger, which eventually helped Lee, the only son of Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee, to tighten his grip on the entire group. Both President Park and Samsung have strongly denied the bribery accusations. On Monday, two senior executives of Samsung -- Samsung Electronics president Park Sang-jin and senior executive Hwang Sung-soo -- were questioned over whether the sponsorship for Choi’s daughter was under Lee’s instruction. Both had positions at the Korea Equestrian Federation. This takes the total number of Samsung Group executives called in as suspects to five, including its future strategy office’s Choi Ji-sung and Chang Choong-ki who were summoned earlier in connection with the investigation.By Bak Se-hwan","again over bribery samsung ,over bribery samsung group ,over bribery samsung ,bribery samsung group de ,grilled again over bribery","['Samsung Group ’s de', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Seoul', 'Lee']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.37888327  0.33956379

Lee, the only son of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee, is suspected of bribing President Park and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the state-run National Pension Service’s support of the conglomerate’s controversial merger of two units. The independent counsel had sought to arrest him last month, but was blocked by the court, which cited a lack of evidence. As for the interview of the president, the spokesperson said that the investigation team has had no consultation with the Blue House since the latter unilaterally called it off at the last minute last week. The presidential office on Wednesday canceled the face-to-face questioning of President Park, which had been scheduled for the next day, saying the counsel team had leaked info about the session to the media. “There is nothing decided yet over the face-to-face investigation of the president,” Lee said.Local media reported the team may just subpoena the president, after its efforts to show courtesy to the sitting president by consulting with the presidential office about the timing and location of the event bore little fruit. The team will likely take the action – a summons or not – this week, the reports said, as it must wrap up the probe by the end of this month. The team earlier ruled out a forceful investigation of Park. The interview, if realized, would make Park the first democratically elected leader to be questioned by investigators in Korea. Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9 over allegations she colluded with her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to extort major conglomerates, including Samsung, to transfer around 77.4 billion won  to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi. Choi-controlled entities — the Mir and K-Sports foundations — are suspected to be covers for channeling money to Choi’s private business interests, including Core Sports, a paper company she set up in Germany. The Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the legality of Park’s impeachment. The special counsel has until Feb. 28 to conclude its investigation. The counsel could ask for a one-month extension in the investigation period, but it requires the approval of acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is seen as a key Park ally. Hwang said earlier it is “not appropriate” to talk about extending the mandate for the team while there is still time remaining for the investigation. Earlier this month, the Blue House also refused to follow the team’s court-issued search warrant on the presidential compounds in central Seoul, blocking the raid. The raid was carried out in order to secure evidence before Park’s questioning, but they were denied entry by presidential officials citing security reasons. Under the law, any government facilities handling confidential information cannot be searched without the approval of the subject in charge. In response, the counsel submitted the request on Friday to the local administrative court to seek the suspension of the disapproval by the presidential office, the prosecution and the court said. The administrative court is expected to deliver its ruling by Tuesday on whether to allow the suspension.By Bak Se-hwan","corruption surrounding president park ,arrest warrant three weeks ,again considers summoning president ,alleged corruption surrounding president ,corruption surrounding president","['Park Geun', 'Samsung Group ’s de', 'Lee Jae - yong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24105847  0.09590811

The counsel team last week attempted in vain to enter Park’s official complex with a court-issued search warrant to obtain evidence over Park’s alleged bribery, creation of a blacklist and her confidante Choi Soon-sil’s meddling in state affairs.But Cheong Wa Dae refused the team’s entry, citing a law that requires approval from the person in charge of the location when searching top security sites with confidential information. “The reason for the action is to be judged by the court as to whether the presidential chief of staff barring the execution of the search and seizure by the special counsel was legitimate,” Lee said. Lee said he expects a hearing to be held next week. The court-issued search warrant is valid until Feb. 28.  The counsel team also said it plans to charge the chief of the presidential staff and chief security officer with obstruction of public duty if they continue to block the search even after the court rules against them. “But if our request is rejected, there is no way to raid the presidential under the current law, so then we think it is impossible to execute the search warrant,” Lee said. The move is widely seen as stepping up pressure on the presidential office amid the continued deadlock between President Park and the counsel team over its plan to question Park face-to-face.Park unilaterally called off the planned face-to-face interrogation on Thursday, accusing the counsel team of leaking information about the timing and the location of the questioning to the local media. The counsel team denied leaking the information.The probe team also said it is currently not adjusting the schedule with the president for the face-to-face questioning.By Ock Hyun-ju","involving impeached president park ,scandal involving impeached president ,to stop presidential aides ,impeached president park geun ,raid on presidential office","['Park Geun', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'Lee Kyu - chul']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1604566  -0.04966404

With the indictments of Kim Ki-choon, Cho Yoon-sun, Kim Sang-ryul and Kim So-young, the team is close to wrapping up its inquiry into the blacklist allegation, part of its multifaceted investigation into the corruption and influence-peddling allegedly committed by Park, her close friend Choi Soon-sil and their shared inner circle.  Cho Yoon-sun and Kim Ki-choon. Yonhap“The arraignment states President Park as an accomplice to some of the charges,” Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for Special Counsel Park Young-soo said at a press briefing. The systematic discrimination against cultural figures and organizations critical of the administration has recently been added to the charges that President Park faces in the ongoing impeachment trial. Park cannot be indicted under the law which gives her criminal immunity as sitting president.Tuesday’s prosecution of the four brings the total number of indictments related to the artist blacklist to seven, including Cho’s predecessor as culture minister Kim Jong-deok. According to the probe team, former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, both detained since last month, led the creation of the list to monitor thousands of dissident artists and block them from winning state funding. For that, Kim and Cho face charges including abuse of power and coercion. In an interview last week the president flatly denied any knowledge of such a list. President Park, currently stripped of powers while the Constitutional Court reviews whether to end her presidency, allegedly colluded with her long-time friend, Choi Soon-sil, to extort 77.4 billion won  from local business groups, including Samsung. The money was allegedly made in return for political support for the conglomerates. The blacklisting of artists was first raised last year by former Culture Minister You Jin-ryong, who claimed that Park’s administration excluded renowned cultural figures from state funding. The probe team sees that the creation of the list was led by Park’s chief of staff Kim, under the president’s directive, and handed over to the culture ministry to execute the crackdown. The list reportedly includes “Oldboy” director Park Chan-wook and poet Ko Un, along with other high-profile celebrities who criticized the government over the way it handled the rescue operations of the Sewol ferry incident 2014 which claimed the lives of 300 people.Cho, who served as Park’s senior secretary for political affairs before becoming the culture minister, is suspected of attempting to block the airing of a documentary critical of the government’s handling of the ferry disaster at the Busan International Film Festival in 2014. The movie aired despite Busan city’s opposition. The film festival then suffered a 50 percent cut in state subsidy. The probe team plans to conduct a face-to-face interrogation of President Park over her alleged role in the blacklist creation and others. The grilling, largely expected to be carried out this Thursday or Friday, will make Park the first sitting president to receive prosecution enquiry.By Bak Se-hwan","scandal indicted four more ,former aides on tuesday ,hye scandal indicted four ,scandal indicted four ,team investigating the president","['Park Geun', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Kim Sang - ryul', 'Kim So - young']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.0123936   0.90102649

I only followed Choi’s orders and received a salary from Choi,” Ko said, disputing Choi’s claim that he was the actual owner of The Blue-K. Choi's lawyers had a war of words with Ko as they tried to prove that Ko and other officials at the entities plotted to frame Choi and fabricate the evidence.“Choi has no office in The Blue-K company, is that right?” Choi’s lawyer asked, showing a floor map drawn by a security guard of the building. When Ko denied that, the lawyer asked again, “Are you confident? You should think about it hard.” Ko fought back, saying, “The floor map doesn’t even make sense. You haven’t been to the office, have you? Choi has her desk, safe and table in her own room in the office.” This marks the first time the two have faced each other since the scandal broke in October 2016. Ko, who appeared in a gray suit and black coat, barely looked at Choi as he answered questions. Ko provided detailed testimony on Choi’s involvement in the operation of the entities as well as the dress shop in which Ko manufactured clothes for President Park. He said Choi had covered the rental fees of the offices and she directly paid him a salary and expenses for Park’s items. As for Choi’s relationship with Park, he said they were very close. President Park was named an accomplice in the alleged extortion of donations from local firms for the Mir and K-Sports foundations. “Choi visited the presidential office often to deliver her clothes. She treated Park’s secretaries as personal assistants and always told me that she worked for the president out of loyalty,” he said. “In her office at The Blue-K, she was working on something like presidential speeches on her laptop.”Ko has been a key whistleblower with knowledge of inner workings and Choi’s meddling in state affairs. His revelation about Choi’s editing of presidential speeches in October triggered the scandal that eventually led to Park’s impeachment. Choi has denied all allegations from her extortion of donations from local firms to her manipulation of power behind the scenes for personal gain. A woman in the audience in the courtroom suddenly stood up and hurled curse words at Choi and Choi’s lawyers, which was met with applause. She shouted: “Why you are protecting the woman who ruined the country?” Ko’s appearance came amid his continued absence from the public eye since he offered key remarks implicating President Park and Choi in the alleged wrongdoings during the parliamentary inquiry into the scandal in December. He has remained in hiding and refused to appear at the impeachment trial, citing threats to his own safety.  Ko is the most wanted witness by President Park’s lawyers in her impeachment trial as Park argues she was wrongly framed in the scandal sparked by the 60-year-old Choi’s adulterous affair with the 40-year-old former fencing champion Ko.Ko, who has been called Choi’s boy toy, allegedly first met Choi in 2006 while working at a “host bar” in southern Seoul. Ko denied the rumors and said he only met Choi through his handbag manufacturing company Villomillo. The Constitutional Court plans to bring in Ko for questioning as a witness at the 12th hearing of the impeachment trial scheduled for Thursday. It remains unclear whether he will appear.  Earlier in the day, Lee Sung-han, a former secretary general of the Mir Foundation, also testified that the entity was under Choi’s control during the hearing. “I think Choi ran the foundation,” he said. Lee also agreed that Choi conspired to shift the blame linked to the operation of the Mir Foundation to TV commercial director and Choi's another associate Cha Eun-taek. Lee earlier revealed that Choi had received files as thick as 30 centimeters from Jeong Ho-seong, a presidential secretary of private affairs, almost every day for review and delivered her instructions through Jeong to the presidential office.

YonhapThe date and venue for the interview cannot be disclosed yet, the spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul added, as the president’s legal representatives and the probe team are still in talks to finalize the process.  The grilling, largely expected to take place on either Wednesday or Thursday, will make Park the first democratically elected leader to be brought before investigators while in office.Investigators also hope her questioning will provide the missing pieces in the scandal that led to President Park’s parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9 and gripped the country for months.The president is suspected of extorting donations from local businesses to nonprofit foundations controlled by her friend Choi Soon-sil, among others. The embattled president is likely to strongly defend herself against all allegations. In an interview late last month, President Park claimed to have done nothing wrong, calling her impeachment charges “preposterous and colossal lies.”  The probe team on Friday attempted to raid the presidential Blue House in connection with the investigation, but was blocked at the gate by officials citing security reasons. The Blue House claimed that the search warrant was “unconstitutional” as it lists President Park as a criminal suspect. It said the president cannot be charged with a crime as long as she remains in office. By law, a sitting president is immune to criminal liability.At the briefing Sunday, the investigative team‘s spokesperson told the reporters that they are “considering all options” to search the presidential office, but did not comment on how. The probe team, under the law, has until the end of February to wrap up its investigation of alleged crimes committed by President Park. A 30-day extension of the investigation is possible with the approval of acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, who was appointed by Park.The special counsel team has so far questioned dozens of high-profile government figures and suspects linked to Park’s alleged wrongdoing. President Park’s now-infamous friend Choi was one of them. The jailed 60-year-old is accused of coercing 53 companies, including Samsung, to donate 77.4 billion won  to the Mir and K-Sports foundations run by her, using her ties to the president. She is undergoing her own criminal trial on charges of attempted fraud and being an accomplice to abuse of power. Special prosecutors allege that Park was a major player as well in extorting the corporate money and giving favors in return to the business groups.  Other key allegations surrounding President Park include her role in creating a blacklist of dissident cultural figures and her inaction following the deadly sinking of a South Korean ferry off the southwest coast in 2014, which claimed the lives of more than 300 people, mostly teenagers on a school field trip.  Regarding the so-called blacklist, former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryung first disclosed to the public that Park’s administration monitored and cracked down on leftwing artists not favorable to the government.

It will be the first-ever prosecution enquiry of a sitting South Korean president if it is carried out as planned, officials said Sunday.Independent Counsel Park Young-soo is in talks with the president's lawyers with a plan to hold the interrogation of the president sometime between Wednesday and Friday, according to officials from the special investigation team.""If the face-to-face interrogation can be carried out, it will be on a date between Wednesday and Friday,"" an official on the independent counsel team said. ""The final schedule will be fixed in the very near future.""  Independent Counsel Park Young-soo Last Friday, the special prosecutor team attempted to search the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, but was denied entry on the ground of state confidentiality concerns. President Park has, however, been receptive to the possibility of in-person questioning. The location is likely to be either inside Cheong Wa Dae or a government estate outside the presidential residence. It would mark the first time ever for a sitting South Korean president to be interrogated by law enforcement authorities if the plan is carried out as planned.The envisioned enquiry is likely to focus on what role the president played in Samsung Group's financial contributions to cultural foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, an imprisoned long-time friend of the president. Also, it will touch on her role in crafting a blacklist, through which cultural figures and artists were unconstitutionally discriminated against. Park has repeatedly denied those charges.  Park is also likely to be grilled over suspicions involving the seven hours immediately following the sinking of a South Korean ferry on April 16, 2014, off the country's southwest coast.She has been reported to have stayed in her residential quarters inside Cheong Wa Dae before making her first public appearance after the sinking. More than 300 people, mostly teenagers on a school field trip, were killed in the accident.""There will be only a single chance to interrogate Park in person,"" a special counsel official said, vowing thorough preparation.An official on the presidential side said they will use the enquiry as a chance to ""rectify what is wrong and illuminate what needs to be legally clarified.""","sitting south korean president ,planned officials said sunday ,president lawyers with plan ,scandal centered on president ,first ever prosecution enquiry","['Park Geun', 'south korean']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42425084  0.46188328

Officials had heralded the search to start at 10 a.m.The visit marked the first time that the special team, led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo, tried to force itself into the precincts of the presidential office since it started its investigation in December.The places subject to search were the offices of the presidential chief of staff, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, personal secretary to the president, the presidential security team and the medical office. The independent counsel‘s search team arrives at Cheong Wa Dae on Friday morning, seeking to find evidence related to President Park Geun-hye’s bribery allegations. YonhapBut Cheong Wa Dae maintained its stern guard, refusing to offer investigators access to the presidential compound, citing “national security” reasons. After hours of tension at the main gate, the search team withdrew at around 3 p.m.Park has been accused of letting her civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil meddle in state affairs and amass illegitimate profits by using her high-profile connections.Denying such allegations and resisting the investigation, Presidential Chief of Staff Han Gwang-ok issued a statement to disallow the prosecutors’ entry.“The presidential office is categorized as a national security facility which handles military and state secrets, so we cannot accept any raid, according to previous practices,” a ranking official said.“But we will fully cooperate by submitting the requested documents.”This came in line with spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk’s remarks on the previous day that the Blue House’s stance remains “unchanged,” denying the reports that a partial search in some of the facilities may be possible.The situation was reminiscent of October last year, when the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office’s special investigation team were halted while attempting a raid and settled for the set of documents selectively handed over by Cheong Wa Dae.The team later raided one of the offices affiliated with Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo, which was an annex located outside the presidential compound.The legal basis for the defensive presidential office is mainly the Criminal Procedure Code act which states that locations which are related with military and state secrets may not be raided without the consent of the person in charge. The given clause does add that the consent is compulsory, unless the search seriously infringes on the nation’s interest.With President Park currently suspended upon impeachment, the consenting authority lies upon Prime Minister and acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn who has so far reserved his stance upon the issue.“We will send out an official letter to the acting president, asking for his cooperation in the search,“ said the independent counsel‘s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul.But as the search warrant is to hold effect for several more days, investigators are pledging to make repeated raiding attempts before summoning the president, according to officials.The raid would have taken place a day earlier on Thursday, which was President Park’s 65th birthday, but investigators put off the date in consideration of the occasion.By Bae Hyun-jung","blue house over scandal ,interrogation of president park ,state chief bribery suspect ,face interrogation of president ,investigators on friday sought","['Cheong', 'Dae', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13416627  0.2533474

Lee is suspected of offering bribes to Park’s longtime friend Choi in exchange for the Park administration’s backing of a merger between two Samsung affiliates, another crucial step for Lee to tighten his grip on the firm. Officials of the independent counsel enter the Fair Trade Commission office at the Sejong Government Complex on Friday as part of their investigation into President Park Geun-hye. YonhapThe search and seizure came at the same time as the counsel team’s failed attempt to raid the presidential office and execute a warrant in which President Park was named as a criminal suspect for bribery. The alleged bribery was one of the key reasons behind the parliament‘s decision to impeach her in December. The counsel team said it will decide whether to indict Lee by Feb. 15. Its earlier request to issue an arrest warrant for Lee was rejected by the court for lack of evidence. Through the raid, the team also obtained Choi’s foreign currency transaction records to look into her alleged attempt to derive illicit benefits through a state project worth 76 billion won  in Myanmar last year. Choi, who is already standing trial for abuse of authority, coercion and fraud, is suspected of receiving shares from a company in return for helping it to take part in the official development assistance project.The team also suspects that Choi interfered in the foreign ministry’s personnel appointments linked to the state project. Choi allegedly helped South Korean Ambassador to Myanmar Yoo Jae-kyung and the nation’s foreign aid agency chairman Kim In-shik secure their current posts.The team’s investigation into the Park administration’s creation of a blacklist of cultural figures critical of the president also gained momentum Friday as the Seoul High Court dismissed a complaint filed by former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon. Kim, who the probe team suspects as the mastermind behind the management of the blacklist, filed the complaint saying the case was not within the independent counsel’s discretion.By Ock Hyun-ju","corruption scandal on friday ,regulator raied over bribery ,friday raided the offices ,scandal on friday raided ,bribery allegations involving president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Samsung Group', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'Sejong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.4518829   0.4324109

Since then, there has been controversy over whether to return it to Japan or to Buseok Temple. After years of dispute, the court acknowledged the Korean temple's ownership of the statue and ordered the government to immediately hand it over to the plaintiff regardless of whether an appeal is filed over the case or not.The prosecution appealed the ruling and sought an injunction to temporarily suspend its execution.""The latest injunction order took into consideration the risk of robbery, harm, and the possibility of a higher court overturning the decision, as well as the diplomatic issues with Japan,"" a prosecutorial official said.Wonwoo, the chief monk at Buseok Temple, said he will consult with his lawyer and take the necessary legal measures. The statue will be kept by the government until the final ruling is made.The 50.5 centimeter-tall statue is presumed to have been made in the early 14th century during the Goryeo Dynasty  and was designated by the Japanese prefecture as a cultural asset in 1973.It was one of the two statues stolen by the thieves. The other was returned to Japan in July 2015 after South Korean prosecutors concluded that they could not confirm if it was illegally taken to the island nation.","over stolen buddhist statue ,court prosecutors said wednesday ,for stolen buddhist statue ,stolen buddhist statue court ,hand over stolen buddhist","['buddhist', 'the Daejeon District Court', 'Buseok Temple', 'Seoul']",4,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.18072337 0.41818267 0.10872375],KH디지털2,Social affairs,2,2017,"stolen buddhist statue to local ,after south korean prosecutors concluded ,hand over stolen buddhist statue ,over stolen buddhist statue ,higher court prosecutors said wednesday","['buddhist', 'the Daejeon District Court', 'Buseok Temple', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Kannon Temple', 'Japan', 'the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage', 'Japanese', 'south korean', 'Japan', 'Buseok Temple', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Wonwoo', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'south korean']",0,[1.         0.         0.         ... 0.18072337 0.41818267 0.10872375]

A delayed trial at the Constitutional Court, or more precisely the preordained departure of justices in its nine-member judge panel, increases her chances of surviving the impeachment, while giving her more time to muster support outside the courtroom. With Monday’s retirement of the court’s president, Justice Park Han-chul, the top court now must proceed with the trial with eight justices. Another justice, Lee Jung-mi, who is acting as court president following Park’s departure, is also nearing the end of her term -- March 13. Since removal of a sitting president from office requires consent of at least six justices, not two-thirds, of the court’s judge panel, the chances of Park’s ouster are greater if the decision is reached before Lee steps down. Until March 13, three of the eight justices must side with Park for her to keep her job, but this requirement falls to two out of seven after that. These, of course, are just the numbers. They do not take into account the main deciding factor -- whether or not President Park will manage to convince enough justices to vote for her reinstatement against an apparently overwhelming public sentiment.","her impeachment trial delayed ,impeachment trial delayed trial ,impeachment trial delayed ,fast track her impeachment ,track her impeachment trial","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Han']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33110157  0.18710728

Choi allegedly recommended Yoo to the president after interviewing him in March 2016. Yoo, 58, a former senior executive at Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co., had no experience in diplomacy when he was appointed to the post in May 2016.South Korea's Ambassador to Myanmar Yoo Jae-kyung walks through reporters to enter the office building of the independent counsel team on Tuesday Yoo returned to Seoul earlier in the day to face the investigators' questioning.During the interrogation, Yoo testified that he met Choi several times and became the ambassador following her recommendation, reversing his previous statement, the probe team's spokesman Lee Kyu-chul said.Before he entered the probe team's office in the morning, he told reporters that he did not know who recommended him as ambassador. ""If somebody has recommended me to this post with an ulterior motive, I can tell you that the person has got the wrong person,"" Yoo said. He did not directly mention Choi and declined to comment when asked if he actually had the meeting in March.""Upon appointment, I was told by the president that they were looking for somebody with experience in trade, instead of an authentic diplomat, so as to tap into the new market,"" Yoo added.He is the second incumbent ambassador stationed abroad to be called in by investigators in relation to the scandal. Ambassador to France Mo Chul-min returned to South Korea last month, following the investigation team's summons over suspicions the presidential office created a ""blacklist"" of cultural figures considered critical of the government. Mo served as a senior presidential secretary from 2013 to 2014.Later on Tuesday, the investigation team sought an arrest warrant for Choi on charges of bribery to question her in connection with the Myanmar case. The writ is valid for 48 hours after issuance.Choi, who has been in custody since late last year, has declined to answer to the probe team's summons claiming the prosecutors have been ""repressive.""The investigation team interrogated her with a warrant on Wednesday, but she has exercised her right to remain silent.","appointment last year investigators ,park jailed friend choi ,jae kyung admitted tuesday ,scandal recently began investigating ,admitted tuesday that president","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Korea']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3317149   0.65390408

As a former senior executive at Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Yoo had no experience in diplomacy.South Korean Ambassador to Myanmar Yoo Jae-kyung The investigation team suspects that Choi placed Yoo to the post using her ties to the president so as to gain economic profits through state-funded businesses there.“I still do not know who recommended me as ambassador,” Yoo told reporters upon arriving at the independent counsel headquarters.“If somebody did make the recommendation , I can affirm to you that he or she had the wrong person.”He declined to comment as to whether or not he had actually met her in March, before his appointment.But contrary to Yoo’s denial, the investigation team claimed the ambassador had admitted to his connection with Choi.“Though he earlier denied it,  admitted that he had met with Choi several times and that he became ambassador upon her recommendation,” said the independent counsel team’s spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul in the afternoon, hours after Yoo went in for questioning.While chances are low the ambassador will face indictment, his remark is likely to add another bribery charge to Choi.According to the investigation team, Choi had received kickbacks in exchange for having a Myanmarese company included in the K-Town Project, a 76 billion won  deal to build a convention center in the Southeast Asian state. The project, however, later fell apart amid disputes on its legitimacy and profitability.“We expect to request an arrest warrant for Choi ,” Lee said.On the previous day, the embattled presidential confidante refused to respond to a summons on her bribery allegations connected to Samsung Group and other conglomerates.Meanwhile, speculation mounted on the scenario that investigators will question the president in person between Feb. 8 and Feb. 10, though the exact date, time and place are yet to be decided.“We plan to carry out a search and seizure of Cheong Wa Dae and a face-to-face questioning of the president in February,” counsel spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul said Tuesday.The place could be either the Blue House or another location, as the independent counsel office does not have the necessary security conditions, according to officials.Among the charges raised against the president is the allegation she exerted power to help conglomerates, including Samsung Group, in exchange for benefits offered to confidante Choi and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra.But despite the president’s promise to respond to the independent counsel’s summons, it is uncertain whether she will attend, especially considering the increasing complaints she and her legal representatives have levied against the ongoing investigation.“I am planning to cooperate with the investigation,” Park said in a rare interview with the chief editor of the Korea Economic Daily, which aired via YouTube on Jan. 25.The president had made a similar promise last year to fully cooperate with the prosecutors’ investigation, but altered her stance as soon as investigators named her an accomplice in Choi’s alleged wrongdoings.Also, dispute arose Tuesday following reports the president had ordered her staff to uncover investigation secrets, a story Blue House spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk immediately denied.By Bae Hyun-jung","park ongoing impeachment trial ,corruption special prosecutors tuesday ,park ongoing impeachment ,affect park ongoing impeachment ,ongoing impeachment trial at","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Park ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17441584  0.53423202

559,559,559, Chief Justice steps down with ‘heavy heart’,"Park Han-chul, chief justice of the Constitutional Court, reiterated his calls for a speedy ruling in the impeachment trial of President Park Geun-hye at his retirement ceremony Tuesday. “The public are united in the view that a conclusion (on the impeachment) should be made as soon as possible, given the gravity of the situation in which the president has been suspended from duty for nearly two months,” the justi...","Park Han-chul, chief justice of the Constitutional Court, reiterated his calls for a speedy ruling in the impeachment trial of President Park Geun-hye at his retirement ceremony Tuesday. “The public are united in the view that a conclusion  should be made as soon as possible, given the gravity of the situation in which the president has been suspended from duty for nearly two months,” the justice said, ending his six-year term as a member of the nine-judge court. Park’s farewell speech echoed his earlier call for a decision on the fate of the Park presidency to be made by March 13, before the term of another justice, Lee Jung-mi, expires. He earlier warned that the absence of justices could lead to a “distorted” ruling in the impeachment trial. “I believe that the fellow justices and colleagues at the court will serve as the beacon of the Constitution by making utmost efforts to strictly review whether the Constitution and laws were violated in this case,” said Park, adding that he leaves the court with a “heavy heart.”Chief justice of the Constitutional Court Park Han-chul As for the ongoing debate over the Constitutional reform in the political realm, Park said that such a revision should not serve a political purpose. “The Constitutional revision should be done in a way that more greatly guarantees human dignity, the people’s happiness and the nation’s wellbeing.”Park also urged the National Assembly to play an active role in resolving conflicts of interests and social confrontation, saying a failure to do so could lead to “the public dissatisfaction and distrust in the political system.” Park’s seat will likely remain vacant for the time being, with the appointer -- President Park-- suspended from office and standing trial herself. Justice Lee will act as the court’s president. It is the third time the top post at the Constitutional Court has been left vacant since its establishment in 1988. The outgoing Chief Justice Park earlier chided the National Assembly for failing to enact a law stipulating the terms of justices at the Constitutional Court and thus causing the absence of a chief justice in a significant trial for the country. Debate ensued in the political arena over the vacancy of the chief justice, with the conservative bloc demanding acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn be given the authority to appoint Park’s successor. The post is supposed to be filled by a figure chosen by President Park. The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea’s floor leader, Woo Sang-ho, dismissed such calls, saying it was against the public sentiment that seeks a rapid conclusion of the impeachment trial. “If a successor is nominated, the new chief will have to begin the trial from scratch,” he said. Appointed as the chief of the court by the sanctioned president Park Geun-hye in 2013, the outgoing Justice Park has left a crucial mark on the nation’s historic rulings, from the disbandment of the left-wing minor party to the abolishment of the criminal punishment of adultery.  But under his command, the court was embroiled in allegations that it had been influenced by the presidential office when making the controversial ruling in 2014 to dissolve the minor Unified Progressive Party. The party was convicted of plotting a rebellion to support North Korea in the event of a war. The court flatly denied the allegations which came to light through a notebook left behind by the deceased former presidential secretary Kim Young-han. Born in Busan in 1953, Justice Park, a graduate of Seoul National University School of Law, started his career as a prosecutor in 1983. He served as head of the public security department at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office and chief of the Seoul Eastern District Court. He left the public office in 2010 to briefly work as a lawyer for the nation’s largest law firm Kim & Chang. Since 2011, he served as a justice at the Constitutional Court and succeeded the court’s top seat in April 2013. The remaining eight judges have until June to decide whether to uphold the impeachment. President Park was impeached by the parliament on Dec. 9 over allegations she allowed her confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs and extorted donations from local firms for foundations controlled by Choi. She has denied all the charges.   If the court rules to remove Park from office, a presidential election will be held within 60 days. By Ock Hyun-ju","his retirement ceremony tuesday ,impeachment trial of president ,retirement ceremony tuesday ,retirement ceremony tuesday the ,at his retirement ceremony","['Han', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00954577 0.23607799 0.36445004],KH디지털2,Social affairs,1,2017,"at his retirement ceremony tuesday ,his retirement ceremony tuesday ,uphold the impeachment president park ,retirement ceremony tuesday the public ,his retirement ceremony tuesday the","['Han', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Jung - mi', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Han', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Lee', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park ’s', 'Democratic Party of Korea ’s', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Progressive Party', 'North Korea', 'Kim Young - han', 'Busan', 'Seoul National University School of Law', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office', 'the Seoul Eastern District Court', 'Kim & Chang', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Choi']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.00954577 0.23607799 0.36445004]

She is also alleged to have allowed Choi to meddle in important state affairs. Park has persistently refuted all charges leveled against her and even hinted there may be a concerted move to remove her from office. She recently called charges of corruption and collusion ""preposterous and colossal lies"" and claimed that the media and her political opponents have spread falsehoods that gave the public distorted information.The team has been pressed for time, as its initial investigation period is due to end on Feb. 28. The period can be extended once by a month with consent from Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.While differences over the date have been reduced, the two sides still remain apart over the venue, the source said. Several places have been floated such as the Korea Banking Institute and an annex to the central government complex, both of which are located just hundreds of meters away from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.Observers say that Park may employ a two-track approach next month -- firming up the legal rationale for her denial of corruption charges while seeking to create a turn in public sentiment that has remained hostile towards her.Since the start of this year, Park hosted a press meeting and an interview with a conservative journalist in an apparent move to ease public fury over a slew of corruption allegations against her.The move drew the ire of many with her critics upbraiding her for the ""publicity stunt,"" but at the same time it is seen as rallying conservatives who have been mustering support and calling for her reinstatement.","next week presidential aide ,presidential aide said tuesday ,over her corruption allegations ,next week presidential ,week presidential aide","[""Park Geun - hye 's""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.63178617  0.29401293

The goal is to discover evidence the president actively gave out orders to ministries and conglomerates on behalf of Choi’s interests, so as to prove the bribery charges which constitute the core of her alleged wrongdoing.The raid is largely anticipated to take place within this week, especially considering that investigators are planning to summon Park for face-to-face questioning by mid-February.“I believe that legal sanctions are possible , should there be traces of evidence destruction,” independent counsel spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul said Wednesday.Independent counsel spokesperson Lee Kyu-chul speaks to reporters at a press conference But the Blue House has so far firmly resisted all search within its boundaries.The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office special unit, which initiated the investigation before handing it over to the independent counsel, had attempted to enter the perimeter late last year, but was thwarted by the presidential security team.Cheong Wa Dae’s consistent reasoning given was for “national and military security reasons,” but disputes have persisted concerning the presidential office’s alleged abuse of exemption power.Expecting obvious resistance from the presidential office, investigators are currently reviewing a number of scenarios, including the possible arrest of presidential security officials for interfering with public duty, should they resist the execution of the search warrant.Another variable for investigators and President Park is the possible summoning of Woo Byung-woo, formerly senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. Woo was one of the closest aides to the president until he stepped down amid a power abuse and bribery scandal. He is also suspected of having exerted influence on the Culture Ministry on behalf of the president and her confidante.The independent counsel team is scheduled to be in action until Feb. 28. It may extend its period by another month upon the approval of acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn.By Bae Hyun-jung","allegations pivoting on president ,park questioning special prosecutors ,corruption scandal but is ,pivoting on president ,search the presidential office","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cheong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.4646022   0.08340247

Choi Soon-sil is escorted to the court by a group of police officers and convoys The prosecutors dismissed Choi's criticism of their investigation as being groundless, vowing to continue a ""thorough"" probe into the scandal that has gripped the nation for the last several months.Choi is alleged to have extorted money and favors from large conglomerates, including Samsung Group, using her decades-old relationship with the president. She has refuted most of the charges leveled against her and rejected claims she colluded with the president.Some observers said Choi appears to be stalling for time by rejecting the prosecutors' call to appear for a direct inquiry. The independent counsel team's first investigation period ends Feb 28. It can be extended by a month with the consent from Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, but it remains to be seen whether Hwang would approve of the extension.Later in the day, the probe team plans to grill former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun over the allegations that the Park government had created and managed a blacklist of cultural figures deemed critical of it.It also plans to question Kim Kyung-sook, former dean of Ewha Womans University's College of Science and Industry Convergence, over the allegations the school gave undue favors to Chung Yoo-ra, Choi's daughter, related to admissions procedures and grades.","bribery allegations monday criticizing ,her bribery allegations monday ,profile corruption scandal rejected ,corruption scandal rejected the ,over her bribery allegations","['Park Geun - hye', 'Independent Counsel Park Young']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.13210666  0.12724683

Under the law, the team's investigation will be wrapped up at the end of February, although it is possible for it to be extended for another 30 days. Vice Chairman of Samsung Electronics Lee Jae-yong On Jan. 19, a local court rejected the issuing of an arrest warrant for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. The team believes that Lee ordered his company to give tens of millions of dollars to the president's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the state-run pension fund's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates. The court said at that time, ""It is hard to find a reason, necessity and appropriateness for the arrest at the current stage,"" adding that key issues, such as whether the money was for any kind of reciprocal favors, are still debated. Last weekend, the team summoned Hwang Sung-soo, a senior executive at Samsung Electronics and vice chairman of the Korea Equestrian Federation, for questioning over Samsung's role in supporting Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra. It also called in several people, including a former official at the federation and a former coach for Chung, to investigate what illegal requests, if any, Samsung Group made in return for huge financial support for Chung.It is said that the team has secured pieces of circumstantial evidence that Samsung voluntarily supported Chung by, for example, promising her a new expensive horse, which is against its former claims that it was coerced by the president to cough up the money.","seek arrest warrant again ,an arrest warrant again ,corruption scandal involving president ,arrest warrant again ,arrest warrant again for","['Park Geun', 'Lee Jae - yong', ""the Samsung Group 's""]",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59792721  0.31002012

Park was impeached last month over the scandal and the Constitutional Court is reviewing whether to formally end her rule.Choi created a stir Wednesday by shouting out accusations about prosecutors when she was brought to the office of prosecutors. Choi screamed out to reporters that the investigation was unfair and said she had been forced to confess untrue things about her relationship with Park. There is huge pressure on prosecutors amid widespread fury in South Korea over the charges against Choi and Park. Millions of South Koreans have taken to the streets to protest what prosecutors have described as collusion with Park that allowed Choi to pull government strings from the shadows. But on Thursday, her lawyer accused prosecutors of questioning Choi without informing him late on Christmas Eve in what he called a violation of a law that guarantees the right to counsel. During questioning that he said lasted until 1 a.m. on Christmas Day, the lawyer, Lee Gyeong-jae, said prosecutors used ""very shocking'' language that abused Choi's human rights. He said they threatened to ""annihilate'' Choi's family and make ""Choi and even her grandson live  so that they cannot hold their faces up.'' Lee said the threats to destroy a person's family was similar to the feudal language used during the Chosun Dynasty, which ruled the Korean Peninsula for 518 years before it was colonized by Japan in 1910.Lee accused prosecutors of trying to induce Choi to confess to things she had not done.Lee and Choi have previously raised similar accusations, but prosecutors dismissed them as groundless.Prosecutors said Wednesday they plan to question Park and search her office by early next month. Park has said she's willing to undergo questioning by the special prosecutors investigating the wide-ranging scandal. It's not clear if her office will allow the search of the presidential Blue House.To remove Park from office permanently, at least six of the Constitutional Court's nine justices must support her impeachment. Two of the nine justices will leave office in coming weeks -- one on Jan. 31 and the other on March 13 -- when their terms of office end. But six ""yes'' votes are still required even if some seats are vacant.Court head Park Han-chul, one of the departing justices, said the court's ruling should be issued by March 13.","thursday that prosecutors threatened ,south korean political scandal ,prosecutors threatened to annihilate ,prosecutors threatened park confidante ,political scandal in decades","['south korean', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.63716626  0.4449307

The president made clear that she is not involved in or had knowledge of wrongdoings related to Choi and vowed to prove her innocence in court. The presidential office has even hinted that prosecutors looking into the charges are biased and are not conducting their investigation in a fair manner.With the prosecutors working under a 70-day deadline that expires at the end of next month, Lee said they will decide whether to seek an extension closer to the date after considering progress made in the investigation, including the questioning of Park.","to search presidential office ,special prosecutors said tuesday ,ready to search presidential ,scandal centered on president ,to search presidential","['Park Geun - hye', 'Cheong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.55809021  0.38215387

Choi Kyung-hee, president of Ewha Womans University until October, attended a hearing for her arrest at the Seoul Central District Court over suspicions that she directed professors and school officials to accept Chung. In return for admissions favors for Chung, the probe team alleges the elite school received state subsidies and projects via her mother Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s close friend accused of meddling in state affairs. Choi Kyung-hee, ex-chief of Ewha Womans University, is surrounded by reporters as she arrives at the Seoul Central Districdt Court on Jan. 24, 2017, ahead of a court decision on her arrest. YonhapThe former university president is also accused of perjury, having denied during a parliamentary inquiry last month that she has never met Choi Soon-sil personally. The probe secured records of dozens of phone calls between the two in the year Chung was admitted. If arrested, Choi will be the fifth and highest official of Ewha to face the ordeal with regard to the 20-year-old horseback rider Chung. The court’s decision on her arrest was not available as of press time. It is expected to be announced late Tuesday or early Wednesday. The investigative team led by Special Counsel Park Young-soo has been looking into allegations that Chung was illegally admitted to Ewha and received special favors in grading despite her missing most of the classes as part of its high-profile, multifaceted inquiry into a massive corruption and influence-peddling scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park late last year. Four have been already arrested, including former dean of the university’s College of Science and Industry Kim Kyung-sook, former head of admissions Namkung Gon and Professor Lyou Chul-gyun. Chung is currently under the custody of Danish authorities.The probe team also expects to bring her home for questioning through the official extradition process, which Chung seems determined to resist. Repatriation could take several months, should Chung file a petition against the Danish court to avert repatriation. Besides special treatment in school, the “equestrian princess” holds key to another allegation in the sweeping scandal that ties her mother Choi Soon-sil to South Korea’s top conglomerate Samsung Group. Executives of the group, including its de facto chief and Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, are under investigation that they provided generous sponsorship to Chung and Choi’s sports business interests in return for the Park administration’s support of the group’s merger of two units.

After almost universal condemnation, there has been growing suspicions by conservatives who are loyal to Park that the investigation carried out by state prosecutors and the media may have been incomplete.","for impeachment trial president ,request 39 more witnesses ,impeachment trial president park ,witnesses for impeachment trial ,at her impeachment trial","['Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39788765  0.22773674

With key suspects increasingly implicating President Park in wrongdoings, special counsel Park Young-soo and his team of investigators are considering raiding the presidential office this week at the earliest and questioning Park face-to-face by early February.  Independent counsel Park Yong-soo . YonhapSince its launch on Dec. 21 last year, the probe has tightened its focus on Park over key allegations: her involvement in drawing up a blacklist of cultural figures critical of her administration and extorting donations from local firms in return for business favors.It suspects Park of ordering ex-Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and ex-Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, who are both jailed, to create and manage the blacklist. It could be an additional charge against the president in the ongoing investigation as well as the impeachment trial. Park is vehemently denying any wrongdoings, in particular regarding the blacklist, blasting media outlets for “manipulating public opinion.” She has criticized the independent counsel for being “politically biased” against her. “Park has never ordered anyone to write up a so-called blacklist,” said Park’s lawyer Hwang Seong-wook. He said Park will file a suit against the media outlet for defamation. The Constitutional Court is also quickening its court proceedings, with two more hearings scheduled for Monday and Wednesday before the nation’s public Lunar New Year holiday.Ex-Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong, TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek and Lee Seung-cul, vice chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries are to testify Monday. They are all accused of assisting Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s longtime friend and central figure in the scandal, to extort money and favors using her ties to the president. The remaining schedule for Park’s impeachment trial is expected to be confirmed this week as the court is set to finalize the list of witnesses amid growing expectations that the ruling will be made as early as in late February. The court earlier adopted statements by 46 suspects and witnesses at the prosecutorial questioning tied to the scandal as valid evidence, which means the witnesses do not have to testify to help reconstruct facts at the court. The parliamentary impeachment committee also withdrew its initial plan to call in 10 more people as witnesses before the court, which could contribute to bringing forward the court ruling.After the final hearing, it takes about two weeks for the nine-judge court to write up a verdict. The special counsel’s investigation is also set to accelerate -- with about a month left in its two-month probe period -- by starting to investigate Woo Byung-woo early next week. Woo is suspected of being involved in and condoning the irregularities surrounding Park and Choi while serving as a presidential secretary for civil affairs. Despite the failure to arrest Samsung Group’s de facto chief Lee Jae-yong, the special counsel team continues to look into whether Park extorted donations from local firms in return for business favors. The prosecution suspects Samsung Group offered bribes worth 443 billion won  to foundations controlled by Choi in return for the Park administration’s support for the merger of two Samsung affiliates. Choi, Park’s friend of 40 years, is standing trial over suspicions that she forced companies to make donations to the K-Sports and Mir foundations, which she controlled and used to funnel money to a paper company for personal gains. During the probe, the counsel team arrested former Health and Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo in regards to the Samsung bribery allegation, four officials from Ewha Womans University over alleged special treatment for Choi’s daughter Chung Yoo-ra and five government officials linked to the management of the blacklist.

Former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon and Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, both detained since last weekend for their suspected role in the creation of the list, appeared for questioning at special prosecutor Park Yong-soo’s office in Southern Seoul. Park’s team is trying to uncover who masterminded the administration’s alleged crackdown on around 10,000 artists deemed unfriendly to the government. The list is said to have some 10,000 names, including “Oldboy” director Park Chan-wook and poet Ko Un, whose name frequently surfaces for the Nobel literature prize.The investigators suspect that President Park may have been a key player in this.  Ex-presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon shows up at the special prosecutor’s office in Daechi-dong, southern Seoul, to face questioning over his involvement in blacklisting progressive artists deemed unfriendly to President Park Geun-hye. YonhapThe president, impeached by the parliament over the scandal in late December, vehemently denied her involvement in the making of such a list.“The president has never ordered anyone to create a blacklist,” her lawyer Lee Jung-hwan said in a statement on Saturday.“Any attempt by some specific groups to manipulate public opinions must be stopped. Media outlets should also release reports based on the truth.” Special prosecutor’s team has reportedly stepped up inquiries into allegations that Park instructed Kim and Cho to secretly crack down on leftwing artists amid rising criticism of Park’s inaction to the deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 that claimed about 300 lives.The blacklisting of artists can be another potential element of the case against Park in her ongoing impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court. Its existence was raised last year by former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong, who claimed that Park’s administration had been monitoring artists unfavorable to the president.Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea claimed that it was created after the 2014 ferry sinking to rein in artists and celebrities who criticized the government’s failure to cope with the disaster that killed about 300 people. It was used to exclude those critical of Park from state funding. Both Kim and Cho are said to be denying all allegations regarding the list. Also on Sunday, Jang Si-ho, a niece of Choi Soon-sil, President Park’s longtime friend, was questioned separately at the special prosecutor’s office under allegations of coercing donation from Samsung Group for the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center run by Jang. Jang admitted the allegation at the earlier parliamentary hearing and said it was all Choi’s idea.The niece was also questioned on whether the donations by Samsung were made in exchange for political support of a controversial merger deal between its affiliates. The probe team is poised to summon Park in early February to question her on her role both in the crackdown of anti-Park artists and her colluding with Choi to solicit corporate donations for their own gains. Park’s powers have been suspended since a motion of impeachment of Park under allegations of corruption and abuse of power was passed last December in South Korea’s biggest political corruption scandal involving her close friend Choi Soon-sil. The jailed confidante of Park is also fighting her own criminal trials under charges extorting roughly 77.4 billion won  from the nation’s top businesses with ties to the president. The court will decide in the coming months whether to end Park’s presidency on the allegations filed by the National Assembly.

The opposition bloc claims Park failed to fulfill her duty as the president to lead the rescue operation.The accident was cited as one of the grounds for Park's impeachment motion, which was passed by the National Assembly in December.The independent counsel seeks to prepare for a face-to-face investigation of Park, expected in February, based on the investigation of the two figures.Park's lawyers deny she made such an order to write a blacklist and said they will seek lawsuits on false accusations by the media.","scandal summoned two arrested ,two arrested key aides ,arrested key aides to ,arrested key aides ,summoned two arrested key","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Kim Ki - choon']",4,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.5466783  -0.06438997

Ahn Min-suk of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea raised the suspicion during a parliamentary hearing late last year that Jang had registered six illegal mobile phones and that one of them may have gone into the hands of the president. Cheong Wa Dae has flatly denied the suspicion. The chairman of the minor opposition People’s Party harshly criticized Cheong Wa Dae and the president, calling them “a crime group.” “From the president herself to her aides, it turned out they were using burner phones. Is this a proper nation? Is that what has been going on at the presidential office?” Rep. Park Jie-won said in a party meeting. “I see them only as a gang and a crime group.” Tthe National Assembly impeached Park on Dec. 9 last year after a massive corruption broke out over allegations that she allowed Choi to meddle in state affairs and abused her authority to coerce large funds from conglomerates in return for favors. Jang is also suspected of conspiring with Choi to run paper companies to embezzle funds from donations made by Samsung Group.By Jo He-rim","her impeachment trial thursday ,controversy south korean president ,trial thursday former presidential ,thursday former presidential aide ,park illegal phone","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'the Constitutional Court']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.476789    0.20403852

The former aide began serving Park in the late 90s. He is known as a member of the ""doorknob trio"" who had direct access to the president. Former presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong ""It's a rather painful side of our politics, but there has long been controversy about wiretapping,"" he said in response to a question from a parliamentary impeachment panel, which serves as the prosecution in the trial.

Park is accused of allowing Choi to meddle in state affairs, access government secrets and extort money and favors from businesses by using their 40-year relationship.  The special counsel team has focused on bribery, however, zeroing in on Samsung, the largest conglomerate in South Korea. The major challenge is that most of the economic benefits were offered to the president’s confidante Choi and her associates, while it is the president who is suspected of exerting power upon government departments and conglomerates.It was for this reason that the prosecution’s special probe team, which had led the investigation before the independent counsel, had excluded the president’s bribery charges in its final arraignment. Prosecutors had also defined conglomerates, including Samsung Group, not as suspects but as victims of the high-profile coercion.Circumstantial evidence gathered so far has indicated that a massive sum of money -- 43 billion won  according to investigators -- was handed from Samsung Group to Choi and her family members.The special counsel claims that the amount was paid in exchange for Park putting pressure on the National Pension Service to support a merger between the group’s two affiliates -- Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries.The disputed merger of the two units increased Lee’s equity ratio in the group, helping his inheritance of control over the company. The NPS was at the time the largest shareholder of Samsung C&T; and later faced hundreds of billions in losses due to the merger.But the dismissal of the warrant reflects that the court is not convinced, suggesting that the president exerted influence on behalf of Choi.Prosecutors earlier claimed that President Park and Choi should be seen as accomplices in the entire scandal, as the two share common economic interests.Now facing a roadblock, the independent counsel is highly likely to extend its 70-day period by another month so that it can carry on with the probe up to the end of March.Also, the face-to-face questioning of the president may be put off to mid-February or later, according to observers.By Bae Hyun-jung","arrest warrant for samsung ,setback in park investigation ,the bribery allegation centered ,her infamous friend choi ,investigation the court refusal","['Samsung Group ’s', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14771719  0.04778369

""Although its impact on the national economy is crucial, it is more important to set justice straight.""The Seoul mayor said the independent counsel should reapply for the warrant to root out corruption and reform local conglomerates. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon Local conglomerates have been under fire for being linked to the scandal, where Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil is accused of exerting influence on state affairs for personal benefit. She is also charged with colluding with the president to extort money from local businesses.Lee allegedly gave or promised some 43 billion won  worth of bribes to Choi, who has been taken into custody, in return for the state-run pension fund's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015.Rep. Park Young-sun of the Democratic Party said the court's decision indicates Samsung stands at the peak of the country's power structure during an interview with CBS Radio.The lawmaker also expressed concern that the decision will also adversely impact the independent counsel's investigation going forward. Investigators said they planned to check other conglomerates who had donated money to two non-profit organizations that was created with Park's backing and linked to Choi.Both the president, who was impeached by parliament on Dec. 9 in regards to the scandal, and Choi have refuted all allegations raised and even accused the prosecution of concocting crimes that did not exist. The chief executive has vowed to prove her innocence in court.","peddling scandal involving president ,rejection of samsung heir ,samsung heir arrest ,opposition condemns court rejection ,court rejection of samsung","['Seoul', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Group', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Lee']",4,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.15928687  0.11279796

591,591,591,[BREAKING] Court rejects arrest warrant for Samsung’s Lee Jae-yong,"A South Korean court Thursday rejected an arrest warrant for Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong over a corruption scandal that led to President Park Geun-hye’s impeachment. 　 ""It is hard to acknowledge the reason, necessity and appropriateness for the arrest at the current stage (of the investigation)"" the Seoul Central District Court said, citing lack of evidence and key issues that are still debated ...","A South Korean court Thursday rejected an arrest warrant for Samsung Group’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong over a corruption scandal that led to President Park Geun-hye’s impeachment.  ""It is hard to acknowledge the reason, necessity and appropriateness for the arrest at the current stage "" the Seoul Central District Court said, citing lack of evidence and key issues that are still debated as the reasons for the rejection. Following the court's decision, the 48-year-old tycoon was immediately released from a detention facility just south of Seoul at around 5 a.m., where he was placed behind bars for nearly 14 hours while waiting for the decision.  Lee Jae-yong leaves Seoul Detention House in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, early morning on Jan. 19.The independent counsel team looking into the corruption scandal sought the warrant for Lee on Monday on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. According to the independent counsel team, Lee offered bribes worth 43 billion won  to Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the Park administration’s backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the young tycoon -- the only son of the illness-stricken Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee -- to tighten his grip on his family’s massive corporate empire. Lee denies all charges, saying he was forced to make donations to entities controlled by Choi, including the K-Sports and Mir foundations, and did not seek any business favors in return. Samsung Group expressed relief over the court’s decision. “We are relieved that Samsung Group can fight for truth without Lee’s detention. We will do our best to clarify the fact that Samsung Group has never made donations  in return for favors regarding the merger of Samsung C&T;’s and Cheil Industries,” said Samsung Group. “We feel sorry and regrettable that we have been involved in such allegations.” The court's rejection for Lee's arrest warrant is likely to deal a blow to investigators who have been accelerating the probe into the bribery allegations involving Park, Choi and local firms. The alleged Samsung bribery is a primary charge for President Park’s ongoing impeachment trial under review at the Constitutional Court. Park is accused of colluding with Choi and her aides to extort money from Samsung and a score of other local business groups, giving them favors in return.   Several other Korean conglomerates, including LG Group and Hyundai Motor Group, also made donations to Choi’s foundations, although the investigation has not extended to them yet.

The NPS was at the time the largest shareholder of Samsung C&T;, giving it influence over the deal, which led to hundreds of billions in losses for the public corporation.Samsung Group`s heir apparent and vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, Lee Jae-yong The currently suspended president is also suspected of having delivered documents to Lee during their closed-door meetings, asking the Samsung chief to offer support to Choi’s daughter Chung in her equestrian activities and Choi’s niece Jang Si-ho in her sports businesses.The backscratching relationship between the Samsung chief and Choi seems to be gaining credence, but investigators still have to prove President Park’s involvement. “We have secured substantial evidence to prove the complicity between President Park and Choi,” said Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for the independent counsel Monday.“We have proven to a certain extent that the two share common economic interests in various ways.”Based on this, the bribery allegation involving Lee and Choi may eventually lead back to the incumbent president’s involvement.Though the final decision on Lee’s alleged wrongdoing is to be made by the court, the issuance of an arrest warrant for the top businessman is deemed a litmus test for the special prosecutors’ achievements so far.Should the court agree to issue the warrant, it will reduce the grounds for the president to continue shunning the independent counsel investigation.Park, despite her earlier vows to “respond faithfully to the independent counsel’s investigation,” has so far refused to show up in person, continuously denying all the charges raised against her.But if Lee’s arrest is approved by the court, it could give the investigators new momentum and could lead to them questioning the president in person. “I believe that  should take place no later than early February,” said spokesperson Lee on Tuesday.As this was the first time that he mentioned a timeline, speculation mounted that investigators are closing in on Park.For similar reasons, it is considered plausible that investigators may attempt to raid and search the presidential compound of Cheong Wa Dae within the month, to gain access to official records related to Park’s charges.Officials had tried to search the Blue House in October last year, but the presidential security team refused to cooperate, citing the need to protect confidential documents on national security.By Bae Hyun-jung","samsung chief arrest ,businessman offered 43 billion ,36 million in bribes ,special prosecutors extra ammunition ,influence peddling scandal president","['Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Group', 'Park Geun - hye']",4,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.17345548  0.48931754

Looking tense and grim-faced, he immediately headed toward a black car that was on standby and left for the detention center.Lee Jae-yong “We  sufficiently clarified allegations. We are certain that the court will make a wise decision,” Lee’s lawyer Song Woo-chul told reporters. “The sticking point was whether the donations were for business favors.” He is set to wait at the detention center for the court’s decision. If the warrant is issued, he will immediately be taken into custody and will face the ongoing probe in jail. If the warrant is rejected, he will be set free. An independent counsel investigating the scandal involving President Park sought a warrant for Lee on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury Monday. Lee is suspected of offering bribes worth 43 billion won  to Park’s longtime friend Choi in return for the Park administration’s backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates. The merger was a crucial step for the heir apparent to tighten his grip on the firm ahead of a power transfer.Lee has denied all charges, saying he was forced to make donations to entities including the K-Sports and Mir foundations set up and controlled by Choi. In a session to review the warrant application, Samsung’s lawyers allegedly argued that Samsung Group never sought business favors from the government in return for the donations. They also allegedly said it is not necessary to detain Lee, citing he is not a flight risk.  The prosecution, on the other hand, claimed that detainment is necessary to uphold the law and justice, citing how the arrest will impact the ongoing investigation into the bribery allegations surrounding Park, Choi and local firms. By Ock Hyun-ju","arrest warrant samsung ,arrest warrant samsung group ,on arrest warrant samsung ,hearing on his arrest ,on his arrest warrant","['Samsung Group ’s', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.04881499  0.10596308

Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban's aide also refuted an opposition lawmaker's claim that his brother's company was expelled from the UN Global Compact after engaging in mining activities that ran counter to the initiative's environmental principle. The initiative is a corporate sustainability movement that underscores universal principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.Ban's aide said that his brother has no relations to any illegitimate mining business.Allegations involving Ban's relatives emerged amid his aggressive efforts to build grassroots support ahead of a presidential election this year. Though Ban has yet to officially declare his bid for the country's top elected office, he has repeatedly signaled his strong presidential ambitions, vowing to work for a change in politics -- in an apparent swipe at establishment politicians.","aide denies new allegations ,aide on wednesday denied ,brother former un secretary ,false reports the aide ,wednesday denied reports that","['UN', ""Ban Ki - moon 's"", 'Ban', 'Myanmar', 'Ban']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51545185  0.60870367

A court decision on whether the de facto chief of the country’s largest conglomerate will be taken into custody is expected to come later Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. As Lee, 48, appeared at the Seoul Central District Court at 9:55 a.m., journalists bombarded him with questions, but he quickly walked past the crowd to the courtroom without answering any questions. An independent counsel investigating the scandal surrounding President Park sought a warrant for Lee on charges of offering bribes to Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the Park administration’s backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and only son of the ill-stricken Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee, has denied all charges, saying he was forced to make donations to entities including the K-Sports and Mir foundations set up and controlled by Choi. In a session to review the warrant application, Samsung’s lawyers are expected to argue it is not necessary to detain Lee, citing he is not a flight risk and his absence from the company could pose a threat to the nation’s economy. The prosecution, on the other hand, is expected to argue detainment is necessary to uphold law and justice, citing how the arrest will impact the ongoing investigation into the bribery allegations surrounding Park, Choi and local firms. By Ock Hyun-ju","seoul on an arrest ,arrest warrant in widening ,country largest corruption scandal ,park geun hye impeachment ,largest corruption scandal","['Samsung Group ’s', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.32817316  0.06149234

He said Park had directly interacted with Samsung’s management in raising donations for the entity controlled by Choi and Jang.Choi Soon-sil  and her niece Jang Si-ho  are seated with their attorneys at a courtroom of the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul on Tuesay  The three -- who are all jailed -- are accused of colluding to force Samsung Electronics to contribute more than 1.6 billion won  in donations to the winter sports center through its affiliate Cheil World Wide. The trio’s suspected extortion -- using ties to the president or under her direct orders --- is one of the charges facing Park in her ongoing impeachment trial.  During the hearing at the Seoul Central District Court, the accused appeared in prison uniforms and sat side by side. They barely looked at each other, only talking to their lawyers and focusing on the court proceedings.  The appearance at the court of Jang, 37, and Choi, 60, came amid speculations that their family ties had deteriorated, as Jang had submitted key evidence against her aunt -- a tablet PC supposedly owned by Choi -- to the independent counsel investigating the scandal. The two appeared to shift the liability to each other. While Jang admitted to forcing Samsung Group to sponsor the center -- where she served as a secretary-general -- and embezzling some of the donations for her personal gain, Choi firmly denied any wrongdoing. She claimed that she only intended to help Jang set up and run the organization for a good cause and said her niece was its de facto owner. “She did not abuse her authority by collaborating with Jang. She only asked the Vice Culture and Sports Minister Kim to help run the center,” Choi’s lawyer said. The prosecution sees Choi as a main suspect who made “important” decisions and gave specific instructions to Jang in the fundraising.  Jang’s admission came a day after the independent counsel sought an arrest warrant for Samsung Group’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong on charges of offering bribes to Choi in return for the Park administration backing a merger of two Samsung affiliates.The donation for the winter sports center is suspected of being part of the total bribe worth 43.3 billion won that Samsung Group gave to entities -- including the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- that are closely linked to Choi and the president. Meanwhile, Vice Minister Kim Chong’s claims that implicate Park in the alleged extortion are in line with testimonies given by ex-Presidential Secretary An Chong-bum during the hearing at the Constitutional Court on Monday. An said Park gave detailed instructions in the process of forcing donations from local firms.  “According to An’s memo book, the donation was made through direct communication between Samsung’s management and the presidential office,” Kim’s lawyer said. Choi is standing a separate trial for meddling in state affairs and colluding with the ex-presidential aide An to coerce big companies to make donations to the Mir and K-Sports foundations she controlled.  Choi has so far denied all the charges. The next hearing is scheduled for Jan. 25 during which officials from Cheil World Wide will testify. By Ock Hyun-ju","extorting donation from samsung ,park impeachment denied the ,in the corruption scandal ,at court hearing tuesday ,led to park impeachment","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil ’s', 'Jang Si - ho', 'Samsung Group', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Kim Chong']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07917195  0.44775257

At the fifth hearing of the Constitutional Court on Monday, Choi faced questioning by representatives of the National Assembly, which passed the impeachment bill last month. The questions focused on her alleged influence-peddling in state affairs and the troubled foundations which collected donations from companies, including Samsung. On the witness stand, Choi displayed her uneasiness in facing the allegations, interrupted people as they asked her questions and denied any wrongdoing.  When asked about her role in policymaking with President Park in the cultural sector, Choi took issue with the intention behind the question, saying, “What role could I possibly have in state affairs with the president?” Choi had allegedly helped her associate Cha Eun-taek, a former TV commercial director, to win lucrative cultural projects. Cha’s charges include abuse of power, coercion and embezzlement.Choi Soon-sil enters a courtroom in Seoul for the fifth hearing on a motion of impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, Jan. 16, 2017. In answer to another question on what she did on the day the ferry Sewol sank, she said, “I don’t even remember what happened yesterday.” Choi also responded defensively when quizzed over whether the Ministry of Culture had ever assisted the two entities -- the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- that are suspected to be covers for channeling money to her own interests. She said, “Why would you even ask me that when I have no relationship with the ministry?”  Other remarks Choi made at the hearing included, “I don’t exactly get what you want to hear from me,” “Ask more specifically,” and “This is not a prosecutor’s investigation, so no loaded questions.”  Regarding questions on the testimony she gave at a prosecutorial investigation earlier, she refused to answer, claiming that she was “forced to make confessions” during the investigation. The shameless court demeanor of Choi, however, turned 180 degrees in the afternoon, when the questioning from President Park’s attorney began at the same court. To questions asked by Park’s lawyer, Lee Jung-hwan, Choi answered them thoroughly, without using vague words or refusing to answer. She even shed tears while vehemently defending her embattled friend. “Park has no one else around, so I just wanted to help her.” she said.        It is the first time that Choi has attended the impeachment trial of her longtime friend President Park. Since Dec. 9, Park’s presidential powers have been suspended, after the National Assembly voted to impeach her. She is now fighting the case in court, claiming she is not an accomplice in the Choi scandal. As criticism surfaced over Choi’s demeanor during the trial, Choi’s lawyer fired back, saying, “The questions were subpar.” Choi is jailed and standing a criminal trial of her own. She is accused of forcing businesses to give donations to two nonprofit foundations by using her ties to the president, which led to Park being suspended from office last December.

The 60-year-old, who has known Park for 40 years, had so far refused to attend, citing the ongoing investigation and her own trial. She is on trial for colluding with Park and presidential secretaries to extort 77.4 billion won  from local businesses in the form of donations to two non-profit foundations she controlled. The entities -- the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- are suspected to be covers for channeling money for Choi’s personal gain.An Chong-bum, Park’s former aide who is standing trial on the same charges as Choi, has also been summoned to the Constitutional Court’s Monday hearing as a witness.  On Tuesday, the court will put other key witnesses on the stand, including former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong and Ko Young-tae, a former associate of Choi. Yoo, who stepped down in July 2014 amid a fallout with Park, will be questioned over Park’s alleged abuse of power to help Choi’s foundations and fundraising for them. Yoo also disclosed earlier in a recent radio interview that he saw a blacklist detailing thousands of anti-government artists in June 2014, shortly before he was replaced. The allegation is currently being investigated by Special Counsel Young-soo, but is not listed in Park’s impeachment motion.Former presidential secretaries An Bong-geun, Jeong Ho-seong and Lee Jae-man are scheduled to testify Thursday about Park’s whereabouts during the “missing seven hours” on April 16, 2014, when the ferry Sewol sank, resulting in the loss of more than 300 lives. Park’s lawyers submitted last week a 16-page statement to clear suspicions about the president’s alleged neglect of duty during the national disaster, but the court dismissed it as “insufficient” and ordered a resubmission. The president herself might be attending the upcoming hearings amid widening criticism of her no-shows at the impeachment trial, according to Yonhap News on Sunday. She has so far refused to appear. Some of Park’s former aides such as An Chong-bum and Lee Jae-man -- considered key persons with knowledge of Park-Choi ties, as well as the president’s whereabouts on the day of the Sewol disaster -- have also failed to attend the trial so far. The court couldn’t deliver summonses to them because they could not be contacted or found at their registered addresses all week. By law, witnesses cannot punished if they did not receive their summonses. Since Dec. 9, Park’s presidential powers have been suspended as the National Assembly voted to impeach her over violations of the Constitution, abuse of power and bribery, among other charges.  Over the past few months, millions of protesters took to the streets to demand her immediate resignation, but Park indicated that she will fight the case in court.  If the witnesses fail to appear at court this week, the court is expected to proceed without them. The Constitutional Court has until June to decide whether to officially end her presidency or reinstate her.By Bak Se-hwan","this week her lawyer ,park impeachment trial choi ,impeachment trial choi soon ,attend the impeachment trial ,at park impeachment trial","['Choi soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park ’s', 'South Korea ’s']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47200197  0.24051033

Lee Young-sun, the presidential office’s administrative staff in charge of Park’s security, refused to confirm how many times Choi and Park’s other confidants secretly visited her at the presidential office. Park’s friend of 40 years, Choi is at the center of a massive corruption scandal which led to Park’s impeachment by the parliament on Dec. 9. Lee Young-sun, the presidential office’s administrative staff in charge of Park’s security, arrives at the court “Whether Choi entered the presidential office is not a national secret. Why should the number of times Choi visited Cheong Wa Dae be kept a secret?” said Kang Il-won, the lead justice of the Constitutional Court. “If it is not related to you or your family’s crime, you should testify. The issues surrounding Choi are a crucial point here.” Lee, suspected of driving Choi in and out of Cheong Wa Dae and closely assisting her, did not confirm whether he saw Choi at the presidential office, saying “I cannot reveal anything related to my job.” Justice Lee Jeong-mi accused him of committing “perjury” when he denied driving Choi into the presidential office, citing a text message exchanged between him and an arrested ex-presidential aide, Jeong Ho-seong, who is charged with leaking government secrets to Choi. Lee admitted to having sent the text message, discovered on Jeong’s phone, in which he said that “Choi is coming in.” The message is suggested to mean that Choi is coming into the presidential office – possibly escorted by Lee. He only admitted that he had first met Choi sometime around the 2012 presidential election, and met her several times at a dressmaker’s shop in southern Seoul while picking up clothes for Park until early 2016. Allegations have suggested that Lee carried Park’s close friends including Choi and unauthorized doctors in his car to get them into the presidential office without having their identities checked. Lee also appeared to go back on his earlier statement given during the prosecutorial questioning that he had never delivered money to Choi on behalf of Park. Choi is suspected of paying for Park’s clothes, which could constitute bribery. Another witness, Ryu Hee-in, former secretary-general of the National Security Council and a member of the parliamentary committee investigating the cause of the Sewol ferry sinking, said that the president was “ultimately” responsible for handling the maritime disaster.“I cannot understand that the presidential office does not serve as a control tower in cases of disaster, given my past experience ,” he said, dismissing Park’s then-security adviser Kim Jang-soo’s claims that the presidential office was not in charge of coping with the accident. Park’s alleged seven-hour absence and negligence of duty to save people’s lives during the maritime disaster, in which more than 300 people died or went missing, is one of the key elements of her impeachment. A former CEO and a staff reporter for a local daily also testified on the government’s alleged crackdown on the media outlet since it reported in 2014 on a document revealing Jeong Yun-hoe’s meddling in state affairs and personnel appointments. Jeong is Choi’s ex-husband.The hearing comes amid growing frustration over delays in court proceedings caused by the continued absence of key witnesses and their reluctance to give detailed testimonies.Other than the ongoing impeachment trial, Park is facing an investigation by an independent counsel over suspicions that she conspired with Choi and ex-presidential aide An Chong-bum to extort donations and favors from local conglomerates. Choi’s niece and close associates are all being tried for criminal charges including attempted fraud, abuse of power and coercion. President Park, Choi, An and Jeong all deny their charges, and even questioning the validity and legitimacy of major pieces of evidence, in what critics see as a tactic to prolong the court proceedings at the Constitutional Court. But Lee Joong-hwan, Park’s lawyer, said that Park has no intention of delaying court proceedings. “We are just very busy reviewing more than 40,000 pages of documents,” he said during a briefing Thursday.Meanwhile, Kwon Seong-dong, chairman of the judiciary committee in the National Assembly, told reporters that the parliamentary committee officially requested Park’s lawyers for explanation on the president’s work from her residence in the presidential office. “The president’s work from home has no legal grounds and it is illegitimate,” he said. The request comes after the president submitted to the court a document detailing a timeline for what briefings she received and orders she gave while working at her residence in the presidential office on the day of the ferry sinking.

Gangnam Station The Seoul High Court upheld a lower court's decision and convicted the man, surnamed Kim, of stabbing the victim, whose identity was withheld, multiple times in a bathroom in a building near Gangnam Station in May last year. The victim was a complete stranger to Kim.   According to prosecutors, the 34-year-old waited for about 50 minutes for a woman to show up in the bathroom. When the victim came into the unisex restroom, Kim attacked her with a knife.The court said it took into consideration the seriousness of the crime, the fact that it was done against a stranger and the social anxiety caused by the incident. While acknowledging that Kim was suffering from schizophrenia, the court did not accept the defendant's claim that he was feeble-minded when he committed the crime.Kim has a record of being hospitalized for the mental disease more than six times since 2009, according to prosecutors. Since he left the hospital for the last time in January 2016, he had not taken his medication or received treatment and had lived on the streets since March, according to prosecutors. The case has triggered nationwide debate over crimes against women in the country. Thousands of South Korean women took to the streets after the incident, paying their respects to the victim, and voiced the need to intensify punishment for crimes targeting vulnerable members of society.","for gangnam murder suspect ,upholds 30 year jail ,gangnam murder suspect ,stabbing to death 22 ,gangnam murder suspect an","['Seoul', 'Gangnam Station', 'Kim']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.28723687  0.46520233

Choi Soon-sil enters a courtroom in the Seoul Central District Court, Jan. 11, 2017. State prosecutors refuted Choi’s claim, saying there was no pressure or coercion on her to confess. “She didn’t make any confession in the first place,” said a prosecutor at the trial. They also stressed that An’s memo books were seized in a warranted search of his home and office. Prosecutors raised questions about the ulterior motive behind the “groundless claims” made by Choi and An. “We cannot help but suspect that the president is behind this and that the defendants are conspiring to hinder this trial and to stop any evidence that may work against the president from being admitted,” the prosecutor said. President Park, Choi and An are accused of extorting money from conglomerates for foundations controlled by Choi, among other allegations. Park, immune to criminal liability as a sitting president, is standing trial for impeachment at the Constructional Court, while Choi and An, both currently jailed, are fighting at the Seoul Central District Court against charges including abuse of power and attempted fraud. State prosecutors allege that Choi and An pressured 50 companies, including the country’s largest conglomerate Samsung, to donate 77.4 billion won  to two foundations controlled by Choi.The entities -- the Mir and K-Sports foundations -- are suspected to be covers for channeling money for Choi’s personal gain. Choi’s attorney Lee rejected the accusation at the hearing, denying her involvement in the corporate fundraising. Choi simply gave advice to the president about issues involving the two foundations at Park’s request, Lee said.An’s memo books, which detail the president’s directives regarding the donations, are seen as one of the most important pieces of evidence that could implicate all three in this massive corruption and influence-peddling case, along with two tablet PCs alleged used by Choi. The memo books, totaling 16, were handed over to the court Wednesday, although the judges will have to determine whether they can be accepted. An’s attorney claimed they were “illegally taken during a prosecution raid while he was detained in a cell.”Choi also denied the ownership of the two tablet PCs. One of them was obtained by a local TV channel and ignited the scandal in October last year. The other was recently submitted by Choi’s niece, Jang Si-ho, to Special Counsel Park Young-soo.  The second device secured by the special counsel team contains emails regarding Samsung’s provision of financial support to Choi’s German businesses, Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for the special prosecutors’ office, told reporters Wednesday.  The Seoul Central District Court will hold the third hearing in the Choi-An trial next week.

Lee Kyu-chul, spokesman for th special investigation team at a press briefing Samsung Group allegedly struck a 22 billion won  contract with the company owned by Choi and her daughter under the name of a consulting arrangement to fund the daughter's equestrian training.Investigators are looking into suspicions that the contract was signed in return for the state-run pension fund's backing of a major merger deal between Samsung subsidiaries in 2015. There have been allegations that the state fund was pressured by the presidential office to support the merger in return for favors Samsung gave to Choi.

She spoke with her national security adviser on the phone for a total of seven times about the ferry accident, according to a 19-page document submitted by her lawyers for her impeachment trial Tuesday. However, the document detailing the president’s actions on April 16, 2014 was dismissed by the Constitutional Court as “insufficient,” during the third hearing of her impeachment trial.   Park’s alleged seven-hour absence and negligence of duty to save people’s lives during the maritime disaster, which left more than 300 people dead or missing, is one of the key reasons behind her impeachment on Dec. 9 by the parliament.The document features a timeline for the reports she received from her aides via documents or telephone and her instructions during the ferry disaster.  But the Constitutional Court took issue with the explanation, saying it falls short of details on what Park was doing as she was being briefed during the sinking of the ferry, as well as when and how she first learned about the accident. “We asked President Park to reveal what she did on the day, but the document appears to be insufficient . It only includes what orders she gave and what reports she received,” the court said, asking Park to “recall” her memories in order to clarify her actions while the ferry was capsizing. It asked her lawyers to supplement the document and submit it again. Park’s lawyers claimed that Park took proper measures via telephone to handle the maritime accident, but they did not provide Park’s records of phone calls during the accident. “The document said that the president made numerous phone calls with presidential aides, but only a written report sent to the president is attached,” said the court, asking Park’s lawyers to hand in the president’s phone records. In the third formal hearing to review the legitimacy of Park’s impeachment, three key witnesses -- Park’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil as well as ex-presidential aides Jeong Ho-seong and An Chong-bum -- were scheduled to testify before the court.But they all refused to appear, citing the hearing’s possible impact on their own criminal trials. In what appears to be a warning to the witnesses who have refused to testify before the justices, the court said it will forcibly bring in the witnesses if they fail to show up again at the upcoming hearings. The court sternly renewed calls for cooperation from both the National Assembly’s impeachment committee and Park’s lawyers in submitting relevant documents and evidence in an apparent attempt to quicken court proceedings. According to Park’s defense paper, submitted 19 days after the court’s request, Park was first briefed by presidential aides at 10 a.m., one hour after the ferry started to capsize off the nation’s southwest coast.Park worked from her residence at the presidential office, as she did not feel well that day and had no official schedule, the document said. She reviewed reports and was briefed about state affairs via email, fax and post. She then learned at around 2:50 p.m. from Kim Jang-soo -- who was then national security secretary -- that the news reports about 370 passengers being rescued from the sinking ferry were incorrect. The president decided to visit the central disaster headquarters at around 3 p.m. and made her first public appearance that day at 5:15 p.m.Only a nursing officer and hair stylist visited her residence while the ferry was sinking, according to the document. The National Assembly’s impeachment committee denounced the document as ""insufficient,"" saying that it is a tactic to delay the court proceedings. It said that her seven-hour absence during the ferry disaster was the primary reason why Koreans lost trust in her and described it as “a collapse of the nation’s crises management system.” In the next hearing scheduled for Thursday, those who will be questioned include presidential office administrative staff Lee Young-sun, who took charge of Park’s personal affairs, as well as a former CEO of Segye Daily, who was allegedly laid off due to pressure from the presidential office. Park’s confidante Choi, who is at the center of the corruption scandal, as well as ex-presidential aide An will be called in to testify again Monday.By Ock Hyun-ju","her impeachment trial tuesday ,impeachment trial tuesday however ,impeachment trial tuesday ,lawyers for her impeachment ,ferry sewol sank president",['Park Geun'],4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16588734  0.21570209

An investigation revealed that an unlicensed contractor was hired for the construction work, while safety regulations and a host of other on-site rules were ignored. Supervisors were also absent at the sites and had faked work documents. After the law revision, contractors will be held responsible from the time the construction begins instead of after the work is finished. Faking work documents will be punishable by up to two years of business suspension instead of the current six months, including for on-site employees instead of just the company. Inspections of construction material and quality assessments of completed work will also be reinforced with more detailed requirements, the ministry said.","three years of imprisonment ,25 000 in fines ,criminal penalty for shoddy ,monday law revisions proposed ,imprisonment or maximum 30","['the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14336415  0.17516063

Park was impeached in December by the parliament over the scandal. The panel summoned 20 figures involved in the case, but some key witnesses, including Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, former Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo and former Ewha Womans University President Choi Kyung-hee, said they wouldn't participate.  A professor from Ehwa Womans University, a former head of the K-Sports Foundation and Park Sang-jin, a high-ranking executive from Samsung Electronics Co., are expected to appear before the National Assembly. The university faces allegations that it gave admissions and academic favors to Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra.  The K-Sports Foundation and Mir were virtually controlled by Choi and collected large-sum donations from local conglomerates under the name of public projects. Investigators suspect Choi attempted to take control of the foundations' assets.  Chung Yoo-ra after her preliminary hearing in a court in Aalborg, Denmark South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group allegedly signed a 22 billion-won  contract with a Germany-based company owned by Choi and financially supported her daughter Chung's purchase of equestrian horses, training and other costs.  Previous hearings questioned business tycoons, presidential staffers and other figures linked to the scandal but mostly ended fruitless amid the absence of key figures and witnesses' reluctance to deliver critical testimonies.  The parliamentary inquiry panel, which kicked off Nov. 17, will officially terminate its activities Sunday.","parliament over the scandal ,hearing monday the committee ,peddling scandal of president ,was impeached in december ,its last hearing monday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40333027  0.10412303

Former Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok on Sunday enters the special prosecutors’ office in Daechi-dong, southern Seoul, to face questioning over alleged involvement in keeping a blacklist against anti-government artists. ” were summoned as suspects, so the next step is to decide whether to request an arrest warrant on them,” Lee Kyu-chul, spokesperson for the special prosecutors‘ office, told reporters. The two former officials have been in stern denial. Minister Kim even claimed in the parliamentary hearings last month that he had not seen such a list, let alone been involved in it.Investigators are focusing on finding out whether the list, allegedly written by the President Chief of Staff’s Office, was handed over to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism by Kim Sang-ryul, who was at the time the presidential official in charge.The so-called blacklist was first disclosed to the public late last year by former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong, Minister Kim‘s predecessor, who claimed that Park’s administration has been monitoring and discouraging artistic circles that are not favorable to the president.It reportedly included some of the country’s most renowned cultural figures, including “Oldboy” film director Park Chan-wook and poet Ko Un, whose name frequently surfaces for the Nobel literature prize.Also, the list contained the names of actors who have signed statements criticizing the government’s failure to prevent the 2014 ferry sinking that claimed more than 300 passengers, according to opposition lawmaker Do Jong-hwan, who broke the list to the media.The resummoning of the two key cultural officials, marking their second questioning at the special prosecutors, triggered speculations that chief independent counsel Park Young-soo recently decided to tighten his grip on the issue, with evidence backing up the existence of such a list.The forthcoming investigation result is deemed a crucial step leading up to the suspected connection of the list to the upper-level administration, involving incumbent Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun and former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon.“We have been investigating a number of key witnesses and suspects involved in making the list for artists to cut state support,“ spokesperson Lee told reporters earlier. “After we finish handling the case, we will decide whether we shall continue summoning former presidential chief of staff Kim and Culture Minister Cho.”By Bak Se-hwan","corruption scandal involving president ,southern seoul over suspicions ,scandal involving president park ,aide quizzed over blacklist ,peddling and corruption scandal","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Jong - deok', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.081939    0.07817102

Chung and Shin were both previously questioned by the investigation team earlier last month, but this time their statuses have changed to suspect from witness. The team, led by Independent Counsel Park Young-soo, has been intensifying its probe into the alleged blacklist, summoning a number of officials related to the case.

It said it is looking into part of the documents to see whether Park and Choi are involved in drawing up the list, how it was written and whether it was used to exclude blacklisted figures from key posts in the Culture Ministry and state support. Lim Dai-ki, CEO of Samsung affiliate Cheil Industries, passes through a press line while entering the independent counsel office building Friday to face questioning on the alleged ties between the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil and Samsung Group Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun and ex-Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon are likely to be questioned in the coming days for their involvement in creating and managing the blacklist involving nearly 10,000 artists, film directors and painters. Cheil Industries CEO Lim is the second high-ranking official from Samsung to be called in for questioning. Late last month, the counsel team brought in Kim Jae-yeol, the president of Samsung Sports Business of Cheil Industries. More key Samsung officials, possibly including Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, are expected to be brought in for questioning soon.Samsung Electronics donated about 1.6 billion won  through Cheil Industries’ sports body to the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, which was set up and controlled by Choi’s niece Chang Si-ho. According to the probe, Choi, Chang and former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong pressured the Samsung official Kim to sponsor the sports center. The special counsel team suspects Samsung of offering financial support to the sports center, K-Sports and Mir foundations Choi controlled and Choi’s equestrian daughter Chung Yoo-ra in return for favors.It suspects that Park exerted influence over the state-run National Pension Service, a major Samsung shareholder, to vote in favor of the group’s plan to merge Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T.; The deal was seen as a crucial step to ensure the smooth transfer of leadership from Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his son Lee Jae-yong. Moon Hyung-pyo, chief of NPS, admitted during the counsel team’s questioning that President Park was behind the merger deal. Moon was arrested over allegations that he pressured the NPS to approve the merger when he was the health and welfare minister in July 2015.Samsung Group has been at the center of the corruption scandal. While funding and chairing the Korea Equestrian Federation, it allegedly signed a 22 billion won contract with the German-based paper company Core Sports, run by Choi and Chung, to support Chung’s dressage trainings. It also contributed 20.4 billion won to the foundations controlled by Choi, the biggest amount among conglomerates. Its Vice Chairman Lee said during a parliamentary inquiry into the scandal last month that the company felt pressured to make donations to the foundations, flatly denying seeking any favors in return.The special counsel team signaled that the probe could expand to other conglomerates including SK, CJ and Lotte Group in connection with the bribery allegations involving President Park. CJ and SK are suspected of seeking favors such as the release of their jailed owners. The team said that it will file a complaint against officials from Ewha Womans University on Friday, including its former President Choi Kyung-hee, for making false testimonies during a parliamentary inquiry looking into the scandal in December. During the inquiry session, the officials denied being close to Choi and being involved in giving preferential treatment to Chung. But the investigation found that the Ewha president and Choi were closely involved in the matter.Chung, a 19-year-old dressage player, is suspected of receiving special treatment in the education and sports circles due to her mother’s close ties to the president. An investigation into the irregularities led to the cancellation of her acceptance into Ewha Womans University and graduation from Chungdam High School. She is in detention in Denmark after being arrested there for overstaying her visa Sunday. She will remain in custody there until Jan. 30. Korean authorities are taking steps to extradite Chung to Korea. Later in the day, the counsel team said it also summoned Cha Eun-taek, a TV commercial director, for the first time for questioning to confirm additional charges, without specifying them. Cha is suspected of using his ties to Choi to peddle influence over the culture sector, meddle in personnel appointments and monopolize state-led lucrative projects for personal gain.

He oversaw the sales of more than 4.5 million humidifier sterilizers containing the toxic chemicals PHMG and PHG from 2001.But Shin’s successor John Lee, who served Oxy from 2005-2010, was spared from charges due to a lack of evidence.John Lee, the former CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, walks into the Seoul Central District Court building Friday to face the verdict over the toxic humidifier disinfectant case. Lee was exempted from his charges, while his predecessor Shin Hyun-woo was handed down a seven-year jail term A group of other officials related to the sales of the toxic products were handed down jail terms of five to seven years, but most of them were exempted from fraud charges due to the “lack of intention.”This included the former CEO of Lotte Mart Noh Byung-yong and former sales chief of Homeplus Kim Won-hoi, who were both held accountable for the manufacturing and sales of in-house brand products that caused lung damage to users.The court also handed down a fine of 150 million won  to Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, Home Plus and Cefu, another brand of toxic humidifier disinfectant.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving consumer chemical products here, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011.In November, prosecutors sought 20 years in prison for Shin and 10 years for Lee for failing to confirm toxic chemicals in Oxy’s humidifier disinfectants that were responsible for at least 177 victims since 2011.As of December last year, a state-led investigation confirmed the connection between at least 258 lung-related damage cases and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants. However, civic groups have said the total number of victims is well above 200,000, due to the delayed response and insufficient action of the government.By Kim Da-sol","ceo gets year jail ,court convicted ex ceo ,seven years in prison ,convicted ex ceo shin ,seoul court friday sentenced","['Seoul', 'Reckitt Benckiser ’s', 'Shin Hyun - woo']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40983474  0.11045526

Three, who purportedly opposed the blacklisting of cultural figures, have resigned. Investigators plan to question Kim and Cho over the blacklist allegations soon. Related to the questions over whether the probe team is responsible for investigating the blacklist, the team said the allegations are ""certainly"" under its responsibility. The team believes this as the new allegations emerged during its investigation into allegedly unjust personnel decisions, which are subject to the corruption inquiry.  Later in the day, the team grilled the country's newly appointed Vice Culture Minister Song Soo-keun over the blacklist. Song is suspected of managing the list in 2014 while leading the ministry's taskforce to encourage the production of ""wholesome content."" He has denied the allegations. During the press briefing, the spokesman bridled at criticism by the president's attorneys over Independent Counsel Park Young-soo's political neutrality, dismissing it as their ""unilateral"" claim.  Park's legal representatives have taken issue with the counsel's political inclination during a hearing at the Constitutional Court, saying his probe results must not be used as evidence for the impeachment trial. The independent counsel was recommended by the opposition bloc, which had been at the forefront of impeaching Park. The president, however, approved his appointment since the matter was decided by parliament. Earlier in the day, a local professor was questioned by special prosecutors over suspicions he was involved in giving undue favors to the detained daughter of the woman at the center of the political scandal that led to the presidential impeachment on Dec. 9. Professor Namkung Gon at Ewha Womans University in Seoul appeared before the office of the special investigation team looking into the influence-peddling scandal surrounding the president and her friend Choi Soon-sil. Namkung, who was in charge of the school's admissions, is under suspicion of using his influence to help Chung Yoo-ra get into the school. Chung, a former member of the national equestrian team, is accused of receiving other academic favors by taking advantage of her mother's ties to the president.  She was arrested in Denmark on Sunday and has been taken into detention by a local court. South Korean authorities are seeking to repatriate her. In December, special prosecutors here requested Interpol put Chung on its wanted list after she declined to respond to the investigation team's repeated summons. On Thursday, the justice ministry sent an application for criminal extradition to the foreign ministry and the prosecution in Demark. The foreign ministry said it would quickly send the application to Danish judicial authorities and seek their cooperation.  Also on the day, investigators questioned presidential secretary Kim Jin-soo over suspicions the presidential office pressured the country's state fund to support a merger deal between Samsung Group's two units in 2015.","team investigating corruption scandal ,counsel team investigating corruption ,investigating corruption scandal ,scandal linked to president ,blacklisting of cultural figures","['Park Geun', 'Lee Kyu - chul', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Kim Ki - choon']",4,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.25020859  0.23563309

Her seven-hour absence is a key controversy, which contributed to Park’s impeachment. The top court’s nine justices, headed by chief Park Han-chul, proceeded despite her absence, according to the Constitutional Court Act. She will likely remain absent for the hearings, her lawyers said. “Park has never let her aides meddle in state affairs and appointed government officials through legitimate procedures,” said Park’s lawyer Lee Joong-hwan during the hearing. “She also took necessary measures to cope with the Sewol ferry accident. There is no evidence for her alleged bribery, abuse of authority and coercion based on objective facts.”He asked the court to look into the evidence presented by the parliament “sternly,” as he claims it is only based on what he called politically biased investigation by an independent counsel and false media reports. The denial of the validity of the evidence is seen as an attempt to prolong court proceedings.The parliamentary impeachment committee, which serves as a prosecutor in the trial, said that the president seriously violated the Constitution and law in performing her presidential duty by using state affairs as a tool for her personal gains. The charges center on allegations that President Park colluded with her longtime friend Choi to extort money from local conglomerates, failed to protect people’s lives at the time of the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 and allowed Choi, who has no official government post, to manipulate power behind the scenes for her personal gains.  Choi Soon-sil “Through the decision to impeach the president, we will reconfirm the principle that the people are the owners of this country and the president’s use of authority against public trust,” Rep. Kwon Seong-dong, chairman of the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee. “Ousting the president is aimed not only at recovering the national loss and vacuum in the running of state affairs but at restoring the constitutional order.”In the hearing, three of the four key witnesses -- Park’s closest secretaries Lee Jae-man and Ahn Bong-geun, and an administrative employee Lee Young-sun -- refused to appear at the court. Only Yoon Jeon-choo attended the session. Yoon, who was in charge of helping Park’s personal and private affairs, said that she was called in at 8:30 a.m. in the morning and attended to “unofficial” business with Park at the president’s residence. “I don’t remember what business exactly it was about, but I remember it was about her personal stuff,” she said without elaborating further.She also offered new testimonies that the president met ex-presidential aide Ahn Bong-geun in the morning on the day of the Sewol accident and two hair stylists visited Park in the afternoon. She also denied rumors that Park held a religious cult ritual or received a plastic surgery at the presidential office while the ferry was sinking.The ex-presidential aides did not respond to the court summoning, remaining in hiding, while the administrative employee Lee is set to be brought back in to testify Thursday. Park’s other lawyer Seo Seok-gu appeared to taint the meaning of the candlelight vigils that have taken place for the past two months against the president, which had prompted her impeachment. “The sentiment shown during the candlelight vigils does not reflect the public sentiment, given it was led by a labor union group,” he said. Seo added that the majority rule can be dangerous when it is based on inaccurate media reports, citing the Greek philosopher Socrates who was sentenced to death and Jesus carrying the cross.Kwon immediately shot back, asking the court to stop him from talking about matters unrelated to clarifying the charges listed in the impeachment motion. “Who led the candlelight vigils has completely nothing to do with the impeachment trial,” he said. The Constitutional Court explained the key points in the impeachment trial and confirmed the list of evidence and witnesses during the hearing. It also asked for cooperation from both sides not to distract from its main focus while reminding them that the trial is not a criminal trial. The National Assembly voted to oust Park on Dec. 9, stripping her of substantial executive powers, over the corruption scandal. The top court has until early June to decide whether to uphold or overturn Park’s impeachment. For the hearing scheduled for Tuesday, other key suspects -- Choi, former presidential aides An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong -- are expected to testify before the justices.By Ock Hyun-ju","her impeachment trial thursday ,impeachment trial thursday ,impeachment trial thursday taking ,choi deny all charges ,trial also held thursday","['Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Park', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23288928  0.23866095

Though confusion exists on whether a suspended president is also subject to such an exemption, it is being widely speculated that Park will not show up during the impeachment trial process.Observers point out that the Constitutional Court, whose main function is to judge the constitutional conformity of laws and administrative measures, will rush through the normative process once the fact-finding is done.But the problem is that Park has been refuting all of the circumstances the National Assembly listed in the impeachment statement, much in contrast to her predecessor in impeachment, former President Roh Moo-hyun.The late liberal president, when facing his impeachment trial in 2004 over an alleged breach of political neutrality, acknowledged the facts listed in his impeachment resolution, allowing the court to jump to its normative judgment.Since the Choi scandal broke out in late October last year, President Park has delivered three official addresses to the nation, in which she mostly claimed innocence over Choi’s alleged influence-peddling acts. In an unheralded press meeting held recently on New Year’s Day, she once again complained of injustice and denied the charges, especially her involvement in the alleged bribery allegations.Considering such circumstances, it is highly likely that Park’s legal team will continue to raise doubts on the credibility of the evidence submitted by prosecutors and lawmakers, as well as that of the written testimonies that are unfavorable for Park.Should the plaintiff -- the parliamentary impeachment committee -- and the defendant plunge into a lengthy cross-examination process on each other’s key witnesses, the court ruling will inevitably face a delay, which will in turn put off the timeline for the next presidential election.The deadline for the Constitutional Court to finalize its stance on impeachment is six months from the submission of the resolution, which will be in early June. The top court, however, has been hinting at speeding up its process, so as to minimize the vacuum in state affairs. The process for the late Roh took about two months.By Bae Hyun-jung","hurdles in impeachment witness ,challenge in judging president ,impeachment witness questioning for ,face hurdles in impeachment ,in impeachment witness questioning","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45183119 -0.10075492

Kwon Seong-dong, chairman of the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee, called on the justices to remove Park from office, saying her actions amounted to a violation of the Constitution and the law. He especially cited allegations that the president gave confidential documents to Choi Soon-sil, her confidante, and extorted large sums of money from conglomerates with the aim of benefiting Choi.""This amounts to abusing one's position to violate the people's basic rights and warrants losing one's authority to oversee state affairs,"" he said.  ""Dismissing the president is aimed not only at recovering the national loss and vacuum in the running of state affairs but at restoring the constitutional order.""Lee Joong-hwan, one of Park's attorneys, rebutted the accusations, citing a lack of evidence and even legal basis.

""President Park didn't know that Choi was effectively in control of the foundations.""Park has insisted on her innocence, saying the allegations against her have been fabricated or not based on real facts but hearsay.

The first oral arguments in the impeachment case have been postponed to the second hearing to be held Thursday. Should Park fail to show up again, he added that the trial will proceed through a proxy.Park was impeached by the National Assembly on Dec. 9 over her alleged involvement in a string of suspected crimes committed by Choi Soon-sil. Choi, a daughter of Park‘s late mentor Choi Tae-min, has been accused of abusing her ties to the president to gain various business and personal favors despite having no position in the government.Park has denied all of the allegations against her, saying she only received simple advice from Choi and carried out her presidential duties faithfully.She especially insisted on her innocence during a meeting with reporters on New Year’s Day, her first public appearance since the impeachment. Critics denounced the move, saying her use of the official presidential quarters and help from her staff amounted to a breach of her suspension of duties.“It is inappropriate and a discourtesy to the court for the president as a defendant to talk about various things outside the impeachment court,” Rep. Kwon Seong-dong, who recently defected from the ruling Saenuri Party, said in a press briefing after the hearing. Kwon is a member of a parliamentary panel handling the impeachment trial.He demanded the president explain herself in court.Earlier, the panel submitted the entire minutes of Park‘s meeting with reporters to the court, citing remarks that could be interpreted as Choi’s involvement in state affairs.Park Han-chul asked the panel to clarify in writing what the evidence it has submitted so far aims to prove and how long they plan to question each suspect during upcoming hearings.Currently, two additional hearings have been scheduled for Thursday and next Tuesday, during which some of the key suspects in the case have been asked to appear before the court. They include Choi; An Chong-bum, former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination; and Jeong Ho-seong, former secretary for private presidential affairs.Speaking to reporters, Park‘s legal representative Lee Joong-hwan said she is unlikely to attend future hearings “unless there are special circumstances.” Citing law, he also said an impeachment trial is meant to proceed in the absence of the defendant.Another attorney of Park indicated that Park’s refusal to attend hearings was based on a precedent set by former President Roh Moo-hyun.During Roh‘s impeachment trial in 2004, he did not appear before the court, citing concerns that he could be exposed to the political offensive from the parliamentary impeachment panel. Roh was impeached on a number of charges, including the violation of his duty to maintain political neutrality. He was later reinstated, as the court ruled that his legal offenses were not serious enough to remove him from office.The key issues under review are whether Park violated the people’s sovereignty and the rule of law, abused her power, infringed on the freedom of the press, neglected her duty to protect the right to life, and took part in bribery and other crimes.In addition to the corruption scandal, Park has come under renewed fire for her apparent absence from duty during the first seven hours of a deadly ferry sinking in April 2014. Lee said his team is preparing “thoroughly” to respond to the accusations in time for the second hearing.In a reflection of the high level of public interest in the trial, 54 members of the public attended Tuesday‘s hearing after applying online.The entire nation has been gripped by the scandal since the first news report broke in late October, leading to weeks of candlelight protest rallies demanding Park’s resignation.Yu Hyeong-jun, 12, came to watch the hearing with his mother.“It‘s too bad it ended so quickly,” he said. “I want to come again on Thursday and especially on Tuesday when Choi Soon-sil comes.”The court has 180 days to decide whether to unseat or reinstate Park. In the meantime, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn is serving as the country’s acting president.Meanwhile, a team of special prosecutors looking into the scandal raided detention centers in Seoul and Uiwang, south of the capital city, where Choi and other key figures implicated in the case have been put under custody.The team said the cells of ex-vice minister Kim Chong, Choi‘s associate Cha Eun-taek and former presidential secretary Jeong Ho-seong were subject to search and seizure. The team said it did not visit Choi’s cell.Later Tuesday, the prosecution team interrogated Vice Culture Minister Yu Dong-hun on an alleged government blacklist of cultural figures who were critical of Park. Yu, however, told reporters he wasn‘t involved in the matter after showing up for the interrogation.","first open hearing tuesday ,hye following her impeachment ,hearing tuesday to determine ,impeachment over corruption scandal ,following her impeachment","['south Korea‘s Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Park Han']",4,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.09019393 0.11537546 0.09329782],손지영,Politics,1,2017,"tuesday the prosecution team interrogated ,tuesday hearing after applying online ,deadly ferry sinking in april ,later tuesday the prosecution team ,protest rallies demanding park resignation","['south Korea‘s Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun', 'Park Han', 'the National Assembly', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Choi', 'Kwon Seong - dong', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kwon', 'Choi', 'Han', 'Choi', 'Chong', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Lee Joong - hwan', 'Park', 'Park', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Roh', 'Park', 'Park', 'Lee', 'Tuesday‘s', 'Park ’s', 'Yu Hyeong - jun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'Uiwang', 'Choi', 'Kim Chong', 'Cha Eun - taek', 'Jeong Ho - seong', 'Choi ’s', 'Yu Dong - hun', 'Park']",0,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.09019393 0.11537546 0.09329782]

After his departure, he reportedly made calls to Lee Hee-ho and Kwon Yang-sook, the wives of late former Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, respectively, to offer his New Year‘s greetings.“As far as I know, President Park has not yet had any telephone conversation with former UN chief Ban in the new year,” a presidential official told Yonhap News Agency over the phone, declining to be named.On Jan. 1, last year, Ban had telephone talks with Park during which he praised the landmark deal between Seoul and Tokyo to settle the issue of Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean woman, which has long been a thorn in the side of the bilateral relationship.Ban also made calls to Park in 2014 and 2015, both on Jan. 2.During the phone conversation in 2014, Ban voiced his hopes for substantive progress in Park‘s much-trumpeted diplomatic initiatives to promote peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia, and build trust with an increasingly provocative North Korea.In his New Year’s talks with the president in 2015, Ban wished that South Korea would further prosper and develop under Park‘s leadership.Political observers said that Ban might think that his contact with Park, reeling from a slew of corruption allegations, would only have a negative impact on his possible campaign for a presidential election which may come earlier than expected.Late last month, Ban said he was “ready to give his all” if it would help advance his home country in the strongest indication that he would run for the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae. Ban is expected to return to Seoul in the middle of this month.In various recent opinion polls, Ban has ranked second in terms of support ratings, trailing behind Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party and formidable presidential hopeful.Before the scandal involving the president and her friend was brought to the fore in late October, Ban, who was then seen as a contender from the ruling bloc, had maintained a lead over Moon and other potential opposition candidates.     Most observers now dismiss the possibility of Ban running for president on the ticket of the ruling Saenuri Party that has lost public trust in the wake of the scandal.Sources close to Ban told Yonhap News Agency that he may return to South Korea as early as Jan. 12.    “The date of return will be some time between Jan. 12 and 15, but for now Jan. 12 is the most likely,” an insider said. After arriving in South Korea, he may hold a public event to sum up his last 10 years as the UN secretary-general.","impeached president reinforcing ,the impeached president reinforcing ,impeached president reinforcing speculation ,to the impeached president ,the impeached president","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Park Geun', 'Ban']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80729085  0.30296263

She is suspected of receiving favors from a Seoul-based college in the admissions process and on tests by taking advantage of her mother's ties to the president.Chung Yoo-ra According to the sources, South Korea's ambassador and envoy in Denmark met the 21-year-old, who is currently in the custody of local police, and delivered the order personally to turn in her passport. Under a relevant law, her passport will be nullified within a week. The sources said that the criminal extradition process is underway to bring back Chung to Korea, adding that the government plans to seek cooperation from the Danish authorities as soon as it receives an extradition request from the justice ministry.Confirming the delivery of the order to Chung, the ministry said that it is ready to take steps to nullify her passport unless she turns it in by Monday.Special prosecutors looking into the alleged corruption scandal surrounding President Park and her friend Choi had requested that Interpol put Chung on the wanted list after she declined to respond to the investigation team's repeated summons.At the request of prosecutors, the foreign ministry earlier mailed the order to turn in her passport to Chung's home in South Korea but it was not delivered since she had been staying abroad.Chung's mother is suspected of meddling in state affairs and influence peddling. The president is also accused of conspiring with Choi. Suspicions surrounding Park and Choi led to massive candlelight vigils across the country over the past few months and eventually prompted the National Assembly to impeach the president on Dec. 9.","of massive presidential scandal ,presidential scandal to turn ,massive presidential scandal ,massive presidential scandal to ,her passport in bid","['south korean', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'danish', 'Aalborg', 'Seoul']",4,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.92583203  0.2783519

Lee Jung-hyun claimed to take all responsibility for the dire situation that the conservative ruling party has been in since the President Park Geun-hye scandal erupted late last year. “Today, I leave the party, taking all responsibility as former chairman,” said Rep. Lee, a staunch ally of the impeached President Park, who was until two weeks ago the party’s chairman. “I hope that the party uses me as a stepping stone to move toward unity and harmony,” he said at a press briefing. “We are faced with a number of urgent issues such as the next presidential election and constitutional revision, so  may no longer afford to take  risks.”His decision, which was not accepted immediately by the party leadership, came amid rising tension within the party, following interim chief In Myung-jin’s stern demand that key pro-Park figures should leave the party by Friday to allow reform to take place.“Those who hold responsibility in the current situation should defect,” In said last week, without specifying names but clearly referring to senior pro-Park figures such as Reps. Suh Chung-won, Choi Kyung-hwan, Kim Jin-tae, as well as Lee.The interim chief’s ultimatum largely reflected the recognition that in order to survive the current political crisis, Saenuri should first cut off its longtime connection with the scandal-ridden president and her aides.Saenuri had suffered major setbacks after the president’s parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9. Thirty of its 128 lawmakers left the party on Dec. 28 to create a new political entity.Having served as the president’s chief advisor since her inauguration, Lee is known to be one of the most ardent supporters of Park, coming to her rescue in every political crisis. When rumors started to spread late last year about the president’s confidante Choi Soon-sil, he staged a hunger strike in apparent protest against the opposition camp, which consequentially distracted the public’s attention from the presidential scandal.While opposition parties campaigned for Park’s impeachment, Lee had stubbornly refused to resign from the party chairmanship. He stepped down only last month after the party elected a fellow Park loyalist as its new floor leader. Therefore, when Lee vowed to “take all responsibility,” it was taken as a message that he would carry all the blame that had been laid on the president and the pro-Park faction, and that other pro-Parks should be allowed to remain in the party.“Rep. Lee told me over the phone that he was ashamed of being named as one of those who should be ousted,” floor leader Rep. Chung told reporters Monday, explaining Lee’s defection.“I urged him to remain in the party and continue to play his role as the only lawmaker speaking for the  South Jeolla Province and close advisor to the president, but he declined.”The opposition camp, however, described Lee’s decision as “meaningless.”“Rep. Lee seems to be bearing his cross but his solo defection is nowhere close to the reform that is required of Saenuri,” said Rep. Park Kyung-mee, spokesperson of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.The runner-up People’s Party also claimed in a written statement that other pro-Parks should leave with Lee, and the minority Justice Party urged Lee to leave the political circle altogether.The Saenuri’s interim leadership said that it will make a final decision on whether to accept his resignation by this weekend at the latest, according to officials.

The Justice Ministry in Seoul said it was taking steps to bring her to South Korea without delay as part of the ongoing investigation into the scandal. According to the National Police Agency, Denmark has notified the South Korean government of her arrest in the northern Danish city of Aalborg on Sunday for staying in the country illegally. Chung, a 20-year-old former member of the national equestrian team, is suspected of receiving undue favors in admission and academic affairs from Ewha Womans University in Seoul by taking advantage of her mother’s ties to the president. Independent counsel Park Young-soo, who is leading a special investigation into the scandal involving President Park and her confidante Choi, requested last week an Interpol Red Notice -- an international wanted persons alert -- for Chung, who was thought to be staying in Germany or Denmark with her infant son. Chung was arrested with three others, including a young boy, the Korean police said. “The request has been sent, but the Interpol Red Notice has not been issued yet,” the chief of the National Police Agency Lee Chul-seong said. “The Justice Ministry will take swift action to take custody of her as soon as possible.” Under Danish law, a suspect caught on charges of staying in the country illegally can be detained for up to 72 hours. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry also said it would also act immediately to cooperate with related institutes.If she returns, Chung will face the counsel team seeking to further investigate the allegations that she received favoritism from a dressage body and her university, with her mother pulling strings. Chung Yoo-ra She had her high school graduation and admission to the university canceled after it was revealed that she received special treatment. The special probe team has secured a court warrant to detain Chung for questioning on charges of obstructing the business of the university.The Korean Equestrian Federation is also currently under investigation for preferentially choosing Chung for the national dressage team in the 2014 Asian Games and planning to help her compete in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with Samsung. Choi was arrested in November and is now standing trial for peddling influence in state affairs and extorting funds from conglomerates using her ties with the president.On Sunday, the special probe team requested an arrest warrant for Ewha Womans University professor Ryu Chul-kyun, who is thought to have illegally given Chung academic advantages, while looking into two other professors from the same university -- Lee In-seong and Lee In-joon -- regarding similar suspicions.Associates of Samsung will also be summoned this week over the allegations that the conglomerate had funded Choi’s companies and institutes for business favors. According to the findings, Samsung had donated some 20 billion won  to the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation -- both government-backed foundations allegedly formed and operated by Choi. The company also made a contract worth 22 billion won with Choi’s paper company Core Sports  in Germany in March 2015 to “encourage and support” the dressage industry. Before breaching the contract in September the same year, the group has already paid 7.8 billion won, which turned out to have been spent on the personal expenses of Choi’s family. Lawyer Lee Kyung-jae, who represents Choi and her daughter, said he would cooperate with the special probe when Chung returns to Korea.

It had been revealed that a test paper under Chung’s name had been submitted while she was in Germany.Ryu was taken into custody Saturday due to “concerns of him destroying evidence,” according to Lee Kyu-cheol, spokesman for independent counsel Park Young-soo’s investigative team.Suspicion surrounding Chung is part of a nationwide influence-peddling, corruption and abuse of authority scandal that led to arrests of Choi and other key personnel and the impeachment of President Park. A major part of the so-called “Choi scandal” is the supposed blacklist of cultural figures believed to have been created under orders from the presidential office, and is related to Choi.Kim Sang-yule, former senior presidential secretary for education and culture, has been grilled in relation to the scandal that former Cheong Wa Dae officials have testified was created to “actively respond against schemes by leftist artists.” The independent counsel team is reportedly investigating suspicion that creation of the list was initiated by Choi, to weed out individuals that can potentially get in the way of her winning state-funded projects.The homes and offices of incumbent Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun and former chief-of-staff Kim Ki-choon -- believed to have given direct orders to officials -- have already been raided, and former Vice Culture Minister Kim He-beom was subject to overnight questioning by the investigators.Kim He-beom is suspected to have been ordered by the ex-chief-of-staff to pick out ministry officials opposing the blacklist. While Minister Cho has repeatedly denied the existence or knowledge of the list, the independent counsel team has accused her of perjury on the matter and have officially requested the National Assembly to file charges against her. Bribery charges against the president, Choi and their associates is another major faction of the independent counsel’s investigation. The former Secretary Kim reportedly testified to have met the CEO from Choi’s paper company The Blue-K, under orders from the president last January. He is believed to have requested former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong to “help” the company. The trio met later in the month to discuss at a hotel in Seoul, after which ex-Culture Minister Kim entered Cheong Wa Dae. Revealing the link between Choi-related companies, President Park’s orders to assist them, and donations made to these companies by local conglomerates is considered crucial in proving the bribery charges.Lawmakers from the parliamentary inspection team said that former presidential secretary An Chong-bum had testified that the foundation of Mir and K-sports foundations -- believed to have been used to channel funds to Choi -- was under the president’s orders. An -- already under arrest -- was to be summoned Sunday afternoon but did not show up, citing health issues. The investigators were expected to question whether President Park’s orders were behind the financial support granted to the Choi family by Samsung Group. Samsung, who is also the largest benefactor of the aforementioned foundations, is suspected to have received favors in form of business affairs such as the merger of Samsung C&T; and Cheil Industries in 2014. Then-Welfare Minister Moon Hyong-pyo is suspected of pressuring the National Pension Service -- a shareholder of both companies -- to back the controversial merger. He was arrested Saturday on charges of abusing his official authority. Moon was summoned against for questioning Sunday, as was Kim Chong and Ryu. Choi’s niece Jang Si-ho was also questioned over the weekend in relation to Samsung’s donation to her sports organization. By Yoon Min-sik","corruption scandal surrounding president ,arrested in choi scandal ,womans university professor ryu ,professor to be arrested ,probing the corruption scandal","['Park Geun', 'Choi ’s', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Ryu Chul - kyun', 'Choi ’s', 'Chung']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34699038 -0.05112481

On the day of the exam, Chung was reportedly in Germany. The university had already decided to expel Chung.The special prosecutors have decided to seek the arrest warrant against Ryu due to the possibility of him attempting to destroy evidence, a source said.Meanwhile, a former vice culture minister returned home Sunday after the independent counsel team questioned him over the alleged existence of a blacklist of cultural figures critical of the government.The team queried former First Vice Culture Minister Kim He-beom for some 17 hours over allegations that Kim Ki-choon, former presidential chief of staff, interfered with top-level appointments at the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 2014.The former vice minister was also questioned over the suspicion that the Park government had blacklisted artists and other cultural figures deemed to be critical of government policies. The list was purportedly drawn up to ban any government support of the figures in question.The former presidential chief of staff is rumored to have directed Kim He-beom in October 2014 to receive resignations from six high-ranking officials at the ministry, some of whom had reportedly been against the blacklisting of artists. Three of the six officials have resigned.Former Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong said in a recent media interview that former Vice Minister Kim Chong had handed over the blacklist to Kim He-beom as well as the former presidential chief of staff.","arrest warrant this week ,team investigating corruption scandal ,team to seek arrest ,corruption scandal involving president ,seek an arrest warrant","['Park Geun', 'Choi soon - sil', 'Choi', 'Independent Counsel Park Young', 'Ryu Chul - k']",4,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7432586   0.12764369
