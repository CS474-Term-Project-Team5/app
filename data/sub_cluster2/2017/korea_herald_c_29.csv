A prolonged duration of the stress and lack of preventive measures can lead to other serious medical conditions, says Kim Dong-yeon, a spinal manipulation therapist and head of Well 206 Clinics in Seoul. Well 206 Clinics“A typical adult human skeleton consists of 206 bones, while joints form the connections between the bones. Any damage to the joints or muscle around them can cause a lot of pain,” Kim said. Joint pain occurs as a result of a wide range of conditions, but in many cases the culprit can be an excessive use of smartphone, according to Kim In fact, it is now a common sight in South Korea to see children busy with smartphones and tablets for hours, which can cause repetitive strain injury to the spine as well as hand joints, Kim said. “Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis should be timely treated, which can affect a child‘s growth and decrease concentration in school. Manual therapy on spinal articulations is important to prevent growth plate injuries,” Kim said. Spinal manipulation modestly improves pain and function in acute low back pain, according to Kim. “The statistics of disease last year suggests that growth plate injuries were ranked fourth,” Kim said, suggesting that a timely intervention is crucial among children.By Bak Se-hwan","best brand spine therapist ,206 clinics in seoul ,spinal manipulation therapist ,seoul well 206 clinics ,well 206 clinics typical","['mobile', 'Kim Dong - yeon', 'well 206 Clinics', 'Seoul']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19508366  0.44065884

If the curved spine is untreated, it can result in different heights of the left and right shoulders and protruding backbones. In severe cases, the ribs can press down on the pelvis and lung, interfering with breathing and digestion. Female students tend to have higher instances of curved spines than male students, as they have relatively weak and flexible ligaments and muscles, Dr. Seo Seung-woo told the news provider.By Park Ju-young","35 834 female students ,every 10 students in ,409 male students and ,834 female students ,834 female students and","['Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'the Korea Unversity Guro Hospital']",29,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.22862759 0.80014175 0.67340893],Park Ju-young,Social affairs,12,2017,"834 female students and found ,middle school in korea suffer ,and 35 834 female students ,wednesday the korea unversity guro ,out of every 10 students","['Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'the Korea Unversity Guro Hospital', 'Seo Seung - woo', 'Park Ju - young']",8,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.22862759 0.80014175 0.67340893]

South Korea has been encouraging paternity leave, including turning the unpaid leave into paid leave in 2001, as part of its efforts to boost South Korea's low birthrate and ease the burden of child care.Childbirths in South Korea dropped to a record low last year despite decade-long efforts to tackle the country's chronically low birthrate.The number of babies born in 2016 reached 406,300, down 7.3 percent, or 32,100, from a year earlier, according to the data.The figure marked the lowest number of newborns since 1970, when the statistics agency started to compile such data.The statistics office said the ratio of employees who work in the same companies after either paternity or maternity leave came to 75.5 percent in 2015, down from 76.4 percent in 2014. But the 2015 reading is higher than the 71.2 percent in 2012 and the 67.6 percent in 2010.The ratio has been on the rise as South Korea has pushed to bring stay-at-home moms back to work in recent years.The statistics office said 46.3 percent of more than 5.51 million married women quit their jobs in 2016 due mainly to marriages, pregnancy and childbirth.South Korea's female labor participation is among the lowest in the world as many women leave work to take care of kids.The data showed that male employees worked an average 45.4 hours a week last year, down 36 minutes from a year earlier, with the corresponding figure for female workers being 39.7 hours, also down 42 minutes.The average working hours a month totaled 176.9 hours last year, down 14.3 hours from a decade ago, with workers' monthly overtime falling 4.4 hours to 12.7 hours, the data showed.","more south korean men ,women data showed friday ,male employees getting paternity ,2016 more south korean ,employees getting paternity leave","['south korean', 'Statistics Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73224491  0.6368798

YonhapAccording to the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, 73.5 percent, or 51,882, of students who sat for the second foreign language test in the annual multi-subject college entrance exam, chose Arabic among nine foreign languages available. The eight others are German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Vietnamese and Classical Chinese. A second foreign language is one of the five subjects of Suneung, which is equivalent to the US’ SAT. Although it is not mandatory, some top tier universities require applicants to submit test scores in the subject.  The number of students choosing Arabic has been growing sharply since 2005 when the language was first introduced to the Suneung. In 2005, 531 students took the Arabic test, but the number rose sharply to 37,526, over half of the whole second language test-takers, in 2016 and finally over 51,800 this year. The popularity of Arabic, however, is unlikely a reflection of the young generation’s genuine interest in the language or the region. Rather, it is a strategic decision for students to score high and get an upper hand over other test-takers, experts say. “Students have found a way of cutting corners in the current assessment system of ,” Lim Sung-ho, head of Jongro Academy, one of the biggest hagwon chains here, told The Korea Herald. Since test scores are relatively determined by that of competitors, it incentivizes students to choose a less popular language in which there aren‘t many high performers as is in the case of more commonly taught languages such as Chinese and Japanese. Arabic is taught in just six high schools nationwide. “In Arabic, even those poorly-prepared students easily get levels 4 or 5 . If they put in just a little more effort, they are more likely to score well,” Lim said. Educations authorities are well aware of this. The Education Ministry announced in August a plan to revise the Suneung rules to adopt absolute grading in second foreign language tests.

When asked to choose between a company where the pay was proportional to the heavy workload, and a company where the salary was relatively low but after-work life was respected, 75.5 percent of the surveyed chose the latter. Further analysis on the respondents showed that their answers were not affected by their marital status, but that those with children preferred a balanced lifestyle more than those without.

It also revealed younger people aged 20 through 39 made up a combined 14 percent of the lonely deaths.Increases in solitary deaths are highly attributed to a hike in the number of one-person households.The number of one-person households in South Korea, which stood at 4.14 million in 2010, increased to 5.29 million as of last year, according to government data.During the 2010-2016 period, people in their 20s and 30s had the most one-person households, while the number of one-person households for people in their 50s showed the highest growth rate, increasing to 911,859 from 590,721.With higher proportions of middle-aged and youth brackets, there have been calls for the government to expand to all age brackets the scope of measures, currently focused on elderly people, to prevent people living alone from dying a lonely death.Early retirement, divorces, worsened health and higher youth unemployment, among others, increase social isolation that could lead to the solitary deaths of people in the middle-aged and youth brackets.""People can experience psychological frustration and have difficulties in adapting themselves to society as they are easily exposed to socioeconomic changes,"" said Lee Ho-sun, leader of the Korea Elderly Counseling Center.Lee stressed the importance of expanding preventive measures to other age brackets as well as senior citizens, saying, ""Elderly people are taken care of through carers' visits to their homes or the government's support. But people other than elderly are placed out of the government system to care for them.""","lonely deaths of people ,people who die lonely ,lonely deaths of middle ,godoksa or lonely deaths ,data showed thursday cases",[],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56502092  0.58134562

The study published in the journal Environment International tracked the association between mortality and extended exposure to microdust by analyzing data between 1993 and 2009 for periods when the concentration of air pollution exceeded the normal range of 75 micrograms per cubic meter for two days or longer. It found that South Korea’s longest consecutive period of exposure was 6.96 days, during which the risk of nonaccidental death spiked by nearly 3.4 percent. As for Japan, where the longest period of exposure was 2.4 days, the mortality rate rose by 1.6 percent. The tally stood at 42.26 days for China with a 10.4 percent increase in the rate. The results were based on a survey conducted by the Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Health and researchers from Japan and China during the same periods.Fine particulates are classified by the World Health Organization as first-degree carcinogens, which can penetrate the respiratory system and trigger fatal illnesses such as cancer. The study concluded that precautionary measures are needed to prevent continued exposure to air pollution, such as installing air purifiers indoors and refraining from outside activities when the dust level is high.","raises death risk studyby ,dust raises death risk ,death study continuous exposure ,death risk studyby bak ,fine dust raises death","['Bak Se - hwanExposure', 'south korean', 'chinese', 'japanese', 'Environment International']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22128877  0.24767806

This is more than 10 percent of the total number of ships inspected. The 287 North Korean vessels inspected in the same period last year also reported a 100 percent deficiency rate. Twenty-four of them were forced to stop operation.In 2015, only one of the 294 North Korean ships inspected passed the safety test. North Korean vessels show a high deficiency rate because their use of decrepit ships is more frequent compared to other countries, VOA said, adding that this is why the Port State Control Committee in the Asia Pacific region has blacklisted North Korea. By Kim So-hyun","korean ships show 100 ,ships show 100 deficiency ,reported 100 percent deficiency ,230 north korean vessels ,100 percent deficiency rate","['north korean', 'Voice of America', 'north korean', 'US', 'the Port State Control Committee', 'Tokyo']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24462207  0.36884296

It hit a record low of 1.88 in the 2005-2009 time span. It is higher than the actual fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, which reached 1.17 in 2016. This is the lowest number since 2009.The latest number is still lower than the replacement level of 2.1 that would keep South Korea's population of 51 million stable.Some 8.2 percent of married people have no plans to have children at all, sharply up from the 2.3 percent of those surveyed in the 1950-1954 period. The percentage was 5.8 percent in 2005-2009 and 5 percent in 2000-2004.Such a trend is not new in South Korea, where an increasing number of women work and want to hold onto their careers.

The findings showed that those who work more than 11 hours are 2 1/2 times more susceptible to displaying symptoms of severe depression compared to those who work 7 to 8 hours a day. The collaborative research team observed 2,000 middle-aged men and women in the United Kingdom for six years. Following thorough analysis of research data, they reported a strong correlation between length of overtime work and risk of depression. The study included 1,626 males and 497 females with the average age being 47.  The correlation between overtime work and depression risk remained unchanged even when variables were controlled such as different life style choices , tension level at work and socioeconomic factors. Working overtime for long periods of time causes our bodies to release stress hormones called cortisol. Researchers reported that the heightened level of cortisol further leads to the development of a full-blown depressive disorder. Doctor Marianna Virtanen of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health views that overtime work can be beneficial to both individuals and society to some extent. Dr. Virtanen, however, stresses the importance of society acknowledging the harmful effects of overtime work and the associated risk of developing depression.

Figures for women ascended from 23 percent to 25 percent.  The increase in the number of female drinkers are interpreted as a natural chain of events following the rise in the number of employed females, and the widespread social notion of alcohol consumption as a legitimate way of entertainment. However, women are cautioned to watch how much they drink, as they innately lack the enzymes that break down the toxin in alcohol, making them more vulnerable to liver-related disease.

Under IR-4, the adoption procedure is only finalized after the adoptive parents re-adopt their children in the US at which time citizenship is secured.After the revised Special Adoption Act came into effect, Korean-born children were sent to the US on an IR-3 visa, which requires that the full and final adoption is completed at the adoptee’s country with the parent physically seeing the child prior to the adoption proceedings. Adoptees brought into the US on an IR-3 visa are automatically guaranteed US citizenship upon arrival.Around 18,000 Korean adoptees who were sent to the US on an IR-4 visa are still not naturalized as US citizens, and some of them have been deported back to Korea.In regards to the figure he released, Rep.

Ten percent said they are unsure about what's best. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.Debate about nuclear energy flared anew as a state commission recommended Friday after months of deliberations that the government resume the construction of reactors Shin Kori 5 and Shin Kori 6 but seek to scale back nuclear power generation in the longer term. On Sunday, Moon said he would accept the recommendations and restart the reactors' construction as early as possible. But he also renewed his commitment to winding down nuclear power and increasing the use of renewable energy.Scrapping the Shin Kori power plant project was one of Moon's campaign promises. But after taking office, he decided to determine the reactors' fate according to public opinion, and ordered the suspension of their construction and the establishment of the independent commission charged with collecting public views and making a recommendation.The proposal sparked heated debate in a country that relies on nuclear power plants for about a third of its electricity amid concerns that closing reactors would lead to a shortage in power supply and a spike in electricity bills.Opposition parties criticized Moon for wasting money on the proposal to abandon the Shin Kori reactors, as contractors for the project are expected to suffer 100 billion won  in losses from the three-month suspension of construction.Ahn Cheol-soo, head of the minor opposition People's Party, said that resuming the construction was a matter of course but it took 100 billion won plus 4.6 billion won spent on running the commission to reconfirm the ""common sense"" decision.Even though a nuclear phase-out policy should be pursued in a long term, Ahn said it was wrong for the government to divide the public into pros and cons on the policy, suspend construction and force the people to choose one side.Joo Ho-young, leader of the Bareun Party, criticized Moon for failing to mention the losses his proposal has caused. The lawmaker also called for Moon to discuss the country's long-term energy policy in the National Assembly rather than pushing hard for a nuclear-phase policy.","of koreans support nuclear ,majority of koreans support ,koreans support nuclear ,60 percent back nuclear ,koreans support nuclear phase","['South Koreans', 'Moon Jae - in']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34231529  0.73333758

Results showed that 5.9 percent of them suffered some sort of discriminatory experience at work, with higher showings for women  compared with men .The number of people with such experiences increased with age. While it was 5.5 percent for those in their 20s, the figure increased to 4.2 percent for people in their 30s, 4.9 percent in their 40s and 7 percent in their 50s. The number reached 11.6 percent for people in their 60s and older.There were more victims of discrimination at work when the individuals received less education, when the work was more menial and when monthly income was less than 1.3 million won . People working at jobs with longer weekly work hours also suffered more discrimination. The study results showed a correlation between discrimination at work and state of well-being. People who had been subjected to some type of bias more than three times at work were 2.6 times more exposed to risks of poor well-being than those who did not suffer such discrimination, according to the results.  Menial laborers  and day-to-day workers  were the top two jobs whose well-being was hurt the most by work discrimination.The team cited that prejudices against senior workers are mostly in the forms of seniors being the first to be let go or being barred from job applications because of their age.

Nam In-soon. The figures were derived from the National Pension Service  records provided to the lawmaker for parliamentary audits. National Pension Service Investment Management Data showed that a subscriber would have to earn at least 4.34 million won a month, categorized as top-level income, and stay subscribed for 30 years in order to reach the minimum amount needed for senior life.According to separate data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, an average pension subscriber as of this year was enrolled for just 17 years, meaning they receive much less than the estimated amount. For instance, people making average income and who paid into the pension for 20 years would only get 450,000 won. South Korea's aging society has put a strain on the NPS which is saddled with growing payment needs. The nominal income replacement ratio for 40-year enrollment was as high as 70 percent in 1988, but it fell to 60 percent in 1998 and a further to 50 percent in 2008. By 2028, it could go as low as 40 percent. As of this year, the ratio stood at 45.5 percent.The rate for an average subscriber enrolled for 17 years would stop at 24 percent.

According to the researchers, 56.1 percent, or 133 teenagers, tested positive for at least one STI, while 35.5 percent, or 54, were infected with two or more infections. Around 9.2 percent  and 3.3 percent  of the participants tested positive for more than three and four infections respectively, the result shows. Infections with ureaplasma parvum were the most common type among the infected group, at 24.1 percent, followed by mycoplasma hominis at 17.3 percent, chlamydia trachomatis at 13.9 percent and trichomonas vaginalis at 0.8 percent. Only 1.7 percent tested gonococcal infections, while 0.8 percent had syphilis. No participants tested positive for HIV.Their symptoms include discomfort and pain when urinating for both men and women, and in some cases blood in the urine or semen. If not treated properly, the urethritis can lead to long-term damage to the urethra, causing infertility. Out of the infected and non-infected groups, 64.1 percent of them said they experienced sexual relations, in which only 27.5 percent said they used condoms. “Most of the infected teenagers at probation centers have no knowledge of such bacteria and viruses and don’t even realize that they are infected,” said professor Lee Jae-gap of the university’s research team who led the survey. “New measures are needed to curb the cases of HIV infection spread through young people,” Lee said.The study was published in the November 2017 issue of the Journal of Korean Medical Science.By Bak Se-hwan","urinalysis test in 2014 ,2014 of 237 teenagers ,medical study shows thursday ,of teenagers on probation ,123rfthe study released thursday","['south korean', 'Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital', 'Seoul']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50030947  0.32976058

YonhapAccording to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs released by Rep. Kim Cheol-min of the ruling Democratic Party, 2.1 trillion won of the total expenses were compensations for livestock culled as part of the authorities’ efforts to contain the outbreaks of the foot-and-mouth disease, bird flu, brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis. Separately, an additional 92 billion won was billed by local governments since 2015 to support farmhouses which saw livestock damage.Together with the disposal cost of culled livestock, personnel expenses and management cost of burying sites, at least 2.4 trillion won was spent over the past seven years on efforts to contain and prevent the spread of epidemics, the lawmaker said.About 72 percent or some 1.5 trillion won of the total compensation amount was given to foot-and-mouth disease-hit farms, followed by 400 billion won to farms hit by bird flu and 92 billion won to farms hit by bovine tuberculosis.Earlier this year, a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said poor breeding conditions at poultry farms in South Korea are to blame for the fast spread of animal diseases such as a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu in recent decades.By Kim Da-sol","epidemics lawmaker over 70 ,won billion of taxpayers ,of animal epidemics yonhapac ,over 70 million livestock ,animal epidemics lawmaker over",['South Korea'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27740964  0.5457859

Nam In-soon of the ruling Democratic Party cited the annual Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2016 conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which showed that 33.2 percent of 2,051 participants tested positive for latent TB infection. LTBI is a condition in which TB bacteria are present in the body but are dormant. That is the highest incidence rate among the 34-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as of last year. People aged 40 and above were found to be more affected than younger generations. Around 46.1 percent of people in their 40s tested positive for LTBI, while the incidence rate for the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups were at 48.7 percent and 45.0 percent, respectively. The LTBI incidence rate was the lowest among those aged between 10-29, standing at 6.5 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively. The contagious disease, which mainly occurs in developing countries, is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. It spreads through coughing and sneezing. Its symptoms include excessive weight loss, high fever and night sweats, and it could be fatal if not treated properly. In 2015, as many as 80 out of every 100,000 individuals here were TB positive, the highest according to OECD statistics. The OECD average rate stood at 11.4 patients per 100,000 people in the same year. The mortality rate of the infection also stand the highest among OECD member states, at 5.2 deaths out of 100,000 people, according to the group’s 2016 statistics.

The number is apparently increasing at an alarming rate this year, with already 1,763 reported during the January-July period.This trend is in contrast with a substantial decrease in the number of juvenile offenders in other crimes. From 2013 to 2016, the number of underage drug offenders has dropped from 506 to 56 while those involved in theft and physical violence have also decreased considerably.Experts attribute the rise in juvenile sex crimes to the overall ineffectiveness of the underage justice laws. Critics argue that the current system, centered mostly around probation monitoring and youth detention, is failing to register the notion with students that sexual assault is a grave crime.""Concerned ministries must work hard to produce programs to prevent juvenile sex offenses, while it is also imperative for corrective authorities to come up with measures, such as establishing special units dedicated to handling juvenile delinquents,"" Baek said.","000 underage sex offenders ,2016 ruling party lawmaker ,sex offenders in 2016 ,over 000 underage sex ,korea rose above 000","['South Korea', 'Democratic Party', 'Baek Hae - ryun']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27262181  0.44053507

But the holiday means “stress” for many foreign women, who moved to Korea after marrying Korean men, largely due to the cultural differences and language barriers.“Back in Cambodia, I looked forward to traditional holidays. It is when we wear beautiful clothes, prepare delicious food and go to a temple with family,” said Nagre, 34, who has lived in Seoul since she married a Korean man in 2007. “In Korea, it is terrifying and stressful. I sometimes feel like I am a machine  I wear an apron all day preparing food and washing dishes,” said Nagre, who lives with her in-laws. Her husband is the eldest son, making her the “chief” daughter-in-law, who is traditionally tasked with much of a family’s household chores. It was worse when she could not speak Korean, she said. “When I first got here and could not speak Korean, I didn‘t know what to do and was worried that I might make a mistake. We communicated through body language.”In a society where traditional ideas about gender roles still remain, Korean women, too, cannot be free from such stress during the family holiday. According to market research firm M-Brain Trend Monitor on 1,000 men and women aged between 19 and 59, 88 percent of the respondents thought that Chuseok holiday is tough for women. Some 69 percent said that it is a day on which hard labor is required of women. But the burden falls most heavily on foreign women who are not used to Korea’s patriarchal culture. “In Cambodia, men and women prepare food together. Here, men in general do not seem to help women a lot with household chores,” she said.  Foreign women learn to make half-moon shaped rice cake ahead of the Chusok holiday in Korea. For Nena, a 44-year-old Filipina who lives with her Korean husband and two teenage children, the most challenging part is preparing food for “charye,” a traditional ceremony involving a heavily laden table prepared in remembrance of ancestors. “We go shopping and begin preparations at least a week before the Chuseok holiday period begins. I was scolded a lot in the past for not knowing how to do it right. One time, I was told off for cooking rice including barley,” she said. During the traditional holidays, there are strict rules in setting the table and preparing the food for the ceremonies. The rules, complicated even for Koreans, include only using rice from the year’s harvest. “Making pancakes on the floor gives me a backache. I am getting used to it, but I have been stressed for years when the Chuseok holiday neared.” According to government data, there were over 152,000 foreigners married to Koreans and living here as of the end of 2016. Of these, 84.3 percent or about 128,000 are women, mostly from Asian countries. The majority of the foreign wives were from China, accounting for 35.2 percent, followed by Vietnam at 31.5 percent, Japan at 9.3 percent and the Philippines at 8.8 percent and Cambodia at 3.4 percent.Many of the foreign wives, who come from a big family in rural areas, describe Korea’s Chuseok holiday as “not fun“ amid the shrinking size of the average family and weakening connection with extended families and neighbors.“In the Philippines, we make a lot of food, it takes a longer time, but I didn’t find it difficult to do. I was happy,” she said. “We cooked a whole pig. We invite neighbors over and shared food all together.” “To be honest, I don’t feel like it is a family holiday here. I am worried about preparing food too much. I feel a heavy responsibility and burden. I want to skip it, even if it is just for once,” she said. While the work involved comes as a burden, foreign wives say that it is loneliness that is the biggest factor in making the holiday season difficult for them. “In general, my life got more comfortable here. But the thing is I am lonely, though my husband’s family treats me well. I wish my family could be here too. I miss them,” she said. Nagre and Nena are not their real names. They have been changed upon request. -- Ed.","wives for most koreans ,loneliness for foreign wives ,after marrying korean men ,most koreans this year ,marrying korean men largely","['Koreans', 'Korea', 'korean', 'Cambodia']",29,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64013284  0.74605387

According to a 2016 report on pop culture industry submitted by Korea Creative Content Agency to Rep. Kim Byung-wook of the Democratic Party, only 35.3 percent of the entertainers aged under 19 went to school every day despite their work schedule. Some 47 percent of them went to school two to three times a week and 5.9 percent went to school once or twice a month when they were working. Nearly 12 percent said they barely went to school, the report showed.The local law stipulates that the teenage entertainers’ right to learn must be included when agencies sign contracts with them. But only 20 percent of the agencies added the teenage entertainer’s duty to attend school to the terms and conditions of the contract. Nearly 53 percent of their agencies did not even check whether the teenage entertainers went to schools. The teenagers were required to work late at night without any prior request, the report showed. Some 15 percent of the agencies said they were not seeking an agreement from the teenagers when they asked them to work at night. For trainees, the working conditions were poorer. Some 23.5 percent of them did not sign a written contract with agencies. It took an average of one year and nine months for would-be actors and actresses to debut and two years and seven months for aspiring singers. Most of the agencies kicked out the trainees when they could not pass a monthly test. “There is an explosive increase in the number of teenage entertainers, but protecting their rights such as the right to learn is insufficient. The government should lay out standardized guidelines,” said Rep. Kim.","of 10 teenage entertainers ,school regularly report six ,10 teenage stars not ,10 teenage entertainers do ,10 teenage stars","['Korea Creative Content Agency', 'Kim Byung -', 'the Democratic Party']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75379884  0.56164104

By sector, the health and social welfare industry saw the highest percentage of the female employees  and their representation at high-ranking posts . In the heavy industry, only 5.8 percent of all workers were women and 1.5 percent of the posts in management were taken by women. Of all workers in the country, 37.8 percent of them were women last year, up 7.3 percent from 2005. Of the managerial posts at the surveyed workplaces, 20.4 percent of them were filled by women, a 10.2 percent rise from 2005.

Following a general assembly vote at the UIA World Architects’ Congress in Seoul on Sept. 9, Copenhagen beat out contenders Antalya, Baku, Kuala Lumpur and Lausanne to secure the candidacy of the conference, dubbed, the “Olympics of architecture.” Organized under the theme of “sustainable futures,” the congress in the Danish capital will explore various ways architects and urban policymakers can contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, a set of 17 global goals with 169 targets through 2030 aimed at transforming the world’s mode of industrial production and consumption for intergenerational prosperity and security. The objectives -- ranging from ending poverty and promoting public health and well-being to developing clean energy and fostering industrial innovation -- are integrally tied to the responsible planning, design and administration of cities worldwide, known as sustainable urbanism. Danish Ambassador to Korea Thomas Lehmann In this vein, the global gathering in Copenhagen will be a timely opportunity to discuss the various technological and policy innovations in green growth, said Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann in an interview. “Not only Copenhagen and Denmark, but the whole Nordic region has been strongly committed to sustainable development and sustainable urbanism. We try to live by example of environmentally, socially and economically healthy lives,” he highlighted at the Danish Embassy in Seoul last week. The Danish presentation at the Seoul congress at Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul from Sept. 2-17 highlighted progress reaped by Danish and Nordic architects in their collective quest to translate sustainability into the built environment, encompassing groundbreaking designs and technologies that save energy while mitigating global warming, according to the envoy. Copenhagen and Seoul both belong to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a network of the world’s 40 megacities committed to curbing climate change through sharing of best practices and knowledge.   Danish Ambassador to Korea Thomas Lehmann; Deputy Convention Director of Wonderful Copenhagen Bettina Reventlow-Mourier; and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon at the 2017 UIA World Architects' Congress in Seoul at Dongdaemun Design Plaza In Denmark, renewable energy accounts for nearly 30 percent of total national energy consumption and over 60 percent of aggregate electricity being generated. Denmark is a world leader in producing wind energy and wind turbine, with half of its electricity coming from wind sources. Biomass is the second-largest green energy source, and investments in solar energy have been gaining ground. The country aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050, while for Copenhagen the target year is 2025. Pointing to Danish cities’ process of involving citizens in democratic decision-making, Lehmann said, “Some people might say the process is slow and cumbersome, but we have a long planning horizon in our country to encourage civic involvement and engagement. It is a very positive thing because it allows architects and planners to hear citizens’ concerns and needs, and people feel close and committed to the process affecting their lives.”“It’s about fostering a sense of ownership around the local community,” he explained. “Because the process is based on consensus, people become more satisfied with end results.”Lehmann pointed to the Copenhagen Harbor -- where citizens can enjoy a variety of cultural and leisurely activities, including swimming, dining and strolling -- as a shining example of attractive and accessible public space. Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann  with Danish architects at the 2017 UIA World Architects' Congress in Seoul at Dongdaemun Design Plaza Responding to the issue of deepening economic polarization and spatial separation across “creative” postindustrial cities of the globe, as articulated by urban scholar Richard Florida in his new book, “The New Urban Crisis,” the ambassador said Danish cities have also experienced a rise in the value of properties, but that the trend is offset by statutory public housing, which accounts for a quarter of all residential stocks in major cities. “There is a big renting market in Denmark,” he said. “Everyone, regardless of their income, can live in cities. It makes our cities socially diverse and economically stable.”Danes are also down-to-earth in terms of their preference for transit, noted Lehmann, heavily relying on bicycles for commute in urban areas. The “unique cycling culture” in Denmark, with bicycles often outnumbering cars, started in the postwar era of economic boom, he said.“People could have easily chosen automobiles over bicycles during this period, but they made the conscious decision to use bikes as a viable and vital alternative,” according to the diplomat. “And they continue to use bikes, because it’s very efficient, healthy and affordable. There is a well-integrated thinking and infrastructure in terms of incorporating bicycles into urban mobility in Denmark. People can ride on their two wheels, and easily hop onto a subway or train for longer distance travel.”By Joel Lee","congress in 2023 danish ,in 2023 danish cities ,2023 danish cities will ,2023 danish cities ,interview copenhagen to champion","['the International Union of Architects', 'UIA', 'danish', 'Korea', 'the UIA World Architects ’ Congress', 'Seoul', 'Antalya', 'Baku', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Lausanne']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.99327832  0.45904037

Korea was followed by Poland with 2.3, Japan and Mexico with 2.4, the US and Canada with 2.6 and the UK and Slovenia with 2.8. Austria was the highest country with 5.1 doctors, followed by Norway with 4.4, Sweden and Switzerland with 4.2, and Germany with 4.1.Other data showed that some regions were more deprived of doctors than others. Seoul and its surrounding areas had 2.8 doctors per 1,000 people, more than twice the 1.3 doctors per 1,000 registered in North Gyeongsang Province, according to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs also forecast that the country would run short of 1,800 doctors in 2020, and 7,600 in 2030, based on the assumption that the number of patients remains the same.

According to 2017 Judicial Yearbook released by the Supreme Court, 32,594 couples got a divorce after living together for more than 20 years, accounting for 30.4 percent of all the divorces last year. The proportion of divorces accounted for by couples who have lived together for more than 20 years has been gradually increasing, from 26.4 percent in 2012 to 29.9 percent in 2015.  The number of couples who divorced after being married for less than five years was 24,597, standing at 22.9 percent of the total. “There could be many reasons, such as an increase in women’s economic status which made them lead an independent life,” Choi Yong-keun, a lawyer specializing in divorce, told The Korea Herald. The yearbook showed that more women in divorced couples had a job and income, indicating that they were in better financial shape when they decided to leave their partners. The employment rate for women in 2016 was 56.2 percent, up 7.3 percent from 2007. Some 40 percent of female divorcees were out of work, students or doing household tasks last year. The proportion has gradually dropped from 61 percent in 2007.Changed public perception of marriages and divorces also appears to be a key factor. “Divorce is no longer regarded as a shame as it used to be in the past,” Choi said. In South Korea, there has been a long-held stigma associated with divorce, viewing it a disgrace and a failure in life. There has been a tendency that couples would stay together despite problems for the sake of their children.The age of couples’ children also seemingly affected the decision on whether to get a divorce, the report showed. Among divorced couples, 52.1 percent had no underage children, followed by those who had one underage child at 25.6 percent and two at 18.8 percent. Only 3.5 percent had more than three underage children.As for reasons for a divorce, the biggest factor was differences in their personalities , followed by financial problems , family troubles , partner’s cheating  and physical and mental abuse . Most of the couples, or 82.2 percent, got a divorce through a consensus, while 17.7 percent went through court proceedings to break up with their partners.

The number will reach 1 million in 2024, 2 million in 2041 and 2.7 million in 2050.The government said that some 20 million won  is being spent on each dementia patient annually, based on its 2015 statistics. The total cost estimated at 13.2 trillion won accounts for some 0.9 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.By 2050, the figure will increase to 106.5 trillion won, equivalent to some 3.8 percent of the GDP, the ministry said. As of last year, the number of elderly dementia patients reported missing went up to 9,869 from 6,596 in 2010, while dementia patients accounted for 27 percent of the victims of elderly abuse cases reported in 2015.On Monday, the Health Ministry announced a new program to install more state-run clinics for dementia treatment and widen medical coverage offered by the state, in line with President Moon Jae-in’s campaign pledge to strengthen the state’s role in taking care of dementia patients.Starting December, the government will inject 160 billion won in setting up some 200 new support centers nationwide. Currently, there are 47 centers in operation, 25 of which are located in Seoul. Moon had stressed during his election campaign that the government should take more responsibility for the treatment of dementia. In June, Moon promised to introduce a 10 percent cap on the financial burden placed on those insured against dementia, a rate similar to those applied to four major age-related diseases -- cancer, cardiac disorders, cerebrovascular diseases -- and other rare incurable diseases.By Kim Da-sol","patients to surpass million ,south koreans aged 65 ,rapidly aging society data ,dementia patients to surpass ,surpass million by 2050","['South Korea', 'Kim Jung - sook', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'South Koreans']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77234608  0.48833838

It marked an increase by 11 percentage points compared to the previous year’s survey. The poll also found that 26 percent saw reunification as feasible within a decade, a large drop of about 18.9 percentage points from last year, while 9 percent believed it would take at least 30 years to achieve reunification. “The findings suggest a marked drop in public expectations for the reunification to occur in the near future after watching leader Kim Jong-un consolidating his grip on power,” researchers said. Kim, in his early 30s, succeeded his father Kim Jong-il upon his death in 2011. Under his dictatorship, the North has been accelerating nuclear weapons and missiles program, making itself a top concern for peace in not just Northeast Asia, but also the United States. With regard to the prospects of Kim Jong-un staying in power, 28.2 percent of respondents said Kim would maintain his dictatorship for more than 30 years, up 11.5 percentage points from last year. Those who said less than five years went down from the 10.1 percent last year to 7.6 percent. The poll also showed that almost 70 percent of defectors said they were not in favor of what Kim Jong-un was doing as the leader before they defected to the South, while just 7.6 percent said that the North Korean leader was doing “very well.”By Kim Da-sol","half north korean defectors ,defectors estimate korean reunification ,korean defectors estimate korean ,studies asked 132 defectors ,over half north korean","['north korean', 'south korean', 'korean', 'YonhapThe Seoul National University ’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'South Korea']",29,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.58835024  0.81172901

The accuracy rate fell 2.5 percent point to 45.2 percent last year from 47.7 percent in 2012, the report shows. The audit watchdog also pointed out in the report that the KMA took 26.7 seconds on average to issue quake alerts in three different events last year, while a neighboring Japan took 7.2 seconds on average. The BAI blamed the poor quality of predictions partly on the agency’s failure to set up a system to extract data from the country’s meteorological satellite Chollian-1 for weather forecasts, an essential process to enhance accuracy, according to the audit report. The agency spent a total of 119.2 billion won  to increase its forecast accuracy over the past five years.

The Ministry of Environment said its committee handling the management of the relief fund decided to charge 18 firms that had produced the deadly product a total of 125 billion won  to share the expenses for the relief fund. The move comes after the parliament enacted a special legislation for the victims who now suffer from permanent lung disease due to the long-term exposure to an anti-bacterial liquid containing polyhexamethylene guanidine used to clean household humidifiers.  A prosecution's probe revealed that the vendors, including the local unit of British consumer product maker Reckitt Benckiser, had sold the toxic product without a proper safety check. Apart from the 73 people who died, the surviving victims either need a lung transplant or to live with a breathing supporting device for the rest of their lives. The government's move also comes a day after President Moon Jae-in offered an official apology Tuesday to the victims and their families in a meeting at the presidential office to which he invited them for the first time.Oxy Reckitt Benckiser Korea, deemed the most accountable for the negligence, is required to pay 67.4 billion won, the largest share of the aid fund, followed by SK Chemical Co. with 34.1 billion won, the ministry said. Three victims, with the most serious diagnoses, are expected to receive up to 30 million won for medical support. The government has also put priority on those who fall under the lower-income category, it added.","125 billion won 110 ,measure after the scandal ,70 deaths amid intense ,of toxic humidifier disinfectant ,billion won 110 million",['the Ministry of Environment'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23581994  0.27907026

Another 17.4 percent answered the ideas being pushed by the government are highly insufficient.The survey was carried out from July 24-30 on 1,000 adults.The government is tackling a longstanding issue with consumers over their cellphone bills that are complicated by undisclosed subsidies and factory prices, stiff rivalry by carriers and minimum payments that are blamed for high costs of using mobile phones.Proposals include dividing the sector into handset makers who sell the devices and carriers who sell network plans. This kind of arrangement would also make the amount of subsidies transparent.  The ideas are opposed by carriers, which said they may take the issue to court if the government presses ahead.Respondents picked a proposal to scrap the 11,000 won  minimum payment as their favorite campaign pledge by now President Moon Jae-in in the mobile business sector. The pledge was supported by 58.1 percent of the respondents. Similarly, 72.7 percent said the government policy should focus on eliminating the minimum cost.""The survey has confirmed that a majority of people think that the government proposal on cost reduction is far from enough,"" the consumer group said.","shows most adults dissatisfied ,adults disapprove of government ,cellphone bills sixty percent ,most adults dissatisfied ,most adults dissatisfied with","['the Green Consumer Network', 'Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54838151  0.09926043

Recent figures show the majority of the population does not support homosexuality, in addition to the general indifference toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer rights and issues. But a growing number of young Koreans are expressing their identities publicly via YouTube. They make videos on all aspects of their LGBTQ lives: coming out, pride parades, Q&As; for the simply curious, and more. The Korea Herald met with some of these Korean YouTubers to discuss why they make their videos, and what it means to be part of the LGBTQ community in Korea today. Coming out in KoreaYouTuber Luke Williams When Luke Williams was outed as gay to his parents by his high school homeroom teacher, the response was unexpected. “My parents were really supportive. I cried when my mom told me, ‘You are my son anyway. I love you just the way you are,’” he said. He started broadcasting via YouTube in 2015, when he realized many did not have such positive experiences. His first video is entitled, “Coming Out in Korea.” “I saw one article about 70 percent of LGBT teenagers in Korea trying to commit suicide, and I thought my coming out was not that difficult compared to other Koreans. So I decided to share my experiences of gay life in Korea on YouTube,” he said. Responses to Williams’ videos are largely positive but his openness is still a foreign concept for some who are used to living closeted lives. “Actually, some Korean LGBT people think I am making the community worse off by showing our lifestyle. They want to keep our culture secret,” he said. Williams recently moved to the US for work and study, but says he will continue spreading awareness of Korea’s LGBT culture. “I will not stop being a gay Korean YouTuber until every LGBT person can be happy, with equal rights,” he said. New channel on genderqueer issuesYouTuber Hayden Royalty For Hayden Royalty, realizing they were “genderqueer” -- an individual who does not prescribe to socially defined concepts of “man” or “woman” -- was a moment of clarity. For this reason, Royalty uses “they” and “their” as preferred pronouns. “Sometime in college, I met people who told me they identified as genderqueer. And when they explained that to me, I felt like they were describing me,” Royalty said. Launched in late 2016, Royalty wants their channel to add diversity to YouTube -- a non-binary, Korean-American perspective. “Luckily, my experience of being queer in Korea hasn’t been a problem. I think foreigners are perceived differently and they get a pass for a lot of behaviors,” Royalty said. In a community that Royalty feels is still quite disconnected, LGBTQ YouTube channels may also help to stimulate dialogue and solidarity. “I was really surprised to hear that lesbians didn’t have any gay male friends and vice versa. You don’t have to fight on the front lines and show up for protests, but educating yourself and others and exchanging conversations definitely helps,” Royalty said. Although Royalty originally started the channel to make insightful videos, Royalty hopes their channel can increase visibility in wider popular culture. “I would love to be shown in mainstream media and help make queer and Asian people here and in America visible. My dream would be to play a queer character in a show or film,” Royalty said. Not alone: reaching out through YouTubeYouTuber Soo Not Sue At first, Soo’s YouTube channel was just for fun -- a way to combine her love of social media and an interest in photography and video-making. But what was initially a hobby is now part of a bigger voice. Along with three other YouTubers, Soo was one of six ambassadors for the 2017 Korea Queer Culture Festival. Being a public face of a largely underground community has its drawbacks though. “Some people say I’m disgusting. I try not to care, but sometimes it hurts me because I’m also human,” she said. Despite challenges, Soo wants to keep making content that resonates with people like herself. She was touched when fans she met at this year’s pride festival said her videos were encouraging.“Many closeted people feel like they are alone because they don’t have queer friends with whom they can share their story. But when they watch my videos, they feel like they are not alone,” she said. She plans to make more short film-style coming-out stories, starting with her own coming out as a bisexual woman just a few weeks ago. Although she has been on YouTube for two years, she now finally feels comfortable enough to be honest about her identity, and hopes others can do the same.“You can love who you love. There are so many queer people like you in this country. Be proud of yourself,” she says.

The JNTO said the sharp increase in the number of Korean tourists reflects an improved perception of safety in Japan after a passage of time since the Kumamoto earthquake in April last year. The agency also said that Koreans are now more likely to travel to Japan rather than China due to the conflict between Korea and China over the deployment of a US anti-missile system.The Japanese government aims to attract 40 million foreign tourists annually in 2020, when Tokyo is set to host the Summer Olympics.

China was the origin of some 34 percent of the particles, while 9 percent came from North Korea. The study was conducted between May and June, when the China factor is considered to be lower than during the winter and early spring. A previous study by Yale and Greenpeace released in 2015 estimated that 50-70 percent of fine dust was domestically sourced.“The impact of sources outside Korea varies greatly with season and requires further study, as much of the KORUS AQ study period was characterized by meteorology preventing direct transport from East Asia,” the report said.James Crawford, lead scientist on the project, also said that the influence of domestic emissions was maximized when the observation took place last year.“The meteorological conditions during the study were very favorable for understanding how local emissions contribute to the local air quality problems,” Crawford told The Korea Herald. “But the actual conditions will be influenced by year-to-year differences in meteorology and seasonal differences in long-range transport ,” he said. Park Jin-won, director of NIER, said the findings will help determine pollutants’ origin and understand what measures to take domestically to improve air quality, after decades of rapid industrial development and growth in coal-fired power plants here. South Korea saw the worst air quality ever recorded between January and March this year, with the average concentration of PM 2.5 -- ultrafine particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter -- standing at a record 32 micrograms per cubic meter, much higher than the World Health Organization standard of 25 micrograms per cubic meter per day. In 2016 Environmental Performance Index released by Yale University, South Korea ranked 173rd among 180 countries in terms of air quality. China ranked the bottom. According to the preliminary analysis of the KORUS AQ study, ground level observations in Seoul showed that nitrates gas, which principally comes from motor vehicle exhaust – accounts for roughly half of the air particulate pollution.More than half of PM 2.5 were composed of volatile organic compounds  and black carbon , very fine particles that can pass much more easily and deeply into the lungs and pose greater threat to respiratory systems.The study also suggested that ozone concentrations can be attributed to the high volume of vehicles in metropolitan areas and emissions from chemical factories and coal-fired power plants in the southern region. Citing an example of airborne observation near the Daesan chemical facility complex in South Chungcheong Province, the report said ozone concentration was 10 times higher there, with 25 different kinds of VOCs. The province also has 26 of the country’s 59 coal-fired power plants.More detailed observations are needed regarding these facilities to understand exposures for workers as well as people living and working nearby, researchers said in the report. Ozone, which is created when pollutants react with each other and the air, can trigger several health problems, including chest pain, coughing and throat irritation. Currently, the NIER issues an ozone advisory when the concentration hits 120 ppb for more than an hour. Seoul had ozone advisories issued on 29 days last year. President Moon Jae-in had announced his vision for cleaner air by introducing a series of measures including stricter emissions tests for diesel vehicles and permanently closing old coal-fired power plants by the end of his term.In that vein, last month, he ordered a stoppage of 10 coal-fired power plants that had been in operation for 32 to 44 years.Coal has been highlighted as a source of fine dust, coupled with emissions and yellow dust originating from China. The final report will be released in 2019. By Kim Da-sol","52 percent of korea ,about half of korea ,half of korea ,korean institute and nasa ,half of korea fine","['Korea', 'China', 'south korean', 'NASA', 'Korea', 'US', 'KORUS AQ', 'NASA', 'Korea ’s National Institute of Environmental Research', 'Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3383275   0.70953983

Another clinic charged 10 million won and 17 million won for local and foreign patients, respectively, for the same breast surgery. Both of the clinics were popular and had received patients from other countries.The clinics attributed the price difference to the inclusion of foreigner-exclusive options, such as translation services. According to clinic officials, foreigners who visit Korea for plastic surgery have more time-sensitive demands since they often have a limited period of stay in Korea. Since periodic postoperative checkups are difficult once they leave Korea, clinics provide them additional services like special scar care following the surgery. Officials added that non-local patients are also given priority in scheduling the surgery date.However, foreign patients are often not given the freedom to opt out of these additional services.

A total of 5,101 men signed up for paternity leave in the first half of this year, up 52.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. The number came to 7,616 for all of last year, while that for 2015 stood at 4,872, the ministry said. Given the pace of applications, the total number for this year will likely surpass the 10,000 mark, the ministry added.As of end-June, men accounted for 11.3 percent of a total of 44,860 who took family leave, up 4 percentage points from the previous year. The brisk rise of fathers taking time off for parenting is attributable to the government policy that promotes the idea of sharing the responsibility for raising kids and moves to expand financial support in line with the policy drive, the ministry said. The South Korean government pays a maximum 1.5 million won  in allowance for the first three months of paternity leave. A woman on maternity leave is entitled to a maximum monthly payment of 1 million won for up to one year.  The government has recently raised the allowance for fathers taking leave for their second child, and is pushing to increase the upper threshold of the monthly allowance for women. In Korea, an employee with a child aged under 8 is by law allowed to take family leave for up to one year. A company that breaches the rule can be fined as much as 5 million won.","fathers taking paternity leave ,government data showed monday ,fathers taking paternity ,steady rise labor ministry ,fathers taking time off",['the Ministry of Employment and Labor'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56336749  0.54887265

The employment number for the elderly is the highest on record so far and accounts for 15.9 percent of all people hired in the quarter.Seniors outdid youths in landing jobs for the first time in the third quarter last year, by a margin of 33,000. The trend continued except for the first quarter this year. Elderly job seekers study the recruitment bulletin. Officials say the demographic change from the low birthrate is the major cause behind the trend.""The population of people 60 and older has outpaced the younger group, and the gap is widening,"" said Bin Hyun-jin, who monitors employment numbers at Statistics Korea. ""Such structure is the main reason behind this reversal.""The growing number of impoverished seniors and the frozen labor market for the young generation also pushed the shift, other officials said, adding that higher employment of the elderly is not necessarily all positive.A report released last year by the Korea Labor Force Development Institute for the Aged showed that 31.8 percent of the elderly hold menial jobs, an indication that they work for sustenance, since they do not have enough income after retirement.Second-quarter figures from the statistics agency said the unemployment rate for youths was 10.4 percent, the highest since the counting method was revised in 1999.","employment surpassed the number ,korea 25 million people ,25 million people aged ,demographics data showed friday ,june more than the",['Statistics Korea'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75774336  0.92632866

Since he took power in December 2011, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been toughening border controls and punishment for unsuccessful escape attempts. After reaching its peak at 2,914 in 2009, the yearly tally began to sharply dwindle under Kim, to 1,502 in 2012, 1,514 in 2013, 1,397 in 2014, 1,275 in 2015 and 1,418 in 2016. The regime appears to have since late 2015 installed high-tension wires in the border regions like the Tumen River basin, reinforced guard post surveillance and changed law to prevent failed runaways from being pardoned, according to an annual white paper on North Korea’s human rights issued last March by the ministry-affiliated Korea Institute for National Unification based on testimonies of 196 new arrivals. “The number of defectors has indeed declined since Kim seized power including this year,” ministry spokesman Lee Duk-haeng said at a news briefing. “There may be various reasons behind the decrease but mostly internal factors should have played out, and we have yet to confirm the news reports on high-wire tension.” By Shin Hyon-hee","korean defectors drops 21 ,south fell 20 percent ,defectors drops 21 in ,of 593 north koreans ,593 north koreans arrived","['North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'the Unification Ministry', 'North Koreans', 'Seoul']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36651072  0.63104147

The number of Chinese tourists plunged 64.1 percent in May compared with the same period last year, marking a drop for three straight months after the Beijing government banned the country's travel agencies from selling Korea-bound package tours. Beijing has opposed the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, claiming it hurts its national security. Seoul has argued the THAAD system is for the sole purpose of countering military threats from North Korea.The neighboring country's travel restriction, which took effect in mid-March, has dealt a blow to the local tourism industry, which has heavily relied on Chinese demand.

Exports of Chinese oil to the North rose, while China's purchases of iron ore increased. Trump wants Beijing to use its status as North Korea's only major ally and source of oil and export markets to pressure Pyongyang to renounce nuclear development. But Chinese leaders are reluctant to press the North too hard for fear its government might collapse. ""Unless North Korea starts a war against China or some other country, China will not cut off all trade,"" said Shi Yinhong, an international relations specialist at People's University in Beijing.  ""Some  activities are not for making money but for political concerns, so the people in Pyongyang will want to listen to us sometimes when we talk,"" said Shi. ""The United States does that too."" Trump on Wednesday cited a Chinese Customs agency statement that Chinese-North Korean trade rose 36.8 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter of the year. That appeared to be at odds with Chinese data that showed a rise of just 7.4 percent. But the Customs agency said Thursday in an emailed response to questions the change was bigger due to a revision in last year's figures that was not published. It gave no other details. Following the North's fifth nuclear test in November in defiance of U.N. demands, Beijing announced in February it was suspending imports of North Korean coal, a key revenue source for the Pyongyang. As a result, Chinese purchases of North Korean coal are off 45 percent this year, according to a South Korean industry group, the Korea International Trade Association. At the same time, Chinese purchases of North Korean iron ore, a key export for the mineral-rich North, rose 34 percent over a year earlier, according to KITA.  Chinese oil sales to the North rose 18 percent in the first five months of the year to $35 million, according to KITA. Other top Chinese exports to North Korea included telephone equipment, textiles, soybean oil and vehicles, it said. Total trade for the first five months of the year was just over 14 billion yuan , a tiny sum for China, the world's biggest trader. But the relationship with North Korea, which shares a border with China, is politically significant. In a sign of growing frustration, Beijing agreed for the first time in March 2016 to enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions following Pyongyang's test of a missile possibly capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. China banned coal imports the following month but allowed some purchases for civilian use. That reflected Beijing's strategy of trying to push the North's leadership to comply without destabilizing its economy. Without coal sales, trade growth is driven instead by rising Chinese exports to the North, leaving Pyongyang with a widening trade deficit. In May, three-quarters of total trade consisted of Chinese exports to the North.","most north korean exports ,imports off sharply beijing ,korean exports have fallen ,year rose 15 percent ,chinese purchases of most","['AP', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'U.N.', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'Customs', 'Chinese', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'China']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43210262  0.6751768

The 2016 figure means an incidence rate of 171.1 per 100,000 people, up from 134.5 in 2013. Two elementary students are walking on sidewalks. Symptoms of precocious puberty include rapid growth, changes in body shape and size, and the development of the ability to reproduce before the age of 8 in girls and 9 in boys. Sejong, a government administrative city some 130 kilometers southeast of Seoul, marked the highest rate of reported cases at 421.8 per 100,000 people. Environmental hormones from new apartment buildings could lead to early puberty in children, said Jeong Eun-ah, head of Wooasung oriental medicine clinic. “Another cause of the highest rate is that the city has a high influx of population, and the number of children moving here is rapidly increasing,” Jeong told The Korea Herald. Without proper treatment, early puberty patients can suffer from reduced adult height later in life due a disorder in the growth plates, according to Samsung Medical Center in Seoul.

The largest number of Korean households with children  had one breadwinner and one adult not working. That figure is much higher than the equivalent figure for the OECD, of 31 percent. In the report that used the OECD Family Database and the Labor Ministry’s statistics, the ministry cited the practice of working long hours and the burden for housework falling overwhelmingly on women as key reasons behind the low proportion of double-income households in the country.  In Korea, 16.5 percent of the housework was done by men, who spent only 45 minutes on domestic work per day, the lowest among the OECD countries. In the OECD, men did 33.6 percent of the housework on average, spending 138 minutes per day. Some 23.1 percent of Koreans worked longer than 50 hours and had 14.7 hours of spare time. In the OECD, 13 percent of people worked longer than 50 hours and had 14.9 hours of free time on average, the report showed. When children are 2 years old or younger, 34.4 percent of households from the OECD nations had both parents working. The proportion increased to 47.6 percent when the kids were aged between 6 and 14. During the same period, the percentage of Korean dual-income households rose from 19.6 percent to 25.7 percent.“The work environment in Korea is not woman-friendly, so the proportion of households with a male breadwinner is still high,” Kim Kyung-sun, an official in charge of the report from the ministry.“As seen in the analysis, men need to more actively participate in housework and the practice of working long hours should be fixed.” By Ock Hyun-ju","percent of korean families ,29 percent of korean ,only in 10 families ,korean families with children ,just 30 of families","['South Korea', 'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'korean']",29,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.6205743   0.59653133

The poll came a day after President Moon Jae-in urged the introduction of a ""blind screening"" system for hiring all new employees in the public sector, saying it will help ensure jobs go to the most qualified, instead of those with better personal or school ties.   Under the blind system, job applicants will not be obliged to write down their academic background, physical condition or birthplace unless the jobs they are seeking to land require such information. The move is apparently aimed at removing the possibility of public firms or recruiters hiring employees based on their ties or acquaintances with the job applicant or family members.","office workers feel alienated ,friday top online job ,south korean office workers ,10 workers feel left ,of 352 office employees","['south korean', 'JobKorea', 'JobKorea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61121815  0.39948443

The number of the country's long-term unemployed tends to hit a nadir in February and peak in August or September when large companies start their second-half hiring.In recent months, the number has been on a steady rise as local companies fret over future business conditions despite recent signs of a recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy.""The recent economic recovery is limited to exports and some other sectors, while relying on the construction sector in the first quarter, which usually hires short-term workers,"" said Sung Tae-yoon, an economics professor at Yonsei University in Seoul.""Such a situation would have not been of much help to change a reality where the number of long-term unemployed people is rising,"" Sung added.Some analysts said the government's push to convert temporary workers in the public sector into regulars may have made companies hesitant to make decisions on employment while sizing up its impact.South Korea's new President Moon Jae-in has vowed to eliminate all nonregular jobs in the public sector during his five-year term as part of his signature job creation campaign. Moon, who took office May 10, has promised to create 810,000 new quality jobs in the public sector over the next five years.Others expected the implementation of an extra budget to help slightly reduce the number of the long-term unemployed.

According to the survey by local matchmaking firm Duo, 96 percent of men and women answered positively when asked about their perception of people getting remarried after separating from their spouse. The survey was conducted this month based on 249 people.  The company said 45 percent of the respondents said they were fine with the idea of a person remarrying or remaining single, while 40.6 percent said tying the knot again is necessary depending on the situation. Another 10.8 percent said remarriage is something that should take place. Those who said it is unnecessary stood at just 3.6 percent, according to the poll.Meanwhile, 45 percent of people who remained single said they would walk down the aisle with a person who was wed in the past, whereas 70.3 percent answered positively to a situation in which they are remarrying and their partner is tying the knot for the first time. The findings are in line with the latest trends of remaining single or marrying late in South Korea.The number of marriages in South Korea fell to the lowest level in more than 40 years in 2016, as young people delayed marriage amid a prolonged economic slowdown. The social perception of a person marrying again has mellowed over the years.The average age of first-time brides and grooms reached a record 30.1 years and 32.8 years, respectively, last year.","remarriage poll showed wednesday ,koreans in their 20s ,people getting remarried after ,percent of south koreans ,96 percent of men","['South Koreans', 'Duo']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48538834  0.99000341

According to a survey by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea on 385 female migrants, 11.7 percent of the women said they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by their coworkers or managers while working in Korea. In the poll, which allowed multiple responses, they said they had been exposed to vulgar jokes, forced to pour drinks for coworkers at office meals, subjected to unwanted physical contact, offered to sell sex and even raped.Among 45 individuals, seven people said they had put up with the abuse without telling anyone. Some 11 people verbally protested, while three people sought consultation from religious groups and civic organizations. Only one person filed a complaint with the Labor Ministry. Others did not give an answer. Only seven of the sexual abuse victims said that they had received an apology. For six migrants, there were no actions taken. Three people chose to change their workplaces and two quit their jobs, becoming unregistered workers. Human rights activists supporting female migrant workers had a dramatically different perception of the sexual abuse faced by female migrants. Among 50 activists polled by the human rights watchdog, 74 percent of them said the level of sexual harassment or violence facing female workers was “severe.” Under the current employment system, migrant workers are banned from changing their workplaces without their employers’ agreement, which activists say puts them at a disadvantage and at risk of rights abuses.Female migrant workers also experienced gender-based discrimination, with 23.6 percent saying so. Among them, 76.7 percent said they were discriminated against in terms of income, followed by job assignments and employment opportunities . Nearly 40 percent of them said they had been disadvantaged because of their appearance.Female migrants were also paid less than male counterparts, the report showed. Most of the woman  were paid between 1 million won  and 2 million won, while 52.7 percent of their male counterparts received more than 2 million won. “In general, the working conditions for female migrant workers are worse than those for men. They are subject to comprehensive discrimination as they are women, foreigner and worker, there needs to be more in-depth discussion on human rights violations facing them,” the report said.According to Statistics Korea, the number of foreign residents aged 15 or over stood at 1.42 million as of 2016.

Exemption numbers in the US reached 35.8 percent in 2013 figures, and 33.5 percent for Canada.Those who reported an annual earned income of 10 million won  or less were not obliged to pay income-related dues in 2015, while 86.3 percent of workers with an income range of 10-15 million won were also exempt.In the 30-40 million won income band, 30.3 percent of workers paid no tax in 2015, up sharply from 4.6 percent in 2013. The figure reached 19.5 percent and 12.8 percent for income groups with earnings hitting 40-45 million and 45-50 million won, respectively. The report said a combined 876,000 people who earned 30 million won or more in 2015 did not pay income taxes.Tax hike issues have been emerging in South Korea as President Moon promised to focus more on job creation and expanding welfare for young people. He said his government will create some 800,000 public jobs during his five-year term, grant an allowance to young jobseekers and offer public residence to newlyweds at lower rent.To fulfill his pledges, Seoul will need an additional 178 trillion won over the five-year period. The president had hinted at a hike in corporate and income taxes, and a removal of tax exemptions and benefits to secure funds.Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon also said he will focus on reducing corporate tax-cut benefits and other tax exemptions, instead of raising income tax ratesIn 2016, income tax revenue amounted to 31 trillion won, accounting for 12.8 percent of the country's total tax income of 242.6 trillion won.","half of korean workers ,tax report said tuesday ,17 million wage earners ,debates on tax hike ,tax report nearly half","['south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Korea Institute of Public Finance']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03800523  0.45776057

The premature birthrate was 56.72 percent for twins and higher-order multiples between 2013 and 2014, much higher than 4.66 percent for single babies.Im said babies born prematurely make up about 10 percent of all births around the world. Such babies are more susceptible to diseases and can lead to death if medical conditions are poor.Any premature delivery within 24 weeks of pregnancy can lead to death because the babies' brains are not fully formed.

The world’s average number of used paid vacation days is 20, while Korea is the only country under 10 days, according to the data.The findings also showed that 48 percent of Korean workers answered that a tight work schedule and lack of substitute workers were reasons for not using up all their annual leave.“Korean workers have a very long working time. But they can’t use vacations properly and their leisure time is relatively low, causing a serious imbalance of work and leisure,” said Kim Ji-hak, a researcher at the KCTI.He added that if workers used all of the statutory annual leave, the country may create a considerable number of jobs and it could have a greater economic ripple effect.By Byun Hee-jin","their annual paid vacation ,paid leave south korean ,paid vacation in 2013 ,korean workers use average ,annual paid vacation","['south korean', 'the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute', 'Korea', 'Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6863184   0.17971255

While other felonies -- arson, robbery and murder -- saw a decline during the period, sex crimes soared by 117.6 percent from 14,277 in 2006 to 31,063 in 2015, according to the 2016 White Paper on Crime published by Institute of Justice.  The total number of offenses increased by 10.5 percent from 1,829,211 in 2006 to 2,020,731 in 2015.

There needs to be stronger policing to prevent the soaring number of sex crimes,” the report said. The jump in sex crimes could mean an actual rise in the offenses committed, but there are other contributing factors, it pointed out. “The enactment of sex crime-related laws and revisions to them as well as the increase in the number of people reporting sex crimes to authorities are also reflected in the number,” it said.

Nearly 5 percent of the victims of sex crimes in 2015 were children aged 12 or younger and 86.3 percent of them were girls.

Some 37 percent had no previous criminal records in 2015.The indictment rate for felonies stood at 47.8 percent in 2015, down 4.5 percentage points from the previous year, meaning the prosecution only filed charges against roughly half the cases.

The prosecution indicted 37 percent of the suspects in 14,263 cases. It is a similar indictment rate to that of all criminal suspects in Korea, which stands at 36.8 percent.A total of 1,736 Koreans were caught committing offenses abroad in 2015, an 11.9-percent increase from a year earlier. The types of crimes were fraud, violence and injury, robbery and drugs. The number of Koreans subject to crimes abroad has also seen a 39.4-percent hike in 2015 from the previous year.

Retired people hold a news conference in Seoul on May 24, 2017, to urge government efforts to create jobs for middle-aged and senior citizens. Another 9 percent answered they were seeking ways to prepare for post-retirement jobs or in the process of making specific preparations.The remaining 60.9 percent said they were not preparing to land jobs after retirement as they didn't consider such efforts necessary.The outcome of the survey, taken from Aug. 9-Sept. 9 last year, was carried in a report released by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.Analysts said the findings reflect the country's reality in which retired people should work to earn a living due to a lack of sufficient pension and welfare systems.According to a recent government report, South Korean subscribers to the state pension program receive a monthly pension payment equivalent to 24 percent of their average monthly salaries during their overall working years.  In terms of market income that includes salaries and other income, South Korea's poverty rate for the elderly came to 63.3 percent in 2015, the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.According to separate data from Statistics Korea in May 2016, 61.2 percent of South Koreans aged 56-79 wanted to work in the future, with 58 percent of them hoping to do so in order to help supplement their living costs.As of 2015, the employment rate of South Koreans aged 65 or older reached 30.6 percent, the second highest among OECD member nations after Iceland's 38.7 percent.

Institute officials noted that the ratio of negative perspective toward China nearly tripled from a similar survey taken two years ago. In the 2015 poll, the ratios of positive, neutral and negative opinions were tallied at 47 percent, 32 percent and 21 percent, respectively.The survey was carried by global opinion research firm Ipsos from Feb. 23 to March 19 at the request of six institutions in five Asia-Pacific countries, including the Asan institute and the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, with a 95 percent confidence level.In a question about China's influence on Asia, 49 percent of Korean respondents answered there is more harm than good, with the ratio of neutral and positive viewpoints standing at 39 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Two years ago, the share of negative responses to the same question was merely 12 percent, officials said.They speculated that the surge in negative perspective of China among the South Korean people may have to do with a strained bilateral relationship stemming from Beijing's economic retaliations in return for the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea.As for the current security situation on the Korean Peninsula, 85 percent of South Koreans gave a negative evaluation, while a mere 15 percent felt positive about it. Over 70 percent of the respondents painted a negative outlook for inter-Korean relations during the tenure of U.S. President Donald Trump.All respondents in South Korea, Australia, Japan and Indonesia cited North Korea as the No. 1 factor of regional conflict, Asan officials said.Among South Korean respondents, 44 percent pointed to North Korea as the biggest conflict factor, followed by China at 29 percent and Japan at 16 percent, they added.","60 of koreans negative ,758 adult south koreans ,koreans negative about china ,south koreans have negative ,percent negatively evaluated china","['South Koreans', 'China', 'South Koreans', 'the Asan Institute for Policy Studies', 'China', 'South Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48038     0.74546486

The corresponding number for regular workers was 7.8 percent. The study was conducted by professors Ham Byoung-ju and Han Kyu-man at Korea University Hospital. It surveyed 6,266 workers aged 19 or over  who had participated in the 2010-2012 national health and nutrition report.Prevalence for depression was measured by whether a person suffered depressive moods serious enough to affect their daily lives for longer than two weeks. People surveyed were also asked whether they had experienced suicidal impulses at least once over the past year. For the latter, 13.6 percent of temporary workers said they did, compared with 8 percent of permanent employees.""Not just prevalence, but the risk level for depression was 1.32 times higher for irregular workers than regular workers,"" Han said. ""In case of suicidal impulses, it was more prevalent among male irregular workers and the low-income group.""Ham said the study verifies that nonpermanent workers whose job stability is weak are more vulnerable psychologically.

According to the latest research by the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, only 17 percent of fathers interviewed went to the ceremony of their kids' first day at elementary school, compared with 92.8 percent of mothers. The survey was based on interviews conducted on 1,469 fathers and 1,556 mothers with children who turned 7 years old in 2016.  Fathers posted a poor participation level in other school-related events, such as field days, parent-teacher meetings and open classroom sessions, with the results coming to about 16 percent, 8.8 percent and 5 percent for each occasion, respectively. Mothers, in contrast, showed an attendance rate of around 70 to nearly 80 percent. While only 1.5 percent of mothers said they never attended any school events for their child, the corresponding figure for fathers stood at 79.1 percent, mirroring an extremely low father commitment to parenting. The institute called on the government, as well as the private sector, for more policy efforts to further encourage the implementation of a flexible hours program at the workplace, since kids entering a school means a big change for parents as well. The government has introduced a number of child care support systems to benefit working parents, including child care leave that entitles both mothers and fathers, and a flexible hours program, but few fathers choose to take time off from work, citing an unsupportive work environment and even fear of being sidelined for promotions and losing their jobs afterward.Nevertheless, many male workers with children agreed that such child care policies do help them participate more in parenting, with over 30 percent of the respondents picking the flexible work hours system as being ""very helpful,"" according to the study.","parenting study fathers ,education only 17 percent ,parenting study fathers are ,17 percent of fathers ,to parenting study fathers",['the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.87065536  0.42307788

This is in contrast to 0.6 percent of those in their 50s who ate instant food on a regular basis. About 12 percent of the solo households said they rely on instant foods such as frozen dishes for daily meals, reflecting a trend toward an unbalanced diet, since many of the home meal replacements  contain higher sodium and lower vitamins and minerals.Reflecting this, the poll showed 44.3 percent of respondents saying they consumed vegetables and fruit 4.5 times on average during a week. Men tended to eat fewer vegetables or fruit with numbers standing at 36.5 percent, while 52.4 percent of the female participants said they regularly consumed them.

Kim pointed out that local companies could face greater cost burdens, given the possibility of older workers getting higher wages compared with their productivity, adding that some industries may face hiring difficulties due to a shortage of young skilled workers.South Korea has been gripped by fast population aging. The country is widely predicted to become an aged society in 2017 with the ratio of people aged 65 and older hitting 14 percent of its 50 million population. It is forecast to emerge as a super-aged society in 2026, with the figure hovering above 20 percent.","koreans getting older report ,difficulties recruiting new employees ,country rapid population aging ,employed koreans getting older ,rapid population aging",['South Koreans'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30094689  0.59299576

The capital blanketed in a gray haze caused by fine dust in the air. The ratio of fine dust particles blowing from Incheon and Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul, meanwhile, decreased in the same period from 18 percent to 12 percent, according to the study.The study was conducted from May 2015 to December 2016 based on the 2013 data of air pollutant emissions released by the National Institute of Environmental Research in June last year. The previous report in 2011 was based on the 2008 data.In terms of emission sources, the influence from traffic has decreased from 52 percent to 37 percent, while the impact from heating and electricity increased from 27 percent to 39 percent, the report said.During the period of a fine dust advisory from Oct. 19-22, 2015, China and other foreign countries were blamed for 72 percent of the pollution in Seoul, up 17 percentage points from 55 percent recorded in ordinary times.The report said the transfer of polluted air from China's industrial regions, such as Hebei Province or Shandong Provinces, seems to have led to the increase.South Korea has been grappling with worsening air quality every year, as clouds of fine dust particles cover the sky with a yellow haze.

The results showed that of babies born to fathers aged 20-54, 38.7 percent were born to fathers aged 35-54 in 2010, almost double the 20.2 percent in 2000. The trend was more so for mothers. The corresponding numbers for them rose from 6.7 percent in 2000 to 17.2 percent in 2010.The findings were carried in the latest online version of international journal Human Fertility.According to the study, the age of parents having their first child was also rising. For men, the average age of first-time fathers was 29.4 in 1997. It increased to 33.1 in 2014. In case of women, it rose from 26.4 to 30.5.The study pointed out that parental age can influence babies' health, education and socio-economic factors in both the short and long term, and while low fertility is not due solely to the aging of the parents, the impact is not negligible.""Potential parents and policymakers can use this information to time births more appropriately, thereby reducing risks to babies and mothers,"" it said.","children after turning 35 ,more men having children ,years study showed friday ,doubling over 10 years ,korean men are having","['south korean', 'Sohn Kitae', 'Curtin University', 'Australia', 'South Korea']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72710025  0.63671172

Those who drink alcohol twice a week -- at least five to seven cans of beers each time -- were at 18.4 percent.Residents of Cheorwon County, Gangwon Province, were most likely to follow healthy lifestyles -- at least half of its residents were nonsmokers who walk daily and drink less alcohol. This was followed by residents of Yeongdeungpo-gu , Yangcheon-gu  and Songpa-gu  in Seoul. In contrast, areas in rural regions mostly ranked at the bottom.Residents of Jeongseon County in Gangwaon , Geochang County in South Gyeongsang Province , Uiseong County in North Gyeongsang Province  and Goseong County in Gangwon Province showed a low rate of practicing a healthy lifestyle. Researchers who participated in the survey said that although lifestyle differences exist between urban and rural areas, the gap is gradually narrowing. “We would like to use this data to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas in maintaining healthy lifestyles, by activating health care services and related business,” said Chung Ki-seok, chief of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Meanwhile, those who regard themselves as fat and do not routinely exercise were on the rise -- from 26.3 percent last year to 27.9 percent this year. Experts say busy lifestyles and a high dependence on instant food are the main culprits behind the increase.

Officials at the Seoul government said the launch of its special control team in August 2015 and its intensive crackdowns on taxi fare scams appears to have contributed to reducing the amount of overcharging.Foreign tourists being ripped off by taxi drivers within Seoul also has decreased, they noted.A ride from Dongdaemun, a major shopping district in downtown, to Myeongdong, Yongsan and other frequent central Seoul destinations cost foreign passengers 21,800 won on average in recent months compared with 48,900 won in the 2016-2015 period. The relatively short trip usually costs just 4,000 to 6,000 won.""There has been a notable change. Unlike in the past, taxi drivers appear to be refraining from excessive overcharging of foreigners to avoid the crackdowns. Instead, they are suspected of continuing to rip off tourists on a smaller scale,"" an official said.The Seoul government said it will mobilize more civil servants fluent in foreign languages to crack down even on small-sum rip-offs. In one of the crackdown methods, civil servants seek to interview foreign passengers getting out of taxis or vans at the entrances of major hotels, it noted.Under the current rules, a taxi driver is fined 200,000 won for the first overcharging offense.

The study, conducted by professor Kang Young-ho, looked at 1.59 million people between 2008 and 2014. It looked at both genders in 245 counties and cities.Male smokers in 236 of the 245 locations followed the overall correlation between smoking and income levels. Female smokers’ income levels corresponded to the findings in 239 of the locations. In all 245 places, the smoking rate among the bottom 20 percent of the income pyramid was higher than the top 20 percent. Bundang-gu, Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, had the lowest smoking rate among male residents in the upper 20 percent income bracket with 26.4 percent, while Taebaek, Gangwon Province, had the highest smoking rate in the lower 20 percent, with 59.8 percent. The figure is considerably higher than the average smoking rate of 39.3 percent for males aged over 19, reported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2015. Women categorized as high earners in Jangseong County, South Jeolla Province, had the lowest smoking rate among women, with 0.2 percent, and Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province, had the highest rate at 13 percent. The largest differences in smoking rates among the income groups were observed in Uljin, North Gyeongsang Province, for males, with a 20.2 percentage point difference, and Dongducheon, Gyeonggi Province for females, with a 9.5 percentage point difference.In Seoul the inequality was most visible in districts such as Yongsan, Mapo, Gwangjin and Dongdaemun. According to the team that conducted the research, South Korea’s smoking trends are starting to catch-up with those of higher income nations, where people at the bottom of the income pyramid are more often associated with heavy smoking. “Despite the team’s achievements on recognizing the widening inequality gap through smoking rates, further research is necessary to measure the variation in the future trend,” said Kang.

The forecast is based on the 2015 census, added the statistics agency. Two-member family units closely came in second with a percentage of 35 percent in 2045, followed by three-person households with 19.8 percent and the conventional four-member homes making up just 7.4 percent of the total.The percentage of one-person families has been on a sharp rise for decades, piercing the 20 percent mark in 2005 for the first time. It was 4.8 percent in 1980.""Years ago, an extended family was divided into a nuclear family as rural people moved to urban areas. Now, an increasing number of young people are leaving their families amid a late-marriage trend,"" said Lee Ji-yeon from the statistics office.""From now on, the rise in the number of single-person families will be accelerated by rapid aging. Old couples will start living alone after losing their spouses.""Homes with a single member over 65 will reach 3.72 million units in 2045, up 3.1 times from just 1.2 million in 2015, reflecting the rapid aging of the population.According to a separate study, the number of South Koreans over 65 accounted for 13.2 percent of the country's population in 2016, and the ratio of people aged over 65 could reach 24.5 percent of the population by 2030 before hitting 41 percent by 2060.The statistics report also showed the total number of households in South Korea is expected to peak at 22.3 million in 2043 and start to decline in the following year.Meanwhile, the nation's overall population is expected to decrease from 2031, when the number is forecast to reach 52.96 million.""The pace of family divisions and downsizing will be faster than that of a decline in the total population until 2043,"" the official said.

The tentative number of foreign tourists to the country stood at 3.72 million in the January-March period, up 3.2 percent from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.  The tourism fest organized by the South Korean government in Hong Kong While the number of Chinese tourists slipped 9.1 percent on-year in the first three months of this year, the figure for March alone plummeted 39.4 percent in the same period, the ministry said. The sharp decline in Chinese visitors last month came as Beijing imposed a ban on selling trips to Korea from mid-March, in apparent economic retaliation against Seoul for installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on its soil.China sees it as a threat to its own defense. The Korean culture ministry said even though the country suffered a setback from China, robust demand from other countries, such as Southeast Asia and Japan, lent support to keeping the on-year gain in the first-quarter tally. As part of efforts to minimize the damage from China's boycott on tourism, the South Korean government has stepped out to diversify its tourist portfolio from focusing on China to other regions. The culture ministry plans to hold a culture and tourism fest in Vietnam later this week, inviting some 100,000 locals, to promote not only Korea as a place to visit, but also as the host of the PyeongChang Olympics. Given that Vietnam is one of the nations in Southeast Asia where the Korean Wave, or Hallyu, has gained popularity, a group of Korean celebrities and K-pop artists, including EXID, will make appearances at the event, the ministry added. Kicking off in Hanoi, the fest is scheduled to take place in Tokyo next month, followed by London, Almaty, New York and New Delhi over the coming months through November.","inbound tourists to korea ,tourists rise more than ,tourists to korea up ,stood at 72 million ,over faltering chinese inflow","['South Korea', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'US']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22372247  0.78824228

The latest tally marked the smallest number of quarterly defectors since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un assumed power in late 2011.Since the second half of 2015, North Korea has bolstered border control and set up high-tension wires around the Tumen River, which flows between the North and China to prevent more North Koreans from escaping the country, according to a report by the Korea Institute for National Unification .Some experts said that China may have beefed up surveillance along the border with North Korea in an expression of its anger against Seoul and Washington's ongoing deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system.China has sent scores of tanks into areas bordering North Korea in an apparent bid to strengthen border control, according to sources.The Seoul government remained cautious about the reading of the latest tally.""In the first two months of 2017, the number of North Koreans coming to the South fell on-year. But as those people rose in March from a year ago, it is hard to prejudge ,"" a ministry official said.The number of North Korean defectors surpassed the 30,000 mark in November last year.Last year, the pace of annual growth of the North defectors picked up for the first time since 2011.A rise in defections was largely attributable to Kim's move to strengthen his iron-fisted rule and the toughening of international sanctions, the government earlier said.","korea declined 18 percent ,of 278 north koreans ,defectors falls 18 on ,government data showed wednesday ,278 north koreans came","['North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Unification']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22047201  1.01514828

The Office of Legislation and the Small and Medium Business Administration plan to designate the third Friday and the last Wednesday of every month as short working days, though discussions are still underway on the actual quitting time.The latest measure came after it was announced in early March that government offices will be asked to ensure their employees get at least nine hours of rest after work under a new initiative to help improve the health of civil servants.

Kim Jin-tae, North Gyeongsang Province Gov. Kim Kwan-yong, former six-term lawmaker Rhee In-je and South Gyeongsang Province Gov. Hong Joon-pyo -- posing for a photo before a debate in Seoul. For the early election triggered by the recent ouster of Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal, the National Election Commission has put a ceiling on election funds for each candidate at 50.9 billion won .The massive funds can be raised through a number of methods under the strict supervision of the election watchdog.The most common way is to collect donations from individual supporters. Under the election funding law, corporate bodies, public servants, private-school teachers and foreigners are banned from extending any donations to a candidate.Each donor is allowed to contribute up to 20 million won during the entire election process that includes the intra-party nomination race. The total amount of individual donations must not exceed 5 billion won, or 10 percent of the funding cap, NEC officials said.Such donations are crucial for cash-strapped presidential aspirants whose financial challenge begins even before they are nominated as their parties' flag bearers.Political parties' preliminary candidates are required to pay between 200 million won and 400 million won just to join their intramural presidential nomination contest.    Another oft-used way to raise funds is borrowing money from citizens by creating a personal election fund.During the 2012 presidential election, Park Geun-hye, the then candidate of the Saenuri Party, a precursor to the Liberty Korea Party, created a fund worth 25 billion won. Her liberal rival Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party, currently the Democratic Party, collected 30 billion won through his own fund.Park and Moon paid back the money after the election watchdog reimbursed their campaign expenditures.To promote equal campaign opportunities, the NEC will make up all of the money spent during an election if a candidate wins 15 percent or more of the valid votes cast on the election day. Those who garner between 10 to 15 percent of the votes can get half of their expenses paid back, while those who fail to reach 10 percent recoup no money. The reimbursement is in line with Article 116 of the Constitution that stipulates that ""expenditures for elections shall not be imposed on political parties or candidates.""Candidates are required to apply to recoup their campaign spending within 20 days of the election. The NEC, then, will carry out its inspection and review of the costs and offer the money from the state coffers within 70 days of the vote, or by July 18.In the 2012 election, Park spent a total of 48.4 billion won, while Moon spent some 50 billion won.","korean president costs fortune ,running for korean president ,presidential campaign fundraising is ,presidential campaign fundraising ,of presidential campaign fundraising",[],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5616852   0.08443139

According to the findings, the percentage of women who first tried smoking in their 20s surged to 44.9 percent from 30.5 percent over the cited period. In contrast, the portion of women who started smoking in their 30s sank to 21.7 percent from 32.2 percent.The figures point to a sharp increase in the number of smokers among female university students, the team said, calling on the government to come up with anti-smoking measures tailored for 20-something women.According to latest government data, the smoking rate among South Koreans aged 19 or older dropped to 39.3 percent in 2015 from 43.1 percent in 2014. It marked the first time that South Korea's smoking rate fell below 40 percent. The drop was attributed largely to spikes in tobacco prices here, with the price for pack rising from 2,500 won  to 4,500 won in early 2015.","korean women start smoking ,996 female smokers aged ,35 996 female smokers ,female smokers aged 19 ,south korean women start",['south korean'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8544398   0.38112214

OECD data showed a South Korean on average worked 2,124 hours in 2014, 1.2 times more than the average.Less than half  of South Korean women were employed as of 2015 compared to the OECD average of 57.9 percent.South Korea's fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime, is also the lowest among OECD member states together with Portugal at 1.24 in 2015.The latest poll showed that only 56.6 percent of working moms continued working one year after they concluded childcare leave as of 2014. People can take up to a year off to look after their children, which women often take immediately following the completion of three-month maternity leave.The comparable figures were 47.4 percent in 2010, 48.5 percent in 2011, 51.3 percent in 2012 and 54.1 percent in 2013.The figures were over 60 percent for five consecutive years from 2002.The findings showed that working moms who only took the three months of maternity leave stayed longer at their workplaces.

The number of Japanese tourists who traveled to South Korea came to 156,000 over the same period, about one-fourth of the Korean tourists who went to Japan.The rise in the figure for Korean tourists flooding into Japan is largely attributable to the depreciation of the Japanese currency in recent weeks, as a cheaper yen can lure more inflows of tourists. The yen dropped to a yearly low against the won Wednesday, with the arbitrated won-yen exchange rate hovering around 900 won per 100 yen. Industry watchers, however, were doubtful that such an increase will continue. ""More demand makes the airfare more expensive. So it's hard to say that the tourist numbers will keep rising,"" a spokesperson at a local travel agency said.

Such a measure comes amid a steady rise in the average age of taxi drivers, along with the average age of the entire population.South Korea is considered one of the fastest aging societies in the world with the ratio of people aged 65 years or older expected to reach 20 percent of its entire population in 2025. A country is considered an aged society when more than 14 percent of its population is aged 65 or older. South Korea is expected to hit the ratio next year.According to the ministry, the ratio of taxi drivers aged 65 years or older came to 19.5 percent of the total as of end-2015, up 8.6 percentage points from just four years earlier. The ratio is expected to reach 50 percent in 2020.The apparent rise in the average age of taxi drivers has been blamed as a source of more frequent accidents.In 2016, the number of traffic accidents involving a taxi driver aged over 65 came to 4,138, up 72.12 percent from 1,734 in 2012, the ministry said.""The country currently has a license renewal system for aged bus drivers, but the system does not apply to taxi drivers. By introducing a license renewal system, the government seeks to improve the safety of public transportation, which in turn will create a safe environment for more people to use taxi services with ease,"" it said in a press release.","tests all taxi drivers ,renewal tests all taxi ,all taxi drivers aged ,require aged taxi drivers ,medical checkup every three",['South Korea'],29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58274519 -0.26770255

The percentage of people who said the eldest son should be chiefly responsible moved from 28.8 percent to 22.5 percent over the same period. Historically, the eldest son took over family leadership and inherited the wealth when the father died and was responsible for taking care of his aged parents, often living together with them. The poll, conducted on 1,052 adults across the country in 2016, pointed to a broader change taking place in the patriarchal family values, not just in expected roles for filial duties. When asked who among their family members they contact most frequently, about 36 percent of the elderly parents said that they meet, call, message or video chat with the eldest daughter the most, followed by the eldest son , second or other sons , second or other daughters  and the first daughter-in-law .In 2006, the eldest son was the most frequently contacted person to the elderly parents, followed by the eldest daughter, the second or other sons and the second or other daughters. The same study also found that more South Koreans, noticeably young people and women, are putting less emphasis on family and marriage, compared to a decade ago. Some 46.4 percent of the surveyed agreed that married women are happier than single women in 2016, compared to 57.1 percent in 2006Moreover, 78.1 percent of the respondents said the authority of a father should be honored in any occasion, 6.2 percentage points lower than 10 years earlier. The survey also showed that 69.7 percent of respondents said family should come before themselves in 2016, compared to 79.9 percent in 2006.Nearly half of the respondents, mostly those in their 20s and 30s, said in 2016 they have no objection to living with a partner while not married. The survey showed that 54.5 percent said they would live with someone of the opposite sex out of wedlock.The survey also showed that most respondents believe 30 is the most suitable age for both men and women to tie the knot.

Some 730,000 high-income earners or high-asset holders will have to endure higher premiums. Ordinary salaried workers with no major assets will see no change. “Some 6 million insurance holding households will see monthly insurance premium down by an average of 46,000 won ,” explained the ministry official Lee Chang-joon.Health and Welfare Minister Chung Chin-youb speaks at a briefing on Jan. 5 regarding the ministry`s new plans for the health insurance system The envisioned new scheme seeks to plug loopholes in the current three-basis subscription system, which categorizes subscribers into the employed, the self-employed and the dependent. Criticism has mounted on the flaws of the segment of the self-employed. While some high-income earners exploit the system by underreporting their income levels, those in the bottom-low income bracket fell out of the basic insurance coverage failing to meet the set monthly contributions. To fix this problem, the ministry will abolish the current income evaluation system for the self-employed, which is based on one’s gender, age, income, asset and ownership of a vehicle, and introduce a minimum monthly premium of 10,310 won, which is equal to one that is applied to salaried workers. The new plan will seek to gauge a subscriber’s comprehensive financial status by taking into account their holdings of financial and non-financial assets on top of their reported salaries.  Moreover, a total of 470,000 households currently registered as dependents will be subject to the same premium calculation scale used for the self-employed. So far, these households received medical insurance services without paying monthly premiums, as dependents of family members who are either self-employed or salaried subscribers. The plan, to be implemented gradually in three stages through 2024, requires amendment of the related law. The ministry said it will submit the revision bill to the National Assembly in May, aiming for its passage in the latter half of next year.  The ministry said it plans to inject 20 trillion won into the health care services and work closely with related authorities to seek fiscal health.By Kim Da-sol","monthly insurance premium reduce ,monday plan to overhaul ,their monthly insurance premium ,korea to revise health ,their monthly insurance","['South Korea ’s', 'Ministry of Health and Welfare']",29,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43705055  0.10953489

The prescription in South Korea was 7.6 times higher than in Norway. The research was conducted jointly by a team led by professor Park Byung-joo of preventive medicine at the Seoul National University College of Medicine and the faculty of Boston Children's Hospital. The researchers took data from 7,400 children who were given antimicrobial drugs at least once in the six nations from 2008-2012.The next highest prescription rate was in Spain , Italy , the US , Germany  and Norway .Another notable finding was that the prescription of the most basic antibiotic, penicillin, was the lowest in South Korea at 9.8 percent. By comparison, penicillin prescriptions accounted for as high as 64.8 percent in Norway. This finding signifies that resistance to penicillin has already grown widely in South Korea and patients now require more potent antibiotics.""The misuse of antibiotics is said to be decreasing in South Korea, but the latest research results show that it is still serious in the country compared with advanced Western nations,"" Park said.

Some 4,800 new family names were created within the past 15 years. There were a total of 5,582 different family names as of 2015, and about 73 percent of them do not have matching Chinese characters, departing from a long tradition here. Those names were registered by foreigners who obtained citizenship here. It is a sign that the Korean society is increasingly diversifying with the growth of its multicultural population, Statistics Korea and experts said. “Traditionally, one’s family name was a critical factor in recognizing the makeup of one’s ancestry and clan,” said historian Park Hong-gab, adding that the recent trend depicts the changing face of the local population.  “With the rise of international marriages and many foreign residents becoming naturalized Koreans here, our society is witnessing the emergence of new foreign-origin family names,” he explained. Still, the census showed 1 in 5 Koreans are surnamed Kim, nearly 1 in 7 have the surname Lee and 1 in 12 have Park as a family name. Together, the three surnames account for 44.6 percent of the country’s 50 million population.   Also among the top 10 most common surnames in Korea were Choi, Jung, Kang, Cho, Yoon, Chang and Lim. Together, they account for about 64 percent of the total. Unlike traditional Korean family names, which typically consist of only one syllable that can be written in Chinese to identify the clan’s city of origin, most newly created surnames do not follow such rules.While some naturalized Koreans choose to follow their spouse’s Korean surname, others sometimes create new family names by picking one syllable from their original surname, for example “Le” from “Lei,” according to an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Government who said she had worked with naturalized Koreans in Seoul. According to separate data from the Supreme Court, since 2011, an average of 6,000-7,000 foreigners who were naturalized as Korean citizens registered Korean names with the court. Officials said not all who obtain Korean citizenship choose to register Korean names, but many still do so to mingle better with locals. “Foreigners tend to get Korean names by writing down their original names as the way it sounds so it can be easily pronounced, as part of their efforts to make themselves a member of Korean society,” said Park Jung-mi from the Cheongju Multicultural Family Support Center. “Some even simply translate their original name into Korean,” she added, giving an example of a woman from the Philippines who named herself Jang-mi, a direct translation of her Filipino name Rose. She put her surname as Nam, meaning that she had come from the West to Korea.By Kim Da-sol","800 new family names ,diversifying trend in korean ,census conducted every 15 ,korean names some 800 ,some 800 new family","['South Korea', 'Namsan', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Park', 'korean']",29,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.43254724  0.43525013
