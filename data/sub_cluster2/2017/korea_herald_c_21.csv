The list also included 20 children who are under the age of 14. Until 2013, the number of North Koreans seeking asylum in Europe had been on the rise, peaking in 2013 with 400 North Koreans requesting asylum in Europe. The figure dropped to 140 in 2014. In 2015, there were 130 North Koreans who applied to move to a European country. By country, 30 defectors sought refuge in Germany while France and Britain received 20 requests each. Sweden, Luxembourg and Bulgaria also separately received five such requests. Experts view the decreasing trend being partly due to the lower number of those defecting from the North. The stricter measures in granting asylum proposed by European countries, following the surge in refugees from the Middle East and Africa, is also thought to have contributed to the fall.

The committee in charge of managing the foreign labor force also unveiled plans to improve the working and living conditions of migrant workers in the farming sector and to curb foreign workers who stay illegally in the country. Headed by Hong Nam-gi, minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, the committee -- consisting of 12 relevant ministries including the Justice Ministry and Labor Ministry -- finalized its plan for foreign workers for next year. It annually reviews labor shortages in each industry and sets the quota for foreign workers based on employers’ needs.  Migrant workers pick tomatoes at a farm. According to the plan, South Korea will receive about 42,300 foreign workers in the manufacturing sector, 6,600 in the farming sector, 2,600 in the fishing sector, 2,400 in the construction sector and 100 in the service sector on E-9 visas. Migrant workers in the manufacturing industry will be dispatched to Korean workplaces in January, April, July and October, with 60 percent of them starting in the first half of 2018. The farming sector will receive foreign workers in January, April and October. The plan also set the number of ethnic Koreans from Russia and China on H-2 visas at 303,000 next year. Men on H-2 visas are usually employed in the construction industry and women are usually employed in the service and hospitality sectors as they speak fluent Korean. “We decided on the next year’s quota to resolve the labor shortage facing SMEs, but also to protect local workers’ jobs ” Minister Hong said. According to government data, the number of foreign workers on the Employment Permit System -- which invites workers from 16 countries in South and Central Asia to fill labor shortages in the fields of manufacturing, fishing and agriculture -- is about 275,000 this year. Under the EPS, a state-run agency in each country selects migrant workers based on their language proficiency and sends them to Korea to fill jobs in such sectors as manufacturing, fishing and agriculture, which are shunned by Koreans due to the low pay and poor working conditions. The EPS visa allows them to work here for up to four years and 10 months.Demand for low-skilled foreign workers continues to increase among employers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, as they seek cheaper labor. They called on the government to allow more foreign workers, but the government remains cautious due to a public backlash over foreigners taking locals’ jobs. The committee also laid out a plan to prevent migrant workers from overstaying their visas and illegally working in the country. It said it will expand the pool of inspectors to crack down on workers who stay illegally from the current 340 to 400, and extend the crackdown period to 22 weeks. Employers found hiring unregistered workers will be penalized when applying for state loans. As for living conditions of workers in the farming sector, the committee said that it will stop providing foreign workers to employers that offer vinyl houses or makeshift houses as accommodation.Many migrant workers in the farming sector live in lodging facilities provided by their employers as they often work far from town, with some news reports suggesting that many of them are forced to live in makeshift houses, containers and vinyl green houses. The government will also allow workers who live in poor conditions and have their wages excessively deducted for the lodging to change workplaces unless their living conditions are improved. Those under the EPS are not allowed to change workplaces except for certain cases such as when they are assaulted or have wages unpaid. They also need consent from their employers to change workplaces. Activists have long called for the abolishment of the EPS, calling it modern-day slavery. They have suggested that the government issue a Labor Permit System that would allow foreign workers to freely change their workplaces without having to get approval from their employers.

The reclusive regime may be eying the virtual currency as its transactions are difficult to trace, allowing Pyongyang to bypass international sanctions, experts here said.  “It is difficult to trace a bitcoin exchange if North Korea wants its financial transactions to remain in the dark,” Lee Kyung-ho, a professor at Korea University’s Graduate School of Information Security, told The Korea Herald. Pyongyang is suspected to have been involved in a recent series of hacking attempts targeting local cryptocurrency exchanges. In July, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange platform, Bithumb, was hacked, which resulted in monetary losses worth some 7.6 billion won . A recent report by Chosun Ilbo said the National Intelligence Service found evidence that North Korea was involved in the leaking of personal information from some 30,000 accounts from Bithumb. The evidence was passed on to prosecutors here for further investigation. Months prior to the Bithumb hacking, other Seoul-based bitcoin exchanges, such as Yapizon and Coinis, were also targeted in similar cyber thefts. Emails encrypted with malicious codes were sent to people in the bitcoin industry here to breach security systems, Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency’s cybersecurity division said in July. On Tuesday Yapizon, now called YouBit, was shut down from the damage it received from another cyberheist. The platform reportedly lost an additional 17 percent of its cryptocurrencies from the hacking attack, which happened earlier in the day. Whether North Korean hackers were involved in the latest attack is unknown. Professor Lee added bitcoin’s soaring value coupled with how it can smoothly “move across” borders is the reason why the North is eyeing the market, amid international sanctions curbing the flow of foreign currency into the country. According to Lee, it was widely predicted under the current circumstances that bitcoin-related hackings would eventually emerge as a popular method for the North to secure foreign currency.“There are routes where a bitcoin can be exchanged for another form of cryptocurrency, which can make it hard for authorities to trace where each bitcoin came from and eventually ends up,” he said. “Bitcoin is also relatively free from international sanctions including United Nations Security Council Resolutions because it is not an asset that governments can control or freeze. If a government imposes regulation on a certain cryptocurrency exchange, then its users can just move to another platform,” explained Lee. One problem that the international community faces is that cyberattacks by North Korean hackers are growing more aggressive and bolder with time. The Donald Trump administration on Monday publically accused North Korea as being responsible for spreading WannaCry malware in May. In the WannaCry attack, more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries were locked down and those behind the attack demanded payment in bitcoin to free their systems. Several fell victim to the ploy, including British hospitals and global companies, such as FedEx and Nissan. South Korea has been keeping tabs on its wayward neighbor’s online activities, aware of its growing reputation as a major hub for virtual currencies backed by its internet speed and wide broadband access -- which could increase the risk of falling under North Korea’s cyberattacks at the same time. North Korea has been linked to “various activities” to dodge sanctions and earn foreign currency, the South Korean government said Tuesday, while acknowledging the rogue nation’s latest bitcoin-related hacking attempts. “The government is monitoring  trends related to bitcoin,” Baik Tae-hyun, spokesman for the Unification Ministry, said at a regular press briefing. Baik’s remarks referred to a number of news reports shedding light on North Korea’s alleged trading of cryptocurrency for goods along with recent bitcoin market hackings. “We are aware that North Korea has been engaged in various activities to evade sanctions and earn foreign currency,” he added. According to California-based cybersecurity firm FireEye, the North is targeting the virtual currency market to avoid sanctions and fund Kim Jong-un’s regime, it said in a report released in September. It could be attempting to rake hard cash in exchange for stolen virtual coins, it added. Baik also said the South Korean government is seeking measures to curb North Korea’s apparent illicit acts associated with digital currency, in cooperation with relevant authorities, including the state cybersecurity center. “We are continuing efforts to block North Korea’s hacking attempts,” he said. But the official did not confirm on whether the government has detected any solid evidence backing the North’s actual involvement in the crimes. He also remained tight-lipped on whether the government holds data on the estimated amount of bitcoins the North possesses.The news of North Korea’s latest bitcoin-related crimes come as the isolated nation is reportedly struggling under a series of United Nations Security Council sanctions drawn to cripple its economic growth. It is widely known that Pyongyang has been funding its nuclear weapons program with foreign currencies it obtained through international trade and business.

This means that in 2075, 1.25 working-age people would be financially responsible for one senior citizen. With prolonged increases in life expectancy, OECD countries have seen an increasing number of older people over the past decades, but the pattern is most evident in South Korea, the report added, where the fertility rate remains the lowest in the world.

Critics said the original rules negatively impacted some industries, as the caps were set too low without considering market prices. According to the commission’s report, some 81 percent of public officials said they received fewer requests for recruitment favors. Another 72.8 percent said paying one’s own bill for a meal had become much easier. About 83 percent of some 37,000 parents said perceived bribery in schools had been curbed significantly since the introduction of the anti-graft law last year. Entrepreneurs and the business industry also saw the changes as favorable. According to the report, 74 percent of 300 entrepreneurs here said the new law had made for a better environment to run the business, especially in regards to reduced reception expenses.“A significant fall in the reception expenses can, in the long run, change the entire business tradition here and help companies focus more on productive networking,” said the report. The report said reception costs of some 600 listed companies had reduced by 0.3 to 0.6 percentage point over a year. When it comes to the agriculture and food industries, however, the agency said they have seen decreases in sales after the law’s effectuation, leading to a fall of 900 billion won in the gross national production and an employment cut of some 4,267 people. Korea Rural Economic Institute data showed that seven major department stores saw a 14.4 percent on-year drop in sales of gift sets for the Lunar New Year holiday early this year. Sales of gift sets comprising agricultural products such as Korean beef, fishery goods and fruits declined by 25 percent.“These changes show how budget spending has become more widespread, as well as social custom of gift-giving tradition is moving toward rational spending,” said the report. The report also said the when a country’s Corruption Perception Index increases by 10 points, there will be an 8 trillion won increase in its gross domestic product and see 27,000 to 50,000 jobs created, citing the Seoul National University data in November. According to Transparency International, South Korea ranked No. 52 with 53 points in 2017. The average on the CPI for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was 68.6 points.

Their technological and policy-related expertise would be instrumental in helping Korea embark on a new development trajectory free from coal, oil and nuclear power, they said at the maiden forum in Seoul. Nordic diplomats, researchers, academics, company executives, government officials and nongovernmental organization leaders participated in the event and shared ideas on sustainable energy solutions, policy innovations and civic engagement. The Nordic Energy Research Conference on Dec. 7 in Seoul gathered Nordic diplomats, researchers, academics, company executives, government officials and nongovernmental organization leaders, who shared ideas on sustainable energy solutions, policy innovations and civic engagement. “The Nordic countries are far advanced in their solutions to achieving both their national energy targets -- covering energy security and economic competitiveness -- and global climate obligations,” said Hans Jorgen Koch, chief executive officer of Nordic Energy Research. He added the countries are some 25 years ahead of other nations on average in the electricity sector, proving potentially useful for cooperating with South Korea. According to the Nordic Energy Research, Denmark derived 66 percent of national energy from renewables in 2015, while Norway derived 98 percent, Finland derived 45 percent and Sweden derived 63 percent.Reducing emissions related to buildings -- by expanding district heating networks and phasing out oil-fired boilers -- is a key component of the energy transition, it said. Stable and ambitious carbon taxation, alongside incentives for renewables, have stimulated the growth of bio and wind energies. The Nordic electricity grid facilitates decarbonization by harmonizing the supply and use of electricity between the countries, such as wind power in Denmark and hydropower in Norway and Sweden. “Denmark’s transition to a fossil-free nation by 2050 is an ambitious goal and in line with our track record on green growth,” said Danish Ambassador to Korea Thomas Lehmann. “It is important to work together internationally to create common solutions to common problems.” Denmark aims to eliminate coal completely by 2030, supply electricity and heating by renewables by 2035, and completely wean its economy from fossil fuel by 2050, he said. “Finland’s prosperity is based on our expertise in using renewable resources,” said Finnish Ambassador to Korea Eero Suominen, adding that over 70 percent of its territory is forest and the country has 188,000 lakes. “The new bio-economy will present opportunities in the smart exploitation of biomass and water resources, using related technologies and value-added products and services.”Norway will become a low carbon society by 2050 by working with domestic and international partners, according to Norwegian Ambassador to Korea Jan Grevstad. Becoming a zero or low carbon economy is a goal shared across Nordic countries, which are at the forefront of worldwide efforts to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the target of the Paris climate agreement. “Leading the transition toward a fossil-fuel society is not only morally right, but also economically smart,” said Swedish Ambassador Anne Hoglund. “Already, electricity production in Sweden is almost fossil-free and policy instruments such as the carbon tax have contributed to replacing coal and oil with bioenergy and wind.”Choe Nam-ho, director general of energy policy at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, underlined that President Moon Jae-in has pledged to increase the share of renewables to 20 percent by 2030, with solar and wind taking up 80 percent of total renewables. “People-led demands for a cleaner environment free of fine dusts are increasing here in Korea,” he said. “As the world accelerates its transition to green growth, we believe now is the time to orient our energy policies toward responsible, intergenerational development, prioritizing people’s safety and health.”Members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- of which Korea is a participant -- are spurring efforts to increase the share of renewables and natural gas, with renewables taking up over 86 percent of new investments in 2015, Choe pointed out. Korea has the lowest share of renewables in the OECD at around 5 percent of the national energy mix, according to the Korea Electric Power Corporation, as well as the highest territorial density of nuclear power plants. The country also continues to rely on coal through the continuing operation of coal power plants. “We will create value-added jobs in the energy sector by actively embracing the ‘fourth industrial revolution,’” the bureaucrat highlighted. “We will begin by reducing the share of nuclear power and coal in our energy mix and replace them with renewables and natural gas.”Korea is in the process of transforming and optimizing its system of energy supply and demand by incorporating the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and Big Data, among other things, he mentioned. As Korea’s energy system becomes decentralized and diversified through renewables and other sources, away from the monopolized nuclear power and oil, the participation of local actors -- governments, residents, NGOs and citizens -- will increase, said Professor Yun Soon-jin of Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Environmental Studies. “Stronger policies that encourage citizens’ involvement in the decision-making process is required for the energy transition,” she stressed.

According to the FAO report, North Korea secured 685,000 metric tons of cereal imports between November last year and end of October this year, which consisted of 572,900 tons in commercial purchases and 112,100 tons in food aid.

A total of 26 billion won will be spent to enhance the unit’s warfighting capability, the official said. South Korean military launched a brigade-level “decapitation unit” on Dec. 1. The unit is reported to include about 1,000 special warfare forces tasked with neutralizing North Korea’s wartime command-and-control system by eliminating Kim and other top officials. #Although the unit’s specific task organization remains classified, it is thought to be in line with US special warfare units, such as SEAL Team Six, also known as DEVGRU, which engaged in a mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.Despite the official launch and budget approval, the unit will take some time to become fully operational as it lacks crucial assets – such as advance low-flying aircraft capable of carrying special warfare units deep into North Korea’s territory, experts said. The military is working on upgrading transport helicopter Ch-47 Chinooks and render them fit for the infiltration mission to the North. The defense ministry is seeking to complete the project next year, according to the ministry’s defense plan released in April.  “Unlike the US, South Korea doesn’t have advanced low-flying transport aircraft for infiltration…… Even if our special forces made it to Pyongyang, chances are high that they will be decimated by North Korea’s heavy fires and artillery,” said Lee Il-Woo, military analyst at Seoul-based Korea Defence Network.

The focus of the efforts is to upgrade the arms system and reduce the number of troops.The government plans to complete the establishment of the so-called three-axis defense platform by the early 2020s. This refers to the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike system, the Korean Air and Missile Defense, and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation scheme.A total of 4.3 trillion won has been earmarked for the project in 2018, up 551 billion won from this year.Separately, lawmakers agreed to lift the budget for military-related R&D; programs and defense industry 4.2 percent to 2.9 trillion won.This paves the way for South Korea to develop or purchase more advanced weapons.South Korea is seeking to introduce military satellites and tactical surface-to-surface guided missiles, known as KTSSMs, and to upgrade the Patriot missile defense system.""We plan to continue R&D; on KTSSM until next year, including that on military GPS, with mass production expected to be possible starting in 2019,"" an official at the Defense Acquisition Program Administration told reporters.

And yet, nearly half the elderly in the region still do not benefit from a pension, a proportion that is only higher in Africa,” said ILO’s social protection expert Nuno Cunha. On average, Asian countries like Thailand spend slightly over 1 percent of its gross domestic product on pensions even though 6 percent of their population are people aged 65 or over. In contrast, Latin America, where 7.7 percent of the population are aged 65 or more, spend nearly 7 percent of their GDP on pensions.In September, the Korean Ministry of Interior and Safety announced that the country had officially entered into an aged society as those aged 65 or older made up 14 percent of the population. In 2050, those aged 65 or more will account for 37.4 percent of the population with a life expectancy of 89.3 years old, according to a United Nations report.Currently, half of Korea‘s population aged 65 and over lives in relative poverty, nearly four times higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 13 percent. There are three different types of pension incomes that those aged 65 or older can receive: social welfare, public pension, and private pension.“Korea is a late starter in terms of pension systems and the number of people benefiting from an adequate contributory pension is still low,” Cunha told The Korea Herald during an ILO meeting held in Bangkok in November. “Korea should consider adjusting the current contribution rate of 9 percent to find adequacy of pension benefits,” he said, adding that Portugal, where he is from, collects almost 27 percent of the contribution rate for the pension program. South Korea adopted the state pension program in 1988 to guarantee income for the elderly after retirement, and to provide coverage for disabilities and surviving family members. As of June, it had 21.67 million subscribers with 4.28 million people being eligible for payments.ILO has been publishing reports to highlight that universal social protection contributes to eradicating poverty, reducing inequality, promoting economic growth and social justice, as well as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.By Kim Da-sol","billion receive ineffective social ,over billion receive ineffective ,health poverty inequality ,ilo only 45 percent ,ill health poverty inequality","['the International Labor Organization', 'World Social Protection Report']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57455283  0.116023

That’s why a stronger initiative, such as introducing plain packaging should be considered now,” Kerstin Schotte, a medical officer at WHO’s Department of Prevention of Non-communicable Disease told the Korea Herald. Kerstin Schotte, a medical officer at WHO’s Department of Prevention of Non-communicable Diseases speaks at a global forum on tobacco control held in Conrad Seoul on Friday. Korea Health Promotion Institute Schotte was in Seoul for a global forum on tobacco control hosted by the Korea Health Promotion Institute and held in Conrad Seoul on Friday. Tobacco has killed half of its consumers. Cigarettes are maybe the only legal product that kills its users, Schotte said. Global data compiled by WHO showed that the tobacco prevalence has decreased over the past seven years in all income levels, but the number of tobacco users has been steadily increasing.“But we are not against smokers. We do not see smokers as bad people. Most smokers want to be able to quit. But nicotine is too addictive. So smokers do not manage to quit,” she said.Adding that WHO’s enemy is the tobacco industry, she stressed that the industry would not make plain packaging on their own unless such a system is mandated by law like in Australia. Plain packaging refers to packaging that requires the removal of all branding, including colors, imagery, corporate logos and trademarks. Companies are only permitted to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font and place on the pack, normally next to the health warnings. The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardized, including the color of the pack.The removal of branding on cigarette packaging aims to deter smoking by the removal of positive associations of brands with the consumption of tobacco. “The tobacco industry has been using packaging as a marketing tool, and with new laws, the industry will find a gap in policies,” she said. In that sense, WHO encourages the Korean parliament to take lead in introducing plain packaging in all tobacco products, health warnings on heat-not-burn products as well as e-cigarettes, popular alternatives for young smokers here. “Measures that the Korean government has been publishing over the past decade are not weak. But it could become stronger, as there is so much that the government can do, such as put stronger health warnings on the cigarette packs, ad regulations, and tax hike measures,” she said.According to the government, the current graphic warnings on the cigarette packs can be changed in December 2018. Schotte also stressed the significance of the government’s role in establishing smoke-free laws in public to prevent exposing people to second-hand smoke. “In Korea, almost 3,700 people died in 2016 due to second-hand smoking, while the majority of them were women. “It is not WHO’s goal to punish smokers or make their lives difficult. We are to protect second-hand smoke exposure to non-smoking groups. It is just dangerous to health.” At the moment, no-smoking areas are quickly multiplying in Korea. There are 17,500 public areas where smoking is prohibited, which include some 3,400 areas close to education facilities such as kindergartens and day care centers. However, the city has been slow to introduce “safe” places to smoke. There are only 43 outdoor smoking booths installed in public places across the capital as of now, which reignited smokers’ criticisms. Schotte said WHO’s end goal is to make tobacco less affordable in Korea.“Past experiences showed that a ban does not work. Instead, the government needs to continue to do what it’s doing. A lot of progress has already been made. We encourage the government to go further, and the WHO will support with technical assistance and resources,” she said. By Kim Da-sol","lower smoking rate korea ,levying higher tobacco taxes ,tobacco taxes are laudable ,packaging to lower smoking ,higher tobacco taxes","['Korea', 'World Health Organization', 'loophole']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60627627  0.03359844

The Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs revealed the environmental reports on the US Yongsan base conducted twice earlier in the year, a move that followed an appellate court ruling made early this month in favor of civic groups that sought the public disclosure of the reports.The reports are based on the water sample analysis collected from dozens of tubular wells in and outside the US base. One survey was done in January-February, and another in August, which tested for five toxic substances, including benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene. The result showed that 11 wells inside the base were polluted with the mentioned petroleum constituents with levels far above the permissible thresholds.  Protesters hold up placards demanding the Seoul government and the U.S. forces allow a pollution survey inside the U.S. base in Yongsan, while officials from the Seoul Metropolitan Government next to them are carrying out a survey of their own just outside the base, on Aug. 9, 2017. At least a dozen inside the base were highly contaminated with benzene, a cancerous substance, one of which recorded a level 672 times the limit in the August survey. The wells also showed high levels of toluene and ethylbenzene pollution, according to the report. The joint Korea-US committee said they will continue to have a constructive discussion over the matter. South Korea and US forces have conducted three joint environmental surveys near the Yonsan base. But they had refused to reveal the findings citing the Status of Forces Agreement by which they say they are bound to keep any documents of such kind confidential. Civic groups filed a series of suits demanding the reports be released, scoring a win from the top court for the first survey and the latest victory from the appeals court for the other two. The government revealed the first one in April. Concerns have grown over the possible chemical contamination of soil and water worsening in and near the US military base. The Seoul city government has spent 7 billion won  on its own environmental survey near the surrounding areas, which found high levels of harmful chemicals in the soil and water. Based on SOFA, South Korea is forbidden from accessing the inside of the US base for an environmental test, while calls are rising that such clauses need to be revised.","seoul has groundwater contaminated ,government reports showed wednesday ,contaminated with harmful petroleum ,central seoul has groundwater ,shows high water pollution","['US', 'Seoul', 'the Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs', 'US', 'Yongsan']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5282346   0.53028858

The World Bank’s annual report, Doing Business 2018, placed Georgia at the ninth spot out of 190 countries surveyed, a drastic improvement from the 100th spot over the last decade. The report also placed Georgia second in the world in terms of protection of minority investors.  A map of the Lapis Lazuli Economic Corridor linking Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey The ambassador said his country provides political stability, a sound banking system and business credibility to outside investors. “Our government is doing its utmost to develop our country. We are one of few substantive democracies in our region with democratically enforced municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections.” Georgia has free trade agreements with the Commonwealth of Independent States of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, as well as neighboring Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia. The country also has in force the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. Additionally, it closely trades and cooperates with the European Free Trade Association economies of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On the question of EU membership, the diplomat said his country has continuously overhauled the government and economy to reach standards required by the EU. The Visegrad Group -- also known as the V4, a cultural and political alliance of four Central European states the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia -- as well as the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been highly supportive of Georgia’s potential membership, stressed the envoy.“Georgia has fantastic relations with Eastern European countries also,” he said. “Our EU aspirations stem not only from the government but most fundamentally from our people. After we achieved independence from the Soviet Union, our people already declared that our future path lies in Europe.”By Joel Lee  A map of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway that opened on Oct. 30","multimodal routes georgian ambassador ,asia georgia geostrategic value ,georgia set to expedite ,expedite europe asia trade ,economic path since independence","['Georgian', 'Otar Berdzenishvili', 'Joel Lee', 'Korea', 'the Soviet Union', 'Georgia', 'Georgia']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.0934515   0.41967919

The South African economy is being transformed to produce value-added goods and services, presenting opportune conditions for Korean companies, Ambassador Nozuko Gloria Bam stressed at an investment seminar at the Federation of Korean Industries on Thursday.“The transformation of our economy through the promotion and development of small and medium-sized enterprises remains one of our government priorities,” she said. “To this end, South Africa’s emerging entrepreneurs in information communications technology, optical and pharmaceutical sectors continuously visit Korea to look for joint venture opportunities. I invite you to contact our embassy for more information.”The two countries established diplomatic relations on Dec. 1, 1992, following the end of the apartheid era. They mark their silver jubilee this year.South African Ambassador to Korea Nozuko Gloria Bam South Africa is the largest economy in the African continent -- accounting for roughly one-quarter of the continental gross domestic product -- with an estimated $280 billion in national GDP and $5,100 per capita GDP this year. Over 10 percent of South Africa’s people, around 5.5 million, reside in urban areas and spend around $10,000 annually, according to the Korea-Africa Center.The country also has vast amounts of untapped mineral and natural resources, particularly gold and coal. It has improved its physical infrastructure and promoted balanced regional industrial development and inclusive growth, aiming to create 5 million jobs by 2020. Priority sectors for foreign direct investment are advanced manufacturing, information and communication technology and electronics, nanotechnology, mining and beneficiation, biofuels, agribusiness, business processing and outsourcing, chemicals and biochemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, aerospace, precision engineering, tourism, oil and gas, renewable energy, boat building, infrastructure development and waste management, according to Invest South Africa. “Our country remains an attractive investment destination for multinational firms in terms of returns on investments. The African continent is also the next frontier economy across many sectors,” Bam added. Korea exported some $354 million of capital goods to South Africa last year, covering transportation, mechanical and electronics, metals, plastic and rubber and chemical sectors, among others. Korea imported $1.33 billion of goods, materials, energy and minerals from South Africa during the same period, with raw materials taking up nearly half. Korean companies invested $6.3 million in South Africa last year, including three new businesses, a drop from the record of $45 million, or 20 percent of total investment in Africa, in 2013. Top Korean enterprises in South Africa include Samsung, Hyundai, Posco, Hankook Tire, Kolon Global and Kepco. South Africa Investment Environment and Opportunities Seminar at the Federation of Korean Industries on Nov. 23 Tourism is a booming sector for bilateral cooperation and one of six selected drivers of the South African economy, alongside manufacturing, mining, finance, communications and retail. The country received nearly 19,000 Korean tourists last year, a 40 percent on-year increase. South Africa’s arms industry is among global leaders in the production of mine-resistant vehicles, missile-guided weapons, communications equipment, aerospace components and attack helicopters. The country produced up to six nuclear bombs in the 1970s and 1980s. “In case there is a legal dispute in a project or investment, South Africa offers legal protection to outside investors in accordance with the New York Convention where Korea is also a member,” said lawyer Timothy Dickens of the DR & AJU Law Group, a Korea-based international law firm. “Foreign investment is actively encouraged in all sectors with few restrictions in general.”Dickens mentioned the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act -- a law designed to capacitate racially disfavored groups under apartheid such as blacks, Asians and Indians -- issued by the South African Department of Trade and Industry. The law, which encompasses ownership transfer, business practice, equitable employment and occupational training, has recently been broadened from mining and other public sectors to construction, finance and information technology. Noting the law targets all government bodies as well as public and private organizations dealing with the state, the lawyer said outside investors should review their potential acquisition target’s black economic empowerment ratings to assess future financing, restructuring and procurement. South Africa has seven of the top 10 universities in Africa, including the University of Cape Town, University of the Witwatersrand and Stellenbosch University. The country has birthed 10 Nobel laureates, most famously the late former President Nelson Mandela, Anglican clergyman and anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu, former President Frederik Willem de Klerk, chemist Aaron Klug, the late anti-apartheid writer Nadine Gordimer, novelist John Maxwell Coetzee and biologist Sydney Brenner.

On Oct. 29, the number of signatories surpassed the threshold which requires the presidential office to answer. "" will conduct a survey about termination of pregnancy next year to figure out the current status and causes.The relevant debate will progress based on the result,"" Cho said in a press release and posting on Facebook. The survey, which had been conducted every five years, was discontinued in 2010 when the government enhanced its crackdown on artificial abortion as part of efforts to boost the birthrate.He also noted the Constitutional Court is deliberating once again on whether the current law criminalizing abortion complies with the Constitution. ""We expect the process will prompt a new public debate,"" he said. The court ruled in 2012 in favor of the law.Cho, a former law professor and civil activist, emphasized the need to strike the balance between the right to life and women's self-determination. He pointed out the current ban has led to various side effects such as illegal, dangerous and highly expensive surgical operations. ""The current law holds only women legally accountable while leaving the state and men free from responsibility,"" he said. ""In addition to a women's right to self-determination, the possibility of their rights to life and health being violated in such illegal procedures to end pregnancy should also be discussed.""","resume survey on abortion ,artificial abortion the presidential ,survey on abortion next ,korea government on sunday ,on abortion south korea","[""South Korea 's"", 'Cho Kuk']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32022938  0.40986964

Having been promoted to the rank of vice marshal in 2014, Hwang was elected to be the new chief of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, a position considered the most senior in the military after the supreme commander Kim.But even Hwang -- who is thought to be a key aide of Kim after forging close ties with his mother Ko Yong-hui -- has fallen victim to a high-profile political purge orchestrated by Kim. Anyone seen as a challenge to Kim’s leadership has been purged or eliminated, including his own half brother Kim Jong-nam, who was assassinated earlier this year in Malaysia. According to South Korea’s top spy agency, Hwang was recently punished for his “impure” attitude as a result of the first inspection on the General Political Bureau in 20 years. Alongside Hwang, his top deputy, Kim Wong-hong, was also punished.  Hwang Pyong-sostands with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un. Yonhap“Given that the two  officials were punished, the punishment of other officers below their ranks would have followed,” said Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, who attended a closed-door meeting with the National Intelligence Service on Monday. It was unclear whether Hwang was verbally reprimanded, dismissed or banished to a rural area. When asked about the scope of punishment, lawmaker Kim said he was not authorized to reveal “classified intelligence” obtained by the NIS. The NIS told lawmakers that the purge was spearheaded by Choe Ryong-hae, who was the No. 2 man before Hwang, indicating a power struggle between the two. Months after Hwang was promoted to the head of the General Political Bureau, Hwang replaced Choe in his last military capacity as first vice chairman of the National Defense Commission. He retained the position even after the NDC was transformed into the State Affairs Commission in 2016.The move also appeared to be Kim Jong-un’s efforts to restore the party’s control over the military, which was overturned by his father Kim Jong-il. He has prioritized the Korean People’s Army in the affairs of state and allocation of resources under the slogan of a “military-first policy.” “It’s a traditional way of confirming the party’s superiority over the military ,” lawmaker Kim said. “But, then again, it was not like an across-the-board purge and did not occur all over the military. It only took issue .” By Yeo Jun-suk","second most powerful official ,second most powerful man ,korea since its leader ,most powerful official ,most powerful official in","['Hwang Pyong - so', 'North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the General Political Bureau', 'the Korean People ’s Army']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55174661  0.67400992

30,30,30,[Herald Interview] ‘Religious tolerance is a test of democracy in Indonesia’,"Indonesia, by virtue of its geography as a vast nation of 17,000 islands, couldn’t isolate itself from waves of Islamic influence that started arriving on its shores largely since the late 13th century. Islam was first introduced by Arab traders, then by Islamic scholars and their missionary activities.

Islam was first introduced by Arab traders, then by Islamic scholars and their missionary activities. It was later adopted by local rulers and converts, and acted as a rallying call against foreign occupiers during the late colonial period.Religion, much like everything else in the heterogeneous archipelago nation, feeds a complex loop of Indonesia’s modern, labyrinthine society. Indonesia has the world’s largest Sunni Muslim population of 230 million people -- comprising over 87 percent of the national population -- but the country remains a secular state constitutionally. “Because our national territory is made of open islands, it was hard to keep outside influences from penetrating our local cultures. There is no single dominant culture or religion in Indonesia. Everything is a mix of different elements,” said Indonesian Ambassador to Korea Umar Hadi in an interview. He added that there are different religions practiced dominantly in different areas across Indonesia, with Hindus in Bali, Christians in North Sulawesi and Catholics in Flores Island, among others. Confucianism, introduced from Chinese merchants since the third century, is a religion in Indonesia, unlike across East Asian societies where it has largely remained a cultural force. Indonesian Ambassador to Korea Umar Hadi The Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs recognizes six religions -- Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism -- with deputy ministers representing each religion. “Indonesia is fortunate, because by nature we had to be an open country,” Hadi stressed, adding in the future, “With all the advances in technology, transport and information, you won’t be able to isolate yourself.”“It’s inevitable,” he argued. “Closing your doors will not be helpful for your own development.”Hadi said the state or government is “sometimes ill-equipped to determine the course of history.” The forces of migration and integration happen naturally for different reasons, “whatever policies are in place,” said the diplomat.Indonesia’s founding ideology is “Pancasila,” which is embedded in the constitution as a secular principle and forms the basis of all national regulations and societal codes. Belief in God comprises one of Pancasila’s five pillars, the others being humanity, the unity of Indonesia within diversity, democracy based on consensus through deliberation, and social justice.Islam was a unifying force in the context of Indonesia’ creation as a modern state, the envoy explained, noting the many different cultures, languages and traditions had to be united in accordance with Pancasila. Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo Atheism is not constitutionally banned in Indonesia, but there have been cases in which atheists were charged with blasphemy for publicly expressing their views. Politicized forms of conservative Islam have surfaced in Indonesia similar to other Southeast Asian countries.The government, prioritizing democracy and national unity within diversity, has sought to tamp down radical Islam, as some extremist organizations were inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and his administration have repeatedly warned against the creeping influence of Islamic extremism in student campuses, viewing it as a threat to the country’s founding secular ideology. Jokowi has conducted a national speaking tour across Islamic boarding schools and emphasized the importance of Indonesia’s diversity within national unity. He also told a national conference of university rectors that it was necessary to give a larger representation of the country’s secular ideology in education.The ambassador said a moderate version of Islam -- preaching peace, tolerance and harmony -- should be encouraged. “Islam as a religion is not meant to burden people’s lives. It strives to be a blessing. That’s the beauty of Islam,” he asserted. On the question of Korea’s cultural and religious diversity in the coming multicultural society, the country should adopt policies ensuring democracy at the grassroots level, he advised. “At the end there is no alternative to democracy. Consensus through deliberation in democracy is even better, because it forces you to listen to even the smallest voices in society.”Regular dialogue between cultures and religions is helpful, he added, noting younger generations are generally more open to outside cultures.

On the contrary, a trend is emerging among local bookworms, with book clubs and community-oriented independent bookstores connecting readers. Trevari is at the heart of this trend. The venture organizes and manages book clubs for a four-month fee of 190,000 won . It started out with just 80 members in 2015 and now has more than 1,600. “I feel like I am spending my time and money right, productively,” said Cho Hyung-mo, 35. Yang Sung-hoon, a Trevari member since last year, said book clubs offer an opportunity to enrich one’s reading experience. “I enjoy intellectual conversations  about a book, because I know I will get quality responses from them,” he said. The touted benefits of joining a book club vary. They include getting help in finding out the current best books; establishing regular reading habits; meeting intelligent people from various fields; and building confidence in discussing various, sometimes very profound, issues. Businesses -- not just those in the publishing industry -- have been quick to respond. With the emergence of “readingtainment,” a Korean term that combines the words “reading” and “entertainment,” shopping malls have started to build magnificent libraries to attract visitors. One example is Starfield Library, which opened in May at the Starfield Coex mall in Gangnam. It is so big that it resembles the libraries you find in fairytales and movies, such as the Beast’s study in the Disney film “Beauty and the Beast.”Starfield Library This 2800-square-meter space holds central bookcases that reach two levels of the mall and offers plenty of seating. People are even allowed to eat while reading. Book curator Oh Seo-hyun sees the latest trend as a positive development in the country’s reading culture, although it may not necessarily lead to a major turnaround in the sluggish book market in the near future. Once a solitary act, reading is becoming trendy, said Ahn Won-kyung, manager of trend tracking company Stylush. “Fancy libraries popping up inside shopping malls serve the purpose of attracting customers, particularly the trendy young generation, by offering them resting places that have a hip and sophisticated atmosphere,” said Ahn. “People upload photos taken there to their personal social media accounts.” Large bookstores are also catering to this new breed of readers. Last year, Kyobo Bookstore, the largest in the center of Seoul, did away with some bookshelves and instead brought in long wooden tables for people to sit down and read. Kim Seok-hwan, CEO of the biggest online bookseller Yes 24, said the emergence of book clubs and small bookstores has showed him how his company should evolve. “We are learning a lot from different book clubs and open library spaces in shopping malls. We want to create a bookstore that connects readers and is a venue for culture, making the leap from being just somewhere to buy books.” By Kim Da-sol","35 percent of korean ,among local bookworms ,korean adults finish single ,percent of korean adults ,reading culture south korea","['South Korea', 'korean']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74877816  0.60879236

In the month before the national college entrance exam, the rate of diagnosis and prescription picks up markedly in the same age groups as the test-takers.  123rfWhile prescriptions of ADHD drugs last year fell around 10 percent compared to the 2011 level, the figures for 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds shot up by 64 percent and 37 percent, respectively, according to data from the state-run Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The amount spent on medication by ADHD patients also showed a clear link to the college entrance test, which takes place in November. Total spending on ADHD drugs peaked at 90.2 million won  in October in 2015, a month before the exam, and significantly dropped to 58.3 million won and 55.8 million won in November and December. ADHD is a mental disorder that prevents children from concentrating for schoolwork and results in disruptive behavior. But those trends suggest that the ADHD drugs are being abused by students preparing for exams as study aids.This prompted the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to issue a public warning against possible side effects of the misguided use of the drugs. “ADHD drugs are strictly prescription drugs and are not to be used as study aids,” it said in a press release last week. Abuse of ADHD drugs can lead to depression, hallucinations, aggressive behavior and a strong urge to commit suicide, it stressed. Local news outlets reported some even illegally obtain the ADHD drugs through online channels, as they cannot purchase them elsewhere without prescriptions. The stimulant medication is used to treat ADHD as it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain.There are currently 60 different ADHD drugs sold here, composed of stimulants including clonidine, methylphenidate and atomoxetine hydrochloride, according to the ministry.

Last year South Korea was No. 116. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2017, South Korea scored 0.65 points, coming between Tunisia at No. 117 and Gambia at No. 119. A higher rank indicates a more equal society for men and women.  South Korea ranked relatively well at 84th in health and survival on the back of high life expectancy. But it remained low in economic participation at 121st, mostly due to the gender wage gap and low female representation in senior posts. The annual report ranks 144 countries on its Global Gender Gap Index to see how they compare in terms of gender equality on four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunities, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment.Globally, disparities between men and women widened for the first time in 11 years since the WEF began to release the rankings, with imbalances in salaries, a drop in women’s labor participation and lack of women’s political representation being major factors, according to the report. At the current pace, the overall global gender gap will take 100 years to close, compared to 83 years last year, the report said. As for the economic gender gap, it would take 217 years to narrow, compared with 170 last year.The top spots in the gender gap index were dominated by Scandinavian countries, with Iceland placed at first, Finland at second and Norway at third. Rwanda came in fourth, making it the highest ranking non-European country.Asia’s big economies dipped in the gender equality ranking, with China at No. 100, India at 108 and Japan at 114. Among Asian countries, the Philippines ranked highest at No. 10.","korea 118th in gender ,south korea 118th in ,118th among 144 countries ,118th in gender equality ,women economic participation last","['South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Global Gender Gap Report', 'South Korea', 'Tunisia', 'Gambia']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95395619  0.49177396

The figures come amid the international community’s growing efforts to place a cap on the reclusive nation’s economic activity by convincing Beijing to use its clout against Pyongyang.  A line of Chinese shipping container trucks are waiting to enter North Korea. A recent report by the Korea-Trade Investment Promotion Agency said the North’s trade dependency rate on China inched to 92.5 percent in 2016, a tad higher than 91.3 percent in 2015. Its rate with Russia, which came in second, stood at 1.2 percent, making China clearly North Korea’s economic lifeline. The total trade volume between the two nations in 2016 added up to almost $6 billion, which was a 6.1 percent increase compared to 2015, said KOTRA.North Korea’s imports of luxury goods last year jumped 9.8 percent to $666 million, amounting to 17.9 percent of its annual imports, Chinese Customs data cited by Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the Liberty Korea Party here showed. Such products included upmarket electronics, cars, leather products and watches.Previously, reports of the North’s increasing demand for foreign goods such as chocolate and alcohol from China, had made headlines after Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post said it imported about 167.9 tons of chocolate worth $398,000 from China during the first quarter of the year. The figure nearly doubled on-year. Experts cited the birth and rise of a new middle class in North Korea as the reason for the increasing demand for foreign goods there. “Kim Jong-un’s move to bring some elements of capitalism including a market economy into its socialist economic system has seemingly invigorated North Korea’s economy, because it has awoken its people to a new way of life,” Yang Un-chul, vice president of the private Sejong Institute, previously told The Korea Herald. China implemented the latest United Nations sanctions on the rogue regime following its series of nuclear and missile tests in September. Last month, Beijing ordered the shutdown of North Korean-owned businesses in China by early January, following its announcement it would cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products. But crude oil, which accounts for the biggest share of its energy exports to the North, has not been subject to the ban.Regarding the sanctions, experts say it may take more time for the effect to kick in. Seoul’s Unification Ministry said Monday that the northern neighbor may undergo severe economic hardships in the near future, when the latest United Nations Security Council and the US’ unilateral sanctions take effect. About 90 percent of North Korean export products are expected to struggle under the sanctions, said Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon.“After the death of founder Kim Il-sung, North Korea faced severe economic difficulties. In some cases, we think that the North‘s situation could get worse compared to that period,” Cho Myoung-gyon said at a forum, referring to the period in the 1990s when North Korea was struck by widespread famine. By Jung Min-kyung","china peaks amid sanctions ,chinese shipping container trucks ,sanctions north korea trade ,trade dependency on china ,million according to lawmaker","['North Korea ’s', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48318574  0.4099021

The KCTU quit the trilateral committee in 1999 in defiance of mass dismissals in the face of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.The relationship between labor and government had faltered during Park’s presidency, as she had pushed to make the labor market more flexible, which the labor bloc saw as undermining job security and labor rights. In an apparent attempt to mend ties, President Moon invited leaders of major labor unions on Tuesday evening. It marks his first meeting with labor leaders since he took office in May. Moon met with business leaders in July.  President Moon Jae-in  and Kim Ju-young, head of the FKTU, at a dinner meeting at Cheong Wa Dae Tuesday. Moon vowed to involve workers as “important partners” in running state affairs and displayed hope for the resumption of the three-way talks during the meeting. “The labor policies for the past 10 years have been unilaterally pushed for. As a result, labor unions shrank in size and number while the quality of each and every laborer‘s lives worsened,” Moon said.”The meeting will be an important starting point to restore relations between laborers and the government as partners.“As for the KCTU’s boycott of the meeting, he expressed regret. “In whatever forms, I hope that social dialogue can proceed through meetings among labor, management and government at the trilateral committee,” he said.The KCTU boycotted the meeting for two reasons: the meeting included the head of the Tripartite Commission and the presidential office selectively contacted individual trade unions under the KCTU without its leadership’s approval.But the KCTU is facing mounting calls to return to dialogue to tackle many pending issues such as long work hours, minimum wage and irregular workers, under the Moon administration, which is considered labor friendly. The government appointed Kim Young-joo, who served as deputy chairperson of the Korean Financial Industry Union under the FKTU, as labor minister and Moon Sung-hyun, former head of the Korean Steel Industry Association under KCTU, as the head of the trilateral committee in an apparent effort to bring the labor unions back to the three-way committee. Some critics say the KCTU’s decision to boycott the president’s call for a meeting is highly political and might even reflect an internal feud in the umbrella union group in the face of the upcoming election to pick the organization’s new leader. The KCTU’s incumbent leader Han Sang-kyun has been placed behind bars on charges of holding “illegal” rallies. The two union umbrella groups represent about 10 percent of all workers in South Korea. By Ock Hyun-ju","korean trade unions hinted ,second biggest umbrella trade ,of korean trade unions ,federation of korean trade ,korean trade unions","['the Federation of Korean Trade Unions', 'the Tripartite Commission of Labor', 'Management and Government']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28136078  0.47208765

According to data from the Chinese Customs revealed by Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun of the Liberty Korea Party, the communist state’s imports of luxury goods increased by $59 million, or 9.8 percent, from 2015.The luxury goods included upmarket electronics, cars, leather products and watches.  Kim Jong-un  Electronics made up the biggest import value at $330 million, followed by high-end cars with $260 million. The reclusive state also imported some $16 million worth of liquor and drinks.Since the young dictator Kim Jong-un took over the regime in 2012, luxury item imports have continued to rise. During his five years of rule, the North has imported $3.36 billion worth of luxury goods, according to the data.Watches saw the biggest increase in imported amount compared to the year before, up by 47.8 percentage points, followed by cars, which rose by 31.7 percentage points, and carpets by 26.6 percentage points. Imports of jewelry and instruments dropped by 91.8 percentage points and 46.3 percentage points, respectively. “It looks like Kim Jong-un tried to ease discontent and encourage a celebratory atmosphere among the privileged by giving out presents,” Rep. Yoon said in a press release. Pointing to China as the main source of the trade, the lawmaker criticized the government’s passivity in preventing transactions between the two countries. In 2006, the UN Security Council passed Sanction 1718, which includes banning all member states, including China, from engaging in the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to North Korea of luxury goods, but China has been ignoring the mandate. Rep. Yoon stressed that actual imports would be much more than recorded by official statistics due to illegal trade and smuggling, urging the Chinese government to follow international sanctions.

Kim Deok-ju , a senior official at the Dangjin muniipality on South Korea`s west coast, receives a certificate on the registration of the city`s Hapdeok Reservoir as a world heritage irrigation structure from Saeed Nairizi , chief of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, during the commission`s world congress in Mexico City on Oct. 10, 2017, in this photo released by the Dangjin municipality. It marked the fourth time a South Korean facility was recognized as a heritage irrigation structure. Seoho Lake, also known as Chukman Reservoir, in the city of Suwon, just south of Seoul, and Byeokgol Reservoir in Gimje, a city in South Korea's southwest province of North Jeolla, are also on the list of ICID heritage irrigation structures.Legend has it that King Gyeon Hwon, the founder of the ancient kingdom Hubaekje , had the Hapdeok Reservoir built to water his war horses ahead of a final battle against its rival Hukoguryo.The reservoir covering an area of 240,000 square meters is designated as a natural monument in South Chungcheong Province to which Dangjin belongs. The Dangjin municipality plans to develop the reservoir as a tourist spot to experience the history of Korean agriculture.The Manseokgeo Reservoir was constructed as one of three reservoirs against drought in 1799, when King Jeongjo, the 22nd monarch of the Joseon Dynasty , built the city's Hwaseong Fortress, a UNESCO-designated cultural heritage site.Established in 1950, the ICID is a leading scientific and technical NGO that has facilitated the sharing of experience and transfer of water management technology through its network of professionals spread throughout more than a hundred countries.South Korea acceded to the international body in 1969, with the Korean National Committee on Irrigation and Drainage representing the country. The ICID made the scheme for the recognition of heritage irrigation in 2012 in a bid to trace the history of irrigation in civilizations around the world and collect information on historical irrigation structures worldwide.A total of 51 irrigation facilities worldwide, including those in China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Thailand, have made the list of heritage irrigation structures so far.","two south korean reservoirs ,south korean reservoirs ,korean reservoirs registered ,south korean reservoirs as ,korean reservoirs as world","['south korean', 'International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage', 'the Hapdeok Reservoir', 'Dangjin', 'the Manseokgeo Reservoir', 'Suwon']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92588198  0.52675492

Wi Seong-gon of the ruling Democratic Party.The figure ranged from about 7,000 to about 9,000 annually between 2010 and 2014, but surged to 12,075 in 2015 and 13,529 in 2016, it said.Wi disclosed the data after some 25 red fire ants were found in a storage container at Busan's Gamman port last week. Minister of Oceans and Fisheries Kim Young-choon  visits Busan`s Gamman port on Oct. 7, 2017. Asia accounted for 68 percent, or 47,205 cases, of the origins of exotic diseases and insect pests discovered in South Korea, followed by North America with 8,580 cases, or 12 percent, and Europe with 5,665 cases, or 8 percent.""There is growing damage from alien diseases and insect pests that sneak into South Korea.

The government should work harder to take countermeasures,"" said the lawmaker.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said that the government has been conducting an all-out campaign to contain the spread of imported red fire ants beyond the port of Busan.The ministry said it has set up 3,467 forecasting traps for the potentially dangerous insect at 34 major ports nationwide and launched an investigative team composed of 20 experts and officials.The team has conducted a thorough examination of inland cargo depots in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province, and Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, while all cargo trucks leaving the Gamman port undergo disinfecting measures, said the ministry.The highly invasive alien red ant species has a sting that can cause severe allergic reactions, including breathing problems that sometimes lead to death.Minister of Oceans and Fisheries Kim Young-choon visited the Busan port Saturday and vowed to take all possible measures to prevent the spread of red fire ants and other harmful insects in the nation in cooperation with the agriculture, environment and other ministries.Kim also said that monitoring for the red fire ants should last for up to two years and that an independent quarantine organization should be set up to thoroughly prevent the entry of harmful insects into the country.","insects growing at korea ,korea ports nearly 70 ,of exotic insects growing ,government data showed saturday ,insect pests at airports",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28481022  0.60159594

The victims were tallied at 6,570 as of this year, down 19 percent from 8,075 recorded in 2016, according to the data by the Ministry of Interior and Safety. It marks a drastic fall from the previous figures of 11,717 in 2014 and 9,937 in 2015. The figure has more than halved from 13,854 in 2013.  The compiled data are based on the government grants paid to the surviving victims. It pays an annual 800,000 won  to every victim as part of medical support.Their declining numbers attest to the fact that the victims -- mostly in their 80s and 90s -- are dying without getting fair compensation in time, civic groups said. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Koreans were mobilized as forced laborers by the Japanese military to toil under dangerous and poor working conditions without pay. The surviving Korean victims and their advocates have urged Tokyo and the companies responsible for the abuses to admit to and compensate for their wrongful acts. Japan claims the damages have been covered by a 1965 treaty with Seoul on resolving colonial-era issues. A total of 15 lawsuits in Korea have been filed since the early 2000s against Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, one of the firms involved in forced labor. But the litigations have dragged on for nearly two decades mainly because of the defendant's dilatory attitude. ""Many of them, who are elderly with physical limitations, are reluctant to join the litigation because they are discouraged about whether they will ever get the court ruling,"" said Lee Kook-un, head of a local activist group. ""The Supreme Court must make up its mind soon."" A 2000 damages suit against Mitsubishi has been delayed until Wednesday, while all five plaintiffs are now deceased. Two out of the four plaintiffs that were engaged in a suit against Nippon Steel & Sumimoto Metal Corp. have also passed away. Currently, three cases are pending at the top court.","it marks drastic fall ,wednesday the victims ,year down 19 percent ,labor is dropping fast ,korean victims of wartime","['south korean', 'japanese', 'the Ministry of Interior and Safety']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50338876  0.60952485

The Bank of Korea in Seoul said North Korea’s economic growth reached a 17-year high of 3.9 percent in 2016.

The Bank of Korea in Seoul said North Korea’s economic growth reached a 17-year high of 3.9 percent in 2016. The South Korean central bank has monitored the North Korean economy since 1991.  North Korean staff stand behind the counter of the kitchenware booth of a distributor from Thailand at the 13th International Trade Fair in Pyongyang on Monday. The figure is a rebound from 2015, when North Korea posted a negative growth of 1.1 percent mainly due to a severe drought that led to a drastic decrease in grain production.The North recorded 0.8 percent growth in 2011, 1.3 percent in 2012, 1.1 percent in 2013 and 1 percent in 2014, according to BOK data.Experts in Seoul attributed the North’s relatively rapid growth last year to a revitalized black market and the increase in trade with China, Pyongyang’s closest ally.“Kim Jong-un’s move to bring some elements of capitalism including market economy into its socialist economic system has seemingly invigorated North Korea’s economy because it has awoken its people to a new way of life,” Yang Un-chul, vice president of the private Sejong Institute, told The Korea Herald. “Today, North Korean citizens have a more capitalist mind. They have begun to brainstorm new ideas and think for themselves to generate more personal profit.” Having taken power after the death of his father and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2011, the junior Kim is said to have been in favor of a more flexible economic system. This has since led to a growth in the North’s private enterprises, according to experts here.They said the North’s economic reform has also bestowed the business and factory operators more private control over its employees and management. The overall farming trend has also shifted from state-controlled to a more family-owned system.  North Korean visitors leave the the 13th International Trade Fair in Pyongyang on Monday. Another factor behind the economic growth concerns the North’s trade ties with China, which reportedly account for nearly 90 percent of North Korean trade.According to data from the state-run Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, bilateral trade between Pyongyang and Beijing rose 6.1 percent in 2016 from a year earlier, reaching a two-way total of $6.5 billion. Notably, China’s export of foreign goods such as chocolate and alcohol to North Korea rose in the first two quarters of this year, which indicates that its economy is not sluggish, said Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post last week. It said that North Korea imported about 167.9 tons of chocolate worth $398,000 from China during the first quarter of this year, which is 1.8 times more than the same period a year before. But experts forecast that the North’s economy will be hit hard by the recent set of stronger economic sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council, which targets its textile exports. In 2016 alone, textiles were the North’s second-biggest export item worth $752 million, after coal and other minerals. “Its economy is likely to face more difficult challenges this year due to its latest series of nuclear and missile tests,” Yang added. Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies said it was the country’s poor who would be worst hit.“But the ruling class and the rich people in the North won’t be much affected because they will always find ways to maintain their living standard. The underprivileged people are always the unlucky ones.” he said.

The all-time low was tallied in December last year when 27,400 babies were born in the country. It is the first time that the number of childbirths remained below the 30,000 level for two straight months.South Korea has seen its childbirths remain on a steep downside cycle since the 3.4 percent on-year gain in November 2015, with numbers falling sharply starting last December.Also the number of newborn kids is expected to reach around 360,000 for 2017, breaking the current record low of 406,200 babies tallied in 2016.The low birthrate has been one of the most pressing issues for decades in South Korea, coupled with an increased aging population. Many are worried that low births will drag down the workforce in Asia's fourth-largest economy and drive up welfare costs, undermining the growth potential of the economy.The statistics data also showed that the number of marriages fell 10.4 percent on-year, or 2,200, to a 10-month low of 19,000 in July due to the leap month in the lunar calendar.At the same time, 8,200 couples divorced over the cited period, down 5.7 percent from a year earlier.The number of deaths came to 22,300 for the month, up 0.9 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.","childbirths fall by double ,double digits in july ,about 29 400 babies ,korea childbirths fall ,newborn babies in south","['South Korea', 'Statistics Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85482454  0.3626354

""Gasoline prices have trebled compared with those early this year.""He added that a kilogram of gasoline was sold in the mid-6,000 North Korean won level early this year. In North Korea, $1 is trading at some 8,000 North Korean won. The surge is not confined to Pyongyang, the capital, although there are some differences by region, he said. The international community has strengthened economic sanctions on Pyongyang. Days after the North's nuclear test Sept. 3, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2375, which was aimed at cutting about 30 percent of oil provided to the impoverished state.It also includes a ban on exports of North Korean textiles.The council also adopted Resolution 2371 in early August, targeted mainly at curbing the North's coal and other mineral exports, in response to its launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.A set of sanctions are expected to slash North Korea's total exports by around 90 percent this year, from $2.82 billion in 2016, he added.In contrast, rice prices and foreign exchange rates are relatively stable, the ministry said.The country's food imports from China stood at some 75,000 tons in the first seven months of this year, nearly seven times higher than around 11,000 tons a year earlier.""Impacts of the sanctions on trade, prices and North Koreans' livelihood are likely to become visible as time goes by,"" said the official.The government said that North Korea is emphasizing self-reliance, pressing its people to withstand the tough sanctions.","gasoline prices have trebled ,tougher sanctions ministry gasoline ,prices in korea trebles ,government official said tuesday ,gas prices in korea","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Unification Ministry']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61391544  0.64184511

YonhapAccording to Seoul Metropolitan Government, the city spent some 775 billion won  last year on producing 1.1 billion cubic meters of tap water, which translates into 679 won per cubic meter.The production cost of tap water in Seoul is far cheaper than New York’s 2,690 won per cubic meter and London’s 2,543 won per cubic meter, the city said, citing data from 2011 Comparison of Annual Water Cycle Charges report. Paris and Tokyo were producing tap water at 1,737 won per cubic meter and 2,193 won per cubic meter, respectively. The Seoul city attributed its low cost of tap water production to well-equipped and sustainable waterworks system. As of 2015, Seoul’s water flow rate hit 96 percent, slightly above that of Paris  and Tokyo . “Seoul City will continue to ensure that citizens’ drinking water has the highest quality and improve the maintenance at the Arisu Purification Center,” said Yoon Jun-byung, head of Seoul Metropolitan Government’s office of waterworks. According to Arisu Quality Report published in May, Seoul’s tap water acquired the ISO 22000 international certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its drinkable quality.The water was free of 26 harmful substances including lead, arsenic, cadmium, phenol and parathion, while no pathogenic microorganisms were detected, the report said. By Kim Da-sol","won 685 million last ,seoul tap water cheaper ,tap water cheaper than ,billion won 685 million ,685 million last year","['Seoul', 'Arisu', 'New York', 'London', 'Seoul Metropolitan Government']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44848615  0.45705426

Under leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea has made rapid progress in its weapons programmes, and it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July that appeared to bring much of the US mainland into range.Kim and US President Donald Trump have since engaged in a war of words, heightening tensions. This file photo shows a worker at a gas station in Pyongyang. The latest UN sanctions for the first time imposed limits on supplies to the North of the fuel it needs to keep its citizens and soldiers moving. China -- by far the North‘s biggest supplier and key diplomatic protector -- confirmed in a statement late Friday it would adhere to the new sanctions from October 1.Exports of refined products will be capped at 2 million barrels a year beginning in 2018.Under the sanctions, crude oil exports are limited to current levels. China has not issued official figures for its crude sales to its neighbor for several years.But according to the US mission to the United Nations, Beijing provides Pyongyang with around 4 million barrels a year of crude oil, and 4.5 million barrels of refined oil products such as petrol and diesel.There is a livelihood exemption in the rules, but the measures would seem to amount to a cut of more than 55 percent in oil product supplies, and it appears to be having an effect in Pyongyang.In North Korea petrol is sold by the kilogram rather than the liter, and payment in hard currency is required for retail buyers.“It was $1.90 yesterday, today it is $2,” said a petrol station employee. “I expect the price will go up in the future.”In January prices were below $1 per kilogram, and stood at around $1.65 in July, so they have gone up about 20 percent in the last two months and more than doubled so far this year.There is significantly less traffic on the roads in Pyongyang than earlier this year, although AFP reporters in the capital have not seen any evidence to back up Trump’s tweet that: “Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!” Trump dubbed Kim “Rocket Man” in a speech at the United Nations last week in which he threatened to “totally destroy” the North if it attacked the US or its allies.In a statement on Friday Kim responded by calling the US head of state “mentally deranged” and a “dotard” who would “pay dearly” for his comments -- triggering Trump to describe him as a “madman.” The increasingly bellicose rhetoric has raised fears of a physical conflict.Even so analysts say that the economic consequences of sanctions will do nothing to dissuade Pyongyang, which says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against the threat of invasion.Reduced fuel supplies would lead to problems with logistics and transport, Andrei Lankov of Korea Risk Group told AFP.But he added: “Even if economic problems lead to starvation, the policy will not change.”One liter of petrol weighs 0.77 kilograms, so the current Pyongyang price is equivalent to $2.59 per liter.In contrast, average retail prices in South Korea -- which, like the North, has few hydrocarbons of its own -- were only about half as much last week at 1,485 won per liter, or $1.31.Residents of the North Korean capital say the recent increases have come in a series of small steps.Prices had already jumped around April, which analysts said at the time could have been due to stockpiling by the authorities in anticipation of an embargo.“The market is anticipating the worst -- a cut-off or decrease in supply via China -- and the authorities are using price rises along with other control mechanisms to absorb the pain in advance,” said John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul.But the impact on the regime could be limited, he added.“The key vulnerability is the military -- but presumably their stockpiles are prioritized and well coordinated with decisions about the nuclear and missile programmes,” he said.“They are built for this. It‘s what they are good at.”","petrol prices pumped up ,pumped higher in pyongyang ,pyongyang pyongyang petrol prices ,petrol prices pumped ,nuclear armed north korea","['pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'United Nations', 'North Korea', 'AFP', 'the UN Security Council']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89397037  0.14968017

Sales of liquefied natural gas are banned outright. A North Korean solder stands guard near barrels stacked up near the river bank of the North Korean town of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong. China announced Saturday, Sept. 23, 2017 it will limit oil supplies to North Korea under UN sanctions starting Oct. 1, 2017, stepping up pressure on Pyongyang over its pursuit of nuclear and missile technology. North Korea depends on China for almost all its oil and gas but estimates of its consumption are low,leaving it unclear how Beijing’s new limit will affect them. The restrictions announced Saturday do not apply to crude oil,which makes up the biggest share of energy exports to the North.China also will ban textile imports from the North, the ministry said. Textiles are believed to be the North’s biggest source of foreign revenue following rounds of UN sanctions under which Beijing cut off purchases of coal, iron ore, seafood and other goods.China accounts for some 90 percent of the North’s trade, making its cooperation critical to efforts to derail Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile development.Chinese leaders were long the North’s diplomatic protectors but express increasing frustration with the government of Kim Jong-un. They support the latest UN Security Council sanctions but are reluctant to push Pyongyang too hard for fear Kim’s government might collapse. They also argue against doing anything that might hurt ordinary North Koreans.Chinese officials complain their country bears the cost of enforcing sanctions, which have hurt businesses in its northeast that trade with the North.The UN Security Council voted Sept. 11 to limit fuel supplies and ban the North’s textile exports. China, one of five permanent council members with power to veto U.N. action, agreed to the measure after the United States toned down a proposal for a complete oil embargo.Petroleum exports for use in the North’s ballistic missile program or other activities banned by UN sanctions also are prohibited, the Commerce Ministry said.The US government’s Energy Information Agency estimates the North’s 2016 daily imports from China at 15,000 barrels of crude oil and 6,000 barrels of refined products. That would be the equivalent of almost 5.5 million barrels of crude and 2.2 million barrels of refined products for the full year.North Korea has abundant coal but depends almost entirely on imports for oil and gas.North Korean textile exports in 2016 totaled $750 million, according to South Korea’s Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. It said nearly 80 percent went to China.","natural gas are banned ,korea and stop buying ,stop buying its textiles ,gas are banned outrig ,missile development further reducing","['BEIJING', 'China', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'Pyongyang', 'the Commerce Ministry']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69264382  0.11270146

Dragged down by such weak inbound traffic, the total number of foreigners who visited South Korea last month fell 33.7 percent on-year to 1.1 million from 1.6 million, according to the data.Chinese visitors accounted for nearly half of the 17 million foreigners that visited the country last year.The sharp decline in Chinese tourists has been widely expected as Beijing has banned its travel agencies from selling package tours bound to South Korea since mid-March in an apparent retaliation over Seoul's deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system.

South Korea also saw the number of visitors from the Philippines and Indonesia plunge 38.1 percent and 44.5 percent on-year in August, respectively, according to the data.The drop from the two countries was mainly attributed to difficulty in securing flight tickets to South Korea amid a sharp increase in demand for flights to the two Southeast Asian countries here during the peak holiday season, the KTO said.The number of outbound South Korean nationals came to 2.38 million in August, up 15.6 percent from 2.06 million a year earlier, the data showed.","korea declined 61 percent ,388 last month down ,chinese visitors number drops ,339 388 last month ,declined 61 percent","['chinese', 'South Korea', 'US', 'chinese', 'Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30287308  0.70565486

Lee Chul-hee of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea.He said the helicopters were half a century old and it was even difficult to get new components. An undated file photo of CH-47D Chinook helicoter operated by South Korea`s military. The lawmaker claimed that then-Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin, who later served as Park’s national security adviser, was behind the purchase. Kim was apparently one of the most influential policymakers on national security affairs in the government of the ousted president.The program to acquire the second-hand CH-47Ds, the US Army’s heavy troop and supply transport aircraft originally fielded in the Vietnam War, started in 2013 at the offer of the USFK as part of its own asset modernization drive.South Korea’s military was seeking additional large transport helicopters at that time.“The helicopters we purchased from the USFK were produced between 1967 and 1980,” a defense official told reporters in a background briefing.The Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, a think tank affiliated with the ministry of National Defense, concluded at that time that the acquisition of the choppers was “appropriate,” he stressed.In its latest related report in July, he added, the KIDA maintained its assessment that the choppers will likely be workable through 2030.Another official denied reports that the new parts of the choppers will soon be unavailable.“In 2015, the US informed us that the Foreign Military Sales program for the components will finish as of September 2018,” he said. “But it will be possible to secure them through a commercial purchase.”The officials did not elaborate when asked whether Kim influenced officials in charge of the program.They said the decision was made “normally” in consideration of budgets and the required operational capability.","chinook choppers for 150 ,choppers for 150 billion ,bought 14 outdated chinook ,2030 military south korean ,dozen 47 chinook helicopters","['south korean', 'the US', 'Park Geun', 'Lee Chul - hee', 'Democratic Party of Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55090737  0.5172649

The government plans to increase the ratio of renewable energy from the current 1.9 percent to 20 percent by 2030, with details on how to reach the target to be included in the energy road map to be announced within this year. For efficient management of energy demand and supply, the government will establish a pilot program for the renewable energy control tower in the coming months and test its ability to manage the power supply in the next two years, with a goal of full operation in 2020, a panel working on the broad energy road map said.Under the program, power providers will have to submit their estimated electricity output based on the weather forecast to allow the control center to regulate energy supply and demand. “The government needs the control tower to expect, assess and manage renewable energy‘s power production,” the group said. The group also called for increased investment in backup facilities for intermittent complementation in case of bad weather and other issues, recommending pumped storage power plants that can control power and liquefied natural gas plants that can solely operate gas turbines.President Moon Jae-in has pledged to stop building new nuclear plants and phase out aged reactors. It has temporarily halted construction of two nuclear reactors to better gauge public opinion. What will be done with the unfinished reactors will be announced in late October.","renewable energy south korea ,tuesday the government plans ,government plans to increase ,renewable energy policies ,south korea will establish",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52926517  0.51457828

Health and Welfare Minister Park Neung-hoo said Thursday that the ministry will set up a team dedicated to lowering the country’s suicide rate, which is one of the world’s highest, and add 500 more counsellors at 241 mental health welfare centers across the nation, starting next year. “Suicide is not a personal problem anymore, but a national task which our society as a whole should take interest in and try to solve,” Park said ahead of World Suicide Prevention Day, which falls on Sunday. Preventing suicides is one of the 100 key policies that President Moon Jae-in vowed to push forward during his five-year presidency, with an aim to reduce the number of suicides per 100,000 people to 20 by 2020. South Korea’s suicide rate remains the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with 26.5 people per 100,000 taking their lives in 2015. According to the Welfare Ministry, there were an average 37 suicides per day in 2015, totaling 13,513. There are a myriad of factors behind Korea’s high suicide rate, with experts citing stress from excessive competition at school and work, heavy workload, high unemployment, dissolution of families and weak social safety nets, among others. Many family members of someone who has taken their own life, estimated to be hovering around 700,000 over the last 10 years by the ministry, are also thought to suffer from mental and physical distress. The government’s survey of 72 family members of suicide victims showed that 75 percent of them experienced depression and lack of motivation, 69 percent had insomnia and 65 percent felt anxiety. Some 11 percent received treatment for mental problems and 43 percent had suicidal thoughts. Civic groups criticized the government for its lack of efforts in preventing suicides at a forum held Thursday, calling for comprehensive measures across ministries and municipalities. “There should be a pangovernmental suicide prevention policy and a control tower to curb suicides under the Prime Minister’s Office,” said Kim Yeon-eun, head of Life Line Seoul. “The government should force ministries to carry  out and monitor their implementation.” Baek Jong-woo, secretary-general of the Korea Association for Suicide Prevention, took issue with the lack of funding for suicide prevention efforts. “The increased budget could prevent suicides,” he said, noting that the number of those who died in traffic accidents decreased by about 39 percent during the 2001-2011 period mainly due to a budget of 400 billion won to reduce traffic accidents. Some 9.9 billion won has been assigned to prevent suicides in the Welfare Ministry’s budget this year -- amounting to 0.02 percent of the budget to stave off traffic accidents.","add 500 more counsellors ,10 billion won million ,for suicide prevention korea ,500 more counsellors at ,million for 2018 health","['Korea', 'Welfare', 'Park Neung - hoo']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41549683  0.29043555

Furthermore, Seoul, Washington and other nations now hope to completely cut off Pyongyang’s fuel supply. “Gasoline prices rose to $27-$30 per 15 kilograms  in Pyongyang last month, and recently it skyrocketed again,” Seoul Pyongyang News reported Wednesday, quoting an unnamed source.“Drivers in Pyongyang are visiting five to six gas stations to fill their cars, as oil supply has been sharply reduced. Some of the gas stations are secretly charging extra.”The unnamed source also said that roads that once suffered from traffic jams have become less congested. The report added that although the atmosphere appears to be peaceful after the sixth nuclear test, North Koreans are gradually feeling the impact of international sanctions. The communist regime is known to import about 1 million tons of crude and petroleum products from its ally China, while Russia also ships some 300,000 tons of crude oil to the country, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.Half of the million tons from China are said to delivered for free, but China has neither confirmed nor denied its oil trade with the North.While denouncing the North’s latest test, Russia and China appear to be reluctant to take action against the rogue nation. A US-drafted resolution that was circulated to UN Security Council members Wednesday seeks to ban all oil and natural gas exports and freeze all foreign financial assets of the North Korean government and its leader Kim Jong-un. The resolution is expected to be put to a vote Monday.A Japanese media outlet reported last week that North Korea had set a goal in April to increase its oil reserves, possibly in preparation for additional sanctions.According to the Tokyo Shimbun report, Kim ordered for the country’s oil reserves to be increased to 1 million tons, which amounts to about half to two-thirds of North Korea’s annual crude imports. By Jo He-rim","nuclear programs more sanctions ,gasoline prices soaring ,gasoline prices soaring in ,prices soaring in pyongyang ,cut off pyongyang fuel","['Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Pyongyang', 'yonhap)“gasolin']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33232117  0.11518595

The number of unwed male household heads in the age bracket is predicted to surge 31 times from 2017 to 671,000 in 26 years, with that for women rising to 13 times to 372,000.The statistical agency attributed the rising number of unmarried senior household heads to the country's aging population and a growing tendency among South Koreans not to tie the knot.South Korea remains gripped by a quickly aging population, which experts worry will likely sap the economy's growth by cutting the labor force and add to its welfare burden.Asia's fourth-largest economy is projected to become an aged society in 2017, with the ratio of people aged 65 and older hitting14 percent of its 50 million population. It is forecast to become a super-aged society in 2026, with the figure rising above 20 percent.","skyrocketing to 04 million ,year before skyrocketing ,04 million in 2043 ,year before skyrocketing to ,this year before skyrocketing","['South Korea', 'Statistics Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80154306  0.20363659

It is the highest figure since compilation of related data began in 1990, the office said. The amount of the confiscated narcotics reached 117 kilograms, enough for use by some 3.9 million people, sharply up by 41.8 percent from 2015. The number of those charged with smuggling also climbed 24.7 percent to 4,036. The report attributed the ascent in registered narcotics offenders and seized drugs to a growing use of online platforms, largely social networking sites, to buy and supply the illicit substances. It said that in a lot of the recent cases, the offenders made deals through mobile chatting apps or SNS sites. There was also a sharp rise in the narcotics crimes committed by foreigners. A total of 957 foreign nationals from some 30 countries were busted by local law enforcement in 2016, up 49.5 percent from a year earlier. Chinese citizens accounted for the biggest proportion, followed by Thais and Americans, with most of them in charge of the smuggling. ""There has been a growing number of smuggling cases in which the seller contacts a foreign supplier over the Internet or SNS and has the drugs delivered via international mail or express mail,"" the report said. The most popular distribution route changed from China to Southeast Asia in the cited period, with a lot of methamphetamine smuggled in from the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan, according to the report.","korea rose 19 percent ,drug offenders up 19 ,19 percent in 2016 ,latest white paper published ,narcotics offenders in south","['South Korea', ""the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59647042  0.49191672

Traditional gender norms still hold sway in many sectors of the Confucian society. The country has the largest gender wage gap amongst the world’s developed countries, while women still remain a rare species in corporate Korea’s C-suite. But for Kim Hei-sook, head of the elite Ewha Womans University, women’s distinct sensibility and empathy which enable them to better connect with people, will be a valuable asset in the new age of the “fourth industrial revolution.”Kim Hei-sook, Ewha Womans University president “After decades of struggle, women have finally become independent and socially autonomous like men  but they are now still struggling to reach the positions to shape the social and political landscape,” Kim said in an interview at the university’s campus in Seoul.But as technology changes, so do gender roles. The coming major wave of socioeconomic transformation will bring to women opportunities that were not seen before, she said. Traditional engineering skills alone -- typically dominated by men -- will not be enough to cope with the unknown challenges lying ahead, she went on, stressing the need to tap into the female talent pool. “Creative thinking will become ever more important.” Still, there are so few women in the field of emerging technologies, like 3-D printing and robotics, Kim noted. As an educator, she wants to better prepare female students for the forthcoming era. “The key is to leverage the collective power of female intellectuals here at Ewha and develop and learn strategies to use digital tools from our own perspectives. Now with a new era of artificial intelligence dawning upon us, women should be able to equip themselves with the right skills so that we can take on new, emerging jobs.” To achieve that, the leading women’s university here has rebranded its engineering college into ELTEC College of Engineering, which comprises some of the most advanced engineering education in technology including mechanical, biomedical and materials science.It was the world’s first women’s college of engineering when it was established in 1996, with the aim of meeting the country’s needs for female engineers.As the new name represents -- which stands for excellence, leadership, technology, entrepreneurship and convergence -- 550 female students who have entered this year are learning the convergence of diverse engineering knowledge and its application through business management techniques. In the global manufacturing sector, workers, whether white or blue-collar, are already at risk of being replaced by robots. But the robots will not be able to perform tasks on the level humans can in certain areas where a focus on humans is more needed. “The AI technology has not yet reached this level, in particular, when it comes to responding to our certain emotions. In that regard, women have the edge when equipped with the right skills,” said Kim. She questioned: “Why are there so few girls here playing video games like many other men do?” The needs to obtain the right skills, of course, come from a sense of urgency and a desire among themselves to do something outside of their traditional boundaries, Kim said. Originally a philosophy professor, Kim took office as president of Ewha on May 26, as the university’s first president elected through a direct vote of the faculty, administrative staff, students and alumni since its establishment. Her election was widely seen as a closure to one of the most turbulent periods of Ewha’s 131-year of history: Ewha was embroiled in a massive scandal surrounding former President Park Geun-hye’s close friend Choi Soon-sil, accused of providing favors to Choi’s daughter in admissions, grades and school affairs. For Kim, that was a case where political power and educators colluded immorally -- not something that frequently happened in the past. Ewha’s former president Choi Kyung-hee stepped down in October last year amid allegations that she gave admission favors to Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of former President Park’s longtime friend and confidante. The admission fraud was part of a sweeping corruption scandal surrounding Park which eventually led to her impeachment and the arrest of the school’s several top officials, including Kim’s predecessor.Kim was at the front of the professors’ protests against the irregularities of the school’s leadership then led by Choi. But in person she was soft-spoken and composed. “There are two sides on the admission fraud scandal. First is, we should bring positive images back again as a leading educational institution, which won’t be easy. Another is that our students have proved themselves to be brave enough to fight for justice,” Kim said. She vowed open communication and inclusive leadership, seeking to rebuild the elite school after months of internal and external troubles.Kim said opposite views and conflicts are natural in human society, addressing the importance of cooperation and dialogue.“Most importantly, we need to regain trust within our community first, settling conflicts through dialogue and democratic procedures,” Kim added.By Bak Se-hwan","largest gender wage gap ,korea women earn less ,south korea women earn ,the largest gender wage ,korea women earn","['South Korea', 'confucian', 'Korea', 'Kim Hei - sook', 'Ewha Womans University']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84341174  0.17622788

Seoul saw its residents decline 1 percent to 9.8 million last year, while people in Gyeonggi Province rose 1.5 percent to 12.67 million. Busan, the country's second-largest city on the southeastern coast, was home to 6.7 percent of the population, or 3.44 million people.The study showed that South Korea is aging at a rapid pace as people aged over 65 years rose 3.1 percent to 6.78 million last year, making up 13.6 percent of all its citizens.It is the first time that the number of seniors surpassed that of the youth aged zero to 14, which amounted to 6.77 in 2016.As a result, South Korea's aged-child ratio, referring to the percentage of those over 65 to children between 0 and 14, soared to 100.1 in 2016, up from 95.1 tallied a year ago.The agency said the surge is attributable to the country's fast aging population coupled with a low birthrate, which fell to a seven-year low in 2016.There were a total of 19.84 million households in the country last year, with an average of 2.51 members. One-member households were the main family type in 2016, accounting for 27.9 percent, while the typical four-member families took up 18.3 percent.Nearly half of South Korean families reside in apartments, with 9.4 million households, followed by 34.3 percent living in detached houses.","2016 census south korea ,census showed thursday total ,last year but senior ,27 million people lived ,national census showed thursday","[""South Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'Statistics Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64678913  0.68597239

The number of students attending kindergartens declined 1.4 percent. However, the number of elementary school students rose 0.1 percent, growing by 1,384 students.

That accounted for 1.9 percent of all students here.In elementary school alone, the number of multicultural students went up by 11.8 percent to hit 82,733, which the ministry attributed to an increased number of international marriages. In line with an overall drop in the number of students, the average number of students per class fell to 22.3 for elementary schools, 26.4 for middle schools and 28.2 for high schools. The number of students per teacher went down to 14.5 for elementary schools, 12.7 for middle schools and 12.4 for high schools. Despite the fall in the number of students, the number of teachers at kindergartens and elementary schools rose 1.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively, while the number of teachers fell 0.4 percent in middle schools and 0.5 percent in high schools.

It was calculated based on a budget in 2003, when South and North Korea held reunions three times, the most so far. This file photo, taken on Oct. 26, 2015, shows South and North Koreans bidding a tearful farewell after reunions for separated families. An estimated 131,200 dispersed family members are on a waiting list for state-arranged reunion events, of which about 54 percent died as of end-June, according to data by the ministry and the Korean Red Cross.With President Moon Jae-in putting top priority on resolving the issue, Seoul proposed in July to hold talks to discuss family reunions. But Pyongyang has kept mum toward the offer.Meanwhile, the ministry has proposed increasing the budget for inter-Korean economic cooperation 78.5 percent to 248 billion won next year.The rise reflects costs needed to cover President Moon's vision to build new economic belts with North Korea.The vision includes the re-connection of railways between the two Koreas and a project to lay pipelines in North Korea to transport Russian natural gas to South Korea.Next year's budget proposal allocated for the Ministry of Unification stands at 1.27 trillion won, up 5.5 percent from 2017, the ministry said.Some 1 trillion won was set aside for the state inter-Korean cooperation fund, up 8.7 percent from this year.The government's 2018 budget proposal of 429 trillion won is subject to the National Assembly's approval.","double the budget allotted ,billion won 10 million ,almost double the budget ,korean war next year ,double the budget",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85584468  0.3283371

The Japanese daily based its report on a lecture given last year by the North’s State Security Ministry in South Pyongan Province, which addressed rampant drug use across the nation. The minutes showed that a “well-connected person” belonging to North Korea’s elite circle is behind the spread of the illegal drug, Mainichi Shimbun reported. As controls have tightened in the border region, the black market for drugs has relocated to major cities in the North.Narcotics have reportedly been referred to as “modern flu medication” or “healer of the 21st century” by North Korean drug users in urban areas.

A total of 52 poultry farms in South Korea were found to have used insecticides not permitted for poultry farming, including fipronil, in a nationwide examination conducted between Aug. 15 -18. All eggs produced from July 1, estimated to be over 42 million, are subject to recall to be discarded. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on Tuesday, the 52 farms, currently suspended for illegal pesticide use, will be allowed to resume egg production once they pass tests. Normally re-inspection takes place in about six months’ time, but the authorities plan to conduct it sooner. President Moon Jae-in on Monday apologized for the tainted egg scandal and vowed to enhance food safety and the livestock farming environment.He called for a thorough examination of the entire livestock industry safety control system and ordered staff to promptly craft measures that can be trusted by citizens.","south korean egg scandal ,korean egg scandal only ,of 52 poultry farms ,korean egg scandal ,10 percent of eggs",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11912768  0.58017099

Some 50 years on, the country faces the opposite problem, with one of the lowest fertility rates in the world and a graying population posing a threat to Asia’s fourth-largest economy. There is inherent uncertainty in population projections based on assumptions about plausible future trends. However, the way things look now, one thing appears to be clear: South Korea’s population will see fewer newborns, more elderly and foreigners in 2030. And the demographic shift will have a substantial impact on many aspects of Korean society including families, politics, job prospects, education, the welfare system and even military conscription. According to Statistics Korea, the size of the country’s population will peak in 2031 at 52.96 million and fall to 51.05 million in 2045. Behind the dwindling population is the country’s chronically low birthrate. It stood at 1.17 last year, meaning a Korean woman on average has only 1.17 babies over her lifetime, among the lowest in the world. An estimate of about 397,000 babies will be born by the end of this year in the country, the lowest number ever recorded. It will mark the first time the number of births in a year has fallen below 400,000.Coupled with the low birth rate, the economically active population, made up of those aged between 15 and 64, started to fall for the first time this year, after peaking at 37.6 million last year, a trend called “a demographic cliff.” In 2050, the number is expected to drop to 25.9 million. While there are fewer people of working age, the population of those aged 65 years or older is projected to rise from 6.54 million in 2015 to 18.1 million in 2050. The country is forecast to become a super-aged society in 2026, with the elderly making up more than 20 percent of its 50 million population. Kim Jong-hoon, who leads a team that looks at the nation’s low birth rate and aging population at the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, said that the low birth rate and aging population are likely here to stay. “The aging population is a trend to continue in the long term because people are living longer thanks to improved access to medical services and a healthy way of living. Policy cannot put a stop to it,” he told The Korea Herald. “But as for the low birth rate, it could fluctuate. It remains to be seen whether policies ranging from promoting marriage to improving child care services will be effective in raising the birth rate.” If the demographic shift continues, it will also reshape the country’s labor market, another expert said. “There will be a far smaller percentage of the young in the labor market and in 2030. More elderly will enter the labor force, and they will stay economically active,” said Seong Jae-min, director at the center for labor trend analysis at the Korea Labor Institute. “As there are fewer job seekers in the labor market, unemployment among the young and women will likely improve on the conditions that the gaps in working conditions and pay between small and medium-sized companies and large firms become narrower,” he said. “When it comes to income, there is a possibility of widening inequality, as jobs in the manufacturing sector -- which are mostly middle-income jobs -- are expected to disappear due to automation.” Experts fear that the low birth rate could lead to a reduction in the workforce and consumption as well as a jump in welfare costs for the increasing elderly population, which could hurt the potential for economic growth.Korea is estimated to spend an additional 2.8 trillion won  per year between 2016 and 2065 due to its rapidly aging population and low birth rate, according to a report published by the Bank of Korea. The number of retirees to support per 100 people aged 15-64 is estimated to soar more than fivefold from 19.6 in 2015 to 71.5 in 2050, meaning a heavier fiscal burden for the working age population. The South Korean government has spent about 100 trillion won trying to boost the country’s birth rate over the past decade, handing out baby allowances and improving paternity leave systems. But these efforts do not seem to borne fruit. “More time is needed to evaluate the past demographic policies that have failed,” Kim said. Given such concerns, the Moon Jae-in administration has put priority on creating jobs, preparing the country for the “fourth industrial revolution” and tackling the demographic cliff. As part of efforts to alleviate the negative impact from the demographic change, there are growing calls to accept more immigrants, especially skilled workers. ""To solve a demographic problem, accepting immigrants is not a perfect solution. But it could be a complementary policy,” said Chung Ki-seon, director at IOM Migration Research & Training Center. “Even when we had an abundant working-age population, we needed migrant workers. As the size of population starts to dwindle, there will be a higher demand for a foreign workforce,"" she said. “Accepting migrant workers could temporarily lower the average age of the economically active population.” Korea will need to take in 605,000 more immigrants by 2020 and 4.27 million more foreign workers by 2030 to achieve sustained growth, according to a 2014 report by the Korea Economic Institute. But questions remain over whether the population should be maintained at the same level as now. Is it impossible to lead a happy, downsized life when the country has a smaller population?Cho Young-tae, scholar in demographic studies, said it is possible in his best-selling book, “Determined Future.” “It is time to prepare the country for the downsizing,” Cho said. “Korea should prepare its own institutions, culture and awareness to be in line with its downsized scale.” “The trend of low birth rate has continued since 2002, with newborns hovering around 400,000,” he said, calling it a “gradual, stable change.” “If we prepare for the downsizing for the next 10 years, the 20-to 30-year period after that will lay the groundwork for new development based on stable size of economically active population.” By Ock Hyun-ju","faced with severe famine ,1953 korean war south ,1950 1953 korean war ,severe famine and struggling ,with severe famine",['South Korea ’s'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30215621  0.31184921

This is still beyond the 25 micrograms that the WHO sees as an acceptable level of PM 2.5. Last year, under the existing scale, South Korea had 15 “bad” air days based on the existing PM 2.5 standards, but the new standard would increase that to 44 days. The changes, if they are implemented, will also increase the number of issuances of fine dust advisories and warnings. On Tuesday, Seoul’s average PM 2.5 concentration was 37 micrograms per cubic meter, which would be classified a “normal” day under current standards, but “bad” according to the new one. The ministry said it will complete discussions on the new standards for introduction as early as next year. By Kim Da-sol","korea to toughen ,toughen air pollution measurement ,korea is moving to ,korea to toughen air ,korea air quality map","['South Korea', ""the Air Visual 's"", 'Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62483555  0.76455212

Commission officials said they would make a recommendation only, with the government making the final decision, while the government said the commission has the final say on the matter.On Thursday, the commission met to determine its role.""We have clearly confirmed that the commission is not an organization that will decide whether or not to halt the construction of Reactor 5 and 6, but it is an advisory organ delivering the results of public opinion to the government in the form of a recommendation,"" the commission said after the meeting.The proposal to scrap the reactors' construction sparked heated debates in a country that relies on nuclear reactors for about one-third of its electricity. Proponents say the country should phase out nuclear power for safety and environmental reasons, but opponents say it will lead to a shortage in the power supply and a spike in electricity bills.The commission plans to conduct an initial opinion poll on about 20,000 people and select 500 of the respondents as a jury that will be provided with more information on the issue and participate in debates and hearings.","reactors in south korea ,commission on nuclear reactors ,korea dependence on nuclear ,nuclear reactors to play ,nuclear energy the government","['South Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Moon Jae - in']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47205254  0.42656425

The number of outbound South Koreans totaled over 12.62 million during the same months. The last time that the gap neared twofold was in 2007. The imbalance apparently is largely attributed to the sharp drop in the number of Chinese visitors. Their number fell 41 percent, from 3.81 million to 2.25 million, during the cited months. The dive resulted from a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing over South Korea's decision to host a U.S. missile defense system on its soil. Beijing insists that the system, intended as a deterrence against North Korea's missile threats, can also pick up sensitive missile movements in China.Tally from March, when Beijing restricted group travel to Korea and imposed trade limits, to June showed that the number of Chinese visitors had dropped 60 percent.The gap was replaced somewhat by travelers from Taiwan, whose number increased 14 percent for the biggest increase among foreign visitors. They have become the third-largest group of foreign tourists to Korea so far this year, edging out the United States.The volume of Japanese travelers increased 6.48 percent, and Hong Kong 5.37 percent. The number of people coming from Thailand gained 4.13 percent. For U.S. visitors, the increase stood at 0.67 percent.The KTO projected that the number of inbound travelers could drop up to 27.2 percent, or 4.69 million people, this year from China's retaliation and geopolitical factors, including threats from North Korea.The number of visitors to Korea last year had leaped 30.3 percent from the year before to set a new record.","outbound south koreans totaled ,korea down 16 percent ,korea nearly doubled the ,south koreans totaled over ,chinese visitors heavy drop","['chinese', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', 'South Korea', 'KTO', 'South Koreans']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51810133  0.74738407

In comparison, only 19.8 percent said having North Koreans compete here will have a negative impact on PyeongChang 2018. In this file photo taken on Feb. 13, 2010, North Korean athletes parade during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics at BC Place in Vancouver. Those who saw North Korean participation as being positive said the occasion could help provide a breakthrough for inter-Korean relations, and that it also corresponds with the Olympic spirit while generating much interest in the Olympics both at home and abroad.South Korean President Moon Jae-in has invited North Korea to take part in the PyeongChang Games, saying the doors will be kept open until the very last minute. PyeongChang organizers have said any peace-loving country, including North Korea, has a duty to compete in the Olympic Games.Moon has also asked International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach for support to ensure North Korea's participation. Bach has said the IOC has already extended its invitation to North Korea and that it's supporting North Korean athletes to meet the qualifying standards.While North Korean athletes have yet to qualify for the Olympics -- the country has one last shot at pairs figure skating-- the IOC could grant the country some wild card entries.North Korea competed in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics but didn't have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.As for the South Koreans' expectations for PyeongChang, 63.8 percent said they believed the Olympics will be a success, up from 62.9 percent in May and 55.1 percent in March.On the other hand, 35.1 percent said they were interested in the PyeongChang Games, down from 40.3 percent in May. Also, 41.1 percent of the polled said they were looking forward to the 2018 Winter Olympics, compared to 44 percent two months ago.","2018 pyeongchang winter olympics ,half of koreans positive ,pyeongchang winter olympics survey ,olympics survey showed monday ,games thousand south koreans","['South Koreans', ""North Korea 's"", 'PyeongChang', 'Metrix', 'South Koreans', ""North Korea 's"", 'PyeongChang']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42459655  0.79736978

The number of surveys more than tripled from 1,142 in 2013. KCDC Director Jung Ki-suck gives a briefing on the recent outbreak of tuberculosis on Wednesday at the government complex in Seoul. This year, from January to June, health authorities carried out 1,791 such surveys. By type of facilities investigated, 288 were schools, 590 were medical institutions, 54 were military or police units, 302 were correctional or social welfare facilities, 491 were companies and 66 were other organizations. Forty-one people were confirmed with TB from the examinations, while 4,408 others were found to have acquired inactive TB -- a condition in which the TB bacteria is in the body but inactive with no symptoms -- via exposure to 58,758 TB patients from group facilities.TB is a bacteria-related disease that mainly attacks the lungs and is one of the world’s most infectious killers, along with HIV and malaria.South Korea had the highest TB prevalence rate among 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2015, with 63 patients per 100,000 people. Portugal ranked second with 25 patients, followed by Poland with 21.According to doctors, only about 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB at some time in their lives, usually between age 15 and 40. In March, the government implemented free wide-scale TB testing as part of efforts to cut the high incidence rate.Some 600,000 high school freshmen, teachers and other school employees were tested in the following month, according to the Health Ministry.Meanwhile, on Wednesday health authorities said 118 newborns were infected with inactive TB at an obstetrics clinic in Seoul from a nurse with TB who started working at the clinic in November last year. By Kim Da-sol","tuberculosis outbreaks at mass ,government conducted 502 epidemiological ,tripled in south korea ,2016 for possible tb ,tb outbreaks at schools","['South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29135978  0.27776009

Bank of Korea South Korea could cross the threshold into a super-aged society around 2026, when more than 20 percent of the people will be over 65, she said.But if the two countries are counted as one, the overall demographics will change, delaying the general aging of the population. Under this scenario the Korean Peninsula would become an aged society and a super-aged society in 2021 and 2031, respectively, if the population merged in 2020, Choi said.The researcher said the delay would be attributable to North Korea's relative high total fertility rate and high ratio of people aged under 14. North Korea's total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- stood at 1.94 in 2015, compared to just 1.24 in South Korea. The total fertility rate of the two Koreas is still below the replacement level of 2.1 that would keep their populations stable.""The population integration of the two Koreas may alleviate the burden of population aging of South Korea. This positive impact, however, may be gradually reduced if the North's fertility rate sharply drops and life expectancy converges to the level of the South,"" Choi said. ""On the other hand, the level of population aging may be controlled if the fertility rate of the North rises going forward,"" the BOK analysts said. Despite such a prediction, the likelihood of some sort of merger of population is slim since South and North Korea remain technically in a state of war as the bloody 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a formal peace treaty.","population aging south korea ,five years an economist ,aging south korea potential ,koreas likely to delay ,aging south korea","[""South Korea 's"", 'North Korea', 'Choi Ji - young', 'the Bank of Korea', 'South Korea', 'Bank of Korea', 'Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.81926709  0.51021343

When I asked my boss to raise the wage, the boss has refused it,” Islum told The Korea Herald. “The legal minimum wage hike will allow me to take home more money.”Islum said that he does a very “difficult” job at a stone processing factory, spending some 11 hours a day at work and taking only Sundays off because the current wage is just “too low.”Migrant workers and their advocates call for better protection of migrants' human rights at a press conference held in August, 2016. Next year’s minimum wage has been set at 7,530 won  per hour, up 16.4 percent from this year, in step with President Moon Jae-in‘s drive to achieve an hourly minimum wage of 10,000 by 2020. Under the Labor Standard Act, all workers, regardless of their race, nationality and gender, are subject to the minimum wage. As of May 2016, there are some 962,000 foreign workers in Korea. Among them, 48.7 percent are paid between 1 million won and 2 million won per month, and are to be affected by the minimum wage hike. Nearly 280,000 foreign workers are hired at factories, farms and orchards in the country under the Employment Permit System as of 2016. The EPS was put into force in 2004 to fill low-skilled positions facing short local supply with migrant workers from 13 countries in southeast and central Asia. “It is not a dramatic raise, but many migrant workers expect that they can get more money for the same job they do,” Shekh al-Mamun, a Bangladeshi official from Korea’s first migrant workers’ union. “The minimum wage raise is not a disadvantage for employers too, because migrant workers will have higher productivity.”“But my concern is that it won’t be strictly enforced in reality as many workers are already being underpaid amid a lack of monitoring by the government,” he said. While migrant workers largely welcomed the wage raise, their employers -- mostly small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as farms -- have voiced concerns that the hike will take a toll on their businesses. “It is impossible for me to hire Koreans for the wage we pay foreign workers. I cannot run a business without foreign workers,” said a vegetable farmer, who owns 33,100-square-meter field in Goyang, Gyeonggi Provicne. He employs three foreign workers. Foreign workers pick tomatoes at a farm. “There will be many farmers who give up farming if the minimum wage increases at such a fast pace. It eventually poses a threat to the nation’s food security,” he said. “I think that the minimum wage should be set lower for foreigners than for Koreans.”The wage increase will additionally cost 1.75 trillion won for small and medium-sized enterprises that hire foreign workers, the Korea Federation of SMEs said Tuesday. The figure is based on the calculation that some 280,000 foreign workers, who are on the EPS, work an average 209 hours per month and their monthly wage will increase by 332,891 won. “The minimum wage hike means that it would put more financial burden on SMEs ,” said Chung Wook-jo, an official in charge of personnel policy at the Korea Federation of SMEs. Employers, especially SMEs, have claimed the minimum wage could lead to soaring production costs and possible job losses. Workers, on the other hand, had called for a drastic hike to curb the nation’s income inequality and improve living conditions for low-income workers.The government on Sunday said that it will spend some 3 trillion won to help smaller businesses offset an increase in labor costs, after the next year’s minimum hourly wage was raised by the biggest margin since 2000.“The SMEs complain that expenses for accommodation and meals provided by employers are not included in the minimum wage,” said Noh Mean-sun, researcher at Korea Small Business Institute. “It is necessary to discuss the scope for the minimum wage.”In terms of foreign workers’ job security, an expert said that they will not lose their jobs due to the wage raise. “There are yet no Koreans who are likely to replace foreign workers working under such  conditions for such low pay,” said Oh Sang-bong, a research at the Korea Labor Institute. ”It is rather those on F-4 visa in the service sector who could possibly be replaced by locals.“The F-visa holders, together with H-2 Visa holders, who are ethnic Koreans holding foreign nationalities, make up the biggest groups of foreign workers in Korea, standing at 630,500.

It was the biggest gain since 2000, when the bar was moved up by 16.6 percent. This year’s minimum wage was 6,470 won per hour, up 7 percent from a year ago.Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon  speaks during a meeting of senior government and ruling-party policymakers at the National Assembly building in Seoul on Sunday. “The decision will benefit many workers, but it could also put a heavy burden on small business owners,” said Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon during a meeting with economy-related ministers held on Sunday morning. The hike is seen as the first big step toward realizing President Moon Jae-in’s vision of 10,000 won by 2020. The liberal Moon administration is pushing for “income-led growth,” stressing that an increase in household income will create a virtuous economic cycle of stronger domestic consumption, higher corporate profits and more jobs. To realize this, Moon has vowed efforts for a higher minimum wage and a reduction in average working hours. Employers, particularly small- and medium-sized business owners, have been calling for caution, fearing a sharp rise in labor costs could put them out of business. Saturday’s decision to increase the wage by 16.4 percent is projected to directly affect at least 4.63 million workers, or 23 percent of all workers, according to Statistics Korea. If a minimum-wage earner works eight hours a day, he or she will be able to receive 60,240 won a day and 1.57 million won a month under the new guideline in 2018. “The suggestions made by both sides  reflected the government’s will to push for a minimum wage for 10,000 won ,” said Uh Soo-bong, professor at Korea University of Technology and Education, who chairs the commission. To devise detailed support plans for SMEs, the government will form a task force, the ministers decided in the meeting. Among the plans currently under consideration is subsidizing companies that meet certain criteria for the increase in labor costs exceeding 7.4 percent, which is the five-year average increase rate in minimum wage. The government will also consider a reduction in commission fees charged by credit card companies and a slashing in value added taxes – all for small businesses, Vice Finance Minister Ko Hyoung-kwon revealed. Earlier in the day, employers and major corporate lobbies voiced concerns over the drastic hike.The Korea Employers Federation said the hike would take a toll on smaller businesses and deteriorate the business conditions for employers.The Korea Federation of SMEs also claimed the small- and medium-sized enterprises will be crippled by the higher cost of labor.By Kim Da-sol","korean government on sunday ,some trillion won billion ,panel hiked next year ,saturday the minimum wage ,biggest margin since 2000","['south korean', 'the Minimum Wage Commission']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65413529  0.47684374

North Korea has conducted five underground nuclear tests since 2006, and carried out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile last week. Experts believe it is only a matter of time before the North develops an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to the US mainland.The report also noted increased thermal activity at the uranium enrichment facility in Yongbyon.""It is unclear if this was the result of centrifuge operations or maintenance operations,"" it said. ""Centrifuge operations would increase the North's enriched uranium inventory; however, based on imagery alone, it is not possible to conclude whether the plant is producing low or highly enriched uranium.""Pyongyang is thought to have used plutonium for its nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009, but some analysts say it could have used highly enriched uranium for the fifth test in September.If confirmed, the development would mark an advance in the North's nuclear weapons program because uranium enrichment is harder to detect than plutonium enrichment. Uranium can also be enriched continually while plutonium stocks are limited.","korea likely hikes plutonium ,additional plutonium for nuclear ,nuclear weapons since september ,hikes plutonium production for ,june the radiochemical la","['WASHINGTON', 'North Korea', 'Friday.38 North', 'US', 'North Korea', 'Yongbyon']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80151033  0.59205788

In particular, 59 percent of the farmland in Jangpung County in North Hwanghae Province was ruined by drought, the broadcaster said, adding that rice paddies suffered more damage than corn fields. ""We plan to request a UN emergency fund as the nutritional conditions of children, pregnant women and lactating mothers in the Hwanghae provinces and Nampo City in North Pyongyan Province can be more vulnerable due to drought,"" the investigation team was cited as saying.

The number of passengers on Chinese routes fell 46 percent on-year to 949,665 last month, while that of passengers on Japanese and Southeast Asian routes jumped 44 percent and 21 percent to 1.43 million and 2.23 million, respectively, the statement said.

Seoul and Washington have argued THAAD is purely aimed at countering missile threats from North Korea. But Beijing has opposed the system, arguing it could be used against it. The ministry expected travel demand on Chinese routes will continue to remain weak, but the overall air traffic will continue to rise backed by increasing demand on other Asian routes.

Cho, however, made clear that the decision does not mean a change of stance regarding the future of elite schools, which fuel excessive competition here by serving as gateways to prestigious universities at home and abroad. He stressed the schools’ status extension was based on existing rules, which he said should be observed until they are revised. “We still believe the current system has departed from its initial purpose of creating diversity and autonomy in education,” Cho added, urging the government to revise rules to promote equality in education. Seoul is home to nearly 40 percent of the nation’s 77 elite private schools, which hold the status of either special-purpose or autonomous high schools. The five schools that were reassessed had received poor grades in an evaluation in 2015, becoming subject to re-examination this year. Seoul’s decision was closely watched by the provinces where reassessment of the elite schools is also pending. Since liberal President Moon Jae-in -- a critic of elitism in education -- took office, liberal education chiefs in Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and other areas have been voicing their intention to rescind the autonomy of such premium schools in curriculum and admissions.By Bak Se-hwan","seoul allows five elite ,allows five elite schools ,five premium high schools ,seoul allows five ,five elite schools to","['the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'Seoul ’s Education Superintendent Cho Hee - yeon']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41499054  0.80972165

As the air and sea temperatures rise, pollack, cod and other staple fish are on the verge of extinction, while mackerel, anchovy and squid are becoming ubiquitous and cheaper. Apple orchards are being replaced by tangerine, banana and kiwi farms. Summer birds like white and night herons are spotted all year round. Double rice harvest, which was once possible on the southernmost island of Jeju only, is spreading to upper regions. The average temperature of the peninsula has risen 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past 100 years, nearly twice that of the overall planet. The sea surface temperature, too, has shot up 1.11 degrees Celsius between 1968 and 2015, more than 2.5 times the global average, according to the National Institute of Fisheries Science.  On May 3, the mercury hit 30.2 in Seoul, the highest level for the day in 85 years. An early heat wave has continued for more than 10 days, with Daegu City’s Dalseong County reaching 37.2 on June 18. Citizens of Daegu and Gwangju now call their respective hometowns by the nicknames “Daefrica” and “Gwangfrica” in a reference to Africa. At this speed, almost the entire peninsula would turn to a subtropical climate in 2070, the Korea Meteorological Administration estimates.The rapid warming is giving birth to flora and fauna that favor a warmer environment while scaring away the species that have long thrived in the peninsula’s diverse climate running through four seasons. Among the hardest hit was Alaskan pollack, or “myeongtae,” one of Korea’s favorite delicacies in wintertime. Its nationwide catch went from more than 165,000 tons in 1981 to less than 10,000 tons in 1993 then to near zero in 2008. Currently around 90 percent of pollack consumed in Korea is imported from Japan or Russia. The crunch prompted the government to funnel 24.8 billion won  into a recovery project since 2014, setting a 500,000 won reward on a living adult pollack. Pollack is not alone in vanishing from dinner tables. The yearly haul of filefish hovers around 2,000 tons now, a mere 6.1 percent of what was caught 30 years ago. Cod faces a similar fate. The shifting biome may result in a 20 percent fall in fisheries production in the country’s near sea by 2050, causing financial losses of up to 4 trillion won each year, the Korea Maritime Institute projects. Meanwhile, concerns are growing over higher dangers of floods, typhoons and other natural disasters due to the stretched-out summer and increasing rainfall. The peninsula’s annual precipitation has increased by more 200 millimeters and the summer by up to 17 days depending on the region over the last three decades, according to the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences. Last year, North Korea suffered from what state media called its worst flood disaster since World War II, which the UN said left at least 528 killed or missing and another 107,000 homeless. The warming climate is also creating breeding grounds for diseases and insect pests, as well as alien species that disrupt the ecosystem. Data by the Rural Development Administration shows that the areas affected by California red scale, planthoppers and other such species have expanded more than five-fold from about 4,100 hectares in 2013 to almost 22,000 hectares in 2016.The phenomenon is changing not only Koreans’ dinner tables, wardrobes and lifestyle, but also the industry dynamics. While fashion houses reduce down parkas and between-seasons clothes like trench coats in their product line-ups, home electronics makers boost production of air conditioners, dehumidifiers and air purifiers. To cope with the sweeping impact, the central and local governments have been carrying out various programs including a national carbon trading scheme. The nation aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent, or 315 million metric tons, by 2030 based on business-as-usual levels. It enacted an act on low carbon and green growth in 2010, introduced its voluntary reduction target during a UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015, and set specific reduction thresholds for energy-intensive sectors in the mid and long terms last December. Last week, President Moon Jae-in pledged to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with renewable resources as the country shuts down the Kori No. 1 reactor which reached the end of its 40-year lifespan, the first nuclear plant to be closed permanently here. Currently 25 reactors supply about a third of the country’s total electricity. The government deems a cap-and-trade system to be key to meeting the 2030 goal, which it says could expedite industry innovation and environmentally friendly investment while paving the way for a future integration into a global carbon market. Industry resistance persists, however, as well as policy fragmentation among related agencies that pursue different goals. The green growth vision, trumpeted by the former Lee Myung-bak administration, has been put on the back burner after his successor Park Geun-hye took office. Under Moon, the climate change policy has again been transferred to the Finance Ministry from the Environment Ministry, while the energy and land ministries taking over power generation and other supplementary areas. “I take a positive view of the transfer because the Finance Ministry has substantial say with its financial management functions and would be able to work more efficiently with other agencies,” said Kim Hye-jun, a senior fellow at the Korea Research Institute on Climate Change in Seoul. “Though the country is ahead of others in initiating the emissions trading system, it is virtually a sanction so there will need to be greater incentives such as for green cars, eco-friendly products and energy efficiency to encourage further public participation.” Song Ji-yoon, a researcher at the Korea Environment Institute’s Adaptation Center for Climate Change, stressed the need for the government to build climate change-related facilities. “In the long term, it could be imperative to secure infrastructure to help cope with climate change. For example, we may paint buildings with different colors to lower the temperature and develop road pavement technologies,” she told The Korea Herald. Choi Hyeon-jung, who works on climate change and sustainable development at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said the new government would have to set up a control tower to steer the policy amid conflicting interests among the involved agencies. “Even if the government has a comprehensive goal to improve sustainability, it would be impossible to implement the policy without tackling the systematic inertia and the barriers between the ministries that pursue their different own interests,” she said in a report released Friday. “As Moon has also pledged a related organizational overhaul, the policy should be set in motion through an integrated control tower and this must be institutionalized.” By Shin Hyon-hee","korea reeling from climate ,round double rice harvest ,climate change the korean ,squid are becoming ubiquitous ,year round double rice",['the Korean Peninsula'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79781383  0.53226787

According to the report titled “OECD Producer Incentives in Livestock Disease Management: Korea Case Study,” battery cage-facilities at poultry farms and stockbreeding farmhouses have made worse the bird flu damage and fast spread of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu in recent decades. Such facilities, made up of rows and columns of identical cages connected together like cells, can house millions of birds, but hens spend their entire lives in the cages with a floor space about the size of a sheet of A4 paper.Health authorities in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province quarantine a chicken farm on June 3, 2017, after a suspected case of avian influenza was reported. Since early this month, the government has been grappling with a fresh outbreak of bird flu and 185,000 chickens have been culled so far as part of containment measures.South Korea’s livestock industry has expanded rapidly since the 1990s. The proportion of the agriculture industry’s output accounted for by the livestock industry shot up from 23 percent in 1995 to 42 percent in 2015. Livestock diseases have continued to reoccur in battery cage-facilities, which were used at poultry farms here to expand stockbreeding farmhouses, the report said. The report also warned that the government lacks awareness and measures to strengthen farming facility management in the country. Governmental support in terms of direct compensation of small livestock holders related to livestock epidemics should be implemented, the report said.Although the bird flu virus has been a constant issue since last year, the South Korean government has not offered clear reasons for the worsening situation, blaming migratory birds instead. Experts and animal rights activists have been demanding that the authorities come up with regulatory improvements in Korea’s overall poultry farming systems and upgrade quarantine measures. Professor Kim Jae-hong of Seoul National University’s College of Veterinary Medicine said that “it would be strange if the virus does not spread in such a filthy environment. Damage  could have been minimized if there was an upgrade in farming systems that provides a healthy environment for poultry breeding, considering animal health and welfare.” Developed countries in Europe, where most stockbreeding farms have abandoned conventional battery cages for animal welfare reasons, have seen a low percentage of bird flu outbreaks.In 2012, the European Union Council banned the use of battery cages after scientists observed signs of extremely abnormal behaviors in caged hens. The number of eggs produced in battery cage-facilities in the EU has rapidly decreased since then.By Kim Da-sol","korea bird flu outbreaks ,aggravates korea bird flu ,farming aggravates korea bird ,korea bird flu ,the bird flu damage","['South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD Producer Incentives', 'Livestock Disease Management']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34546328  0.42951569

A weekly rally is under way in front of the Japanese Embassy, which is being renovated, in downtown Seoul on May 17, 2017, to demand Japan apologize for the sexual slavery of Korean women by the Japanese military during World War II. The court was dealing with a civilian suit filed by 12 South Korean victims of Japan's wartime sexual enslavement, who wanted the government to indemnify Japan for psychological and material damage incurred by the so-called comfort women deal.In a written response to the court, the government said, ""The comfort women deal does not override the victims' individual rights to claim indemnity,"" according to a source close to the plaintiffs.The deal had called for the two governments to put the issue to an end ""for good and irreversibly,"" with Japan paying 1 billion yen  to financially assist the victims.Still, the government said in the court response that the deal is a political agreement that is not legally binding, but it should still be abided by because it is a promise between states, according to the source.Then, the court again ordered the government to state what government steps would be taken to help the victims claim their indemnity, the source also said. The government is reportedly weighing whether or not it will uphold the controversial deal with Japan since liberal President Moon Jae-in took power last month.Moon has said most South Koreans do not approve of the deal, hinting at a possible renegotiation of the bilateral issue.In light of the uncertainty, the court delayed its ruling by one month to early July at the request of the government.","korea concludes sex slavery ,sex slavery victims still ,japanese government for compensation ,concludes sex slavery victims ,government for compensation seoul","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'south korean', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'Dece']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76951671 -0.1732281

All able-bodied South Korean male adults are obliged to serve in the armed forces for about two years.The budget proposal also includes an 11.6 percent hike on-year to 13.6 trillion won on spending for improving the military's firepower, in particular the early establishment of the Korea Air and Missile Defense  system and the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike program.If approved by the finance ministry and the National Assembly, the on-year budget increase would be higher than the average growth of around 5 percent during the previous conservative administrations of Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye.In 2005, the liberal Roh Moo-hyun government's defense budget expanded 11.4 percent from the previous year.

The sides will also upgrade the chief of the agency for veterans affairs to a minister level, while detaching the fire-fighting and maritime police departments from the Ministry of Public Safety and Security in favor of two separate organizations. The envisioned changes, which are on a smaller scale than expected, reflect President Moon Jae-in’s bid to stabilize administrative functions and curb confusion that may result from a monthslong political turmoil and last month’s snap election.Top officials from the ruling Democratic Party, government and presidential office Cheong Wa Dae hold a meeting on a government restructuring plan and extra budget proposal at the prime minister`s official residence in Seoul on June 5, 2017. “We concurred that it is desirable to minimize the scale of the reorganization, considering internal and external difficulties and to ensure stability in state affairs,” Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon, chief of the party’s policy committee, said as he announced the meeting results. “This overhaul is focused on creating jobs, revitalizing the economy, improving public safety, protecting the nature and ecosystem, and adjusting the standings of the related agencies in line with changes in our society.” Under the plan, the vice-ministerial Small and Medium Business Administration will be upgraded to a new ministry responsible for overseeing policy for SMEs and venture firms. The agency is also to take over some of the relevant affairs from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, and the Financial Services Commission, while handing down the SMBA’s policy-related functions to the ministries. The Office of the Minister for Trade will also be reinstated in about four years, yet this time within the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, instead of its previous home, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The decision beat widespread anticipations that the office would be transferred back to MOFA in line with Moon’s campaign pledge to boost trade diplomacy and the position of his policy planning advisory panel. His predecessor Park Geun-hye’s decision to relocate the organization to MOTIE has since been a source of controversy, with critics relaying concerns it would undercut Seoul’s negotiating power in sensitive trade deals especially with an administration like that of US President Donald Trump. Monday’s surprise move is intended to prop up MOTIE’s capabilities so as to better counter the “fast-evolving trade environment and spread of trade protectionism, Kim noted. To reinforce public safety and disaster prevention and response capacity, the fire service and the Coast Guard which are currently part of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security will be separated to reintroduce as independent agencies. The vice-ministerial Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs will be elevated to a ministerial level in a sign of the budding leadership to upgrade its standing and expand support for those who fought on the frontlines for the nation. With a rapid technological revolution under way, a new, comprehensive advisory panel on science and technology will be formed by incorporating two existing gatherings. A vice-ministerial bureau on science technology innovation is also planned to be installed within the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. “We should finalize the plans as soon as possible to help resolve pressing national issues,” Kim said, noting the party will introduce a related bill during this month’s session and requesting cooperation from opposition parties.

The UNSC passed Resolution 2321 after the isolationist regime detonated its fifth nuclear device in early September. Under the guidelines set by the international community, North Korea can only ship out 7.5 million tons of coal worth $408.7 million this year. All United Nation members states are obliged to report transactions undertaken with the North on a monthly basis.The committee said that in January, the North shipped out 1.44 million tons of coal, with numbers reaching 1.23 million tons and 6,300 tons in February and March, respectively. It said just one country, presumably China, imported coal from the North.North Korea's trade with China made up 90 percent of external transactions, with coal and iron ore making up 40 percent of goods traded between the two neighboring countries.As of April, the North coal shipments already reached 57 percent of its maximum export limit in terms of value for this year.","korean coal exports dropped ,korean coal exports drop ,coal exports dropped ,zero in april report ,give up its nuclear","['north korean', 'United Nations', 'the United Nations Security Council', 'Pyongyang']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53981775  0.60563439

""His last words were not 'Down with the Tyrant,' his last words were 'How am I supposed to live?'  "" the connection between climate crisis and political instability is an issue that has not yet received enough attention,"" he stressed.  Also behind the outbreak of the Syrian civil war were climate change-triggered food problems, Gore also said, highlighting that a climate-related drought from 2006-2010 destroyed 60 percent of all the farms in the country and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria.""When these climate refugees collided with another 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War in the cities of Syria, the social explosion happened,"" according to Gore.  Given the seriousness, ""it has been recognized by the military in my country as a national security issue for a long time,"" he said. ""If you have hundreds of millions of climate refugees what will that mean to self-government and the ability to maintain stability. ... These are some of the reasons why we have to act,"" he said.  Climate change is also causing pandemic diseases like the spread of Zika with warmer weather conditions giving advantage to germs, microbes and insects that carry viruses, he said. On the backdrop of the Zika outbreak, doctors in South and Central America are telling women there not to get pregnant for two years until the virus comes under control, according to him.""When we hear messages like this it should set off alarm bells, it should communicate to our heart not to our head that those of us who are alive today have obligations, a sacred duty to generations that come after us to prevent such conditions from becoming commonplace in the world that they inherit from us,"" Gore said.After retiring as vice president, Gore has been leading efforts to fight climate change for which he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.","climate crisis induced food ,arab revolutions in 2010 ,climate crisis behind political ,jeju island climate crisis ,climate crisis induced","['arab', 'United States', 'Al Gore', 'Gore', 'Bill Clinton']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41734943  0.5147292

The government has been pushing hard to get people to be less dependent on drugs because they can pose serious problems down the line. Excessive use of antibiotics can make it hard to treat people when they become sick since the bacteria can become immune to treatment.Despite the fall, a separate report showed that the country's antibiotic use was tallied at 31.5 defined daily dose per 1,000 people in 2015, meaning 31.5 out of 1,000 people were using antibiotics per day on average. The prescription of antibiotics, which stood at 26.9 DDD in 2008, reached 30 DDD in 2013 and peaked at 31.7 DDD the following year before a moderate dip in 2015. South Korea's antibiotic use has consistently ranked high in the OECD, which is a source of concern.South Korea and Italy topped the frequent drug use list with 31.5 DDD in 2015, trailed by Slovakia with 26.8 DDD, Luxemburg with 26.3 DDD and Israel with 24.9 DDD.Among OECD countries, Sweden and Estonia prescribed antibiotics the least, with 13.9 DDD and 14.1 DDD, respectively, which is less than half of South Korea's antibiotic use.","korea highest among oecd ,korea consumption of antibiotics ,greatly reduced government report ,down in korea highest ,government report showed thursday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51490384  0.54947662

People visiting China accounted for 15.1 percent of all outbound travelers in the cited period down from 32.6 percent the previous year, according to the latest data released by Mode Tour. The Seoul-based travel agency did not disclose details on the actual number of travelers. The data reflects dampened interest among South Koreans after Beijing implemented a string of measures against South Korean products and services in protest of the deployment of a US anti-missile system, or THAAD, on the Korean Peninsula. Since March 15, China has also banned its travel agencies from selling Korea-bound trips in an apparent act of sabotage. Related industries in both countries are pinning hopes on a thaw in relations after new South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10. At present there are no clear signs of change. The findings showed that while South Koreans cut back on trips to China they instead opted to visit Japan and Southeast Asia, with the growth for each region spiking 72 percent and 66 percent in the same period, respectively.

Moon Hee-sang of the ruling Democratic Party visited Japan as the new South Korean leader's messenger there.The president thanked the envoys for making themselves available on such short notice. And then he thanked them for accurately delivering his messages that needed to be said, especially those concerning thorny issues such as the deployment of the THAAD US missile defense system and a controversial deal with Japan over its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.Moon and his special envoy to Japan have told Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, that South Korean people could not accept the 2015 agreement over sexual slavery.Under the controversial deal, Tokyo agreed to provide 1 billion yen  in compensation to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of South Korean women forced into sexual servitude. The money is also intended for dozens of Korean victims who are still alive.The UN Committee against Torture has also acknowledged the compensation may not be enough to help and support the victims in a recently published report.""As well as the THAAD issue and the sexual slavery issue, I believe we have said what needed to be said,"" the president said.""I need to hold summit talks with the leaders of those countries, and so I believe  have been meaningful also in the sense of setting the agenda for the summit talks,"" he added.The South Korean leader came into office on May 10, only one day after a rare presidential by-election caused by the removal of the former president over corruption allegations.Moon has already agreed to hold a bilateral summit with his US counterpart in Washington in late June.He is also expected to hold summit talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Japanese prime minister.All four leaders, including Trump, are also set to attend the G20 summit scheduled to be held in Hamburg, Germany on July 7-8.","hiatus south korean president ,monthslong diplomatic hiatus also ,diplomatic hiatus south korean ,monthslong diplomatic hiatus ,called monthslong diplomatic hiatus","['south korean', 'Moon Jae - in', 'US', 'Japan', 'China', 'Park Geun - hye']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44511697  0.52099162

Inbound tourists numbered 1.23 million last month, compared to 1.38 million tallied the previous year, according to the Korea Tourism Organization.  The tally of Chinese visitors plunged 40 percent on-year to 360,782 from 601.671, followed by a 24-percent on-year fall from Hong Kong and a 14.8-percent decline from India, the KTO said. As widely expected, the Chinese vacuum dragged down the overall tourist tally for the cited month, which came as Beijing imposed a ban on the sale of tours to South Korea starting March 15 in apparent retaliation for Seoul's planned installation of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.The cumulative tourist tally of Asia's fourth-largest economy stood at 3.7 million in the first three months of this year, up 3.2 percent from the same time in 2016. However, the on-year figure for Chinese tourists shrank 9.2 percent to 1.51 million in that period. The gain from Japan and Southeast Asian countries helped cushion the Chinese decline, which posted moderate double-digit growth on average from a year ago, except for a slight fall from the Philippines, the agency said. Tourists from Taiwan also soared nearly 30 percent in March from the previous year on the back of a government and industry-led drive for incentive tours and promotional campaigns, it added. As for the outbound tourists, the number rose 23.7 percent on-year to 1.94 million in March, on firm demand for overseas travels, according to the KTO.","korea sank 11 percent ,tourists numbered 23 million ,23 million last month ,drop in chinese visitors ,sank 11 percent last","['South Korea', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'the Korea Tourism Organization', 'chinese']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68603361  0.9409346

The survey conducted by the Gyeonggi Research Institute on 1,004 smartphone users showed that 82.4 percent said they cannot do everyday tasks and often feel anxiety if separated from their mobile devices.According to the study, over 1 in 2 respondents said their amount of personal leisure time had gone down  and their sleeping hours had been reduced  due to daily smartphone use.But 67.7 percent said their quality of life had improved and 54.2 percent said work efficiency had increased with their mobile devices.Although there were both negative and positive feedback based on the pattern of using smartphones, about half the respondents had experienced smartphone addiction, according to the research. Some 54 percent regarded themselves as too dependent on their mobile devices, while 91 percent saw others as smartphone addicts. Almost 87 percent said they should reduce the amount of time they spend using their smartphone, noting the risks of addictive behavior.Experts say those considered at risk of addiction experience withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally if they do not have access to their device.Oh Jae-ho, a researcher who participated in the survey, said, “Addiction-prone smartphone users will have difficulty voluntarily restricting themselves from using mobile devices.”The report suggested the government should create policies to deal with the issue, such as providing education programs at schools and issuing counseling guidelines for high-risk users.Last year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started to put up signs along the streets and on pavements at five locations to warn citizens of the dangers of being occupied with smartphones on streets.According to the Korea Transportation Safety Authority, the number of traffic accidents arising from the use of smartphones more than doubled from 437 cases in 2009 to 1,111 cases in 2014.Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health and Welfare released a report that addiction to smartphones has reached “serious” levels, especially among young South Korean women, with single people more susceptible to experiencing problems.By Kim Da-sol","problem of smartphone addiction ,80 percent of smartphone ,high smartphone penetration rate ,percent of smartphone users ,korea high smartphone penetration","['South Korea ’s', 'the Gyeonggi Research Institute']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66107625  0.41366774

The share of women in senior government posts above grade 4 had risen from 9.3 percent in 2012 to 13.5 percent last year. The nation's civil service system is comprised of nine grades, with grade 9 the lowest and grade 1 the highest.In addition, the government will push up the ratio of women in various central government committees to 40 percent. Five years ago, the corresponding ratio stood at 25.7 percent.The ministry said female members at 442 committees established under 42 central government agencies accounted for 37.8 percent as of the end of last year, though the current law stipulates a ratio of over 40 percent.The portion of women in school deputy principals and principals will also be raised to 38 percent this year, compared with 24.6 percent five years ago, it said.The ministry, which has striven to increase higher-level women in the government, will report these plans to the weekly Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.Thanks to such efforts, the ratio of female managers at public institutions had risen from 11.5 percent in 2012 to 17.2 percent last year and is expected to reach 18.8 percent this year, ministry officials said.In the military and police, too, women are expanding their presence. The share of female officers in the military rose from 5.8 percent to 7.1 percent in the 2012-2016 period, with the corresponding ratio of the police topping 10 percent.The ministry said South Korea still lags far behind other advanced countries in terms of women's representation in public sector leadership positions. According to a survey by British weekly Economist, the ratio of female managers in South Korea's public and private sectors stood at 10.5 percent last year, compared with the average of 37.1 percent among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.","korea to expand women ,gradually increase women representation ,increase women representation in ,increase women representation ,korea to expand","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.95128828  0.03703797

A lack of jobs has been cited as one reason why many South Koreans are not getting married, which is hurting birth rates.Childbirth in South Korea dropped to a record low last year by reaching 406,300, down 7.3 percent or 32,100 births from a year earlier, according to a report by Statistics Korea. The figure marked the lowest number of newborns since 1970 when the statistics agency started compiling such data.Also, the number of people getting married fell to the lowest level in more than 40 years in 2016 by reaching 281,600, down 7 percent from a year earlier, the agency said. In 1974, the number of couples tying the knot reached 259,100.The ministry added that part of the budget will be spent on providing subsidies for infertility treatments for couples in low income brackets.The ministry forecasts about 407,000 infants to be born this year, with the country's fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, dropping to 1.2.To tackle the issue of ""aged society,"" defined as when more than 14 percent of the population are 65 or older, the government will spend money on creating more jobs for seniors.  Government officials and private sector experts have warned that the aging population, coupled with the low birthrate, could pose a serious threat to the nation's economy as it could lead to fewer workers and increased spending on health and welfare in the long run.","trillion won 33 billion ,asia fourth largest economy ,spend 38 trillion won ,largest economy by reducing ,hurt asia fourth largest","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Welfare and Health']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42586604  0.40742248

The South Korea tourism and hospitality sectors have been hit by the dearth in Chinese travelers triggered by the apparent retaliation by Beijing against the planned deployment of a US anti-missile system, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, on the Korean Peninsula. Since March 15, Beijing has banned the selling of Korea-bound travel packages, which is hurting the local tourism sector. As of April 9, the number of Chinese visitors has tumbled 63.6 percent from the previous year, according to the Korea Tourism Organization. In the cited period, the number of Japanese tourists rose 18.5 percent, with the figure of Southeast Asians jumping 11.6 percent.To stave off the damage, the KTO and related industries have joined forces to devise unique tour services targeting non-Chinese travelers. The KTO and the provincial government of Gangwon Province hosted a weeklong spring fest tailored to Thai visitors this week, during which some 500 tourists ironically enjoyed sleigh-riding at a famous ski resort in PyeongChang. The spring sleigh program came around the biggest holiday season in Thailand, known as Songkran. The event was a success, according to the KTO, as it was a rare experience for those from the region that barely has snowfall.The state tourism body is also working to develop somewhat out-of-the-ordinary tours for young Japanese women in their 20s and 30s that take up a large portion of inbound visitors from the neighboring country. Given the tendency that many of them are fond of luxury itineraries like getting spa treatment, the KTO is planning to induce them to come for city glamping -- a type of resort-style camping with amenities and services -- and Korean-herbal skincare treatment at hotels, it said. Besides such plans, the KTO has been organizing the World Club Dome Korea, a global electronic dance music festival, slated for Sept. 22-24 in Incheon, hoping to draw at least 20,000 tourists from around the world, according to the tourism body.","japanese southeast asians struggling ,chinese visitors local tourism ,drop in chinese visitors ,the south korea tourism ,asians struggling to cope","['chinese', 'japanese', 'southeast asian', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'US']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57634872  0.86891276

The shift necessitated by the change includes looking to attract more visitors from other nations and promote more in-country travel, sources said.  The sudden drop in inbound Chinese tourists is the result of a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing over the planned deployment of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery on South Korean soil. Chinese nationals accounted for nearly half of inbound foreigners in 2016, with their individual spending estimated at about $2,080 per person, according to the Korea Tourism Organization. Besides tourism, many local companies and goods have been hit hard by China's open objections to the missile defense system.China has slammed THAAD for hurting its security interests, despite repeated assurances by South Korea that the weapons system is to counter North Korea's evolving nuclear and long-range missile threats.In the wake of the dispute, local tourist-oriented businesses and governments reported sharp drops in earnings. The southern port city of Busan said it has received cancellations from some 94 Chinese cruises that were slated to use its port since March 15, when the trip ban came into effect. The total number of cruise passengers visiting South Korea's No. 2 city could have been as many as 300,000, according to the Busan Port Authority.Incheon, a port city located west of Seoul, has had about 87 percent of Chinese cruises call off their scheduled arrivals, while car ferries -- that carry passengers and cargo, and ply between the two countries -- have virtually been getting zero passenger traffic, local authorities claimed. Many businesses conceded that the drop in deep-pocketed Chinese visitors is being missed since they were oftentimes the main source of profit. KTO data showed that there was a 63.6 percent on-year drop in Chinese visitors this year as of April 9. The total that visited stood at 520,000. Given the current pace, the government expects the total number of Chinese visitors to be halved to less than 4 million for 2017.    Reflecting this, government officials on the resort island of Jeju, situated off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, confirmed it has been hurt by no-shows by Chinese tourists.It said that not only are duty-free shops run by big retail firms suffering a sharp drop in sales, but many small and midsized travel agencies, restaurants and accommodation businesses are struggling to stay afloat. While the repercussions are inevitable and painful, many have said that the blow from the Chinese ban has given them a hard lesson and the need to strive for change.Spearheaded by the KTO, the country is ramping up efforts to diversify its tourist portfolio to Japan and Southeast Asia, while shifting its primary target to individual travelers rather than group package tours. The state tourism agency plans to bolster viral promotions of getaways and relaxation programs for Japanese visitors through online and mobile channels. It will also work with the local food service industry to increase Muslim-friendly restaurants that serve halal dishes for those from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.By doing so, the country will seek to achieve a fresh annual target of 11.2 million non-Chinese tourists for this year, up from 9.17 million recorded a year earlier. A total of some 17 million foreigners visited South Korea last year.Both the central and regional governments plan to boost promotions for in-country travel for locals through discounts and other benefits, which can give new momentum to this critical service sector.Highlighting the need for change, Jeju Island suffered a 26.6 percent on-year fall in its Chinese tourist tally in the year to date, but its overall inbound number has risen nearly 3 percent from a year ago on the back of an on-year gain in the number of local visitors. Its provincial tourism authority said it plans to devise more incentive tours or school trip programs as part of a bid to lure not only locals but visitors from such places as Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. The provincial government of Jeju has recently clinched a deal with Philippine Airlines to fly chartered planes to the island until mid-June, from which it expects to draw at least 3,000 visitors from the Southeast Asian country.

""The finding on Korea's tourism reflects our efforts toward improving the overall quality of services and programs. We will continue to work to strengthen the industry by revitalizing in-country travel, as well as diversifying the inbound tourist portfolio,"" a ministry official said.

Moreover, South Koreans tend to hesitate and delay seeking professional help, which causes the condition to worse and makes treatment more difficult.

The launch of the landmark coincided with the 50th anniversary of the group's establishment and comes at a difficult time for the retail and food conglomerate.It is embroiled in a swirl of troubles from its business operations in China and legal disputes involving the chairman and his brother over leadership succession. Separately the Shin family is also facing corruption charges in relation to an influence-peddling scandal that led to the ouster of Park Geun-hye as president. Due to health issues, the founder, 95, didn't appear at the ceremony, while his second son Dong-bin was present throughout to welcome the guests. ""As Korea's landmark, we want to make the Lotte World Tower the pride of this country. We will make sure Korea becomes the world's most famous tourist destination by securing an annual 100 million visitors from around the world,"" Shin said.  The 555-meter high building consists of offices, a lavish residence and luxury hotel named Signiel Seoul, and is topped with a glass observation deck. On Sunday, Lotte held a fireworks display to showcase the opening of the skyscraper. More than 400,000 people gathered to see the show, which involved some 30,000 fireworks going off to light up the building, according to Lotte.","korea tallest skyscraper built ,korea tallest skyscraper opens ,south korea tallest skyscraper ,korea tallest skyscraper ,tallest skyscraper built","[""South Korea 's"", 'Lotte Group', 'Lotte World Tower', 'Lotte', 'Shin Dong - bin']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14814016  0.64960706

Those found guilty of failing to carry out their duties face a maximum one year in prison.","korea 2015 revised criminal ,korea strengthens penalty for ,consuming korean pop culture ,penalty for consuming korean ,2015 revised criminal code","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency', ""North Korea 's""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3172642   0.35211107

But they failed to narrow their differences on some important details, such as weekend pay rates and a grace period to be granted to businesses.Ha Tae-kyung, chairman of the Environment and Labor Committee, holds a meeting to discuss the amendment of the Labor Standards Law with its members at the National Assembly in Seoul, Monday. The Labor Standards Act currently limits work to 52 hours a week -- 40 hours of regular work and 12 hours of overtime. But as the Labor Ministry has seen “the week” as excluding Saturday and Sunday, the legal limit is stretched to 68 hours in reality -- 40 hours during weekdays, 12 hours of overtime and 16 hours during the weekend. The proposed revision was to plug this loophole by clearly stating in the law that the 52-hour cap is for the entire seven days of a week. According to 2015 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Koreans worked an average 2,113 hours annually, the third-longest hours among OECD countries. This marks 1.2 times more than the OECD bloc’s average of 1,766 hours. On the other hand, labor productivity, measured as gross domestic product per hour worked, was far lower than the OECD average of $46.6, standing at $31.80 in 2015. The push to curtail long hours and move to a more efficient work culture has faced strong resistance from local businesses, which fear that a rise in labor costs would chip away at their competitiveness in the global market. Mindful of the worries, pro-business lawmakers of the parliamentary committee had insisted on granting companies up to two to four years of grace period. Liberal lawmakers as well as labor unions, however, have strongly opposed the grace period for businesses, saying it is only an excuse for employers to break a law and further exploit workers. Better work-life balance, enabled by shorter working hours, longer vacations or a flexible work system, is a key campaign pledge of major presidential hopefuls in the coming May 9 election, including front-runner Moon Jae-in. South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung, a liberal runner-up candidate, has pledged to introduce a sabbatical leave of one year for all workers who complete 10 years of consecutive work.By Ock Hyun-ju","korean lawmakers have failed ,lawmakers have failed ,reducing the maximum weekly ,lawmakers have failed to ,south korean lawmakers","['south korean', 'the National Assembly ’s Environment', 'Labor Committee']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55489069  0.70194197

The attempt is the second of its kind, following one in 2012. This file photo shows the MAB International Co-ordinating Council adopting a report on the periodic review of South Korea's UNESCO-designated biosphere reserve Jeju Island during its 25th session at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris on May 28, 2013. At that time, the environment ministry unsuccessfully tried to seek the BR status for Gangwon and Gyeonggi provincial counties and the DMZ because of tense inter-Korean relations and some local residents' opposition.""But this time, we've decided to apply only the Gangwon counties for the UNESCO status at a provincial level, while excluding Gyeonggi counties and the DMZ,"" the official said, The DMZ will also be sought for the registration on the BR list at a national level later when inter-Korean relations will be improved, the official said. The provincial government plans to hold meetings with local residents for their better understanding of its plan in the first half of this year and draw up a preliminary application by the end of the year, according to the official. The province will endeavor to complete procedures for on-site UNESCO inspections and the submission of a final application next year, the official said. The final decision on whether to put the counties on the BR list will be made at a meeting of the Man and the Biosphere Programme International Co-ordinating Council between May and July 2019, according to the official.Launched in 1971, the MAB develops the basis within the natural and social sciences for the rational and sustainable use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere and for the improvement of the overall relationship between people and their environment.At present, 669 sites in 120 countries have been designated as Biosphere Reserves, with South Korea holding five, including Mount Seorak and Jeju Island.","biosphere reserves this year ,monday the five counties ,counties of south korea ,counties to seek unesco ,to seek unesco biosphere","[""South Korea 's"", 'Gangwon Province', 'UNESCO Biosphere', 'Cherwon', 'Yanggu', 'Inje', 'Goseong', 'Koreas']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9512955   0.39000738

To brace for the fallout, the Korea Tourism Organization will adopt various ways to improve tourism services for Muslims, aiming to secure 1.2 million inbound visitors from Southeast Asia and the Middle East for this year, the organization said in a statement. Under the envisioned theme of ""Muslim Friendly Korea,"" the KTO plans to encourage restaurants to gain an accreditation for providing halal foods, which will then be promoted through KTO's tourism guide. The organization will also attend tourism exhibitions in Kazakhstan in late April and other similar events that will be held in Malaysia and Indonesia in the latter half of this year, seeking to promote and introduce South Korea to Muslim communities, it said. In September, the KTO plans to launch a week-long halal fest for Muslim travelers, during which an assortment of local foods made in accordance with halal rules will be introduced to the visitors as a way to promote local cuisines and culture, it added. In 2016, some 980,000 Muslim tourists came to Korea on a trip, up 33 percent from a year earlier.","more tourists from muslim ,asia fourth largest economy ,muslim countries its tourism ,tourists from muslim countries ,woo more tourists from","['south korean', 'muslim', 'China', 'Beijing', ""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'chinese']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80905217  0.73903602

Starting from an early age, students struggle to meet the expectations of their parents and teachers. If they hit the end goal of getting in to a good university and landing a reputable job, they often consider themselves freed from studying, rather than eager to take more classes.But for those who are motivated to educate themselves, the times that they don’t work become free times to develop autonomously.“If I retire one day, I will still need a way to make a living. I want to continue working,” said 47-year-old computer teacher Lee Hye-sun.She had just signed up for a three-days-a-week cooking class for a professional certificate in Korean cuisine. For the next two months, she will be spending her free time honing her culinary skills.Employed people study to become chefs on Saturdays at Hansol Cooking Hagwon. “I’ve taken baking and barista classes, too. Maybe I can start my own cafe or a restaurant in the long run,” Lee said, adding that even if she were to hire someone, she would still want to know the ropes to make sure nothing goes amiss.“It can’t be helped that I continue learning. The world keeps churning out changes and if I cease the effort to educate myself -- whatever it is I choose to learn -- I fear I will fall behind. Learning is good for the mind.”Lee is not alone in having such thinking. Han Ki-tae, a 38-year-old salesman who has worked over 10 years at an engineering firm, said that he took up sports and piano before he joined the dessert-making class he is currently enrolled in. “I first started taking cooking lessons two years ago,” said Han, who stepped outside for the interview while his pink roll cakes were cooking in the oven.Han spent four hours every Saturday at the cooking academy situated in Jongno-gu, Seoul, an hour’s drive away from his home in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.Han Ki-tae, who works at an engineering firm bakes pink roll cakes. The time he invests in pursuing this extra-training outside of work provides more than what meets the eye, according to Han.“One might think it’s tough working five days a week and spending the precious weekend taking classes, but surprisingly this is my way of finding peace,” Han said. “I love the feeling that I’m growing in a way I choose to. Also, when I’m cooking I’m solely focusing on the task at hand. I can empty my head of other thoughts and immerse in the ‘now.’”Han did not have an immediate plan to quit his sales job, but adding new skill sets enriched his overall lifestyle. “Everything I learn turns out to be useful in a way or another. Cooking, for example, has immensely affected my diet at home in a positive direction.”Outside the walls of the cooking institute, Saturday was lazily rolling out amid the clear skies of March’s warming weather. But within the walls, packs of people were busily occupied in front of chopping boards and bubbling saucepans. Employed people study to become chefs on Saturdays at Hansol Cooking Hagwon. The scene wasn’t much different at a Chinese language institute near Yonsei University and Ewha Womans University in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul. Being the university area, the district has diverse educational institutions called hagwon, where students can sign up to get extra kicks for their academics. Not only students, but also employed people are returning to the area for early morning, late night or weekend classes to help boost their careers or seek new opportunities outside their usual perimeters.Choi Jae-kwang, a team leader at Netmarble Games, said he often traveled to China to meet Chinese buyers and clients.In the near-10 years he has worked in the field, he had put off learning Chinese and hired interpreters to help his conversations. But to help build his competence he has finally decided to enroll in a beginner’s course. “Today was the second class,” said Choi, packing up his bags after the grueling hours he practiced pronouncing the Chinese intonations. “I know some Chinese, but it’s all slang. I wanted to properly learn the language so that one day I will be able to sit at the negotiation table without an interpreter.” “It’s recently become an annoyance that my interpreters water down my feelings in the middle as they translate. I want to be able to directly express complaints on the occasions where I need to,” Choi said. Choi’s classmate Kang Jeong-hee, who has worked for Incheon International Airport Corp. for 17 years, said he doesn’t need to learn Chinese as there are enough new recruits at the company who are more than apt in the language.The reason he is taking the Chinese class is because he has an ambition to break free from his present job and start an online shopping mall targeting Chinese people.“I want to learn basic coding too, so that I know what’s going on when I outsource the webpage making to a professional firm,” Choi said. The Korean government provides subsidies for people seeking lifelong education at more than 2,300 educational institutions. These institutions cover diverse subjects from computer skills to language to handicraft. According to data released by the Ministry of Employment and Labor, from January and end of December in 2016, nearly 550,000 people applied for the nationally funded program that aids people who wish to register for courses at career-advancing classes.Those younger than 30 took up more than 33 percent of the tally, while those aged above 50 accounted for 15 percent.

The looming decline came as the number of births continued to drop. South Korea's total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- stood at 1.17 in 2016, compared with 1.65 in 1993.A growing number of South Koreans have fewer babies due mainly to economic burden amid a prolonged economic slowdown.Still, South Korea's aging population could continue to grow due to progress in medical technology.The number of South Koreans over 65 accounted for 13.2 percent of the country's population in 2016, Statistics Korea said.

According to the data by local environmental authorities, scholars and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the yearly cost of South Korea's air pollution is estimated to hover above the 10 trillion won mark.Prof. Bae Jeong-hwan of Chonnam National University in Gwangju, about 330 kilometers south of Seoul, even put the figure at 11.8 trillion won.The estimates measured the harmful effects of such air pollutants as particulates, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides.""According to conservative estimates, the damage from air pollution in South Korea hovers in the 10 trillion won range, but it could become much larger considering its ripple effects on consumption and industrial activity,"" Bae said. ""It also has a negative impact on the quality of life.""Spewed out by power stations, plants and cars, particulates, also called fine dust, refer to microscopic solids and droplets that are known to cause various respiratory problems while also affecting the body's immune system.According to the OECD, South Korea has the worst air pollution among its member countries. In a report released last year, the Paris-based club of advanced economies predicted South Korea to suffer the biggest economic damage and the highest premature death rate from air pollution among its members in 2060.Air pollution is estimated to cost South Korea $20 billion that year, which will wipe 0.63 percent off its economic growth rate, the highest among its member nations, the OECD said.Some local experts pointed out that the damage from air pollution could be larger that the conservative estimates, given fine dust and yellow dost that originate in China and grip South Korea nearly every spring.Meanwhile, a series of international reports have recently been released, pointing to the serious level of South Korea's air pollution. Seoul ranked No. 3 among large cities worldwide in terms of air pollution on Tuesday. According to pollution monitoring website AirVisual, Seoul had an air quality index of 174, trailing those of New Delhi  and Dhaka .According to the Health Effects Institute, a US non-profit specializing in research on the health effects of air pollution, the annual average density of particulates in South Korea stood 29 micrograms per cubic meter, the second-worst level among the OECD members after Turkey.","pollution costs korea dearly ,10 trillion won billion ,thursday air pollution causes ,air pollution costs korea ,costs south korea more",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60756111  0.51969874

Only Turkey registered a faster pace of growth during the corresponding period.  Korea was the fifth largest emitter in the group, climbing four notches from ninth place in 2000.

Petroleum took 31.3 percent from the total energy consumption, followed by coal at 28.6 percent and natural gas at 21.2 percent. Biofuel and renewable energy accounted for only 10.3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.To reduce emissions, the OECD suggested that South Korea expand the supply of eco-friendly energy and phase out fossil fuel subsidies.It also called for a stronger political commitment to green growth and penalties on illegal acts leading to pollution.A graph of change in total greenhouse gas emissions The OECD reviews the overall environmental policy and performance of its member state every 10 years and publishes a report with some policy recommendations.

In the first nine months of last year alone, only 39 percent of the 268,974 participants finished the program.Due to the high dropout rate, only 76 percent of the 108.1 billion won  budget earmarked for the program was spent last year. However, last year's budget execution rate was up sharply from 23 percent the previous year as more money was spent on advertising.Experts still insist that the program, which was a key part of the government's anti-smoking policy package announced in 2015, has not produced satisfactory results. Among other things, South Korea jacked up the price of cigarettes by 80 percent to 4,500 won  per pack in 2015 in an effort to curb smoking.In order to coax more smokers to join the program, the government should not only redouble publicity activity but also increase the number of hospitals, clinics and community health centers that participate in the program, they said.The anti-smoking program, which costs about 440,000 won to complete, is provided at medical institutions with staffers who have a nonsmoking eduction provided by the service.So far, more than 21,000 doctors have completed a related education program, but only 11,745 hospitals and clinics have offered anti-smoking programs at least once in the past three months.Analysts said hospitals are reluctant to treat participants because the service-set cost is too low compared to the long hours needed for consultation and treatment, calling for the active participation by health centers numbering 1,600 nationwide.Meanwhile, government data showed Monday that sales of cigarettes in South Korea fell for three months running in February following a government push to imprint health warning graphics on the outside of packages. Starting in December 2016, graphic images of damage caused to internal organs by smoking were placed on the upper part of cigarette packets.","tuesday slightly over 358 ,in 2016 south korea ,state funded anti smoking ,program spike in 2016 ,2016 south korea saw","['South Korea', 'the National Health Insurance Service']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42800024  0.59642899

The agency also planned to set up business booths for the companies in an effort to help increase exports of homegrown animations.Many industry insiders forecast that the festival would probably deny the Korean firms' application for participation in the future.""We're greatly embarrassed by the Chinese notification,"" a KOCCA official said.

Go Myong-hyun, an Asan research fellow who authored the report, said that he has calculated the fatalities based on interviews with 20 former prisoners at the North's Jungeri Prison, who defected to South Korea in recent years.Go said the 20 interviewees observed a total of 276 fellow detainees at the Jungeri labor camp from 2002 to 2012 and reported that 24.3 percent of them died before being released.North Korea's labor camps, also called reeducation centers, are mostly for political prisoners and are notorious for their unsanitary and life-threatening conditions.In the interviews, the defectors testified about diseases, malnutrition and other inferior conditions for prisoners at the Jungeri camp.""The number of interviewees was limited in the report but it is meaningful that the fatality rate has been calculated through their multiple testimonies,"" said Go.The multiple-answer survey found that 80.3 percent of the ill-fated North Korean prisoners died of undernourishment, with infectious, digestive and respiratory diseases afflicting 53 percent, 25.8 percent and 24.2 percent, respectively, Go said.""It is notable that eight in 10 North Korean prisoners suffered from malnutrition before death,"" said Go.

On Feb. 25, animal activists gathered at Gupo Market in Busan -- which is similar to Seoul’s Moran Market in terms of size and product range -- to demanding the closure of dog meat vendors there.  The protestors, who called themselves “anti-dogmeat friends,” said the culture of ruthless dog slaughter should be abolished, as it involves a process in which dogs are beaten and electrocuted while being hung midair. In an interview with a local media outlet, Yoon Green, the leader of the group, vowed to carry on with the protest until such businesses within the market are completely abandoned. “Moran Market’s dog meat butchers are shutting down thanks to Seongnam City’s active involvement in the matter,” he said. “In comparison, the vendors at Gupo Market seem more open toward changing their professions.” The Seongnam City Government’s decision to remove the slaughterhouses was revealed last December through an agreement with an association of vendors at Moran Market. The vendors were promised compensation such as financial aid to start new businesses. Park Yong-soon, the chairman of Gupo Market’s association of vendors, acknowledged the widespread negative views toward the handling of dog meat. “We can consider changing businesses if proper countermeasures are offered.”Gupo Market was established in northern Busan during the Joseon era and grew in proportion after the Korean War. It expanded into one of the largest meat markets in the country in the 1970s and ’80s, with a total of 70 dog slaughterhouses in operation. However, the number of dog meat shops there had dwindled to 22 as of 2017, partly due to the Busan Metropolitan Government’s efforts to attract foreign tourists, who might find such facilities repulsive. In the summer of 2016, the Busan district where Gupo Market is located received almost 250 civil complaints related to illegal dog slaughtering. This included complaints about the stench and noise. Animal activists also frequently voiced their protest. A spokesperson for the Busan Metropolitan Government denied that there is a plan to remove the existing dog meat vendors from the city.By Jung Min-kyung","largest dog meat market ,feb 25 animal activists ,of dog meat vendors ,korea largest dog meat ,closure of dog meat","['the Seongnam City Government ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Gupo Market', 'Busan', 'Seoul']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14740787  0.41843042

Kim Yong-buk, a member of the vendors’ association speaking for 22 dog meat dealers, told reporters Monday that vendors agree with the city government’s decision to refurbish the area.“Following several rounds of talks with the city government, we decided to voluntarily remove dog slaughter facilities in the market to abolish the slaughter of dogs here,” Kim said.But he was soon interrupted by a group of vendors who yelled at him, saying, “You are such a traitor! What about others who want to continue with the dog meat business? We have yet to receive complete compensation from the government!”The decision was announced in December by the Seongnam City Government and an association of the vendors at Moran Market, which represents 22 dog meat dealers, among others. According to their agreement, the dog meat vendors were to start removing slaughter facilities and dog cages this week and complete the process by early May, in a move officials described as a step toward ending the animal welfare controversy over the industry. Moran Market, which opened in the 1960s and sells everything from live animals to antiques, has seen at least 80,000 dogs sold either dead or alive each year. It supplies one-third of all dog meat consumed in the country. Live dogs are kept in cages for customers to choose. They are then slaughtered at the market in plain sight.Dog meat vendors have been under attack from animal rights groups around the world for their use of brutal methods to slaughter dogs, including electrocution, hanging and beating. Seven of the 22 vendors who signed an agreement with the city government have since changed their minds and are now against the removal. They are urging the city government to provide due compensation and support the relocation of their shops to continue their business.“We cannot agree with the measures and support provided by the city government. We will see a tremendous amount of profit loss when we are forced to ban dog slaughtering here,” said Shin Seung-cheol.“Almost 80 percent of our customers visit our shops to buy fresh dog meat, what are going to do if we cannot provide it for them? Is the government going to pay us?” Shin asked.Dogs on sale to be slaughtered and consumed are seen in a cage at Moran Market in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. The city said in an agreement signed in early December that it would provide financial support for vendors to refurbish their shops for new businesses. The agreement came as part of the city’s project to remodel the traditional, open-air market.Vendors were also divided regarding the issue of looking for a new type of business.“Can you eat food with your left hand when you were a right-handed person for your entire life? It is total nonsense that the city government is asking us to find a new business,” said a vendor who has been trading dog meat for the past 30 years at Moran market.According to the vendors’ association, 10 of 22 dog meat dealers have already decided that they will go into a different business.“But those who changed their business are the rich ones, who already raked in money from the dog meat trading business. We, poor tenants from our shops in our part of the market, do not have enough money to find a new business,” someone among the rest of the vendors said. The city government said they would push ahead with a plan based on the agreement they made with vendors in December.“Nothing will change, we will continue to talk with vendors who oppose, but there will be no change in the amount of the government support,” Seongnam City official Kang Won-gu told The Korea Herald.“All we can do for now is to persuade vendors and continue to crack down on illegal dog slaughtering,” added Kang.

This file photo, taken on Feb. 10, 2017, shows an aerial view of the now closed joint industrial complex in North Korea's border town of Kaesong. An earlier report suggested North Korea may have tried to sell some products left behind in Kaesong by South Korean companies to Chinese buyers.The North has declared the forfeiture of all materials and equipment left behind by South Korean firms in the joint complex.Still, Seoul has asked Beijing to prohibit the transaction of such products in China.The informed sources here, however, said such attempts were rather incidental, and that most of the equipment and materials at Kaesong remain untouched.""Officials from Kaesong firms have been told that North Korea is keeping their equipment and materials safe. Officials from the joint Kaesong management office also say there have been no major movements of supplies at the industrial complex,"" said Chung Ki-seop, head of an emergency committee for 124 former Kaesong firms here.Local analysts suggested the North's keeping its hands off the goods at the joint complex may indicate its wish or willingness to reopen the park that was once considered a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.""The North's military and party are said to have tried to sell some goods from Kaesong to earn hard currency, but the amount appears to be extremely small,"" said Cho Bong-hyeon, a senior official and researcher from the private think tank IBK Economic Research Institute.""North Korean authorities are rather keeping the equipment and finished products left behind by Kaesong firms safe. In the past, the North would have used such goods, but the fact that it has not appears to show its wish to restart the industrial complex,"" he added.Such a wish is apparently shared by the 124 South Korean companies and their employees forced to leave their workplace a year earlier.They said raw materials and finished goods they left behind alone are worth over 240 billion won , while their equipment there is worth another 600 billion won.Their repeated requests to Pyongyang to be allowed to retrieve their goods and materials have gone unanswered.Seoul, meanwhile, remains opposed to reopening the joint industrial park, insisting that UN Security Council sanctions against the communist North also keep it from doing so.""The imposition of United Nations Security Council sanctions resolutions is aimed at making North Korea give up its nuclear weapons, not pursuing dialogue,"" Seoul's Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo told the National Assembly last week, when asked whether the resumption would violate relevant UN resolutions.","year after seoul pulled ,after shutdown north korea ,year after shutdown north ,124 south korean firms ,after seoul pulled all","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south Korean', 'Kaesong', 'North Korea', 'south korean']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75467837  0.40350688

A month earlier, the number was 4.16.It was a tangible drop from October 2015 when the figure reached its highest at 5.51, one month after President Park Geun-hye attended a war victory ceremony in China, showing the close diplomatic relationship between Seoul and Beijing. Chinese Premier Xi Jinping The number came down to 5.14 in May last year before tumbling to the low 4-point range in recent months, the poll showed.  Another 10-scale indicator put the popularity of China as a foreign nation among South Koreans at 4.31 in January, slightly higher than 4.2 a month earlier, the poll also said.  It was also a drop from the highest point of 5.54 posted in November 2015. The grimmer results come as South Korea and Beijing are entangled in diplomatic tension over the plan to bring the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system into South Korea to guard against North Korea's missile threats. The plan was announced in early 2016. In retaliation of the deployment, which China says compromises its security interests, the country has banned South Korean entertainers from appearing on Chinese TV programs and targeted South Korean goods in China. ""China's protests over the plan to deploy THAAD on the Korean Peninsula are affecting South Korea's public sentiment,"" the institute said in a related report. ""If China's hard-line measures continue it may further worsen South Koreans' public perception of China.""The report also showed shrinking support for the deployment plan among South Koreans, mainly due to the public's distrust of the government's policy-making process. The rate of support for the deployment peaked at 73.9 percent in February 2016, but has steadily come down to reach 46.3 percent as of November, according to the report. The most frequent reason behind opposing the deployment was distrust of government decisions, followed by worsening relations with China. ""The change of public opinion showcased how domestic politics and a lack of trust in the president and government affect  about diplomatic policies,"" the report said, referring to Park's recent impeachment over a influence-peddling scandal.

The remaining 9.07 trillion won in deals involved direct contracts reached with weapons manufacturers, the data showed.South Korea has for the most part acquired US weapons to help with the interoperability of weapons system between the militaries of the two countries. South Korea also allocates a large sum to stationing US troops on its soil.Last year, Seoul paid 944.1 billion won to the US as part of sharing the cost of keeping American troops in South Korea, the defense ministry said.The Seoul-Washington defense treaty had initially put the burden of financing US defense activities solely on Washington. The allies then inked a cost sharing deal that has been renewed intermittently.Currently, about 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to provide deterrence against North Korea amid Pyongyang's growing nuclear and missile threats.Separately, Seoul spent an estimated 10 billion won last year on operating the Korean Augmentation Troops to the US Army, a unique military system under which South Korean soldiers work with their American counterparts, the ministry said.South Korea plans to shoulder 8.9 trillion won to help expand the US military base in Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of Seoul, by December. The US side plans to inject 8.2 trillion won into the construction project, it said.""We are planning to explain the government's current payments and contributions to support US troops here to the incoming Donald Trump administration,"" a ministry official said.During his presidential campaign, Trump argued that South Korea should pay a fair share of the cost for US troops stationed in the country, even warning that the US could pull out its troops unless Seoul agrees to pay more.","billion worth of weapons ,36 trillion won 30 ,defense budget last year ,than 36 trillion won ,2016 south korea purchased","['the United States', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'US']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27486908  0.42978966

Public polls have showed him to be in a neck-and-neck race with opposition rival Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.During his last press event before leaving the UN official residence, Ban also said he will arrive in South Korea at around 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 12 via an Asiana Airlines flight.“I will report to the people of my country how I feel about returning after successfully accomplishing my duties for the past 10 years,” he said.Ban, who finished two consecutive terms as the UN’s top chief official Saturday, was initially due to arrive on Jan. 15 but moved the schedule ahead by a few days.The accelerated timeline kindled rumors that the former UN chief official will be quick to gear up for the presidential election upon his return. Ban is considered to have effectively declared his presidential aspirations when he said in a press conference with Korean reporters last month that he is ready to give everything to contribute to the development of the country.By Bae Hyun-jung","upcoming south korean presidential ,ahead of presidential bid ,korean presidential election ,south korean presidential election ,presidential election the increasing","['United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'south korean']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47970635  0.32396939

Voters chose their leaders every five year at nationwide polls and the elected presidents ranged from pro-democracy fighters to a dictator’s daughter. But the young democracy had its own issues. Every president elected since 1987 has found themselves embroiled in a corruption scandal near the end of their single five-year term. It was often linked to their family members, relatives or close aides. In the last two months of 2016, the country witnessed the culmination of this recurring problem. President Park Geun-hye was once thought to be immune to corruption and nepotism since she had no family of her own, had lost both of her parents  in assassinations and was estranged from her siblings. But she was mired in an unprecedented scandal that many said have fundamentally undermined the country’s core democratic values. Amid massive protests, Park was impeached on Dec. 9.      The debacle has sparked a widespread reevaluation of country’s governance system set out in the Constitution that was written in 1987. Calls for Constitutional amendment are ripe, as the Park fiasco presents to the country a new challenge to build a more resilient democracy.    Marking the 30th year since the 1987 democratic uprising, The Korea Herald interviewed eight prominent leaders at the center of the transitional period who shared their insights on how to build a new governance system for the new era.Following are the excerpts from the Korea Herald’s interview of eight prominent figures in politics, officialdom and academia. – Ed. KH: It has been 30 years since South Korea enacted the current Constitution, completing its transition to democracy. What are the successes and failures of the past three decades and what changes are needed? Former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik: The 1987 system was successful in preventing dictatorship and allowing the people to elect their presidents by themselves. But problems emerged over time. Presidents have often abused their power to achieve their short-term goals within their single, five-year term. The power structure needs to be fixed, so that presidents can manage state affairs with a longer-term vision. In my view, we should stick to the presidential system but should allow presidents to stand for re-election once. Plus, we should build a more sophisticated system of checks and balances to prevent the abuse of presidential powers.    Former National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa: It is true that the 1987 Constitution was significant progress for South Korea, but I feel that now the 30-year-old system has become the root cause of many problems we face. Only a few people dominate power under the winner-takes-all election system. There is no middle ground.Such a system creates a hostile political climate. Politicians and their parties are more likely to fight each other than to find common ground. I think we are in a transitional period. We need to move beyond the 1987 system. Former National Assembly Speaker Park Kwan-young: Every president elected since 1987 was embroiled in political scandals near the end of their term. This is because the presidents dominate  and abuse their power. We need to find a way to reduce presidential powers. I think a semi-presidential system in which the presidents focus on external affairs and prime ministers deal with internal affairs would be best for Korea. Former National Assembly Speaker Kim Won-ki: The 1987 system brought an end to an authoritarian era that had persisted since the Cold War. Since 1987, there have been no presidents seeking to extend their term beyond the limit stated by the Constitution. But focusing too much on preventing a dictatorship, we neglected other values crucial to managing democracies, like how to run political parties. It seems to me there is a broad agreement that the 1987 system needs to be changed. Former National Assembly Speaker Lim Chae-jung: The 1987 system’s most significant achievement was to end dictatorship and build democracy -- albeit in a procedural sense. As a result, people are able to change their presidents every five years. But we have failed to build upon the system and many problems have emerged afterward. Even the basic right was not fully protected under the 1987 Constitution. I think it has failed to catch up with the change of time and is now losing its value as the basic law. However, we have to be cautious about revising the Constitution, because some politicians and parties approach the issue from  their own partisan interests.  Professor emeritus of Kyung Hee University Huh Young: The 1987 Constitution wasn’t a perfect one, but it has worked quite well until now. If we think there is a problem, it is more to do with how we managed the system rather than what the system is about. When the people overthrew the military dictatorship in 1987, they focused on two things. First, they wanted to elect their presidents by themselves. Second, the presidents had to be limited to a single term to prevent dictatorship.   But things have changed so much since then. In 1987, we still lived in a conventional society, but now we are going through the internet and digital revolution. It is natural for the people to demand a different system for a changed society. I think there is enough consensus among the public since President Park’s scandal.  Regarding the government type, I think the presidential system suits Korea most because of the security challenges facing Korea. We need a strong leader. But the current single-term five-year presidency should be adjusted. I think a two-term four-year presidency is more ideal.     Former Environment Minister Yoon Yeo-joon: The 1987 Constitution was a reflection of the people’s consensus during turbulent times of the 1980s, which was electing presidents by themselves. But other than that, the 1987 system was a little bit slipshod. It needs to be fixed. Senior People’s Party adviser Chung Dae-chul: The 1987 system was a call from the people for democracy and it has persisted for 30 years. Now the people want it to be changed. They want to change the way their presidents use power. KH: Since the presidential scandal erupted in October, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the street to demand her resignation. What is your take on the protests and what they mean for Korean democracy?  Prime Minister Kim: I understand that the people had no choice but to take to the streets. The scandal showed that Korea’s representative democracy did not work at all under the rule of President Park. Maybe the candlelight protests could help strengthen democracy, but it can’t provide an alternative to representative democracy. We need to solve the problem by incorporating the people’s ideas into the political process under representative democracy. Speaker Kim: The candlelight protest will be a watershed moment in South Korea’s history. It will have a profound impact not just on politics but on society as a whole. It could be a driving force behind efforts to make Korea a better country. But it is up to the politicians to channel this energy into national reform. The protests were an opportunity for people to nurture a sense of justice and courage to stand up against wrongful authorities. I hope politicians realize what would happen if they fail to do their jobs.  Huh: The public sentiment shown during the protest is something that we can watch and experience. Such an “empirical experience” is a piece of information that policymakers can use, but not all or an overriding and deciding factor in mapping out a strategy to run the government. We should regard equally the opinions of those who do not show up at street protests. There are two types of public opinions -- one of the protestors and the other from a more silent group. I think the latter is closer to what the people as a whole think. One of the problems in South Korean politics is that it gives too much weight to empirical experiences like massive protests and opinion polls. But they will change over time. It is wrong to allow them to influence policies too much. I don’t think it would happen in other advanced democracies. Senior adviser Chung: I have a positive view of the candlelight protests. It is a new form of direct public participation in the political process KH: President Park’s scandal brought about a leadership crisis, damaging the public’s confidence in the way the country is run. Do you think Park is solely to blame, or had structural factors played into the current leadership crisis?    Yoon: It is self-evident if you just watch what is happening. If you are in a position to lead the country, you should have leadership skills. I think we elected a president who doesn’t have the ability to lead.   Assembly Speaker Kim: The current leadership crisis is an unprecedented one. But then again, leaders in South Korea have confronted a similar crisis. Though Park’s scandal is much more serious than others, most presidents barely gained the trust of the public.The current crisis is also linked to our political system. True, political leadership has to do with the individual traits of the leaders. But, more often than not, it has more to do with the established system, as well.Prime Minister Kim: President Park is the primary reason behind the current crisis. She has allowed unauthorized individuals to meddle in state affairs and neglected her duty to oversee them. Thus, Park is the first one to be held accountable. Then again, her predecessors have suffered from similar nepotism scandals. Presidents have often wielded exclusive power, but there is little method available for us to limit their power abuse.  Senior adviser Chung: I don’t agree with the notion that links the current political turmoil to the failures of the country’s political establishment. What we are seeing is an isolated case of President Park Geun-hye herself. She violated the Constitution and lacked the ability to lead. This is why she was impeached.Assembly Speaker Chung: Both are to blame. President Park herself has managed the country in a wrongful manner and failed to do what is required of a leader. A dysfunctional political system has also played a part. Under the single-term presidency and single-member constituency system, political parties are prone to partisan standoffs and fractional infighting. It creates a political culture where the winner takes all. There is no middle ground. Lim: Both are to blame. One thing I want to highlight is that we are beginning to see our history bounce back from the legacy of Park Chung-hee, a military dictator and the father of the current President Park Geun-hye. The way that President Park Geun-hye’s office worked is exactly the same as her father’s did. It was something that we didn’t expect to see again after the demise of Park Chung-hee. In that regard, I think we are living through the final chapter of Park Chung-hee legacy.KH: After President Park’s fall, politicians are talking about what kind of leader that the country needs. Some say “cohesive” leaders are needed while others advocate “reformative” ones. What is your take on this?Prime Minister Kim: I believe that the next leader should be “cohesive,” embracing diverse parts of society through compromise and negotiation. It does not clash with reformative leadership. Compromise and negotiations make it easier for us to pursue reform. It is not an either A or B issue. Based on bringing together the people’s opinions, we can find a way to overhaul society. Lim: I think we need reformative leadership. For example, the Constitution cannot fulfill the demands presented by the new era. Now is the time to open up ourselves and reach consensus over what sort of values a new Constitution should represent. Huh: If I had to choose between the two, I would definitely go for cohesive leadership. We cannot achieve social reform without bringing together the people’s opinions. If we simply push for reform, protests will re-emerge. Therefore, bringing together the people must come first before pushing for reform. Leaders can achieve their reform after reaching out to the people and building consensus among them. Reform can serve its purpose only when it succeeds. Simply pursuing reform cannot be our goal.  Yoon: Whether it is cohesive or reformative, what is more crucial is the person’s ability to lead the country. We need a leader who comprehends how a true democracy works and has internalized democratize values and rules.  By Yeo Jun-suk","decades of military dictatorship ,ending decades of military ,democracy 30 years old ,leaders every five year ,years since south korea","['South Korea', 'North Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84932053  0.52409065

North Korea’s despotic leader is said to be planning a “prime time” nuclear weapons push. The coming Donald Trump administration in the US, South Korea’s top ally, also presents its own set of challenges.  To top it all off, this country of 50 million is lacking leadership, with President Park Geun-hye impeached by the parliament. An election to choose the successor to the scandal-ridden leader will be held this year, but there is a big question mark over when. Still, South Koreans have reasons to look forward to the future. The New Year has always been a symbol of new beginnings, but 2017 may really be the beginning of a new, more hopeful era for South Korea, with its people more awake and alert than ever.“After what has happened here, I think the year 2017 has the potential to be a turning point for the country in its path toward total reform, not just in politics but all across society, culture and business,” Kim Won-ki, a retired politician who served as the speaker of the National Assembly from 2004-2006, told The Korea Herald. Tommy Kim, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in Seoul, also said that he likes to think of 2017 as an opportune time for his home country to part with an old system that has been pestering from inside. “South Koreans will be electing a new president this year. I hope the new leader can courageously correct our rotten system,” Kim said. Political uncertainty does exist but a bright side to it is that it will also bring positive energy to the country and a new leader who will be at least be more responsive to the people, he said. In the last two months of 2016, South Korea has been in a turmoil, with tens of thousands taking to the street to oust President Park Geun-hye over a scandal which shed light on the corruption and rampant cronyism at the highest office. For Jeong Ho-jun, a military officer living in Gangwon Province, the year 2017 is big in more ways than one.“I will be completing my military service this year, which means I will have to get a new job and a new house… but most of all, there will be a new member in my family,” said Jeong, who is expecting his first baby in April. “My hope is to see my daughter live healthy in a society where responsible people do their duties, just like army soldiers do,” the officer said, revealing that he plans to watch the first sunrise of the New Year on a beach of Gangeung. Thirty-year-old Sohn Jae-geun is eager to greet the New Year. Having entered his dream company in January last year, Sohn said he is ready to absorb and learn everything he can do at work to prove his worth. “I hope I can learn more things at work in the New Year so I can contribute more to my company and to the national economy,” he said.   He expressed hope that the government in 2017 would spend more on assisting young people like him with fulfilling their dreams, and not just focus on the older generation.Kindergarten teacher Kim Hi-yeon said she sees hope in every kid she takes care of every day. “By doing my job sincerely in my position, I can give trust to parents who leave their children here every morning. I think that way I contribute to making a brighter future ,” said the 34-year-old. A 10-year-old Kim Dong-sung said that her only wish for the New Year is to see her one and only prayer over the past year to come true: get a high score in dictation so she can get a Yorkshire terrier.“I think studying hard for dictation tests will bring me good results anyways since I want to become a Korean teacher when I grow up,” the elementary school student said. For Moon Du-sik, spending the last day of the year at a Buddhist temple has been a ritual. This year, he also planned to go to Heungguksa in Goyang, north of Seoul. “It is really refreshing to go there, wake up early and see the sunrise,” he said. “My daughter is getting married this year. Marriage is a start of a new part in life and I wish for the best of her. I wish to see a grandchild soon,” said the 67-year-old who runs a restaurant. A former supporter of President Park Geun-hye, Moon was among the tens of thousands of protestors who took to the street in the last two months of 2016 to demand the resignation of the president. As for the economic outlook, pessimists clearly outweigh optimists. A recent poll by Gallup Korea shows that only 11 percent of the people surveyed expect their livelihood to improve, compared to 42 percent who anticipate deterioration. Only 4 percent expect the national economy to fare better in 2017, while 66 percent said economic conditions will worsen. Last week the government slashed its projection for economic growth this year to 2.6 percent from 3 percent, predicting a third consecutive year of slow growth after 2015 and 2016. However, some experts continue to pin hopes on exports, the long-time growth driver of the Korean economy. “Unlike the worrisome domestic situation, external conditions are improving, which will help improve the country’s exports,” said Ju Won, chief of macroeconomic research at Hyundai Research Institute. “Because the global economy is getting better, including the US, Korea can expect growing demand for its products worldwide.” Rising oil and other commodity prices would help raise unit prices of Korean export goods, leading to higher profits for Korean exporters, the expert said. A weaker Korean currency against the strengthening US dollar may also help increase price competitiveness of Korea-made goods in the global market, he added. “Since our economy is still more dependent on exports than domestic consumption, such improvement can make a noticeable contribution to growth this year,” Ju said. New technologies could provide some hope, as well. According to the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, Korea’s IT sector would see growing exports of products based on fresh technologies, taking a competitive edge over their global rivals in 2017. “Korean-made OLED TVs, solid state drives, 3D NAND flash memory products and wearable devices are expected to be highly recognized in the global market, helping boost the country’s IT industry,” said Kim Kyung-yoo, a researcher at the institute. “Despite continuous falls in auto exports, development of high-tech hybrid cars and compact SUVs would be hopeful for the industry.” By Kim Da-sol , Song Su-hyun , Yeo Jun-suk  & Jo He-rim","2017 north korea despotic ,corporate setbacks south korea ,even worse in 2017 ,economy already in bad ,worse in 2017 north","['South Korea', 'North Korea ’s', 'Donald Trump', 'US', 'South Korea ’s']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88141364  0.21149231
