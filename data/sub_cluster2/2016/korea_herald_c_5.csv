Chartered flights are operated upon government approval, usually in busy travel seasons. The latest requests were filed ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season in late January when a great number of Chinese are expected to travel to South Korea. The cancellation took place simultaneously as the Chinese government rejected approval for South Korean airlines' similar requests to run non-scheduled flights between the countries in January.The Chinese disapproval delivered to three South Korean air carriers -- Korean Air Lines, Asiana Airlines and Jeju Air -- on Friday was critically portrayed by the South Korean media as retaliation for Seoul's decision to deploy the Terminal-High Altitude Area Defense, an advanced U.S. missile shield, on the Korean Peninsula.""Usually, both countries communicate before  on the chartered flight issue, but this time we didn't and were also given no specific reason for the disapproval,"" a ministry official said.The official said South Korean diplomats in China are contacting local airlines and trying to find out why the decision was made.","chinese airlines withdraw plans ,chinese airlines have withdrawn ,chinese airlines withdraw ,airlines withdraw plans for ,chartered flights to korea","['chinese', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'China Southern Airlines', 'China Eastern Air', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Land , Infra']",5,"[ 2.          2.          1.         ... -0.02769155  0.55465657

But in the summer of 2006, that’s exactly where he ended up. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail for refusing to join the Army and fulfill the country’s mandatory military service. “I didn’t want to be a victim, or the inflictor, of violence. I didn’t want to be a slave of violence,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “A strong army has never prevented war. A military is to win wars, not to get rid of them,” said Lee, who is now an activist for anti-war nonprofit group World Without War. Hong Jeong-hoon, an activist affiliated with the progressive People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, holds a performance at Gwanghwamun Square on Dec. 13 after announcing his conscientious objection to the state military service. Lee is among one of the 18,700 “conscientious objectors” in South Korea who have gone to jail for refusing to serve in the armed forces on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience or religion since military service became compulsory for all able-bodied men during the 1950-53 Korean War. In a country still technically at war with North Korea, those who reject conscription have so far found little hope of leniency in a court. Just like Lee, they have been uniformly sentenced to 18 months in prison. Their plea for alternative ways to serve the country has repeatedly been nixed by the court and the government, as well as a majority of the public. But some see a ray of hope that South Korea may be finally thawing to those who would rather choose to go to prison than raise arms. Their hope is that the Constitutional Court, currently reviewing the issue for the third time, may deliver a groundbreaking ruling in favor of those like Lee, reflecting the change of legal perceptions evidenced by nine acquittals at lower courts this year alone. A persistent controversy A vast majority of those who refuse to do their conscription in South Korea cite religion, with Jehovah’s Witnesses being the most common among them. “It’s not a question of whether or not I ‘oppose’ the military, it’s because I felt it was wrong to participate as a Christian,” said Lee Che-rin, a 26-year-old freelancer. “We are taught to love even our enemies.” Like other conscientious objectors, Lee was jailed in September of 2013. “I would have been ready to do anything, even if it meant I would spend twice the time  in alternate service. I would be thankful if they  would provide a system for us to do what we can,” he said.   The South Korean government requires all able-bodied men to serve in the military for at least 21 months.   It is a core part of the country’s defense against the North, as its Army of 650,000 men face 1.1 million troops of the communist state across the heavily fortified border since the war ended with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. Once enlisted, conscripts can be assigned to alternative services, such as working at community centers as support staff. But a month of combat training is still mandatory for all, which is the reason for the conscientious objection. Many in South Korea agree that a country should respect one’s individual beliefs. But when it comes to guarding their home against North Korea, which appears to be racing toward nuclear armament, national defense should come before individual rights, they say.  “I don’t think a religion should be above the law, as the law should be applied fairly to everyone. Hardly anyone ‘wants’ to go to the military, why should they  be granted a favor?” posed 30-year-old Yoo Kyung-min, who works for a pharmaceutical company.The majority of Koreans seems to share Yoo’s sentiment. According to a survey by Gallup Korea in May, 72 percent of the respondents said they “cannot understand conscientious objection.” But just as many as those against conscientious objection are open to the idea of allowing them other ways to serve. The same survey found that 70 percent agreed to the introduction of an alternative to the compulsory military service. Among countries that have military conscription, some countries, like Austria, Denmark and Finland, allow alternative services. Lawyer Oh Du-jin, who has represented several conscientious objectors in the past, argues that freedom of conscience and the duty of national defense, both prescribed in the Constitution, do not have to conflict with each other. “I am not saying that the military duty is worthless. I’m suggesting  should make use of the people they can’t make into soldiers by making them do other things for society,” he said. Park Seung-ho, campaigner for Amnesty International Korea Office, pointed out South Korea’s reaction to conscientious objection is punitive.“South Korea hands out punishment indiscriminately to everyone who says they cannot serve in the military,” he said. “A person who refuses military out of faith should be given another way to serve.” However, the Ministry of National Defense says it is premature to consider an alternative service program, given the growing threats from North Korea. “Introducing alternative services for those refusing military service can be used as means for draft-dodging, while dampening the morale of servicemen,” said a ministry official. “The public sentiment and national security has to be considered before reaching a decision ”  In a country where roughly half of the population has been, or will be, enlisted, draft evasion is a near taboo that can destroy one’s reputation and career.Korean-American singer Yoo Seung-jun, also known as Steven Yoo, saw his career and fame quickly implode in the early 2000s when he flip-flopped on his word that he would serve in the military. Conservative presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang had his campaign helplessly bogged down by allegations of his son evading conscription and was eventually defeated by liberal contender Roh Moo-hyun in 2002. Even after serving prison time, conscientious objectors have to fight social stigma attached to “draft dodgers,” Lee, the conscientious objector, said. “I still find it hard to get a job because I never served in the military, which is why I’m still a freelancer,” he said.Tides of change? Last month, the National Human Rights Council of Korea formally delivered to the Constitutional Court its position that an alternative service is necessary for those who object to military service based on their beliefs. “We reconfirm our previous stance that the right to reject military service based on one’s beliefs falls under the freedom of conscience stated by the Constitution and international regulations, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,” it said in a statement. Although the NHRCK made similar recommendations in 2005 to the National Assembly and Defense Ministry, its renewed call for an alternative service program has raised expectation the Constitutional Court may act to end the decadeslong predicament of conscientious objectors. The highest court has ruled against conscientious objection twice, in both 2004 and 2011, prioritizing national defense over individual rights. Its third ruling on the matter is expected as early as this month, nearly five years after a petition was filed in 2011. Signs of change have been almost unmistakable in the judiciary in the past few years. This year alone, nine courts -- all lower courts -- ruled in favor of conscientious objectors.   In October, an appellate court in Gwangju acquitted three draft rejecters, which marked the first time in history a high court recognized conscientious objection. “When there are two values, we cannot just accept one and reject the other. It would not be fitting with the value of our Constitution,” the court said in its ruling. But the result was soon tainted by a ruling delivered a fortnight later by another high court in Suwon, which found two conscientious objectors guilty of draft dodging.“Their refusal to serve in the military does not constitute the just cause permitted by the Military Conscription Law,” the court said, refusing to comment on the issue of alternative service. Lawyer Oh expressed hopes the nation’s top court would pave the road for alternative services. “The freedom of religion and conscience is a constitutional right. To impose criminal punishment infringes upon one’s freedom. I hope the Constitutional Court would serve as the last bastion of human rights,” he said. “It’s not just a political issue. It is about the very essence of humanity that a human being should be treated with dignity in whatever situation.” Since 1991, the United Nations Human Rights Council has recommended South Korea implement an alternative military service program for conscientious objectors, saying the Seoul government is violating a provision of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  According to the Defense Ministry’s data submitted to Rep. Park Beom-kye of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, 3,633 South Korean men refused their mandatary military service over faith or religion from 2010 to 2015. From January to October of this year, 225 people refused to join the military.   As of Aug. 31 this year, some 535 of these conscientious objectors are standing trial.  By Yoon Min-sik  and Ock Hyun-ju","korea thawing to conscientious ,months in jail for ,jail for refusing ,in jail for refusing ,18 months in jail","['Lee Yong - suk', 'Army', 'Lee', 'Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13849711 -0.00092253

The source, in particular, said South Korea's military is of the opinion that the North has set up more special forces units, upgraded the equipment used by such troops and beefed up their training. North Korean flagKIDA and the military said as a case in point, the North actually created a battalion-size unit specially tasked with attacking South Korea's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae and assassinating key figures in government.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un actually visited this battalion on Nov. 4 and the troops assigned to the unit actually took part in a mock attack on Cheong Wa Dae early last week.Even before such developments, the North has placed considerable emphasis on special forces, and is reported to employ large numbers of troops for special missions in the event of war breaking out on the Korean Peninsula.The source then said Seoul is currently in the process of reassessing the North's infantry, artillery, special warfare, naval and aerial capabilities, with the final classified report to be submitted to the defense ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff in the first half of 2017.Such analysis can paint a clearer picture of North Korea's military might that has been greatly boosted by it nuclear weapons program.This year alone the North tested two nuclear devices and fired off dozens of ballistic missiles, including those launched from a submarine, which can pose considerable challenges for South Korea and its main ally the United States.Others said that while it has become very hard to carry out signal intelligence, with Pyongyang using underground cables to send commands to all key forces, Seoul still has the ability to carry out human intelligence gathering from various sources that includes defectors.Since 2000, there have been 294 North Korean soldiers who have defected to the South, with many being senior officers and noncommissioned officers who have a generally good grasp of developments taking place within the military. Of the total who have reached the South, 20-30 have held command posts with their insight being instrumental in the compiling of the latest assessment.They said this is the kind of intelligence that Japan wants to acquire through the recently inked General Security of Military Information Agreement .""There is a chance that Tokyo may use GSOMIA to get a copy of the military reassessment report that Seoul is working on,"" insiders said.","from north korean defectors ,korean defectors who served ,north korean defectors ,improved think tank north ,north korean defectors who","[""North Korea 's"", 'the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44180042  0.50344402

""The government has made it clear that it will stick to its diplomatic and security-related policies under the acting president,"" foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said at a regular briefing. ""Our stance is to faithfully carry out agreements reached with Japan including the comfort women deal.""Last Friday, the National Assembly voted to impeach Park over a corruption scandal and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn took over as acting president.Following the vote, Rep. Choo Mi-ae, head of the major opposition Democratic Party, called for an immediate stop to the implementation of the comfort women deal saying it requires more discussion and public consensus. In December last year, South Korea and Japan reached a landmark agreement in which Tokyo apologized for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the creation of a foundation aimed at supporting the victims, euphemistically called comfort women.The deal has been hailed by the international community as the comfort women issue has been a long-standing obstacle to ties between the two neighboring countries.Victims, liberal civic groups and opposition parties have accused the government of striking the deal hastily without getting Japan's acknowledgment of legal responsibility. They also said the agreement was reached without prior consultation with the victims.The foreign ministry spokesman said that what was agreed upon between the two countries on the comfort woman issue has been faithfully implemented with diverse projects being pursued by the Seoul-based foundation launched to help support the victims.According to historians estimate, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II. Around 40 South Korean victims, mostly in their late 80s, are currently known to be alive.","impeachment of president park ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,women deal south korea ,the impeachment of president ,impeachment of president","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cho Ju']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.50421959  0.0079518

The association of Korean Americans in Maryland first proposed the idea, and the Maryland's government decided to endorse the proposal despite initial reservations and opposition from the state transportation department about naming a road after a specific nation or ethnicity.The designation was made possible thanks to strong support from the governor.Hogan, who is married to Korean-American artist Yumi Hogan and calls himself a ""hanguk sawi,"" which means a ""son-in-law of South Korea,"" has been very supportive of Korean Americans in his state.In January, Maryland also designated Jan. 13 as ""Korean-American Day"" and April 15 as ""Taekwondo Day.""Yumi Hogan, an accomplished abstract landscape painter who teaches at the Maryland Institute College of Art, is Maryland's first-ever Asian-American first lady.

The president was the now deceased Roh Moo-hyun. Key players in the 2004 parliamentary impeachment are back. But they are in different positions, this time. Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chief of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, was then leading the Millennium Democratic Party pushing for Roh’s impeachment. National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun was at that time on the floor along with his fellow Uri Party lawmakers, trying to stop the vote, though to no avail. President Park Geun-hye, then a Grand National Party lawmaker, sat in the back row of the Assembly hall as voting took place. On photos taken that day, she is seen smiling. President Roh was impeached on March 12, 2004 on charges of illegal electioneering. He was accused of violating the national election laws when he called for support for the small Uri Party, which backed the president. Brawls and loud voices erupted during the voting session, as the pro-Roh Uri members occupying the Assembly hall in a three-day sit-in were removed by security guards at the order of Speaker Rep. Park Kwan-yong. With Uri members not voting, the motion of impeachment swiftly passed in a 193-2 vote, suspending Roh of presidential powers as head of state and chief executive immediately. Prime Minister Goh Kun took charge in his stead. Following seven rounds of hearings that continued until April 30, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of the sanctioned Roh on May 14, 63 days after the impeachment bill passed the Assembly. “ was not serious or grave enough to justify the unseating of the president,” Court President Yun Young-chul said in a ruling, reinstating Roh. Nearly 60 percent of Korean citizens were against the impeachment of Roh, quite opposite to the current public sentiment calling on Park to resign over the corruption scandal. According to local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, over 78 percent of South Koreans support the impeachment of Park. But both in 2004 and 2016, citizens took to the streets to show “people power.” On March 7, 2004, the very first candlelight vigil against impeachment on Roh was held on the streets of Seoul. Some 170 people mainly from Nosamo -- the official Roh Moo-hyun camp support group -- gathered to urge South Korean lawmakers to nullify impeachment discussion, five days before the motion of impeachment was to be put for a vote.The rally soon gained momentum with over 500 civic groups, including the civic group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, joining the move.On the day the impeachment motion passed, about 12,000 people protested near the National Assembly, declaring that Roh’s impeachment was invalid. The number of people gathered to rally reached 70,000 the next day.Weekly rallies reached their peak on March 20, when at least 200,000 people took to the streets at over 50 cities across the country, according to the rally organizer. Police put the number at around 130,000 people.A month later, voters punished conservative parliamentary candidates with a victory for the Uri Party in the April 15 elections. The Uri Party won control of the National Assembly, tripling their seats to 152 to take a majority, thanks to voter fury against the impeachment.By Kim Da-sol","parliament impeached the president ,south korea parliament impeached ,hyun impeachment twelve years ,korea parliament impeached the ,impeached the president","['South Korea ’s', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Democrat']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64503217  0.23187971

The findings raised concerns that confidential information may have been compromised as the affected server is connected with the information systems of the Army, Navy and the Air Force. But the ministry said information saved on the server was not stolen.The Ministry of National Defense said a total of 3,200 computers, including 700 linked with the intranet, were contaminated with malware in the latest cyber attack, which occurred on Aug. 4. It said some military documents were hacked while refusing to provide details. The computer used by Defense Minister Han Min-koo was also affected, the official said.On Tuesday, the ministry said the IP addresses linked to the attack were traced to a location in China that has been used by North Korean hackers.""As one of the military's two integration servers was jointly linked to the internet and the intranet, it allowed the hackers to gain access to the intranet,"" a ministry official said. It is one of two servers the military operates. The other server involves information for the defense ministry, the Defense Security Command and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration .""We are still in the process of determining what data were leaked. We found the hackers infiltrated the intranet using the main server but information in the server remains intact,"" the official said. The cyber command separated the affected server from the whole network to avoid the spread of viruses in October, two months after the initial hacking attempt was made in August. It marked the first time that the data of South Korea's cyber command has been compromised. South Korea set up the command in January 2010 as part of its efforts to counter external hacking attempts on the country's military.North Korea -- which has thousands of cyberwarfare personnel -- has a track record of waging cyberattacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.Earlier this year, Seoul accused North Korea of stealing information from about 10 South Korean officials by hacking into their smartphones.Two months ago, Rep. Kim Jin-pyo, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party, claimed that the cyber command was hacked in September. He told Yonhap that the attack targeted the ""vaccine routing server"" installed at the cyber command.Kim, who is a member of the parliament's national defense committee, said that a malicious code was identified and it appears to have taken advantage of the vulnerability of the routing server.The server is tasked with security on computers that the military has for internet-connection purposes. Around 20,000 military computers are known to have been connected to the server.Kim said in October that chances are ""very low"" that the hacking led to a leak of confidential information, given that the military's intranet is not connected to the server.The defense ministry later announced it has identified the intrusion of the malicious code into the system.","attackers hack into korea ,suspected north korean attackers ,suspected nk attackers hack ,hack into korea cyber ,korean attackers accessed the","[""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Army', 'Navy', 'the Air Force']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.3751511   0.3538911

The announcement followed two days after the UN Security Council approved a new resolution in response to Pyongyang’s fifth nuclear test in September. Japan also said Friday it had decided to toughen its own sanctions on the North Korea.  Lee Suk-joon, minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, speaks at a news conference in Seoul on Friday. “By including for the first time North Korean institutions involved in coal and labor exports, which are a major source of their foreign currency revenue, we’re looking to remind the international community that having transactions with them may contribute to bolstering the North’s weapons of mass destruction capabilities,” Lee Suk-joon, minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said at a news conference. “The measures are also anticipated to have an effect in cutting funding sources that might be siphoned off for WMD development.” Under the plan, Seoul newly designated 36 high-profile North Korean officials and 35 entities subject to an asset freeze and ban on any financial transactions with South Koreans. Among the individuals are Hwang Pyong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army; Choe Ryong-hae, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party; Kim Won-hong, minister of state security; and Pak Yong-sik, minister of the People’s Armed Forces. Speculation had persisted the names may include Kim himself and his younger sister Yo-jong. But Seoul officials appear to have opted for some of Kim’s closest servants, who often accompany him on field inspections and other key events, leaving the possibility for a potential future blacklisting of the Kim dynasty. The sanctioned groups include top state organs such as the Workers’ Party, the State Affairs Commission and the party’s Central Military Commission, as well as Air Koryo, the nation’s sole airline, which is suspected of transporting overseas laborers, cash and prohibited goods. Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development, a Chinese industry machinery wholesaler based in the North Korean border region, and four of its executives were added to the roster over allegations that they have provided financial services and illicit supplies to Pyongyang. In September, Washington sanctioned the company and Beijing launched an investigation into the charges. In total, the new designations brought South Korea’s list to 79 persons and 69 organizations. In a move to further dismantle the regime’s maritime network, Seoul decided to bar foreign-flag and flag-of-convenience ships from entering the South if they had stopped at the North within the previous year – doubling the time period set out in the existing rule. The government also plans to increase its watch list of sensitive items from the current 22 to 33 by adding 11 types of minerals under the UN ban, including coal, iron, iron ore, gold and rare earth metals.Given the almost complete halt to economic and people-to-people exchanges between the two Koreas, the blacklisting would bear more symbolic implications and the government’s intention to rally other likeminded countries behind its sanctions campaign. But sources of controversy linger, with skeptics saying Seoul may have to make way for a violation of its own bans in the future when a cross-border thaw is in the offing and the sanctioned officials offer to visit the South. Hwang and Choe, who are deemed the two most powerful men after Kim, traveled to the South and held talks with top Seoul officials in October 2014 on the margins of the Incheon Asian Games. “So far North Korea has not signaled any change in its course and any intent for a denuclearization, we have no option but to continue imposing sanctions and pressure together with the international community,” Lee said when asked about the prospects for a reconciliation. “Under the current circumstances, I would say it’s inappropriate to speak of dialogue.” In Tokyo, the Japanese government introduced its own new unilateral sanctions including an expanded reentry ban on executives of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a pro-North organization better known as Chongryon, and foreign nationals engaged in illicit nuclear and missile development activities.Japan also plans to prohibit all vessels that have called at North Korean ports from accessing the archipelago country, and freeze assets of additional individuals and organizations linked with Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program. “It is a new phase of threat that North Korea has forced … Japan absolutely cannot tolerate these acts of violence,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference, referring to this year’s underground blasts and missile firings. “Japan will consider further measures depending on moves by North Korea and the international society.”The US, for its part, will unveil its own fresh sanctions package in line with the three countries’ consultations and efforts to shore up the UN resolution’s implementation, Seoul officials noted. By Shin Hyon-hee","seoul sanctions top aides ,south korea blacklisted several ,kim south korea blacklisted ,south korea blacklisted ,korea blacklisted several","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'the UN Security Council']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.59649056  0.16649732

The investigators said that Park was an accomplice to a substantial share of the crimes allegedly conducted by Choi and two of Park’s former aides, An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong. The three were indicted Sunday on charges such as abuse of power, coercion, attempted fraud and leaking government secrets.“About the president, the special investigative team decided that she had colluded with Choi in a ‘significant’ part of the crimes by Choi, An and Jeong,” said Lee Young-ryeol, chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, without specifying which of the charges Park is being accused of. “But due to an incumbent president’s Constitutional privilege that grants an exemption from prosecution, we cannot indict her.”Lee made it clear that the authorities would investigate the conservative president as a suspect, although specifics of the inquiry are still unclear as it marks the first-ever case of an incumbent president being questioned by the prosecution. Park is being suspected of allowing her civilian friend Choi -- who is a daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min -- to edit presidential documents, siphon public funds via nonprofit organizations and use their relationship for illegal benefits.Park has denied the allegations and claimed that An and the companies voluntarily helped with fundraising.“As a lawyer, I cannot accept any part of the prosecution specifying the president as an accomplice,” said Park’s attorney Yoo Yeong-ha, adding that the charges against Park were a result of “pure imagination and speculation.”Prosecution officials watch TV on Sunday as Seoul's chief prosecutor Lee Young-ryeol announces the interim results of its investigation into the Choi Soon-sil scandal involving President Park Geun-hye. “If a certain individual had attempted to benefit in the process of establishing foundations, it has nothing to do with the president. ... She did not know of Choi’s business affairs, and Choi using K-Sports and other organizations for her own gain was beyond her imagination.”He also denied accusations that the benefits given to Choi and her family had been intended to support Park, after she finishes her term as president.Yoo said that he has lost faith in the prosecution and vowed not to comply with its request to directly investigate Park, instead he said he would prepare for the investigation by an independent counsel.Cheong Wa Dae echoed Yoo’s comments, saying that the accusations were groundless, while expressing “deep regret” over the prosecution “claiming that the president had committed a grave felony.”Investigators had sought to question Park face-to-face prior to indicting Choi before the deadline Sunday, but the president insisted on being questioned the following week.  “Choi and An abused their authority over 53 member companies of the Federation of Korean Industries, forcing them to donate 77.4 billion won  for the establishment of the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation,” Lee said. He highlighted the irregular nature of the process by saying that the corporations and the amount that they were asked to donate was decided in just one week, and that the sum increased from 30 billion won to 50 billion won for no apparent reason.It has been revealed that Park convened a private meeting with heads of the seven biggest companies in the country, including Samsung, Hyundai Motor, LG, SK, CJ and Hanhwa, during which she is suspected to have urged them to participate in the fundraising. The investigators had summoned the company chiefs for questioning.  But while the arraignment said that the companies were made to feel that there was “no choice” but to give out the money, there has been suspicions that the donations were made in exchange for favors. Samsung Group in particular is suspected of contributing up to 5 billion won to the Choi family in addition to a 24 billion won donation it made to the two foundations, the biggest for any Korean firm.Choi and An have also been accused of attempting to coerce a company that acquired advertisement company Poreka, formerly an in-house firm of Posco, to give up the company to Choi’s associate Cha Eun-taek. Cha, formerly a prominent TV commercial director, has been arrested and is being investigated for charges including attempted coercion and embezzlement, as is former Korea Creative Content Agency chief Song Sung-gak.The prosecution acknowledged Choi and An forcing Lotte Group to donate 7 billion won to the K-Sports Foundation, while coercing Hyundai Motors Co. to seal deals worth 6.2 billion won and 1.1 billion won with companies owned respectively by Choi and her acquaintance.Jeong has been indicted on allegedly leaking to Choi 180 documents related to the president, including personnel details on high-ranking government officials, documents related to diplomatic matters and her overseas tour, and her speeches at Cabinet meetings and senior secretarial meetings. This also included 47 “clearly classified” files, such as data related to appointing new ministers and vice ministers.Recordings of his conversations with Park uncovered on his phone showed that he was acting under direct orders from the president. One of the files even showed the president urging Jeong to receive confirmation from Choi, whom she called “teacher.”Prosecutors continued to close in on those around Park and Choi by requesting an arrest warrant for Choi’s niece Jang Si-ho, who is suspected of coercing donations from Samsung Group to the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center that she founded. Jang is also accused of pocketing part of the funds.An arrest warrant for former Vice Culture Minister Kim Chong, who is believed to be Jang’s accomplice, has already been requested.The prosecution, however, left out the bribery charges for any of the accused. There have been calls to include bribery under the charges faced by Choi, and possibly Park, for their alleged benefit from raising tens of billions from local corporations. “We only specified charges that we can prove in the arraignment,” said an official from the prosecution. Officials did not rule out the possibility of pressing additional charges of bribery in relation to the scandal. Minor opposition People’s Party said via a statement that the prosecution should have specified Park’s role, urging the president to step down.“The reason they  left out the bribery charges I think it is because the president did not comply with the investigation but hindered the process. ... In order to prove that  conspired, the prosecution should investigate the principal offender Park and press additional charges,” said the party’s interim leader Park Jie-won.Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, claimed that there are sufficient legal grounds for Park’s impeachment and urged her to step down.By Yoon Min-sik","south korean prosecutors investigating ,korean prosecutors investigating the ,korean prosecutors investigating ,investigation south korean prosecutors ,criminal investigation south korean","['Park Geun', 'south korean', 'Park', 'Choi', 'an Chong - bum', 'Jeong Ho - seong']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55046612  0.35141644

The pact, if formally concluded, will give Japan, which is always looking for an opportunity to reinvade the peninsula, a legal way to start a war with the North, the spokesman said.

DeTrani.But Washington downplayed the meetings as an unofficial event devoid of any US government involvement, reiterating the official government stance that there will be no talks until Pyongyang demonstrates its denuclearization commitment.Participants said later that the North Korean officials repeated the country's long-running claims during last week's talks with former US officials that it needs nuclear weapons to cope with what it claims the US ""hostile policy"" towards the country.","korean diplomat handling us ,senior north korean diplomat ,korean diplomat set for ,senior korean diplomat set ,north korean diplomat","['north korean', 'US', 'american', ""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', ""North American Affairs Choe Son - hui 's"", 'Beijing', 'european', 'US']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.32649043  0.67989403

Some opposition members want the president to divorce herself from all domestic affairs and focus only on foreign matters, while others want her to stay out of government completely.These scenarios would destroy Park’s authority as president during her last 15 months in office, forcing her to voluntarily yield large parts, or maybe even all, of her presidential powers to a prime minister named by an opposition-controlled legislature. Even so, it is still unclear what the splintered assembly will decide on, or when _ or what Park will agree to. Park’s ruling party is divided between those who support Park and those who don’t, and the opposition, while having more members than the ruling party, is also split into factions. The prime minister is largely a ceremonial job, though by law he or she directs executive ministries under the order of the president and has other important rights. There have always been calls to give the office more power to balance the large role the president has. Last week Park nominated a new prime minister, but he is likely to withdraw from consideration after Park allowed the legislature to pick a new nominee. The current nominee, Kim Byong-joon, told reporters that he would be in charge of social and economic issues and fully exercise the rights as a prime minister if his nomination received parliamentary approval. Park’s office said Tuesday those conditions endorsed by Park would still stand for a new nominee.The political tug-of-war over the prime minister comes amid a scandal involving Park’s longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, who has no official government role. Investigators are looking into whether Choi made major government decisions and used her relationship with Park to force companies to donate money to two foundations controlled by Choi.Earlier Tuesday, South Korean prosecutors raided the Seoul office of Samsung Electronics, the nation’s largest and most valuable company, in connection with the scandal.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office provided no other details. The Yonhap news agency said investigators suspect Samsung gave Choi’s daughter illicit financial help.Tens of thousands of people rallied in Seoul over the weekend, demanding Park’s removal from office. Her approval ratings were, at one point, the worst of any president since South Korea gained democracy in the late 1980s. Nam Jeong-su, spokesman of Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of South Korea’s two large umbrella union groups, said he expects 150,000 anti-Park unionists, plus supporters, to gather Saturday and march to the presidential Blue House. Park’s government, meanwhile, said Tuesday she would skip an Asia-Pacific leaders’ meeting in Peru later this month. The announcement sparked media speculation that the scandal may have forced Park to cancel her plans to attend the summit, though officials said the decision was made before the scandal exploded and is aimed at focusing on how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear program.","scandal south korean president ,massive scandal south korean ,to defuse massive scandal ,her new prime minister ,korean president park geun","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53972608  0.54442728

Residence permits issued by an EU member state allow holders to stay legally in its territory for at least three months. The 2015 figure was a nosedive from 748 North Koreans in 2008, when the EU's statistical authority began to compile such data.Other comparable figures were 352 in 2009, 284 in 2010, 433 in 2011, 262 in 2012, 294 in 2013 and 339 in 2014, according to the report.The number of North Korean citizens who received residence permits for family-related reasons was 27 last year, just 16 percent of the 167 recorded in 2008, the report said. The North Korean government's control of overseas workers' family members is believed to be the main reason for the sharp drop, North Korea experts said.They said that Pyongyang has banned overseas workers from bringing their family members to third nations in order to take them as hostages amid the mounting defections abroad in recent years.A notable change is found in Britain, where Thae Yong-ho, a minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, defected to South Korea with his wife and children in August due to being disillusioned with the Kim Jong-un regime and concerns about his children's future.The number of North Koreans acquiring residence permits in Britain plunged from 294 in 2008 to 28 in 2013, 18 in 2014 and just one in 2015, the report showed.In particular, the 2008 figure included 115 family members of dispatched officials and workers.But the number of family members receiving British residence permits dropped to seven in 2011, four in 2012, five in 2013, one in 2014 and zero last year.","defections by north koreans ,korea prevents overseas workers ,north koreans staying overseas ,family members amid defections ,koreans staying overseas in","['European Union', 'North Korea', 'North Koreans', 'Eurostat', 'non - eu', 'North Koreans', 'EU']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32188359  0.2264843

Three were forced to step down, one was assassinated and another jumped to his death after retirement. Most had their legacies tainted by scandals and two of them were put behind bars.President Park Geun-hye, the only woman and unmarried leader of the 11, appears to have failed to escape the trap. With 16 months left in her five-year term, Park is facing a humiliating crisis that also threatens her job, as her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil is accused of a wide range of wrongdoings committed by using their 40-year ties.Park’s approval ratings have plunged to a level that none of her predecessors ever saw -- 5 percent according to a Gallup Korea poll released Friday. In another survey, 65 percent said they want her removal from office. The predicaments of Korean presidents trace back to the era of Rhee Syng-man, the country’s very first head of state. Idolized by conservatives for his contribution to the nation’s foundation and hated by liberals for his dictatorship, Rhee rigged the presidential election to ensure that his aide Lee Ki-poong was elected the vice president in 1960.Faced with massive public revolt, which culminated in the April 19 Movement, Rhee stepped down on April 29, 1960, after 12 years in power. He fled to Hawaii and died in exile five year later. Two more Cheong Wa Dae occupants followed suit -- Rhee’s successor Yun Po-sun and Choi Kyu-ha, who headed the country briefly from December 1979 to August the following year. One of the most dramatic endings was met by Park Chung-hee, who was fatally shot on Oct. 26, 1979, in what some say was the Korean equivalent of Brutus assassinating Caesar. He was killed by Kim Jae-gyu, then-director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and a close aide of Park, who claimed he was doing so for the sake of the country. This ended the 16-year ironfisted rule of the Army Gen. Park who seized power through a military coup. It also left the young Park Geun-hye, the incumbent president, orphaned and the country in the hands of then-Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah.The two presidents who came to occupy Cheong Wa Dae after the interim leader Choi -- Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo -- finished their terms, but they faced many troubles afterwards.Both faced retribution for their suppression of democratic movements in the 1990s. In 1994, 22 former military officials filed charges against Chun, Roh and 32 officials involved in the 1980 coup through which Chun rose to power. They were also accused of collecting a massive amount of secret funds illegally.Chun was sentenced to death for his involvement in the coup, which later was lowered to a life sentence in an appellate court, while Roh received a 17-year jail sentence. Both were put behind bars but were pardoned in 1997.The era of President Kim Young-sam, the first nonmilitary president to be elected -- began in 1993 with much hope. His approval ratings peaked at 83 percent in his first year in office. In the last year of his term, however, his ratings plummeted to just 6 percent, as South Korea’s economy was close to bankruptcy, as it had been hit hard by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It was the lowest presidential approval rating in history until President Park Geun-hye set a new record of 5 percent. While in office, Kim also saw his son being arrested on charges of receiving bribes and abusing his position as the president’s son. The next president -- Kim Dae-jung -- received the Nobel Peace prize in his third year in office, but also saw his two sons being arrested for bribery. President Roh Moo-hyun’s era was full of drama, too. Having been elected with a dramatic come-from-behind victory, the liberal politician and former human rights lawyer became the first president to face impeachment in 2004. He survived it with overwhelming public support, but saw his popularity drop sharply going into the final year of his term. After his retirement, his family members were embroiled in a bribery scandal. The intense investigation by the prosecution -- which was suspected of being politically-motivated -- resulted in Roh committing suicide in May 23, 2009. The prosecution ceased investigation after his death.President Lee Myung-bak faced a scandal even before taking office. Accused of having been involved in a stock price rigging scheme, Lee, then president-elect, underwent a prosecutorial probe and was cleared of wrongdoing. Throughout his term, the former Seoul mayor grappled with many controversies and scandals, but the biggest crisis came in 2008, when South Koreans held massive candlelight vigils to protest against his handling of a trade deal to import American beef.

""The memoir, diplomatic records of the US Embassy in South Korea, and other reports made around that time are against Moon,"" Rep. Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader of Saenuri, said. ""Even Moon's side is admitting there was some sort of contact with North Korea.This proves the  statement is false.""""Moon should stop providing 'pathetic' excuses that he does not remember what happened, and reveal the truth in front of the people,"" Chung added. Moon had described Saenuri as ""pathetic"" last week, adding it should focus on other urgent matters instead of engaging in ideological mud-slinging.","south korean conservative ruling ,north korea said monday ,korean conservative ruling party ,korean conservative ruling ,south korean conservative","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'UN', 'south korean', ""North Korea 's"", 'inter - korean', 'south korean']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.23578949  0.71832573

The archives will be updated every three months.The North has been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world, but Pyongyang has denied such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.Human rights violations in the North have been receiving renewed attention recently, with calls growing for global cooperation to shed light on people suffering from the North's oppressive regime.

One of them was Yeongdong, North Chungcheong Province. Despite having no prior connections to the area, he decided to relocate there. On Thursday, he finally moved into his new home in Yeongdong.  People visit a consulting booth at a job fair for rural regions held from June 3 to 5 in Seoul. “I got to know good people and learned about the area during my field trips with the center. I stayed there for days, examining the area,” he told The Korea Herald. Choi is among 18,000 urban dwellers who take preparation courses at the Gwinong, Gwichon Support Center annually. Established in 2012 and headquartered in Yangjae, Seoul, the center has over 5,000 instructors and extensive networks with rural governments. In Korean, Gwinong and gwichon mean a return to the rural life and agriculture.  People visit a consulting booth at a job fair for rural regions held from June 3 to 5 in Seoul. The center provides consultations, lectures and field classes. Attendees can also stay and learn about farming at its Return Farmer’s Houses in rural towns. “There is a big difference between those who have taken our courses and those who have not,” said Kim Kwi-yeong, the chief of the center, in a phone interview Thursday. “Jumping into farming without proper preparation would lead to failure,” she said. Decades after urbanization and industrialization, Korea started to see a new trend in 2006 -- people moving from cities to rural areas. A law was enacted in 2007 to support population migration for the first time. Faced with increasing calls for more systematic and practical support, the Agricultural Ministry started running consultation sessions and education courses, which led to the establishment of the Gwinong center in 2012. “Around 30 percent of the returned families have been educated in the center,” said Kim, who also returned to the rural life. She stressed the importance of education and legwork for successful resettlement in rural areas. “Beginners are so used to city lives and they face challenges when their dreamy expectations are found to be wrong,” she explained. “Living in rural areas is not a fantasy but a reality.”People should know what they want from the rural life to successfully settle down, Kim added. Living in rural areas may sound like freedom to some, but such freedom often comes with a price. “For instance, when home appliances go out of order, you often have to fix them yourself,” Kim said. “Repairmen do not come fast like they do in the cities.” People attend a farming course at Gwinong center.Aside from investing capital on buying land and farming equipment, living cost is usually cheaper in rural areas than cities. However, many forget that the income made through farming is different from what they earned in the cities and they have to adjust their spending patterns accordingly. According to the center’s data, the average cost of resettling in the countryside is 160 million won  for buying farmland and farming equipment. “Earnings are not promising when you are farming, especially when you have just started. So it is very important that you think of a five-year income plan and spend less money,” the 52-year-old Kim said. A native of Seoul, Kim had never lived in the countryside before choosing to move to Hongcheon, Gangwon Province. She was one of the first few people to relocate to the area from the city in 1978. She said she sees great value in rural regions and in farming, which she described as an act of caring for living plants. “Farming is never to be looked down on, and it is actually like running a business -- only more difficult as the environment is not full of help as it is in the cities,” said Kim. But once properly prepared, moving to a rural area can enrich your life, she added. “Life is freer and you are close to nature, for sure. People are different in a positive way, too,” she said. By Jo He-rim","old retiree in seoul ,retiree in seoul finally ,urbanites rural dream after ,rural dream after hesitating ,hurrying to real estate","['Choi Hyeong - tae', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67041594  0.28427628

Thae was the No. 2 man at North Korea's embassy in London.Thae defected to Seoul with his family in late July, making him one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials to arrive in the South.The Seoul government said it is checking relevant information to verify the report over Kung's purge.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said on Oct. 2 that the largest-ever number of elite defectors came to the South over the past eight to nine months, without revealing specific figures.A North Korean diplomat stationed in Vladivostok, Russia, is believed to have brought a considerable sum of foreign currency to South Korea when he recently defected to the South.Kim Chol-song, a third secretary at North Korea's trade mission in Russia, is also known to have escaped to Seoul in late July.North Koreans toiling in overseas countries defected to South Korea earlier this year at a time when Pyongyang has increased its labor exports to secure foreign currency.In April, a group of 17 North Koreans working at a Pyongyang-run restaurant in China made a rare group defection to the South in the wake of the UN Security Council's sanctions over the North's fourth nuclear test in January.As of end-September, the number of North Korean defectors reached about 29,830 in total, with 1,036 North Koreans having come to the South in the first nine months of this year, according to data by the Ministry of Unification.Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at the ministry, said that Seoul is preparing to overhaul the resettlement system for defectors as the number of such people is set to top the 30,000 mark.President Park Geun-hye said Tuesday that the government should review the current policy for defectors and come up with a system that can ""sufficiently"" embrace North Koreans coming to the South.Early this month, Park said South Korea will keep the road open for North Koreans to find new hope and lives in the South.","korea spy agency defected ,official defected to korea ,defected to korea last ,spy agency official defected ,defection by north korean","[""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'the Ministry of State Security', 'Pyongyang', 'north Korean']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.46399802  0.20999895

But late last year, the two sides agreed to settle the matter under a deal that entails Tokyo's provision of financial assistance and apology for the atrocities committed.    At the meeting, Sakakibara asked Park to visit Japan later this year for a trilateral summit that also involves the leaders of Japan and China.   ""I hope that President Park can make her first visit to Japan on the occasion of the trilateral summit slated to take place this year in Japan,"" Sakakibara was quoted by Park's aide as saying. He also invited her to a trilateral business summit that the business circles of the three nations have been preparing.   Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo have been discussing the issue of holding the trilateral summit. In November, the three nations held their summit in Seoul.   The president also used the meeting to urge the Japanese business leaders to expand their investment, while outlining Seoul's policy efforts to make South Korea an attractive investment destination, which include building regulation-free zones, cutting taxes and offering incentives for foreign investors.    The latest meeting follows the chief executive holding talks with some members of the Japanese business group in December 2014. At the time, she touched on ways to bolster two-way trade and mutual investment.   Founded in 1946, Keidanren is one of Japan's top three economic organizations. As of March 31, it consisted of 1,336 Japanese firms, 156 industrial associations and 32 regional economic groups.","diversify south korean president ,on japanese business delegation ,business delegation to diversify ,japanese business delegation to ,japanese business delegation","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese', 'the Japanese Business Federation', 'Keidanren', 'Park']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62451398  0.62753087

Currently talks are underway at the United Nations Security Council  to penalize the North following its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9.On arrival on Saturday the ambassador said she wanted to directly hear the plight of those that have fled the North, and based on what she learned, go back to New York to negotiate fresh sanctions with other countries.She had said it is deplorable that the North Korean regime threatens and abuses its people.""The world has done a much better job in shining the spotlight on those crimes in recent years and I am here also to meet people who have suffered under the North Korean regime's rule,"" she said after her arrival. ""We also seek to shine the world spotlight on the worst crimes with really no parallel in this world,"" she added.Besides going to Hanawon, Powers is set to tour the truce village of Panmunjom on the inter-Korean border, which is expected to send a strong message of Washington's resolve to the North.She had urged North Korea to stop any further nuclear provocations, stressing that the world will ""not be intimidated"" by any actions taken by the Kim Jong-un regime. ""Now we are looking to see what more can be done because, of course, another test was carried out at the beginning of September,"" she said. ""This must stop. We are not intimidated by the actions of the government of North Korea.""Power's visit, meanwhile, takes place amid growing concerns that Pyongyang could carry out yet another major military provocation to mark the anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers' Party and the 10th anniversary of its first nuclear test.Seoul said that Powers is expected to meet Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo on Monday to discuss what actions can be taken against the North, and may hold talks with senior officials from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.","korean defectors on sunday ,defectors on sunday official ,defectors on sunday ,korean defectors ,north korean defectors","['the United States', 'the United Nations', 'north korean', 'Samantha Power', 'Seoul', 'Hanawon', 'Anseong', 'south korean', 'North Koreans']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53109699  0.77241099

As the No. 2 man at the mission he has become one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials to have defected to the South.Seoul's unification ministry cited Thae's reasons for defection as disillusionment with the regime under Kim Jong-un and aspiration for a liberal democracy. Worries over his children's future were also factored into his decision.Kim Chol-song, a third secretary at North Korea's trade mission in Russia, is known to have defected to the South with his family in late July. A ranking health ministry official stationed at North Korea's mission in Beijing is also believed to have recently come to Seoul.Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said that the largest-ever number of elite defectors came to the South over the past eight to nine months.""It means even the privileged class thinks that there is no hope in North Korea,"" Yun told a TV program last week.Experts said with the number of defectors set to surpass the30,000 mark, the government should refine its resettlement policy to help them better assimilate into the South.""The purpose of the policy has changed from providing protection to helping defectors stand on their own feet,"" said researcher Kim at the KINU.

A former ranking official of the Workers’ Party, who defected to Seoul via a third state last year and moved to Washington recently, is likely to take the leadership post, the report said.  South Korea’s Unification Ministry, mostly occupied with the possibility of another imminent missile launch by the North, made no official statement on the proposed government in exile.But a ministry official said South Korea, in accordance with the Constitution, wouldn’t recognize the legal status of the incoming exile government. “Acknowledging the NK exile government would mean that the South Korean government takes North Korea as a foreign state, which would then contradict our Constitution,” an official of the ministry told reporters.Article 3 of the Constitution states that the Republic of Korea’s territory comprises the “Korean Peninsula” and its annexed islands, thereby including North Korea in its domain and denying the legitimacy of the North Korean regime.Han Myung-sub, North Korean issue expert in the Korean Bar Association, also predicted that the US and other countries would not approve of the legitimacy of the exile government “as long as North Korea remains a member of the United Nations.”He nevertheless suggested that the international society may choose to acknowledge an entity founded by defectors, in an unspoken support of the democratization movement for the reclusive communist regime.According to the report, the exile government will adopt liberal democracy as its political doctrine, while embracing Chinese economic reform as its economic focus, the latter intended to induce a favorable response from the Chinese government.The idea of creating a political entity to stand up to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has apparently gained momentum in the wake of the recent chain of defections by government officials, including a deputy ambassador in London in August.“The initial plan was to announce the establishment  by the end of this year, but the timeline was delayed for financial and procedural reasons,” the defector said.The number of North Korean defectors here, having reached 29,288 as of April this year, is expected to pass the 30,000 mark within the month, according to ministry data.Also, the US Department of State said earlier this week that 14 North Korean defectors entered the US as refugees over the past year, raising the total number to 200.By Bae Hyun-jung","korean defectors to establish ,10 chiefs of defectors ,north korean defectors ,by north korean defectors ,exile plan south korean","['south korean', 'north korean', 'the United States', 'Washington DC', 'DongA Ilbo', 'Fr']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51108181  0.22709966

""If Yoo returns to South Korea and resumes activities, it will demoralize soldiers who are devoting themselves to serving the country, while provoking teenagers to evade the conscription,"" the Seoul Administrative Court said in the ruling, adding that his entry could have an adverse impact on social cohesion.Yoo triggered a backlash by repeatedly promising to fulfill his military duty although in reality he won a US citizenship in 2002. This move allowed him to skirt his duties. All able-bodied South Korean men between the ages of 18 and 35 must serve in the military for about two years.

48,48,48,Debate over voluntary military roils Korea,"In 1949, South Korea’s first President Syngman Rhee introduced military conscription for the first time upon liberation from Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945).

In 1951, the system, which was suspended in 1950, was reinstated during the Korean War. Since then, every Korean able-bodied man has been mandated to serve in the military for between 21 and 24 months. In doing so, they constitute the backbone of the armed forces with 640,000 active in duty and 4.3 million as reserve forces. Now, the mandatory military service is being thrust into the spotlight again as some prominent politicians are questioning whether the system reflects new socioeconomic challenges and proposing to replace it with what they see as more modernized voluntary military service. Spearheading these voices is Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the ruling Saenuri Party. The 51-year-old politician, who is also hailed as one of the flag-bearers of the Saenuri Party in advance of the 2016 presidential campaign, said he would adopt the voluntary system if elected president. “The current mandatory system cannot defend South Korea,” said the governor during a meeting with local reporters Wednesday. “The solution is to create a strong but small military -- something that young people want to join as opposed to being forced to.”He laid out a series of options for his initiative: a transformation to a voluntary system by 2022; reduction of the total number of armed forces to 300,000; and offering enlisted soldiers monthly payment of 2 million won , roughly equivalent to the monthly wages of low-ranking public workers. His proposal is based on the idea that South Korea’s low birthrate will lead to a shortfall in manpower available for conscription by 2020 -- the year he said Korea would face dramatic declines both in population and consumption.The Ministry of National Defense expects the number of draftees -- mostly in their 20s -- would be reduced from the current 350,000 to 250,000 by 2020. The number is far below the ministry’s goal to secure 520,000 in personnel in accordance with the military reform plan published in 2014. Another reason for an end to the draft is the physical and mental abuse prevalent among military units, said Nam. According to data from the Army in 2015, about 1 in 10 candidates were deemed unfit to serve and the number of those who were dishonorably discharged rose from 1,419 in 2013 to 3,328 in 2014.  “Maintaining more than 500,000 Army conscripts requires even those with physical and mental issues to be sent to the military,” said Nam. “In order to maintain the current level, we have to send all of the draftees with medical conditions to the Army and even extend their service period.” This is not the first time the idea of a voluntary force has made headlines in South Korea. In 2012, Rep Kim Doo-kwan of what is now The Minjoo Party of Korea had vowed to cut in half the number of armed forces to 300,000 if he won the 2012 presidential election. But his proposal was immediately rebuked by political circles worried about two Korea’s armistice condition. Two years later, the issue came to the fore again amid public outrage over the death of a 23-year-old Army private first class, who had suffered from severe assault and abusive treatment at the hands of his comrades in his barracks in 2014. But the idea has often been dismissed by military officials and security experts as unrealistic. The Defense Ministry said earlier this year that the government should take a “cautious” approach to a voluntary system and that cutting personnel to 300,000 is “impossible” given the threat posed by North Korea. “It is too early to discuss a voluntary military,” said Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn when asked by lawmakers Tuesday during the interpellation session. The government maintained it should retain the current level of military personnel in the event of ground warfare with North Korea. “A mandatory system is still crucial as the two Koreas are still at war,” said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Security and Defense Forum. “Ultimately, the war can end only when infantry troops move in and take control of the battlefield.” He asserted that South Korea must maintain at least 400,000 in armed forces to defend itself against North Korea, which reportedly has a force up to 1.2 million strong -- unless the South has a system in which all able citizens over a certain age can be considered troops and mobilized in a wartime situation, such as countries like Israel. Some experts said that the government cannot afford a voluntary military whose annual cost could range from 4 trillion to 7 trillion won. And the additional cost, they warned, would divert resources from investing more money in developing high-tech military equipment against North Korea’s nuclear threat.   Shin In-kyun, the president of the Korea Defense Network, said in a local newspaper the voluntary system would cost as much as 10 trillion won because it includes pay raises for all military personnel, including officers, and improvement to equipment. He also warned that there is no ample incentive to attract enough soldiers in the nation where military service is still considered a “traumatic” experience for many. “I don’t think the government would recruit even half of what they expect under the monthly salary that is being discussed,” he said. Such a voluntary system with low incentives would create a situation in which only the children of poor families would end up shouldering the burden of military service while those of rich families would avoid it, said Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the Saenuri Party, who had chaired the parliamentary defense committee. “From the perspective of justice, it is an intolerable system,” said Yoo during his lecture at a college in Seoul earlier this month. “While maintaining the draft system, we need to recruit more noncommissioned officers and develop more weapons.” The lawmakers at the National Assembly’s Defense Committee also mostly held skeptical views of the voluntary system. The ruling Saenuri Party and opposition parties alike said that while they acknowledged the need for the system, it is too early to adopt a full-fledged voluntary system. “A voluntary system is a step in the right direction, but not now,” said Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Saenuri Party, chairman of the defense committee. “South Korea is still technically at war and voluntary military could push the burden onto low-income and ill-educated families.” Rep. Kim Joong-ro of the People’s Party, a former army general who represents opposition parties on the committee, said the ongoing discussion over the voluntary system amounts to “populism” targeting the 2016 presidential election. “I understand the need for the voluntary system, but the current development strikes me as populism,” Kim said. “Instead of a voluntary system, the government should prepare for military reform.”Public opinion remains split over voluntary military service and results varied depending upon pollsters conducting the survey. A survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter showed on Sep. 8 that 27 percent approved the voluntary system, with about 62 percent opposing the move. Local media outlet Moneytoday’s survey on Sept. 12 showed that some 51 percent approved the step, while about 44 percent opposed it.

""The general specifically checked how South Korea employs the artillery system in its units,"" the official said. The Finnish officer was in the country and took part in the Defense Expo Korea 2016 that was held for four days at the KINTEX exhibition hall in Goyang, northwest of Seoul, from Sept. 7.Toivonen's trip coincides with moves by the Finnish Defense Forces to adopt a new artillery system to enhance its fighting capability. Helsinki is in the process of replacing its aging artillery pieces with new weapons from 2020 through 2030, with the South Korean K-9 being one of the contenders.Photo taken on Sept. 18, a pair of K-9 self-propelled howitzers from South Korea's 28th Infantry Division conduct a live fire exercise near Yeoncheon, north of Seoul. ""The K-9 has received high marks in past evaluations because of its high degree of mobility even in South Korea's mountainous terrain and its proven capabilities in combat,"" a defense ministry official said.Seoul fielded the K-9 from 2000 onwards to augment its older K-55 systems. The tracked self-propelled artillery, with a top speed of 67 kilometers per hour, can hit targets over 40 kilometers away with extended-range shells and fire upwards of six rounds in one minute. The K-9 has also engaged numerous North Korean targets in the past after the reclusive country attacked South Korea.Hanwha Techwin Co., the producer of the K-9, secured export orders from Turkey and Poland with industry insiders predicting possible headway with India as well. There have been reports that Denmark and Norway may be examining the K-9 for their own armies too.Besides the Finnish general, local arms manufacturers said that many foreign military leaders showed considerable interest in South Korean made arms.Military brass from Morocco visited the land systems arm of Kia Motors Corp. in Gwangju, while Nepal's army chief of staff showed considerable interest when he toured a local small arms manufacturer.""Some eight Army heads and other top brass were present at DX Korea that led to some 150 sales-related talks being held,"" a local company executive, who wanted to remain anonymous, said.A total of 157 local weapons manufacturers took part in the exhibition along with 32 foreign companies, with 126,000 visiting the venue, organizers said.","army commander reviews korean ,army toured south korean ,commander reviews korean unit ,finnish army commander reviews ,commander reviews korean","['Finland', 'south korean', 'scandinavian', 'k-9', 'Seppo Toivonen', 'Army', 'South Kore']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43275443  0.31525216

Also in attendance were the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the People's Party -- Chung Jin-suk, Woo Sang-ho and Park Jie-won, respectively. The three floor leaders have been accompanying Chung on the trip to the U.S. in a rare show of parliamentary unity.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system has emerged as one of the hottest political issues in South Korea after the government announced a joint decision with the U.S. in July to place the system to cope better with the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea.Critics of the decision claim the system is not effective in defending against North Korean missiles and its deployment would sour the countries' relations with China and Russia at a time when their cooperation is necessary to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.During the meeting with Ryan, Chung said that South Korea's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that strengthening the alliance with the U.S. is the basis of South Korea's security and that U.N. sanctions on North Korea are necessary, according the spokesman.On the issue of North Korea, Chung also told Ryan that in the wake of Pyongyang's fifth nuclear test, some South Koreans have raised calls for the country's own nuclear armament while others have called for greater efforts to restart dialogue with the North.Ryan said in response that the U.S. is greatly concerned about the North's nuclear test. He also called for effective sanctions on the North and greater diplomatic efforts to draw Chinese cooperation in reining in Pyongyang, according to the spokesman.The two sides also exchanged views on the free trade agreement between the two countries. Chung said the trade deal has been beneficial to both countries, and Ryan stressed the importance of carrying out the pact completely.After the meeting, Ryan issued a statement, saying, ""Strong U.S.-Korea economic and defense ties are critical to the safety and prosperity of both nations, as well as broader stability in the peninsula. I appreciated the opportunity to reaffirm our alliance with the delegation this afternoon.""Later, Chung held a lunch meeting with a group of House lawmakers, including Rep. Ed Royce , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Eliot Engel , the committee's Democratic leader, as well as Rep. Charles Rangel , a Korean War veteran.""Be sure no matter who's elected, as has happened in the past, we all treasure our friendship and our alliance with South Korea. That is a friendship and alliance that cuts across the political board. We all understand how important it is,"" Engel said at the meeting.Royce said that the Korea-U.S. alliance has never been stronger.The chairman also pledged to make efforts to increase pressure on North Korea.""We are going to work internationally to try to make certain that other countries in the region and around the world comply with a new UN sanctions so as to cut off the funding that otherwise could go for further expansion of these expensive nuclear programs in North Korea,"" he said.Later in the day, the three floor leaders -- Chung Jin-suk, Woo Sang-ho and Park Jie-won -- said at a meeting with South Korean correspondents that U.S. congressional leaders have all assured that the Korea-U.S. alliance will remain strong whoever is elected the next U.S. president.""U.S. congressional leaders told us clearly that what is being said ahead of the election is for campaign purposes,"" Chung of the ruling Saenuri Party said.

YonhapTuncak also blamed the South Korean government for dragging on investigations into related companies’ criminal charges regarding deaths from toxic humidifier disinfectants, as well as lack of access to an effective remedy for all victims.In May, former CEOs and officials at Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014 -- were arrested by the prosecution and fined for falsely advertising their product as “safe to humans.”Currently, the Ministry of Environment acknowledges victims classified into categories 1 and 2 -- mostly those with severe respiratory related diseases -- to be under state supervision and receive compensation. Civic groups have argued that certain health illnesses can have a long latency period.The report also criticized companies’ sales of toxic humidifier disinfectants that were “without adequate investigation of their risks to human health and life.”“Businesses have the responsibility to respect human rights. Business enterprises are expected to carry out human rights due diligence in order to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address their impacts on human rights,” it added.In addition to the recent announcement by RB Korea in May regarding their commitment to ensure that the victims have access to an effective remedy, the report suggested the company provide a sincere apology to all victims and provide due compensation.It also suggested RB Korea establish a permanent commemoration at a location of significance and implement measures that will prevent a recurrence of similar incidents as well as share mistakes made and lessons learned with the global community so that other governments and businesses can avoid similar mistakes.By Kim Da-sol","apology the south korean ,apologize to all victims ,korean government should step ,benckiser should sincerely apologize ,south korean government should","['south korean', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'United Nations', 'Baskut Tuncak', 'UN']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52005553  0.67931968

55,55,55,[EYE] Job mismatch challenges Korean labor market,"When David Swan, an expert with 10 years of experience in the recruitment industry, came to Korea, he was surprised to see Korean job candidates entering the labor force relatively later than its neighboring Asian countries.

Swan, who h...","When David Swan, an expert with 10 years of experience in the recruitment industry, came to Korea, he was surprised to see Korean job candidates entering the labor force relatively later than its neighboring Asian countries. What he witnessed in Korea was a large number of young job seekers, who are highly educated and overqualified, aiming for jobs that are in short supply or waiting for a job they want. Swan, who has served as managing director of global recruitment consulting firm Robert Walters‘ Korea and Japan Office, pointed to the growing mismatch between young people’s career expectations and available jobs as one of the biggest challenges facing the Korean labor market in an interview with The Korea Herald. David Swan, managing director of global recruitment consulting firm Robert Walters‘ Korea and Japan Office Robert Walters Korea, a Seoul branch of the London-based outsourcing firm, has provided recruitment services to local job candidates and clients -- mostly Seoul-based foreign firms and foreign embassies -- in various industries since its opening in 2010. “I think the expectations that the young generation brings to the workforce are not realistic,” Swan said. “A lot of their expectations about life at workplaces have been built around examples like Facebook and Google. They imagine that workplaces would be about coming up with the greatest ideas to change the world.” According to him, easier access to information on the back of the high-speed internet has worsened a mismatch between the supply of graduates and employers’ needs, not only in Korea, but also around the world. “This generation didn’t have to not know anything. As soon as they don‘t know anything, they go to the internet. So they need to be certain when they  get the first promotion or become a CEO of their companies,” he said. “But the current  structure cannot provide a lot of the certainty they desire and that’s why the millennial generation quits a job so quickly.” In South Korea, nearly one in three newly hired employees  quit within a year, according to a 2016 survey on 306 firms by the Korea Employer’s Federation. The poll showed that 49.1 percent of them left work after failing to adapt to their companies, followed by those discontent with the pay and welfare  and those unhappy with their work environment . The mismatch in Korea might be more extreme, due to a social atmosphere focusing on years-long higher education and worries over poor working conditions at small and medium-sized companies. According to a survey on 11,155 SMEs released last year by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Resources, 95.3 percent of the job vacancies were concentrated in the companies with less than 500 employees. A survey by a recruitment firm Saramin this year found that 8 in 10 companies had not been able to hire enough people. Of them, 34.6 percent said that they could not even fill 10 percent of their job vacancies. For job seekers, employment stability  and salary  were the biggest reasons behind their reluctance to enter jobs at SMEs, according to another survey by a job search engine Job Korea on 1,231 job seekers. Swan advised job seekers to lower their expectations slightly. Unlike some young CEOs who did not have to work their way up with their innovative business models, in reality, most people should put in years of hard work and get on with what they do to move up the corporate ladder and achieve success, he said. “The government should also offer better career education to inform them of job opportunities while providing support to improve working conditions and prospects and SMEs,” he said. To boost the productivity of workers and create more jobs for women and youth, the South Korean labor market and company culture should become more flexible and performance-based, Swan pointed out. “The labor market here is very rigid and overprotects permanent employees,” he said, advocating the Korean government’s push for labor market reforms. The right-wing Saenuri Party put forward bills to reduce working hours, expand industries where irregular workers can be hired and extend the contract length of workers, though they have been stalled at the parliament. “If companies cannot get rid of underperforming employees, each hiring becomes a big risk. They then hire temporary workers to avoid the risk,” he said. “Overprotecting permanent employees and reducing the amount of contract workers cannot go together.”“If companies are able to fire people who are not performing well in the job and hire new people who are more fit and enthusiastic about the job, it would increase productivity and generate more jobs overall.”For the Korean economy to survive in the years to come, Asia’s fourth largest economy needs to learn from the mistakes its neighbor Japan has made and the steps it has taken, he stressed. “I think the Korean job market has a lot of similarities with Japan. The closest things are that both countries are very hierarchical, seniority-based in terms of promotion and salaries. They underutilize their female workforce and face issues with an aging society,” said Swan, who has also headed Robert Walters’ Japan Office since 2009. “In Japan, the workforce began to shrink a couple of years ago. In Korea, it will start sometime between 2020 and 2030. Korea‘s working population will drop much faster than Japan’s has,” he said. “I think Korea should start to think now about accepting migrant workers and maximizing the use of female workforce.”Amid the falling birth rate, South Korea will need to receive 1.6 million immigrants by 2020 and 11.8 million by 2050 to offset the fall in the economically active population, a 2014 report by Korea Economic Institute showed. “In many ways Japanese companies are moving faster than their Korean counterparts when it comes to internationalization. They use more English at the workplace and implement progressive polices for women and sexual minorities, for example,” he said. In the age of robots and Artificial Intelligence, the recruitment expert assured that people do not have to fear job losses. “Jobs will disappear and will be recreated. Looking back on history, new jobs have sprung up when jobs have been replaced by computers. There are plenty of opportunities for new jobs to rise,” he said. It is probably high time to ditch an idea of lifetime jobs and learn to redefine their careers every few years as changes are inevitable, he pointed out. “Once you started as an accountant, you retired as an accountant doing the same sort of work. But I don’t think that will exist anymore. It is an old-fashioned idea that you graduate from university and you stop receiving education,” he said. “As time goes on, people need to redefine their skills on a regular basis,” he said. “People should keep an eye on what’s going on and challenge themselves with new things to survive.”By Ock Hyun-ju","job mismatch challenges korean ,korean job candidates entering ,korean job candidates ,challenges korean labor market ,see korean job candidates","['David Swan', 'Korea', 'korean', 'asian', 'Korea', 'Swan']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39195526  0.39500013

The list could put pressure on those countries to end such practices at a time when labor export has become an increasingly important source of hard currency for Pyongyang.The 23 countries are Angola, Burma, Cambodia, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Laos, Poland, Malaysia, Malta, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Senegal, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.About 50,000-60,000 North Koreans are believed to be toiling overseas, mainly in the mining, logging, textile and construction industries. The average wage was stated as $120 to $150 per month, but in most cases employing firms paid salaries directly to the North's government.The North reportedly receives more than $100 million from this system per year.They are also reportedly forced to work usually between 12 and16 hours, and sometimes up to 20 hours, per day, with only one or two rest days per month. Health and safety measures are often inadequate, and workers are given insufficient food.The report is the latest in a series of measures by Washington to increase pressure on Pyongyang over its human rights record. In July, the US imposed its first-ever sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for his role in the country's human rights violations.""The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is one of the world's most repressive countries,"" the State Department said in the latest report. ""The government seeks to dominate all aspects of its citizens' lives, and it restricts the exercise of fundamental freedoms, including freedoms of expression, religion, peaceful assembly, association and movement.""The department outlined its strategy for addressing the situation in the North, largely in three categories: efforts to promote international awareness of the abuses in the North, including helping defectors to share their experiences; providing outside information to North Korean people; and promoting accountability among North Korean officials.""Those responsible for serious human rights violations in the DPRK must be held accountable,"" the department said. ""While full accountability is a long-term goal, we continue to seek opportunities to promote accountability and to remind DPRK officials that they will be held responsible for their actions.""July's US blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim and his aides was part of such efforts, it said. The department vowed to ""continue to collect and evaluate information with the goal of identifying more individuals, at all levels, associated with human rights abuses.""In a section about countries that forcibly repatriate North Korean refugees, the report only said that there were reports this year that North Korean refugees were arrested in Vietnam and handed over to Chinese authorities, and that non-governmental organizations continue to report that repatriations took place along the China-North Korea border.North Korea has long been labeled as one of the worst human rights violators. The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information. But the North has bristled at such criticism, calling it a US-led attempt to topple its regime.","host north korean laborers ,23 countries host korean ,korean laborers state department ,world host north korean ,countries host korean laborers","['north korean', 'US State Department', 'China', 'Russia', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Congress', 'US']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60702091  0.74793315

Thae is believed to come from the top echelons of North Korean society and was trusted by the regime.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reportedly ordered the dispatch of agents and even sought alliances with organized gangs in those regions to launch a terror attack against or kidnap South Korean citizens in retaliation for a series of high-profile defections of North Koreans.According to a source on Sunday, the Thae Yong-ho case seems to have added fuel to the fire. Various signs point to moves to harm South Korean nationals having increased since Seoul confirmed last week that the diplomat has arrived in the country.Accordingly, safety alerts have issued by Seoul, particularly among South Koreans living in China and those traveling to North Korea-China border areas. ""I can't give out the full details but the North Korean leadership has been infuriated over the series of recent incidents,"" the source said. ""For North Korea, provocative acts that won't leave any trace will be the easiest, like hiring local gangsters to commit a terrorist attack,"" the source claimed, adding that border areas with lax security are prone to such covert operations. In April, a South Korean missionary was killed in Changbai in Jilin Province, China, which was believed to be committed by three North Korean secret agents.Amid heightened security risks, the number of South Korean tourists to Mount Paekdu, the highest mountain on the Korean Peninsula situated on North Korea’s border with China, has fallen to half in 2016 of what it was a year ago.According to travel agencies in China on Sunday, the number of South Korean tourists to the mountain region used to be around 2,000-3,000 a day, but this year the number dropped to less than half.Normally, more than 15,000 Chinese and foreign tourists used to visit the mountain daily, and South Koreans made up nearly 80 percent of the foreign travelers.""In the runup to the peak season of July and August we used to receive inquiries from April. But this year, the number trickled to less than half,"" said one staff member at a travel agency. ""The dramatic drop was largely due to the rumors that North Korea was preparing a terror attack on South Koreans.""A worker at another travel company said, ""When our South Korean partner companies ask if it is safe to travel here, we feel helpless because we can't guarantee absolute safety for the travelers.""Since a spate of high-profile defections by North Koreans and the subsequent deterioration of inter-Korean relations, Seoul repeatedly issued travel warnings to travel agencies and individuals against visiting the mountain.Seoul's consulate in Shenyang has issued such warnings five times to South Koreans living in China.","terror threats by pyongyang ,terrorist attacks on south ,attacks on south korean ,considering terrorist attacks ,pyongyang against south koreans","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'China', 'east asian', 'Seoul', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'north korean', 'London']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.59502745  0.55121231

Thae’s defection is the latest in the recent string of defections by the North’s elite group. The North Korean Embassy in London where Thae Yong-ho had worked Local media, citing sources, has reported that Thae and his wife are both descendants of guerillas who fought against Japanese colonialists in the 1930s, which would make them members of highly-privileged families. According to the source, Thae’s family ties had allowed him to work in overseas missions for 10 years, instead of the conventional three.While the report pinpointed former North Korean Gen. Thae Byung-ryul as the supposed father of the diplomat, the Unification Ministry said Thae’s parentage has yet to be officially confirmed.  Thae’s reason for defection was mainly his disdain toward the Kim’s regime and concerns for his family’s future, the ministry said.Experts say Thae’s defection is likely to have a significant impact on Kim’s regime, as sources have said that the young leader has “become enraged” and has ordered families of overseas officials to return to North Korea.Thae Yong-ho during an interview in 2004 Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Seoul’s Dongguk University, said that the regime’s unstable nature may have contributed in some part to the defection, along with recent sanctions. “ is mostly psychological. The very fact that a high-ranking diplomat has defected deals a blow to the Kim regime, which is barely hanging on amid international sanctions and pressure,” He said.Defection by someone from the privileged class marks a change from the past, when it was usually the underprivileged that would leave the communist state.The South Korean government has claimed that such defections from the elite group -- who have better access to the outside world -- implies that they are losing faith in the leadership and also that a fallout among members of the core group are taking place. It has also said such defections shows that the recent UN sanctions against Pyongyang is working.“It is quite natural for a North Korean diplomat to defect, as they are able to compare South and North Koreas while residing outside the country. I think high-ranking officials living outside North Korea will continue to defect,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute. According to the report “Understanding of North Korea” by the state-run Institute for Unification Education, the communist country’s people are divided into three classes and 51 subcategories. The de facto caste system was initiated during the reign of Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong-un, in 1958 and was established in 1970s after years of verification process on whether each citizen was loyal to the dictatorial regime.The elite group makes up roughly 30 percent of the population. It includes Kim family and high-ranking officials of the government and the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Most of them live in Pyongyang and enjoy benefits which the majority of the population are deprived of.The middle class consists of ordinary citizens such as office workers, teachers, merchants and naturalized citizens from other countries. Many of them live in rural areas or smaller countries, and cannot travel to the capital without special permits.The bottom 20 percent are the ones who have been branded as “traitors” by the reclusive regime and are deprived of many basic rights, such as the right to receive higher education, join the ruling party or become a military officer. Some are even subject to isolation and forceful labor.While some experts have predicted the recent incident will spark a rush of even more high-profile defections, others warned against wishful thinking that the defections prelude the Kim regime’s fall. “It is too rash to believe that the Kim leadership is faltering, just because a handful of elites have jumped ship,” said Cheong. “In order for the Kim regime to be truly under crisis, large-scale protests and uprising by the public has to take place. Yet the North’s reclusive system is repressing even the smallest of organized movements.”He pointed out that the 1997 defection of a former WPK secretary Hwang Jang-yop failed to disrupt the dictatorial regime of North Korea.While the Unification Ministry has seen Thae’s defection as a sign that Kim Jong-un is cornered, Kim of Dongguk University called such views “too far-fetched.” “I don’t think it will prompt a chain reaction of North Korean elites defecting, it’s premature to predict such phenomenon. Thae’s defection is probably an independent event,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","korean diplomat recent defection ,north korean diplomat recent ,diplomat recent defection ,downfall seoul unification ministry ,korean diplomat recent","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul ’s Unification Ministry', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'London', 'South Korea', 'Thae ’s']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38716888  0.50971633

The North's diplomat Thae, his wife and children have recently defected to South Korea, making him one of the highest-level North Koreans to desert the repressive regime, South Korea's unification ministry said Wednesday. As minister, he was the No. 2 man at the diplomatic mission there.""A North Korean diplomat usually works in overseas missions for three years, but Thae had worked in London for 10 years, mainly because of his good family ties,"" the source said.Born in 1916, Thae's father, a former member of the ruling party's central committee, served as a general for the Korean People's Army  before his death in 1997.O Hye-son, Thae's wife, is also known as a descendant of O Peak-ryong who also joined the anti-Japanese guerrilla activities with the communist country's founder, according to another source.The senior O died at the age of 70 in 1984.She is believed to be a close relative of O Kum-chol, vice chief of the KPA General Staff, who is the son of O Peak-ryong, it added.Seoul's unification ministry declined to confirm the family background of Thae and his wife.Thae's high-profile defection is seen as a sign that more North Korean elites may follow suit in the face of the iron-fist rule by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and tougher international sanctions.Seoul's unification ministry said that Thae defected to Seoul due to his disillusionment with the North's regime under the incumbent leader and aspiration for freedom. The diplomat may have chosen to defect for a better future for his children.The 55-year-old Thae was known to have been in charge of promoting North Korea's national image in Britain in the face of international sanctions.Foreign media reports said that he was scheduled to return to North Korea this summer after a 10-year-stay in London.The South Korean government refused to unveil details over Thae including how and when his family came to South Korea. A ministry official said that as Thae was exposed to various information outside North Korea, he might have realized that there is no hope in North Korea.""I think that his defection may serve as a starting point in cracking internal solidarity in the Kim Jong-un regime,"" the official said, asking not to be named.He said that what causes more North Koreans to escape their home country is becoming more varied at a time when some are seeking to defect to Seoul for a better life, not because of political persecution in the North.Seoul said Thae, who was initially thought to have sought asylum in a third country, is one of the most senior North Korean diplomats to have defected to Seoul so far.In 1997, Jang Sung-gil, the then North Korean ambassador to Egypt, sought asylum in the United States, with his elder brother, a North Korean diplomat based in France.Thae's defection is widely expected to anger the North's leader, who has been strengthening his reign of terror by killing numerous government and military officials since taking power in late 2011, analysts said.Analysts said that the diplomat's defection would have a psychological impact on the North's elite group, given his status, but its effect may not be large enough to rattle the North's regime.""Thae might have had huge difficulty in doing his job to promote North Korea in the face of tough sanctions including Washington's blacklisting of the North's leader over human rights abuses,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.Cheong said that his escape would have some impact in terms of agitating Pyongyang's elite members, but it is not likely to hit the North Korean regime hard as shown in the case of Hwang Jang-yop's defection. Hwang is the highest-ranking North Korean ever to defect to South Korea.Hwang, who was said to have tutored former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, defected to Seoul in 1997 after serving high-level posts in North Korea including a secretary of the ruling Workers' Party. He died in 2010.Thae's defection came after a group of 13 North Koreans who worked at a restaurant in China run by North Korea defected to South Korea en masse in April. In June, three more North Korean restaurant employees working in China escaped to Seoul.","top north korean diplomat ,diplomat defector wife ,diplomat defector wife from ,descendants of prominent guerrillas ,his wife who defected","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'japanese', 'Thae Yong - ho', ""North Korea 's"", 'London', 'Thae Pyong -']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.75274879  0.30112481

Human Rights Council and UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to protect North Korean refugees and find durable solutions for them,"" Adams said.South Korea said Thae is believed to have defected to Seoul due to his disillusionment with the North's regime under Kim Jong-un and aspiration for freedom. It also said that the case shows the North's ruling elites see no hope and the regime's internal solidarity is weakening.North Korean officials and workers at foreign countries are hard pressed to repatriate money in the face of tougher international sanctions, and this is exerting considerable pressure.In April, a group of 13 North Koreans who worked at a Pyongyang-run restaurant in the Chinese eastern port city of Ningbo defected to South Korea en masse. In June, three more North Korean restaurant employees working in China escaped to Seoul.","korean refugees and asylum ,protecting north korean refugees ,north korean refugees ,unification announced earlier wednesday ,defected to south korea","['the United States', 'north korean', ""the North 's Embassy"", 'Britain', 'South Korea', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'London', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Ministry of Unification']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.36197487  0.22548722

They are currently under protection of the government, and the related organizations are carrying out necessary procedures,” said ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee during a media briefing. He said Thae was the second-highest ranked North Korean diplomat in London, and is among the highest-ranked North Korean diplomat defectors to date. Thae Yong-ho “Thae has said the motives of his defection was his disdain toward the  Kim Jong-un regime, his longing for the democratic society of South Korea and concerns about his child and his own future,” Jeong added. “We  believe that Thae’s defection indicates that there is widespread belief among the North’s elite group that the Kim regime is hopeless and that its system has reached its limits. We also believe that links within the elite group are weakening,” he said.The Unification Ministry stressed that continued pressure from economic sanctions against the North has led to the surge in North Koreans’ defections to the South. They were imposed in March after Pyongyang’s nuclear test and long-range rocket launch,Jeong declined to elaborate further on details such as the specific date and route of defection, citing “diplomatic reasons.” Earlier in the day, South Korean media reported that a high-profile diplomat in the UK had defected with his family to a “third country,” citing an unnamed source.The ministry had refused to confirm the defection in the morning, but said at 7 p.m. that it decided to hold the media briefing as too many “unconfirmed” facts had been circulating. There have been a series of recent defections by North Koreans, including the mass defection of some North Koreans working at a China-based restaurant earlier in the year and a colonel from the North Korean military last year. The solider had marked the highest-level military defection ever from the hermit kingdom.By Yoon Min-sik","north korean diplomat defects ,second highest ranking diplomat ,korean diplomat defects to ,korean diplomat defects ,family north korea second","['North Korea ’s', 'London', 'South Korea', 'the Unification Ministry', 'Britain', 'South Korea']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.69560176  0.36037922

In recent months, senior North Korean officials visited African nations in what appeared to be a bid to break out of a deepening isolation following its fourth nuclear test in January this year. During the talks, Ri briefed his African counterparts on the outcome of North Korea's once-in-a-generation party congress, which endorsed the North's policy of simultaneously pursuing both nuclear weapons and economic development, the KCNA reported. Ri ""clarified the validity of the WPK's line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force and stressed the consistent stand of the WPK to achieve the reunification of the country on the principle of national independence,"" the report said. The DR Congo secretary general ""expressed the full support for the independent policy"" of the North Korean ruling party, according to the report.

Security Council's tougher sanctions in March over its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month.The rare massive defection has garnered attention over whether the sanctions have a major impact on pressuring North Korea, as Pyongyang-run restaurants in foreign countries have served as one of main sources of hard currency for the North.But the case has also sparked a row in South Korea over whether they defected to Seoul of their own free will following North Korea's repeated claims that the female workers were abducted by Seoul's spy agency.The National Intelligence Service has held them under its protection without sending them to a state-run resettlement facility, saying that the case is a high-profile defection and North Korea is using it as propaganda.Usually, North Korean defectors receive three months of resettlement education at the facility named Hanawon after coming to South Korea.An association of progressive lawyers requested a local court to decide on the legality of Seoul's protection of the defectors in a bid to clarify North Korea's claim that they were kidnapped by Seoul.Restaurants operated by North Korea in foreign countries have served as one of the main sources of hard currency for the country.The North is suspected of using the money to bankroll its nuclear and missile programs.North Koreans employed by foreign restaurants are among the50,000 workers sent abroad by the regime to earn much-needed hard currency to help it tackle economic hardships amid the U.N. sanctions on the North.In the wake of the April defections, three more North Korean restaurant employees working in China escaped to Seoul in June.","korean restaurant workers resettle ,13 north korean defectors ,defection in april seoul ,after april mass defection ,korea after april mass","['north korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'Ningbo', 'South Korea']",5,"[ 1.          2.          0.         ... -0.22261034  0.06610733

They, then, tried to send the tires to the North's western port city of Nampo, investigators said.But the smuggling attempt was foiled as the Chinese customs authorities cracked down on it and sent the tires back to South Korea, the investigators said.""There were sufficient possibilities that the large tires, in particular, could be converted for military use,"" a prosecution official said, declining to be identified.

But a District Court in Los Angeles dismissed the suit, saying Glendale did not use the statue for diplomatic purposes.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, which was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.The sexual slavery issue has long been the biggest thorn in relations between Seoul and Tokyo.But the two countries announced a landmark agreement in late December that centers on Japan's admission of responsibility for the wartime crime and plans to pay reparations to the victims.South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.","court rejects japanese right ,court on thursday rejected ,court rejects japanese ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,glendale korean american activist","['U.S.', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'Glendale', 'korean - american', 'U.S. Court of Appeals', 'japanese', 'Global Alliance for Historical Truth', 'Ko']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12948221  0.1879786

This step is expected to have adverse effects on South Koreans wanting to visit the neighboring country.China is South Korea's No. 1 trading partner, so there is usually a large flow of business-related traffic between the two countries. Related to the latest developments, some observers said China may be trying to get back at South Korea for agreeing to station the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery by the end of next year.China has vehemently protested the deployment plans, claiming that it would compromise its own strategic interests.South Korea's foreign ministry confirmed China's decision to revoke the license of the visa agency, but said this does not mean China has stopped issuing long-term, multi-entry visas altogether.""Although no more letters of invitation will be issued from that particular agency which had its business license canceled today, South Korean companies will still be able to get long-term visas normally if they secure letters of invitation  from their partner firms in China,"" the ministry said, quoting the Chinese Embassy in Seoul.","beijing after south korea ,beijing revokes visa agency ,closed agency handled chinese ,korea chinese visa agency ,south korean business travelers","['chinese', 'south korean', 'Beijing', ""South Korea 's"", 'United States', 'chinese', 'South Koreans']",5,"[ 2.          1.          0.         ... -0.82194644  0.31315529

According to a report by the Korea Institute for Curriculum Evaluation on the 2013 revision of the North Korean curriculum, state criteria for the elementary schools stipulates that each student learn about the childhoods of Kim, his father Kim Jong-il, his grandfather Kim Il-sung and grandmother Kim Jong-suk for 684 hours during the five-year curriculum. Lessons about former leaders Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung are 171 hours each, while those for Kim Jung-suk come to 34 hours. Only classes for Korean language and math are given more time than lessons about Kim Jong-un, at 1,197 and 821 hours respectively. Kim Jong-un An educational doctrine for the North revealed earlier by local media shows that its goal of education is for “students to acquire the concept of revolution and endless loyalty toward  party and the supreme leader , while constituting the spirit to safeguard dear leader Kim Jong-un.” As with other communist countries, North Korea’s founding principal is based on the revolution of the working class. But the hermit kingdom claims that the public must receive guidance from its supreme leaders -- the Kim family -- and the ruling party for the “ultimate victory,” justifying its one-man rule.The report by KICE shows that such propaganda takes place at the earlier stages of the North’s 12-year mandatory education, starting at the second of two years of kindergarten and ending with three years in high school.Subjects related to the Kim family continue into later stages of education, with high schoolers learning about Kim Jong-un’s “history of revolution” for 81 hours. This is significantly less that the time devoted to studying Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, probably due to the current leader’s young age. Kim Jong-un’s grandmother is taught for 42 hours.“Subjects unrelated to Kim Jong-un have been added  as a special subject, in a bid to strengthen his leadership. And the four subjects  are being taught consistently throughout elementary, middle and high school,” Kim Jin-sook of KICE said in the report.Kim also added that the new curriculum shows that North Korean education is changing in accordance to global standards, such as by emphasizing English and information technology. English classes were taught more frequently than Korean language at the high school level.“Despite the limitations  as an ideological tool, we can see that new ‘educational experiments’ are being tried in North Korea,” said Kim. “But the negative aspect is that North Korea’s political system and its policies are being reflected in education to promote and sustain the regime, and people’s perceptions are being affected by it. ... The aftermath of the wayward education -- as a result of the politicizing of education -- is something that has to be overcome as we prepare for the future unification ,” he added.

The source who lives near the Sino-China border region told Yonhap News Agency that the two were part of a group of five who illegally crossed the border near the North Korean city of Hyesan last Saturday and robbed people living in two rural villages at gunpoint.They were holed up at a house in the Changbai Korean Autonomous County when Chinese border guard and police tried to apprehend them early Thursday. In the ensuing gun fight the culprits were arrested, although three others got away.The Chinese national police then said that several Chinese security forces were injured in the process with two detectives receiving serious wounds requiring them to be evacuated to a hospital in Changchun.""Chinese authorities are chasing the three runaways and telling people to be extra careful,"" the source said. He said Chinese authorities confirmed the robbers were armed with guns and had ammunition, and were North Korean military deserters. The provincial government and security forces imposed a curfew at night to protect citizens.The latest incident comes after chronic food shortages in North Korea first pushed soldiers and some civilians to cross over the lightly guarded border with China from the year 2000 onwards to steal food and money from Chinese nationals. In late 2014, a North Korean deserter broke into a home in Helong and murdered four people and wounded another, and year earlier one North Korean man in his 20s killed a Chinese couple in Yanji while trying to steal their valuables.","korean deserters who robbed ,last saturday and robbed ,deserters arrested after shootout ,korean armed deserters arrested ,robbed villages in china","['north korean', 'China', 'Jilin Province', 'chinese', 'sino', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'north korean', 'Hyesan']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.393336    0.42936185

He also traveled with North Korea to the 2014 Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon.Before meeting his athletes at the airport, Yun confidently predicted that North Korea would exceed expectations.""We didn't come all the way here to win a meager five gold medals,"" said Yun, who declined to talk about his current role in North Korean sports.Yun also didn't discuss the country's specific objective in Rio, saying it was ""classified,"" but bristled at foreign media's prediction of two to three gold medals.""You have to play the game,"" he said. ""It's too early to tell.""North Korea will compete in nine of 28 sports, and according to ""Info 2016,"" the official source of information for the Rio Games, the North will have 31 athletes and four officials.The list includes weightlifter Om Yun-chol, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist in the men's 56kg, and artistic gymnast Ri Se-gwang, the two-time world champion in men's vault.At the 2012 Olympics in London, North Korea grabbed four gold medals -- three from weightlifting -- and two bronze medals to finish 20th in the standings.Yun said North Korea will also excel at diving this year, with Kim Kuk-hyang having won the 2015 world championship in 10m platform.Yun said the North's leader Kim Jong-un takes ""a great interest in sports,"" and added, ""His support and words of encouragement do so much more to motivate our athletes than any amount of money can.""""In the South, gold medalists receive money,"" Yun said.

Japan colonized the peninsula from 1910-45.Japan expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities under the deal and committed to providing 1 billion yen  to financially compensate the wartime victims and restore their dignity. Only a small number of the estimated comfort women have come forward as victims of the sexual servitude, and there are only 40 confirmed South Korean victims alive today.  Kim Tae-hyun, an honorary social welfare professor at Sungshin Women's University, announces the launch of a foundation to help comfort women on July 28. The foundation, registered as a nonprofit corporation with South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, will be headed by Kim Tae-hyun, an honorary social welfare professor at Sungshin Women's University. Through its course of mission, the foundation will focus on two tasks: financially assisting the surviving victims and commemorating those who were forced to endure Japanese wartime sexual enslavement, according to an official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  A college student protester calls for the cancellation of the South Korea-Japan agreement on the settlement of the grievances of Korean women sexually enslaved by Japan during World War II as South Korea launches a foundation for the comfort women on July 28. ""The foundation was launched in accordance with the South Korea-Japan agreement  and in order to carry out responsibilities on the part of Japan,"" the official said. The 1 billion-yen fund pledged by Tokyo, however, has yet to be transferred, reportedly due to some lingering differences between the two countries.The foreign ministry's deputy spokesman Sun Nahm-kook said earlier in the week, ""I think the promised fund will arrive immediately after the foundation is formally established.""","women japanese government funded ,south korea on thursday ,thursday to compensate women ,korean comfort women japanese ,women japanese government","['japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.48595196  0.12925813

On July 22, the Korean military collected scores of tightly air-filled vinyl bags carrying North Korean leaflets which contained threats of the North's possible attacks on the South using the intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile, a spokesman for Seoul's JCS said in a press briefing. ""North Korea intentionally floated the leaflets toward the mouth of the Han River and were picked up by guard troops near Gimpo,"" the spokesman said, citing an analysis by relevant government officials. The river flows through Seoul, South Korea's capital city, although sources said it is not clear where the leaflets originated from. The leaflets also carried a message celebrating the North's ""victory"" against the U.N. Forces during the Korean War .On Wednesday, two Koreas separately marked the 63rd anniversary of the Korean War Armistice Agreement that resulted in the conflict ending in a ceasefire agreement and a stalemate. The North, however, has been insisting it won the war and that the armistice was only reached because the U.N. forces sued for peace.The JCS said the military will strengthen its monitoring and keep soldiers on high alert to detect additional North Korean propaganda activities along the mouth of the Han River and other vulnerable areas. The leaflet distribution is the latest provocation by the North after it test-fired three ballistic missiles on July 19 in protest against the South's decision to deploy an advanced U.S. anti-missile system by 2017. Seoul said the anti-missile system is needed to counter growing threats from the North.","carrying north korean leaflets ,worded north korean leaflets ,korea sends propaganda leaflets ,north korean leaflets ,north korean leaflets in","[""South Korea 's"", 'Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'north korean', 'korean', 'north korean']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29691097  0.15974291

The incumbent leader inherited the country following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011.The businessman said he heard from a senior official of the North's ruling Workers' Party that, as well as Kim Ok, others related to her were also sent off to labor camps.The RFA reported in 2013 that Kim Ok's father Kim Hyo, then a senior official in the Workers' Party's Finance and Accounting Department, was dismissed from his post.The latest report said members of Kim Ok's family, including her younger brother Kim Kyun, who had been cited for opulence and behaved haughtily thanks to his sister's standing, were all incarcerated, according to the RFA.""Kim Kyun acted high-handedly and tyrannically as his sister was Kim Jong-il's favorite, after Kim Jong-un's real mother Ko Yong-hui died in 2004,"" the source told the RFA.Kim Kyun was appointed the first vice president of the North's prestigious Kim Il-sung University in February 2011 but abruptly resigned from the post in October 2013. Another source also said that Kim Ok was removed from power as Kim Jong-un moved to tighten his own grip over the country.The insider said that unless Kim Ok was removed, the North's scheme to idolize Kim Jong-un's biological mother, Ko Yong-hui, would have run into hurdles.Right after he took power, Kim Jong-un attempted to purge the powerful military elite from the Kim Jong-il era, getting rid of key people in the military, party and government. Kim Ok, meanwhile, reportedly studied piano at the Pyongyang University of Music and Dance, and became a secretary to the senior Kim in 1980.","widow purged rfa former ,widow purged rfa ,kim jong il widow ,il widow purged rfa ,reclusive country chinese businessman","['north korean', ""Kim Jong - il 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'the u.s.-based Radio Free Asia', 'chinese', 'Pyongyang', 'RFA', 'Kim Ok']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.81386256  0.16873005

87,87,87,Majority of working migrant wives have limited job security in Korea: research,"More than half of employed foreign-born migrant wives in Korea work as either temporary or day laborers, while 9.5 percent of them work for free for their Korean in-laws’ businesses here, a study showed on Sunday.　The study, published in the latest edition of academic journal Gender Review, analyzed government data on 226,084 foreign-born women immigrants who married South Korean nationals. 　The report found that ...","More than half of employed foreign-born migrant wives in Korea work as either temporary or day laborers, while 9.5 percent of them work for free for their Korean in-laws’ businesses here, a study showed on Sunday.The study, published in the latest edition of academic journal Gender Review, analyzed government data on 226,084 foreign-born women immigrants who married South Korean nationals. The report found that 52.4 percent of all migrant wives were employed as of 2012, while 84.1 percent of them hoped to continue working or seek employment in the future.However, most migrant wives who were in work faced a lack of job security, the study showed. While 35 percent of them worked as temporary workers, 18.9 percent of them were involved in day labor -- meaning they were hired and paid one day at a time, with no promise to return. Also, 9.5 percent of them were doing unpaid work for their Korean in-laws, such as family farms or businesses.  A group wedding of South Korean men and their foreign-born brides, which was jointly financed by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Woori Bank, held earlier in Seoul this month. The study showed that 65 percent of all working migrant wives’ monthly salaries ranged from 500,000 won  to 1.5 million won . At the same time, 17. 4 percent of them were making 500,000 won or less a month. Only 2.7 percent of them were making 2.5 million won a month or more. The average monthly salary of a university-educated, first-year Korean office worker is 1.9 million won, as of this year.  In terms of occupation type, the largest proportion of them, 30 percent, were engaged in simple labor such as cleaning or delivery. Another 23.9 percent were working in the service sector, followed by 13.6 percent who were factory workers. Only 163 out of 119,922 working migrant wives were working in managerial positions, accounting for 0.1 percent. The report also discovered that migrant wives who have a child aged 9 or younger, those who are married to low-earning Korean husbands, those who have experienced discrimination while living in Korea, and those who are from mainland China – excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan – were more likely to seek employment here. Migrant wives with children aged 9 or younger were 92 percent more likely to be working than those who did not have children but were in the same age group, the report showed. Also, women from Hong Kong and Taiwan were 76 percent less likely to be working than those from mainland China.  At the same time, wives from Japan, the U.S., Russia, Canada, Uzbekistan and Cambodia also had a significantly lower likelihood of participating in the workfoce in Korea than women from mainland China. Chinese-born, ethnic Korean women from mainland China accounted for the largest proportion of migrant wives by taking up 31.5 percent. One of the reasons behind their high employment rate has to do with their proficiency in the Korean language, researchers noted.Researchers suggested the government come up with special job-training programs for migrant wives in low-earning households, especially those with young children. “Language proficiency and education degrees would lead to higher-paying jobs,” the researchers said. “There should be ways for the mothers to get the education they want -- while getting a degree may take a long time, it’s better for their career prospects in the long-run -- while being able to raise their children with adequate support.”As of 2012, those from China, including Chinese-born ethnic Koreans, accounted for 55.7 percent of all migrant wives in Korea, followed by those from Vietnam  and the Philippines . Almost 63 percent of them were aged 39 or younger, while 79.4 percent of them never attended post-secondary education. As of last year, 74.6 percent of all Korean high school girls enrolled in university.By Claire Lee","migrant wives in korea ,wives in korea work ,married south korean nationals ,women immigrants who married ,wives in korea","['Korea', 'korean', 'Gender Review', 'south korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.05098641  0.10679661

An autopsy by the National Forensic Service found intoxicating substances in both the husband and wife, they added.  The Seoul Central District Court expressed their regret over the case and explained they only rejected the warrants because the late wife had wanted to “reconcile” with her husband, who was her only legal guardian, and had also hoped to “improve their marital relationship.”The late husband, surnamed Song, had been questioned by the police a number of times for domestic abuse prior to his death. He also had a criminal history that included the attempted murder of his previous spouse. In March, he physically abused his wife for “eating squid when her teeth were not in good condition,” which led to serious injuries. She suffered a skull fracture that resulted in a coma that lasted for a few days. Prosecutors filed an arrest warrant against him on domestic violence charges, but it was rejected by the court.In May, prosecutors filed another arrest warrant against him, after Song injured his wife again -- this time in her legs. But it was rejected by the court again. The late victim allegedly told the authorities that her husband “didn’t do anything wrong,” and he hit her because “she deserved it.” Police said the late husband sobbed during the investigation session which was held to determine the warrant’s validity, seemingly “regretting his wrongdoings.” This is not the first time that a woman was murdered by her husband after a court failed to physically separate the victim from her abuser. In 2013, a regional court ordered 10 sessions of marriage counselling, instead of issuing a divorce-order, when a long-time domestic abuse victim filed for divorce against her husband. The victim, who had been staying at a shelter at the time, agreed to meet her husband as he offered to divorce her – instead of attending the required therapy sessions -- should she spend a day with him “for the last time.” She was strangled to death by her spouse the same day. “There are relationships that can be improved by counselling, and there are relationships that just cannot be fixed. The latter usually involves severe violence,” said Shin Sang-hee, an expert in domestic abuse against women at the Korea Women’s Hot Line. “The court’s priority should be protecting the victims. They are putting the victims in danger by letting them continue spending time with the perpetrators. For example, the victim of the case in 2013 could have lived if the court issued a divorce-order instead of ordering marriage counselling.” Police said the current system, in which the authorities cannot separate those who commit domestic abuse and their victims if the victims do not wish to do so, should change. In the recent Gwanak case after the second warrant request was rejected by the court, the police placed the late wife at a shelter -- away from her husband -- in June. But she eventually volunteered to return to her husband, saying it was difficult for her to adapt to life at the shelter. While staying at the shelter, the victim reportedly had been receiving threatening text messages from her husband, who told her he’d find her and kill her. She was found dead about a month after leaving the shelter. There was no legal grounds for the authorities to stop her from returning home, the police added. Shin from the Korea Women’s Hot Line agreed with police, but stressed the importance of understanding the unique circumstances of domestic abuse victims. “Many would wonder why the late victim returned to her husband, in spite of the threatening text messages,” she said. “But my guess is that she returned to her husband because of the text messages. It’s highly likely that he had teen asking her to come back, while threatening to track her down and kill her if she does not do so.”Many domestic abuse victims can’t bear such threats and the level of fear among the victims is inconceivable to those who have not experienced such abuse, Shin explained.“It’s important for those at shelters and police to provide enough support to make sure they feel safe away from their abusers -- and let them know that there is help available.” By Claire Lee","man kills wife after ,abuse killed his wife ,kills wife after court ,man kills wife ,arrest warrants south korean","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'the National Forensic Service']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.87022924  0.12357122

But they didn't hit my head so as to make their acts less noticeable."" Another defector testified that a female inmate was sexually assaulted by her male counterparts after she complained about the conditions of the Jeongeori labor camp in northern part of North Korea to which she belonged, KINU reserach fellow Han Dong-ho said.""The Jeongeori camp, which houses 3,000 to 4,000 inmates, is notorious for its inhumane treatment of inmates by having 35-60 share one room and offering them little food. At least one to two inmates die of malnutrition and diseases per day,"" Han said.If an epidemic breaks out, up to 50 inmates die of the disease in a day and their corpses are cremated with their families not being notified, he said.  Among the most painful torture techniques involves guards forcing prisoners to stand still facing the wall all day without budging, or hanging a person on the wall with his or her hands tied behind their backs, according to North Korean defectors from labor camps. Han said a female inmate forcibly repatriated to the North from China was forced to undergo an abortion operation before she was sent to a labor camp in the communist nation.Another KINU researcher said North Korean workers sent to countries such as Qatar, Kuwait, Russia and China have also suffered an unfair treatment in terms of wages and working conditions.He said because their wages are confiscated by executive-level fellow workers, they are not paid properly in those countries.","korean defectors who suffered ,torture in labor camps ,rights abuses south korean ,interviews of north korean ,of north korean defectors","['south korean', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'Korea Institute for National Unification', 'north korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67989916  0.45145285

Ewha Womans University in Seoul recently disclosed its plan to branch out into the United States and China. National universities not in Seoul, which are dealing with an ever-falling number of entrants, are also showing deep interest in setting up schools in foreign countries. According to the Education Ministry, the number of high school seniors who want to enter college next year is estimated at 520,000, just 10,000 more than the entrance quota of 510,000 for all 386 universities and colleges nationwide.The problem is that the quota would have been far higher if not for the government's restructuring steps. Due to the nation's low birthrate, which was around 1.24 as of 2011, the number of students who will take college entrance tests is forecast to plummet to 470,000 in 2020, 430,000 in 2021, 410,000 in 2022 and 400,000 in 2023, according to the ministry's data. The estimate means that colleges will need to slash their current quotas by up to 110,000 overall over the next seven years. The ministry has already prepared to adjust the quota in stages based on the 2023 estimation. The ministry is also moving to introduce a massive restructuring program under which poorly performing colleges can be shut down. Under these harsh realities, survival has become a major issue in academic circles.Chungbuk National University in Cheonju, 137 kilometers south of Seoul, has recently attracted attention as a private education foundation in China's northern Shanxi province, which offered last month to set up a sister campus in the province's capital of Xian.The foundation also requested that the South Korean school run the campus. In addition, the foundation promised to build the campus and dormitories, and even recruit students. Early last month, the university also received a request to join a new international campus in the Chinese border town of Hunchun associated with Yanbian University, located in the Chinese province of Jilin. The Chinese university plans to complete the Hunchun campus by September 2017. In April, the private Mongolian International University also asked the Chungbuk university to jointly launch a branch school in Kazakhstan. This is not the first time that South Korean colleges have tried to make inroads into foreign countries. In fact, Chungnam National University in Daejeon, 164 kilometers south of Seoul, sought to set up a campus in Los Angeles in 2008 but had to call off the project two years later because of a domestic law banning such a step. But private universities will be allowed to set up campuses abroad starting next month as the related law was amended.

The organization that runs the shelter for former sex slaves, euphemistically called comfort women, on the outskirts of Seoul, added Yoo's death lowered the number of known survivors to 40, among the 238 victims who are registered in the South Korean database.This undated photo provided by the House of Sharing is of Yoo Hee-nam. Yoo was captured by Japanese soldiers at age 15 and brought to a brothel in Shimonoseki, Japan, before being tortured by soldiers there for a year. While Yoo was in the process of being moved to Singapore, the Japanese surrendered, and she returned home with the help of an Osaka resident.After Korea's independence, Yoo made her living as a peddler, but she constantly suffered from insomnia and heart disease, the group said. Although she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009, she joined the House of Sharing and engaged in various activities to recover their honor and get an apology from Japan. Last July, Yoo, along with another former comfort woman Kim Kyung-soon, lodged a lawsuit in a San Francisco regional district against Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japanese firms that enslaved Koreans for forced labor during the war and the Sankei Shimbun, a conservative Japanese newspaper, which has called former comfort women ""prostitutes"" in its articles.Yoo also criticized the Seoul-Tokyo agreement on the issue of former comfort women that was reached last December, saying it didn't contain the victims' consent. The House of Sharing said Yoo is survived by a son and three daughters. Her funeral will be held Tuesday, it added.","korean sex slavery victims ,soldiers died sunday local ,surviving korean sex slavery ,40 another korean woman ,ii soldiers died sunday","['korean', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the National Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the House of Sharing']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.02295246 0.42645156 0.48350915],KH디지털2,Diplomatic Circuit,7,2016,"soldiers died sunday local advocacy ,seoul due to lung cancer ,three daughters her funeral ,korean victims of sexual slavery ,lung cancer in 2009 she","['korean', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the National Medical Center', 'Seoul', 'the House of Sharing', 'Seoul', 'Yoo', 'south korean', 'the House of Sharing', 'Yoo Hee - nam', 'Yoo', 'japanese', 'Shimonoseki', 'Japan', 'Yoo', 'Singapore', 'Japanese', 'Osaka', 'Korea', 'Yoo', 'the House of Sharing', 'Japan', 'Yoo', 'Kim Kyung - soon', 'San Francisco', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'Koreans', 'the Sankei Shimbun', 'japanese', 'Yoo', 'Seoul', 'the House of Sharing', 'Yoo']",14,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.02295246 0.42645156 0.48350915]

We thought it was over,” said Yu, reminiscing upon the joy that his 18-year-old self had felt as the war seemed to inch toward the end.  Yu Yong-bong applies bandages to a wounded U.S. soldier at the U.S. Army Garrison Daegu`s Camp Walker Wood Army medical clinic, where he works as Red Cross volunteer. Little did he know that a swarm of Chinese Communist Forces and North Korean soldiers were preparing to strike.Three days later, Yu’s division found themselves cornered in the mountains, desperately fighting to escape.“After two weeks of fierce fighting, the U.S. 1st Marine Division and us were able to break through the siege of the Chinese forces. Thousands were killed and many more were injured. If it weren’t for the help of the citizens who let us use the cable car used by miners, I would not be alive today,” he said. Sixty-six years later, memories of the bloody escape still keep Yu from going near mountains.For Yu, the military was not his first choice. On Aug. 16, 1950, the then-high school junior was on his way to school in Daegu when a policeman got hold of him and urged him to join the forces. He never got a chance to say goodbye to his family, or even visit them, as the raging war demanded more soldiers.Ushered onto a ship headed for Japan, he and other recruits were treated to what seemed to be a gourmet meal on board. “We never had enough to eat back then, so the sight of it was just magnificent,” Yu said. “We also tasted coffee for the first time. Some guys would get greedy and just pour sugar all over it, so it would be half liquid and half sugar. Pretty soon, the sugar would be rationed to two spoons per cup.” But the teenager would soon learn that seasickness was a formidable foe, as he wound up hurling most of his meal overboard for much of the three-day trip.In Japan, Yu was assigned as a medic to the U.S. Army 7th Division, 17th Infantry Regiment, 1st Battalion Aid Station. It was his English skills that made him one of the first KATUSA soldiers.“My older brother would tell me to study English, because it would come in handy with the U.S. military working with the  government,” he said. The war would eventually claim the life of that brother, while Yu’s other older brother was injured.The new soldiers were then deployed to the Battle of Incheon, codenamed Operation Chromite.Yu said that the KATUSA soldiers helped U.S. troops who were not accustomed to navigating in the foreign land. Moreover, his easygoing personality and devotion to work helped him bridge the relationship between Koreans and Americans.“U.S. soldiers used to call Koreans, ‘Gook.’ But I would advise them not to use that word because it is derogatory toward Koreans,” he said. One particular relationship that stood out for him was with the U.S. medical officer Edward Guy, with whom he was paired.This photo shows Yu Yong-bong during the 1950-53 Korean War with U.S. medical officer Edward Guy. “There were these Korean workers who used to work for the Army. One of them was shot in the leg and was brought to us. He moaned ‘Aigoo! Aigoo!’ which in Korean means ouch. Guy was surprised and said ‘Don’t go!’ So I explained that it wasn’t what he meant,” he said.In 2011, the two comrades were reunited after nearly 60 years. This was not the only tearful reunion that Yu has experienced. On Oct. 26, 1950, Yu and Guy were in Daegu while being transported. “It was around 7 a.m. We were standing in the street, when I noticed two women standing near a shop. It was a gut-wrenching moment when I realized it was my mother,” Yu said.From the time her youngest son failed to make it home in August, Yu’s mother had visited nearby temples every day, praying for her son’s safe return home.“I walked toward her and said, ‘Mother, it’s me.’ First she was taken back by a familiar voice coming out of a fully-armed soldier. I took my helmet off, she grabbed me and said, ‘My Young-bong is finally here!”“It was a miracle that I was even able to spot her in that fleeting moment.”Yu finished his service in 1954, but his connection with the U.S. Army was not over. In 1958, he returned to the 543rd General Dispensary, now known as Camp Walker’s wood Army Medical Clinic, where he worked until his retirement in 2004. Even after retirement, he applied as a Red Cross volunteer to continue working at the clinic. He can still be found there today, applying bandages and caring for youthful soldiers who he describes as “like his own grandchildren.”“I’m grateful. I’m grateful for what the U.S. Army did for my life, and to my country. In over 40 years of service, I never took a day off, because of that,” he said.Yu said his devotion to working for the South Korean and U.S. military is a great source of pride. “Even now, the South Korea-U.S. alliance is very important. The U.S. military plays an integral role in our country’s defense and the role of KATUSA soldiers -- aiding the two sides’ coordination -- is that much important,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","gone hiking for decades ,1950 53 korean war ,army soldiers recruited ,hiking for decades ,53 korean war","['Yu Yong - bong', 'the U.S. Army 7th Infantry Division', '313 Korea Augmentation', 'the U.S. Army', 'south korean', 'U.S.']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34925035  0.31763217

The Korean Empire was the name of the Joseon Dynasty during its final 13 years.Other recovered items include an invitation to an exhibition of art work by George Robert Bruenech, a Christmas card from American painter Edith Haworth as well as an invitation to a Bible school of the Church of Covenant in Washington that then-U.S. President Benjamin Harrison attended.A 1892 article in the Sun newspaper said that then-Acting Korean Minister Lee Chae-yeon and his wife attended the church, ""occupying seats directly back of President Harrison."" The paper also said that Lee's home became a ""social center among the diplomats.""King Gojong bought the legation building in 1891 for US$25,000, a huge sum at that time. But Japan took over the ownership of the building for just $5 as soon as Korea went under its colonial rule, and sold it to an American for $10.In 2012, the South Korean government bought the red brick, three-story Victorian-style building in the Logan Circle Historic District, some 10 minutes' drive from the White House, from an American for US$3.5 million in an effort to preserve a symbol of diplomacy of the Joseon Dynasty.It is the only former overseas establishment of the Korean Empire that still has its original shape.Restoration work has been under way since October, and is expected to be completed by year's end before it formally opens to the public early next year.","1906 wedding of daughter ,korean legation in washington ,korean legation from 1891 ,the 1906 wedding ,active diplomacy korean envoys","['U.S.', 'Theodore Roosevelt', 'korean', 'Washington', 'korean', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5136835   0.5562672

UNESCO recommended Tokyo include a ""full history"" related to those facilities. An official from Japan's Cabinet Secretariat recently told Yonhap News Agency that the government is considering ways on how to explain the world heritage sites based on opinions from experts. His comment was a response to a question raised about preparations that have been made to more fully explain the island's history as the first anniversary of it being added to the heritage list approaches. The official added that explanations about the fact that there was a policy for forced labor existed will be included. He said that the efforts will be made in recognition of harsh conditions under which Korean laborers had to work decades ago. He, however, noted that the deadline for Japan to submit its ""follow-up measures"" after the designation is more than a year away, hinting that Tokyo will not be in a hurry to make any decisions on what explanations about forced laborers will be included. Tokyo has been under criticism for changing its stance and promises related to the island.A Japanese representative made a speech last year at a World Heritage committee meeting in which he apparently admitted there was coercion involved in bringing workers to the island. Japan later denied acknowledging that there was any coercion involved.Tokyo has become ambiguous in dealing with the issue ever since, with some media outlets even causing fresh controversy by apparently trying to dilute historical facts. A Japanese media report earlier said that the city of Nagasaki had distributed a document to the department in charge of tourism in which it explained the life on the island was like any other ""coal mine community"" and people there were like a ""family.""A Seoul government report released years ago showed that around 120 Koreans were confirmed dead after being forcibly taken to work in the coal mines on the island also known as Battleship Island as it looks like a battle ship.Japan has been asked to submit its implementation report on how it has carried out the recommendations made by UNESCO no later than Dec. 1, 2017.","korea voiced protest against ,korean workers were forced ,protest against the move ,south korea voiced protest ,korea voiced protest","['Japan', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Nagasaki', 'UNESCO World Heritage', 'South Korea']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.27828309  0.35538203

Choi Kyong-lim, Seoul's ambassador at the mission to the U.N. in Geneva and this year’s president of the U.N. Human Rights Council, had selected Quintana from a finalist of three candidates presented by a consultative group which interviewed eight people including Sonja Biserko, a Serbian rights activist, and Pierre Sob, a former Cameroonian diplomat who now works as a human rights consultant. The appointment is expected to be confirmed at the council’s session in Geneva on Friday. With more than 14 years of experience in the field, Quintana also worked at the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights and as executive director of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights’ program for protection and promotion of human rights in Bolivia. More recently, he represented an Argentinean nongovernment organization’s cases involving child abduction during military rule. In its report to the president, the five-strong group noted Quintana’s “extensive direct experience with the functioning of special procedures, and his engagement with a variety of stakeholders” including those from the government, the opposition and civil society while working on Myanmar. Launched in 2004, the post of the special rapporteur on North Korea brings a one-year stint but it can be extended up to six years.

The program is offered in partnership with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the Australia-Korea Foundation and the South Korean Ministry of Unification.Each scholarship, valued at around 38,000 Australian dollars , covers the full cost of tuition, return flights, accommodations and living expenses.“These scholarships are unique as they offer the highest level of support and financial assistance available for former North Korean students to study English in Sydney,” said Australia-Korea Foundation board member professor James Cotton.UTS:INSEARCH’s managing director Alex Murphy said the programs are specially designed to help students learn through an integrated curriculum by combining innovative online resources with face-to-face classroom teaching in small groups.“We believe this is an important opportunity to assist five young Koreans to build brighter futures and good careers by helping them to improve their English skills,” Murphy said.This partnership is the first to offer fully funded English language scholarships in Australia for former North Korean students.This initiative follows a two-year pilot program by UTS:INSEARCH, which offered two English language tuition-only scholarships each year as a trial to develop the program. Cosmopolitan Civil Societies Research Center Director and UTS academic Bronwen Dalton, who was on the selection panel, said the initiative symbolized the two governments’ mutual values.“This is the type of initiative that UTS and both governments can justifiably be proud of, as it touches on values Koreans and Australians share; a genuine commitment to helping each country to find innovative solutions to social disadvantage, and ensuring that young people of all backgrounds are given the chance to realize their potential,” Dalton said.Similar programs have been offered to North Korean defectors in other countries. In 2011, three young North Korean defectors living in South Korea won scholarships offered by the U.S. government for study and internships at American universities.  By Tang Li Intern reporter","five north korean defectors ,australia invites defectors for ,korean defectors to study ,invited five north korean ,australia invites defectors","['australian', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'the University of Technology Sydney ’s', 'INSEARCH', 'Sydney']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39566365  0.19539306

""But recently, they returned to their workplaces in China after staying about three days in their country,"" the source told RFA.""The reason for their prolonged stay in Sinuiju is that they got reeducation conducted by the North Korean public security authorities before they returned to China,"" the source claimed.When North Korean workers arrive in border cities like Sinuiju they are sent to a special camp totally cut off from the outside world to receive ideological education.Another source who declined to be identified said that Chinese employers have many complaints about their North Korean workers who are absent from work for several days. ""Nevertheless, Chinese firms using North Korean workers have no choice other than to wait until they return because of the cheap labor cost,"" the source said.The insider said the ideological education is a measure to prevent a stream of defections of North Korean laborers overseas, like the recent case of North Koreans working at state-owned restaurants defecting en masse to South Korea on two separate occasions. A group of 13 North Koreans defected from a Pyongyang-run restaurant in China and came to South Korea in early April in what has become a steady stream of people leaving the isolated country.North Korea has consistently claimed South Korea abducted the workers and demanded that they be returned to their loved ones at once. Pyongyang also threatened to take strong actions against the South if its demands are not met.","workers dispatched to china ,thursday an ethnic korean ,workers employed in china ,china to prevent defections ,its workers in china","['North Korea', 'China', 'korean', 'China', 'Radio Free Asia', 'north korean', 'China', 'chinese', ""North Korea 's"", 'Sinuiju']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.58141345  0.40091783

Yonhap“As a result of the internal inspection, we found that the chiefs of Busan’s Saha and Yonje Police Stations were aware of the case,” Kang told the lawmakers. “It was revealed that working-level officials at the Busan Metropolitan Police Agency also knew about the case.”The remarks came two days after it was revealed that two police officers in their 30s, who were dispatched at schools to guard students, had engaged in sexual relationship with teenage girls from the schools. According to the National Police Agency, the police chiefs of Busan’s Yonje and Saha Police Stations were involved in leading the accused police officers to tender resignations without being punished. They also failed to report the case to higher authorities. Kang said that he has referred the two chiefs to disciplinary proceedings. They had both resigned from their posts with full severance pay in return for their acts being dismissed. Kang said the resignation has been put on hold and that their severance pay will be retracted. The resignations of the two directly involved police officers will also be dismissed to take back the severance pay, he said.“There was a lack of education and ethics for police officers dispatched at schools,” he said, vowing to expand training nationwide. The NPA has dispatched six police officers to Busan for an internal probe. It is still unknown whether the accused officers threatened or coerced the girls to have sex with them.

Many of these workers are not paid on time, according to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.The plan came out during an inter-government meeting presided by Vice Gender Equality Minister Kwon Yong-hyun. The meeting was attended by director-general-level officials from 18 ministries and state agencies, including the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the National Police Agency.""Sexual labor is evolving and diversifying to the degree that it cannot be resolved by a single ministry,"" Kwon said in his opening address at the conference.""We need strong support and cooperation among different government bodies, since sex labor relates to different regulations and policies under different jurisdiction.""For tougher requirements for E-6-2 visa applications, the Korean Culture Ministry plans to require a minimum of three years work experience in related fields for performance quality, and will screen the criminal records of potential employees.The Justice Ministry will dismiss the visa application if the workplace has closed privacy rooms or does not have an exclusive stand-by room for performers. The ministry is considering implementing mandatory interviews for visa applicants from countries with 30 percent or higher rates of illegal immigration, such as the Philippines. As of the end of March, a total of 4,018 international entertainment workers worked in local performance centers, tourist hotels, bars and clubs here on the E-6-2 visa, according to the government data. During the cited period, Filipinos took up the majority at 80.5 percent of E-6-2 visa holders, followed by Ukrainians at 5.1 percent and Chinese with 4.8 percent. By category of workplace, bars and clubs took up the highest at 78.4 percent, followed by tourist theaters and entertainment companies at 19 percent and tourist hotels at 7.1 percent.

The government said that it aims to see fine dust concentration of 18 micrograms per cubic meter of air by 2026 from the current level of 23 micrograms per cubic meter. Environment Minister Yoon Seong-gyu , along with officials of other related ministries, attend a press conference announcing the government’s countermeasures plan against fine dust on June 3. The main part of the four action plans is to tackle the sources of fine dust that include business sites that deal with construction waste or that use solid fuel such as wood. They also include construction machineries, power plants and dust from construction fields or businesses. But the measures regarding reducing emissions from diesel cars have prompted criticism. The measure against diesel cars came in the heels of the emission rigging scandal of Volkswagen’s diesel vehicles, thus drawing more public attention.The government said that emissions from diesel engine cars are the main culprit of locally produced fine dust. Adding that worn-out diesel cars running in the country are the first thing that should be avoided, it said that it would gradually cut down the advantages given to diesel car owners.The decision came after President Park Geun-hye’s comments that “automobiles are the key cause of fine dust, which underlines the need for environmentally friendly cars,” during a Cabinet meeting on May 10.In that vein, the Environment Ministry proposed last month a plan during a ministerial meeting to increase the price of diesel. The ministry said “by raising the  price to the similar level of gasoline, the number of diesel cars running in the city will naturally go down and become similar to cars powered by gasoline.” A liter of diesel is sold at 1,230 won  as of June 23, about 85 percent of the price of gasoline.As soon as the price hike plan was revealed, the government was criticized for being self-contradictory as there had been a lack of explanation for the connection between the rising level of fine dust and the use of diesel cars. In 2009, the government had designated diesel cars as eco-friendly cars for its good fuel efficiency. In order to boost the sales of diesel cars, the government also began exempting at least 100,000 won of environmental improvement charges for those who drove diesel cars, along with a discount advantage at public parking lots. As a result, the number of diesel car purchasers skyrocketed, accounting for half of the newly registered vehicles in 2015.The oil refining industry opposed the abrupt turn of policy, saying it was “too rushed” to discuss the price hike for diesel. Some questioned why the government had categorized diesel cars as eco-friendly cars from the beginning if it had contributed to worsening air quality. “We need to watch the government’s diesel price hike plan further as the ministries have different positions ... while we export half of our diesels. If the price is increased, it would immediately lead to reduced domestic consumption which would eventually lead to a raise in the amount placed for export,” an official from the Korea Petroleum Association said. He said that it would then lead to excessive supplies of diesel in the global market that would lead to a price drop.Facing vehement protest from car owners and related industries, the plan was also opposed by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, citing the measure’s “potential increase of burden on ordinary citizens.”Despite such criticisms, the Environment Ministry said it will start encouraging owners of diesel cars that have been used for at least 11 years to be scrapped. The government will offer subsidies for expenses spent on scrapping such vehicles after applying for the process with the Korea Automobile Environmental Association.The Seoul Metropolitan Government also promised to replace all its public buses with eco-friendly Compressed Natural Gas buses as soon as possible.Another one of the government’s action plans is to revamp the current air quality forecast system.Following developed countries’ rising awareness on the fine dust issue since the late 1980s, South Korea designated fine dust as an air pollutant in 2014, as well as implemented the air quality forecast system run by Korea Environment Corporation under the Environment Ministry.When the dust particle concentration is between 81 and 150 micrograms per cubic meter, outdoor air quality is forecasted to be “unhealthy for sensitive group.” Above 150 micrograms per cubic meter is warned to be “unhealthy.” The average figure for the past three years was slightly below 49 micrograms per cubic meter, which meets the World Health Organization recommended air quality level of 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The ministry had said that accuracy of the fine dust forecast system, which was conducted from August to December in 2015, was at 69.9 percent. However, according to the ruling Saenuri Party’s Rep. Joo Young-soon, the Environment Ministry’s data on fine dust forecast conducted from August 2015 to January 2016 in fact showed 33.3 percent of accuracy. The forecast data showed that in metropolitan areas, the ministry’s forecast was just eight times correct out of the 18 days it had predicted the outdoor air pollution was “unhealthy for sensitive groups.”Joo said that the higher the density of fine dust, the more inaccurate the current forecast system appeared to be.Experts said the inaccuracy of current forecast system is due to lack of investigation into finding the real factor behind worsening air quality. “The current forecast model does not consider the city’s smog phenomenon, which has a very close correlation with the dust particle concentration,” said professor Hong Wook-hee of Semin Environment Research Center.“Different measurement standards between regions and municipalities is another problem,” added professor Hong. The government said it was currently working to set up a more comprehensive forecast system.“As we have revealed in the fine dust countermeasure plan, launching our own forecast system with accuracy through research, along with experts, is in the process,” said the ministry official. The ministry added that it is considering adopting high-tech sensors which can be attached to buses running in the city to gather big data.The other two actions plan include establishing new electric power industries and promoting environmental cooperation with neighboring countries.Analysts said it may take longer for South Korea to come up with viable solutions to fight worsening air quality.“South Korea is currently lacking in trustable measurement data and researches as it has just recently begun to observe the fine dust issue,” said Yoon Sun-chang, the vice-head of The Korean Academy of Science and Technology.“Nurturing scientists and expanding the workforce to observe the data and establish investigation devices is also very important, along with governmental support,” he added. By Kim Da-sol","dust problem in korea ,growing public anxiety over ,in korea is difficult ,criticism mounts over government ,korea is difficult","['south korean', 'Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61647213  0.16569023

On Dec. 28, South Korea and Japan reached a deal in which Tokyo expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for the foundation aimed at supporting the surviving victims, euphemistically called comfort women. The deal aims to put an end to the comfort women issue once and for all.An 11-member preparatory committee was officially launched late last month to spearhead the opening of the envisioned foundation.Originally the foundation was set to start work in end-June. ""It appears to be taking more time to make preparations for its launch,"" a source close to the matter told Yonhap News Agency.""More time seems to be needed to complete the articles of incorporation and determine other details, such as how to secure money for its operation.""The source said on condition of anonymity that the official launch could be delayed ""until mid-July, if not until August."" From the get-go, the preparatory committee has braced for a bumpy road as public opinion is divided on the controversial agreement reached in December. The decision was hailed by the international community as a step in the right direction given that the comfort women issue has been a long-standing obstacle to ties between the two neighboring countries.Victims and liberal civic groups blame the government for striking a deal lacking Japan's acknowledgment of legal responsibility. They also said the agreement was reached without prior consultation with the victims.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II. Only 42 South Korean victims, mostly in their late 80s, are currently known to be alive.Kim Tae-hyun, an honorary professor at Sungshin Women's University, who is leading the committee, earlier said that the priority is to heal the scars of the victims and help recover their dignity, adding that communication should come first in order to realize the objective. She, however, caused a stir by saying that the money to be provided by Japan should be regarded as ""healing money,"" not as indemnification, a remark that possibly contradicted Seoul government's stance that it can been seen as compensation since Tokyo apologized and took responsibility for its military atrocities.","korean women sexually victimized ,tokyo expressed an apology ,south korean women sexually ,sexually victimized by japan ,help south korean women","['south korean', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.73451132  0.44934085

The government offers five-year protection to them.The spy agency's decision comes as a local court plans to open a hearing later in the day to decide whether it is legally proper for the government to hold the North Korean defectors.An association of progressive lawyers requested the court to decide on the legality of Seoul's protection of the defectors in a bid to investigate North Korea's claim that they were kidnapped by Seoul.The government said that they came to South Korea on their own free will, but the North claims that they were ""lured and abducted"" by the South Korean government, calling for their immediate repatriation.The legal proceedings kicked off as the NIS earlier rejected the request by the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, to meet with the restaurant workers to clarify the North's claims.","13 north korean restaurant ,put 13 restaurant workers ,of 13 north koreans ,north korean restaurant workers ,protection south korea spy","[""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'the National Intelligence Service', 'Seoul', 'North Koreans', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.42757526  0.17704022

On the way, they also plan to attend ""Wednesday allies"" to be held in major cities to demand Tokyo offer a sincere apology and compensation to sexual slavery victims.They are the second group of South Korean college students to make the bicycle trip on the so-called ""Triple A"" project, which stands for a call for Japan to ""admit"" and ""apology"" for the wartime crime and a resolve to ""accompany"" victims.Last year, two 22-year-old students -- Shim Yong-seok and Baek Deok-yeol -- completed a similar bicycle trip.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mainly from Korea, a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. But Japan has long attempted to water down the atrocity.In late December, Seoul and Tokyo agreed to resolve the issue under an agreement that centers on Japan's admission of responsibility for the wartime crime and plans to pay reparations to the victims. South Korea promised to end the dispute once and for all if Japan fulfills its responsibilities.Some civic groups, however, including one that has spoken for victims, have denounced the agreement as diplomatic collusion between the two countries, arguing that Japan should have offered a clearer apology and acknowledged its legal responsibility for the atrocity.","south korean college students ,on bicycle tour cross ,women three south korean ,three south korean college ,korean college students","['south korean', 'Los Angeles', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Kim Hyun - koo', 'Hansung University', 'Kim Han - kyun', 'Kim Tae - woo', 'Kyung Hee University', 'Los Angeles']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36728519  0.29439926

Over the weekend, the ruling Saenuri Party’s interim leader Kim Hee-ok vacated his seat and stayed home to protest against the party’s decision to accept its defectors. The former justice threatened to leave his post, saying that the decision-making process was “undemocratic” and “offensive” to his leadership.  The residence of the Saenuri Party’s emergency committee chairman Kim Hee-ok The political standoff was resolved on Sunday after the Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk came to see him in person near his house and offered an apology with a deep bow. Only then did the interim leader agree to return to work after three days in seclusion.The 67-year-old politician’s actions stand in the tradition of using the hide-and-seek strategy during political tug-of-war. From the recent precedent of Rep. Kim Chong-in of The Minjoo Party of Korea to the more distant past case of late President Kim Young-sam, high-flying politicians, when cornered, often relied on the tactic. “It works like an ace when playing politics,” said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy. “The politicians have employed the strategy as a last resort when  democratic process such as dialogue and debate doesn’t work,” he said. Former President Kim Young-sam is one of the savvy politicians who used the tactic to push his agenda. When Kim was a leader of then-ruling Democratic Liberal Party in 1990, he refused to serve his post and stayed at home to protest the move to adopt the Japanese-style parliamentary system. The democratic crusader considered the constitutional change to adopt the Japanese-style system as a threat to his bid for single five-year-term presidency. He refused to work for 12 days as the party leader until then president Roh Tae-woo caved in and withdrew his bid to amend the Constitution. Recent hiding by the high-rank politicians, however, have come with relatively less grand causes. Today, it is more often used to express discomfort at challenges to their leadership, especially by those considered backbenchers.Last March, The Minjoo Party’s chairman Rep. Kim Chong-in went into hiding in protest against the party’s rank-and-file member’s public criticism of him assigning himself a top candidacy for a proportional representation. Kim had refused to serve his post until the members offered him an apology. Analysts noted that the effectiveness of “going into hiding” is contingent upon how much political leverage the politician has, and thus the strategy works best when they carry legitimate causes. “It is similar to how blackmailing works,” said Kim Min-jeon, a political science professor at Kyung Hee University. “Their threat to resign gains weight when those politicians are perceived to be too important to be ignored,” she said. For instance, former President Kim got his way by taking the chance. Before being elected as the ruling party leader, Kim was known as the nation’s most vocal democratic activist. In 1983, he staged a 23-day hunger strike to condemn then President Chun Doo-hwan’s suppression of democratic movement.His symbolic role made him one of the most prominent politicians in the ruling party and convinced the party members to rally behind his maneuvers. Two years after playing hide-and-seek, Kim won the 1992 presidential election. When done with less cause, the impact of the seclusion strategy is reduced, as is the case with Saenuri’s Kim, who is a respected jurist but a novice politician, having just entered politics earlier this month. Although he came back to lead the party on Monday, some disgruntled Saenuri members blamed the interim chief for worsening the factional strife by catering to the needs of the faction led by President Park Geun-hye. . “Kim’s decision looks to be solely for saving face for President Park. What he did was questioning the decision made through democratic procedure,” professor Kim Min-jeon said.

The move has hurt the North's ability to trade with the outside world.Quoting a source in the North's northern province of Ryanggang bordering China, the RFA said that, previously, the export permit for tree logs in the region was given to a specific company under the control of the North's General Bureau of Reconnaissance, but now it has been given to two others under the People's Armed Forces Ministry.In Ryanggang Province, there are some 30 trading companies that are under the direct control of the central government, according to the source. In addition, there are dozens of other commercial organizations of various firms that are given permits that allow them to sell their products in other countries.""These trading organizations are competing to get export permits from the regime for such minerals as tungsten, gold, zinc and copper, and even the scraps from the mineral smelting factories there,"" the source told the RFA.The source added the traders are exporting whatever items they can. The source pointed out that logs, bracken and mushrooms, as well as other goods and produce, are being shipped out of the country.Another source told the RFA that the state trading entities even started cracking down on the country's private traders in a bid to sell more goods imported from China.The state-run traders are trying to hold dominant positions vis-a-vis the rising affluent North Korean class called ""donju,"" who earn money by trading with China. Literally meaning ""masters of money,"" donju are people who made cash through business ventures. North Korea depends heavily on China for exports, with 90 percent of its overseas shipments bound for its closest ally. Of the total, coal accounts for nearly 40 percent, serving as a major ""life line"" for foreign currencies.","korean traders going all ,permits report north korean ,korean traders going ,to get trade permits ,north korean trading companies","['north korean', 'Washington', 'Radio Free Asia']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68739825  0.77902764

For example, being unfamiliar with the idea of marriage certificates in the 1950s, many “married” women were in fact not even aware of the existence of the legal practice. Some of them ended up being kicked out of their houses and were even forced to leave their children years after their weddings, following their unfaithful husbands’ mistresses registering themselves as legal wives, according to a study by the Seoul Foundation of Women and Family. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, 11 percent of all Koreans who sought help at the KLACFR were those who wished to end their de facto marriages. The proportion of those who contacted the institution in hopes of terminating their common-law marriages were the highest during this time period since the Korean War , the study showed.In the 1970s, the proportion of those who wanted to end their marriages as their spouses had been missing for more than three years was the highest among all decades since the 1950s. In the time period, a total of 6.2 percent of all Korean men who sought help at the center wanted a divorce because they could not locate their missing spouses, while 2.6 percent of women who contacted the center were experiencing the same. “We assume that many of those people lost touch with their spouses during the Korean War,” researchers wrote in the report. “We also assume that some of their spouses went missing after being sent off to the Vietnam War .”In the 1980s, 35.2 percent of Korean men who contacted the center said they wanted a divorce because their spouses “neglected their spousal duties,” many of them having run away from home. At the same time, 31.3 percent of women said they were mistreated or abused by their husbands. “We think there is a correlation between the high number of husbands whose wives ran away from home and the high number of wives whose husbands were abusive,” researchers wrote in the report.Meanwhile, the proportion of women who wanted a divorce because of domestic abuse was the highest – 33.5 percent – in the 1990s. The proportion of such women accounted for 21.8 percent of all women who sought help at the center in the 1970s, and 31.3 percent in the 1980s, and 31.7 percent in the 2000s. “We don’t think more women became subject to domestic abuse in the 1990s,” researchers wrote in the report. “Rather, we think the way women perceived domestic violence changed dramatically in the specific time period. More women decided not to tolerate abuse by their spouses.”In the 2000s, South Korea was hit by the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. As a result, the proportion of those who sought help at the KLACFR for financial problems, including household debt, increased significantly to 2.8 percent in the 2000s from 0.8 percent in the 1990s.In the 2010s, the highest proportion of both men and women, 50 percent, said they wanted a divorce for reasons that were not one of the following: infidelity, spousal neglect, physical and emotional abuse and a missing spouse. Researchers said a growing number of Koreans are filing for divorce for reasons that were once considered as trivial by the older generations, such as personality clashes, basic unhappiness and incompatibility. Also, those who are having conflicts with their spouse over the issue of financially supporting their parents and in-laws increased by 3.6 times, from 44 in 2005 to 158 in 2015. The proportion of those who contacted the center for bankruptcy counselling also reached the highest in the 2010s, standing at 6.9 percent.

""No regime has been demolished solely from sanctions and pressures.""The co-chairman added South Korea should prepare for potential economic and cultural exchanges with Pyongyang once the on-going deadlock is lifted.","then south korean president ,south korean president ,historic inter korean summit ,korean president ,announced 16 years ago","[""South Korea 's"", 'inter - Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean', 'Kim Dae - jung', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il', 'inter - korean']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.64571989  0.89419925

The 23-year-old Kazakhstani arrived in Seoul in 2011, as an international student, in hopes to learn about the country of her ethnic origin. Born to third-generation ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan, she grew up thinking she was beautiful, feeling confident and comfortable in her skin.Yet things started to change when she realized some people in Korea didn’t see her the way she saw herself. “Among the things I heard was ‘It’s okay to be ugly, but being fat is unforgivable,’” she said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “Another was ‘You’re really lucky that you have a pretty face. Otherwise you would never be able to have a boyfriend.’”While she has always considered herself a confident person, Shamsutdinova said a part of her struggled with her self-image during her stay in Korea. She was often told by Koreans that she should lose weight. Most local clothing stores didn’t have any items available in her size.Alina Shamsutdinova, a 22-year-old Kazakhstani student in Seoul, says she doesn’t want others to pity her because of the body shaming she went through during her years in South Korea. “I want to show people ‘I am who I am, and I think I’m beautiful,’” she says. When she lost some 10 kilograms by fasting in 2014 -- she only drank water and milk for a week -- she was told by hear Korean acquaintance that she should lose more. Throughout that week, she felt dizzy and weak. Since then, she’s made numerous attempts to lose weight after gaining it back again -- until she recently decided to solely lose weight to be healthier.“I think I just tried to follow what others told me, or what the society wants,” Shamsutdinova said on her previous tries to lose weight to look slimmer. “I was young and I thought that was right. I felt that this way I was working on myself when the work should’ve been done from the inside first.”Lookism and eating disorders  While there aren’t a lot of studies available on body shaming in Korea, statistics show that a significant number of Korean women are struggling with their body image and eating disorders. In a 2013 study by Samyook University that surveyed 154 female university students in the normal weight range -- meaning their body mass index was from 18-23 -- almost 95 percent of them said they were unhappy with their bodies. Among them, 61.1 percent said they felt the need to lose weight in order to look more attractive. Among some 1,796 Koreans who sought medical treatment for bulimia from 2008-2013, almost 94 percent of them were women. Also, women in their 20s and 30s accounted for 66.5 percent of all patients. A number of K-pop stars and celebrities, including IU and Jang Na-ra, have openly admitted that they’ve experienced the eating disorder, which involves binge eating often followed by frantic efforts to avoid gaining weight. And many may be suffering in silence, as statistics released by the National Health Insurance Service do not include those who may have been bulimic, but did not seek professional help.Meanwhile, a study last year by Soon Chun Hyang University, which monitored South Korea’s public broadcasters for six months, found that body shaming of plus-size women was prevalent on Korean TV.  For example, an episode of “Hello,” a talk show on KBS2, featured the story of a young woman who belittled her younger sister, whom she called “fat and short,” when the sibling said she was confident about her own body and thought that she could date anyone she wanted. The younger sister said on the show: “My sister said I looked ‘disgusting’ when I wore shorts.”The study also found that many TV producers didn’t see the connection between the nation’s prevalent lookism and gender disparity. The researchers asked six TV producers to rate the importance of combating lookism and body shaming on television on a scale of zero to five -- five being the most important. The producers on average rated it 1.5 out of five. “I think lookism applies to both men and women ,” one of the surveyed producers told researchers for the study. “I don’t think lookism is part of the gender inequality issue.”Body shaming in the education system  Won Yoo-ri was 17 when she returned to Seoul in 2010 to attend university here after living overseas for 16 years. During her first months back, a middle-aged woman on the street literally gasped when she saw her wearing shorts.“Oh my god, when are you going to lose weight? Women must be skinny in order to find men,” the woman, whom she had never seen before, told her.From that day on, Won said she was body shamed left and right in Korea, from strangers to friends, classmates and even professors. One of her older classmates once told her that he’d date her if she lost 30 pounds . She had never been interested in dating him. Once at a restaurant, a server told her that she should stop eating because she had eaten enough. Won also had a professor who told her she would “have it all” if she lost 10 kilograms.She said all of these experiences severely affected her self-esteem. “In the U.S., I felt that my personality was all I needed and people responded to it,” she told The Korea Herald. “But to come to a country and constantly hear a conversation turn to ‘you should lose weight’ was heartbreaking. That became my identity -- the outgoing fat girl from LA.”Pressured by the constant shaming, Won has made a number of efforts to lose weight since 2010. She has sought help at a weight management company. In another try, she ran 10 kilometers a day for two months in the harsh winter weather. “I even considered getting my stomach stapled,” she said. The whole point of losing weight was to avoid the shaming and get complimented on her looks, she said. One of her college friends also starved herself for four months -- she’d only eat half an apple and a single chicken breast a day -- to lose weight. In the process, she passed out at least four times. “ finally feel beautiful for once in Korea and meet the standards,” she said. “So I can move on and better myself in other aspects.”Ashley Hounsell, a 29-year-old American English-language teacher, has been working at a high school in Seoul for the past six years. She’s witnessed many of her current and former female students who were insecure about their body image. Every year during their health checkup, the scale would display everyone’s height and weight for the whole class to see. “I remember girls telling me they weren’t eating for the week before their school checkup,” Hounsell told The Korea Herald. “When I asked why, they told me because everyone gets to see their weight.”Before working at the high school, she taught younger children at a private English-language institution. There, one of her female students, who was 9 at the time, wrote in her diary that she was on a cucumber-only diet because her mother told her she was fat. South Korea currently does not offer any educational programs specifically on body image or self-concept for school children. “Our gender-equality program for school teachers includes a session about how one should not be discriminated against because of their appearance,” said Lee Myung-eun from the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family’s Gender Impact Assessment Division.Fat shaming and fashion industry In Seoul, Shamsutdinova only shops in Myeong-dong, at foreign stores such as H&M; and Forever 21, because Korea’s homegrown brands simply don’t offer anything available in her size. Once, while looking at a shirt for a friend at a Korean store, a sales assistant grabbed the shirt away from her hands, without even asking. “And then she started saying  ‘ small,’ ‘ small,’” she said. “I was speechless.”Shamsutdinova said even online shops and foreign stores in Korea often don’t have many items for plus-size women. And she’s often unhappy about those that are available -- they are often too baggy or unflattering, and don’t complement plus-size body figures, she said. “Having only a couple of stores where I can buy my clothes isn’t easy,” she said. “It feels like if you are plus size you are not allowed to look good. I can’t be as fashionable as I want to be  even though I want to look beautiful.” Baek Jae-hwan, who has been running an online retailer specifically targeting plus-size women for five years, said most Koreans tend to think those who dress well are only those who are thin. His shop, www.tongkeungirl.com, is one of very few Korean online stores that features plus-size models for their clothes. One of the models is in fact Baek’s wife, who is also his business partner. “My wife has always had a very specific taste in clothes,” Baek told The Korea Herald. “She’s always preferred simple and modern design over something too frilly or dressy. As she couldn’t find what she wanted to wear available in her size, she wanted to find them herself. That’s how we started our business.”Baek said he’s received a lot of positive feedback from his customers, who also expressed their frustration over other online stores that feature skinny models when they claim to cater to plus-size women. “One’s body and its size has little to do with his or her ability to dress well. I’ve seen skinny people who dress terribly,” he said. “Being a good dresser means you just understand your body, what works the best for you. I think it’s totally possible for people with all kinds of body shapes to dress well. But I also understand that plus-size individuals have limited options to choose from. And that needs to change.”Bringing changesEarlier this year, Shamsutdinova participated in a special project called “I am Beautiful,” which featured photographs of 24 individuals who have struggled with self-image and are making efforts to love and accept themselves as they are. For her, discovering the existence of plus-size models worldwide, especially Tess Holliday, one of the best known body-positive activists in the U.S., and South Korea’s first plus-size model Kim Ji-yang, made a difference. She has recently accepted that it is not easy for her to lose weight and she would only go on a diet for health purposes, not to meet the beauty standards here. While she thinks plus-size models shouldn’t justify obesity and an unhealthy lifestyle, Shamsutdinova said the world needs to see more people like Holliday and Kim to change their views on beauty and women’s bodies. “Once I started seeing girls my size in the media, I definitely started to appreciate my body more and accept myself more,” she said. “ Kim Ji-yang was just empowering. She looked beautiful. She is Asian like me even though there is a stereotype that ‘Asians are usually slim.’” James Turnbull, who writes on Korean feminism and popular culture at his established blog the Grand Narrative, said asking Korean TV producers to notice lookism was like “asking fish to start paying attention to the water.”He pointed out that Korea has the highest rate of celebrity endorsements in the world, as roughly 60 percent of all commercials here feature celebrities, as opposed to about 10 percent in most other developed nations. “ can set an example by choosing alternative role models as representatives for its own numerous public campaigns, rather than always going for a young, thin K-pop star,” Turnbull said, when asked what Korea could do to tackle the issue of body shaming.Like Shamsutdinova, Won also recently decided to lose weight for her own sake and health, and said she’s never been happier. “A year ago I met my current boyfriend who happens to be Filipino-American,” she said. “Being around him and his friends reassure me and encourage me solely to, perhaps, lose weight to be healthier was my turning point. It really depends on who you surround yourself with.”By Claire Lee  Ashley Hounsell is not her real name.

The photos were obtained by Yonhap through a third source.The incumbent leader took power following the sudden death of his father in late 2011.The communist country proclaimed a ""Kim Jong-un era"" at the recently held congress of the Workers' Party of Korea. He was named the new chairman of the WPK.The propaganda slogan appears to be in line with the country's past practice of making its leader into a glorified being, which is the case with North Korean founder Kim Il-sung and the late leader Kim Jong-il. Among the pictures taken, one shows a sign placed on top of a public organization which reads, ""Hurrah, General Kim Jong-un, the Sun of the Songun  Korea!.""Similar phrases expressing gratitude to the North Korean leader were found at an elementary school and a childcare center in Pyongyang which read, ""Thank you, dear general Kim Jong-un.""At the science and technology hall in the capital city, Kim's speech appears on an LCD screen, saying, ""We should make efforts for the development of information technology to the level of state-of-the-art.""Related to the idolization drive, a Hong Kong-based TV station reported from Pyongyang last month that slogans and catchphrases heralding the Kim Jong-un era were prominently on display at some of the state-run factories in the North Korean capital.The station said the North had already used the propaganda slogan ""Kim Jong-un era"" even before the landmark WPK congress held earlier last month.In addition, there were photos showing various slogans and catchphrases such as ""For the accomplishments of the decisions made at the 7th congress of the WPK,"" or ""Let's advance the date of the final victory of the juche  revolution by exerting the utmost efforts for the accomplishment of the tasks decided at the party congress.""","idolizing kim the photos ,korea putting up slogans ,korea has placed large ,up the personality cult ,north korea has placed","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Pyongyang', 'Sinuiju', 'Kim']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52553201  0.78054273

""I was one of those victimized by such people.""Even though hate speech victims filed complaints with operators of the internet and social network services, they had no effective way to stop incidences of hate speech in cyberspace from taking place.""Actually, there are no viable means for minorities to protect themselves when they are targets of hate speech,"" Lee said.She has been visiting Seoul to take part in the Seoul Queer Culture Festival, a festival for South Korea's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people that opened on Saturday.In January, she attended a weekly rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to call for the Japanese government to apologize to the victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery and provide compensation.At the time, she saw a group of young people staging a vigil around a statue symbolizing the former comfort women in a protest against South Korea's deal last year with Japan on resolving the issue. The view of the young people's rally struck her as encouraging, but an attempt by some of South Korea's right-wing people to foil the demonstration raised the specter of the Zaitokukai anti-Korean rallies. Lee said she had been heartened by two developments involving Japan's efforts to put a break on hate speech. In January, the Osaka Prefectural Assembly passed the first local ordinance against hate speech in the country. The ordinance passage was followed by the enactment of a law by Japan's parliament on May 24 designed to deter hate speech. ""I was so happy the law passed the parliament,"" she said. The law defines as discriminatory any expression of intent to harm people who were born abroad and reside in Japan lawfully and their descendants, or to incite discrimination against them.""I was so much moved upon hearing that an anti-Korean group was forced to call off a demonstration on June 5 after participants of the rally were surrounded by hundreds of citizens voicing opposition against the event,"" in the Japanese city of Kawasaki, Lee said. ""Hate speech demonstrations should be held nowhere.""She hoped that the newly established law against hate speech, whose effectiveness is limited because it does not prohibit or penalize hate speech, needs to be enhanced down the road. ""In addition, what is important, is the efforts to education people on things related to it,"" she said.According to Lee, hate speech is a virus which originates from the internet and plagues the world. ""The virus should be dealt with by vaccines that can be education and people-to-people exchanges,"" she said.""It is up to general citizens to change society. In that sense, everybody ought to have awareness not to tolerate discrimination,"" she stressed.Lee is waiting for the verdict of her 2014 damages suits. She said she ""will win them no matter what and the victory will be not only mine but also ours.""","hate speech korean resident ,hate speech in japan ,of hate speech korean ,japan of hate speech ,hate speech korean","['korean', 'Japan', 'anti - korean', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Lee Shin - hye', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Lee', 'Japan']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.60064858  0.27399039

The source speculated that the move may be an attempt to conceal the fact that they are North Koreans. The badge is a sign of respect and loyalty and is viewed as part of the personality cult being built around the current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un who took the country's power after his father Kim Jong-il's death in 2011.","korean workers in china ,late north korean leaders ,monday an ethnic korean ,north korean employees ,china do not wear","['north korean', 'China', 'north korean', 'Kim Il - sing', 'Kim Jong - il', 'korean', 'China', 'the Radio Free Asia', 'north korean', 'the Hongju International Hotel', 'Hunchun', 'China', 'Jilin Province']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26841536  0.59847534

The analysis found no reference to the communist state as a nuclear power contrary to widespread expectation.The set of party bylaws, which is regarded as being superior to the Constitution in the party-centric state, was amended during the 7th party congress last month, in what analysts said was a move to further strengthen North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's grip on power.Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University, noted that Pyongyang might have signaled its intention to engage in negotiations over its nuclear program amid its deepening isolation stemming from its nuclear and missile provocations.""If North Korea had stated itself as a nuclear power in the bylaws, this would have posed a great impediment to its efforts to hold talks and negotiations with the United States ,"" he said.Pyongyang has already claimed itself to be a nuclear power in its Constitution. During the May party congress, the reclusive state went further to portray itself as a ""responsible"" nuclear state, saying that it will ""permanently"" defend its policy of simultaneously pursuing economic development and nuclear armament.All these moves have been seen as an indication of Pyongyang's unwillingness to bargain away its nuclear arms despite its pressing need to break out of international isolation and shore up its debilitated economy.Observers have argued that with Pyongyang having conducted four nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013 and this year, it would seek negotiations over a nuclear arms reduction rather than denuclearization.In the revised document of party regulations, the North described its current leader as a ""great leader,"" bringing the status of the 30-something strongman closer to that of his two late predecessors: national founder Kim Il-song and former leader Kim Jong-il. Kim Il-song is the current leader’s grandfather, while Kim Jong-il is his father.The North calls Kim's predecessors ""eternal leader"" and ""eternal head,"" respectively.The document also said that citizens age 18 or older can join the party and are obliged to offer it 2 percent of their monthly income, and that party membership can be canceled when a member opposes the party's policy, engages in any factional activity or inflicts ""grave"" damage on the party.The set of rules, in addition, defined the ruling party as one rooted in the ideological principles of Kim's two predecessors, in an apparent move to justify the long-standing hereditary rule by the Kim family.","communist state as nuclear ,party bylaws north korea ,nuclear power in ruling ,state as nuclear pow ,nuclear armed state","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Yonhap News Agency']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5770371   0.27740183

The call is the latest dialogue offer by the North after its leader Kim Jong-un called for military talks with South Korea during the Workers' Party of Korea congress.Since then, the North has repeatedly proposed talks, although Seoul dismissed them because it said such proposals lacked sincerity. Besides urging talks, the North, in addition, called on compatriots to engage in an ""anti-U.S. sacred war,"" demanded the halt of all Seoul-Washington military drills and outlined the benefits of North Korea's ""nuclear sword"" for self-defense.In regards to the latest proposal, South Korea's Ministry of Unification immediately turned down the offer, again saying that it is just a propaganda ploy. ""It's only an obsolete propaganda offensive and repeat of its previous demands to suspend joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises, which came without any attitude change in the nuclear weapon issue, the most critical obstacle to the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula,"" ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said.Pyongyang should first declare denuclearization and follow it with action if the country wants to improve ties and reunify with South Korea, Jeong noted. The spokesman said North Korea's recent dialogue offer is just part of an effort to follow through with decisions made during the May party congress.","reunification meeting north korea ,grand meeting for reunification ,korean reunification meeting north ,korean reunification meeting ,inter korean reunification meeting","['North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'inter - korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26757446  0.64276499

Stoeger attended a ceremony at the ministry marking the bestowal of citizenship, but Pissar was not able to do so for health reasons. During the ceremony, they also received a medal of citizenship and a Korean folding screen decorated with a depiction of the ""Sipjangsaeng,"" or ten longevities.South Korea awards honorary citizenship to a foreigner who made outstanding and meritorious contributions to enhancing the country's prestige and interests.It marks the second time for a foreigner to be made an honorary South Korean citizen since Hiddink, the Dutch head coach of the Korean national soccer team, received honorary South Korean citizenship in 2002.The bestowal of an honorary citizenship certificate does not warrant any legal rights and duties. But the ministry plans to provide them with administrative conveniences such as quick entry and exit through immigration checkpoints and the immediate provision of permanent resident status.Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said, ""I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to them for the sacrifices they made for people with leprosy for about 40 years.""After graduating from the nursing college of the University of Innsbruck, the two women came to the island in 1962 and 1966, separately, upon hearing that the colony was in need of nurses.They resided on the island for more than 40 years to work at the National Sorok Island Hospital before returning to their home country in 2005.Despite their long years of duty, the two, often called ""the Angels of Sorok Island,"" did not receive any remuneration for their service and only devoted themselves to caring for leprosy-stricken patients and improving their welfare.The government presented them with medals in 1972, 1983 and 1996 for their contributions to the country. The Sorok colony was founded on the small island in 1916 during Japan's colonial rule of Korea , as they attempted to quarantine patients with leprosy. Infected people were rounded up and taken to the island for isolation and treatment. The South Korean government forced them to remain there until 1963, nearly two decades after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Hundreds of people who suffered from the disease still reside on the island, even after having been cured.","korean citizenship two nuns ,two nuns from austria ,south korean citizenship wednesday ,korea most famous leper ,sisters marianne stoeger 82","['Austria', 'south korean', 'the Justice Ministry', 'Marianne Stoeger', 'Margareta Pissar', ""South Korea 's""]",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.20000374  0.73895109

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York this week.“The talents of diplomats are not suitable for local politics. While diplomacy is also important, a diplomatic character does not fit with the politics that have extreme conflicts,” Lee said to the press. “I have seen many diplomats, but none of them ran for presidency.”Former prime minister and independent Rep. Lee Hae-chan Lee is currently visiting the U.S. upon the invitation of the U.S. State Department. He was the former premier during the Roh Moo-hyun administration and is the head of a foundation honoring the late leader. Ban served as foreign minister during the liberal Roh administration at the same time Lee was prime minister. Lee reportedly played a role in getting Ban elected as chief of the global body.To the question as to whether he plans to give such advice to Ban during their slated meeting, Lee said the encounter is not supposed to be a political one and that he was meeting the secretary-general for a simple cup of tea. He said he was contacted by Ban’s side for the meeting. Ban and Lee will meet Wednesday, according to the source who works at a foundation honoring late President Roh. Lee is the foundation’s chief director.“ itinerary includes a visit to New York,” the source said on condition of anonymity.The meeting will likely draw keen attention as it comes after Ban indicated interest in running for South Korea’s presidency during a visit to his native country last week. The next presidential election is slated for December 2017, and Ban has long been considered a strong contender, especially within the conservative ruling party.Political watchers raised the possibility that the former foreign minister may be reaching out to regain the support of Roh loyalists from whom he has drifted apart.“For Secretary-General Ban, it’s only natural that he feels uneasy about the talk that he has turned his back on Roh loyalists,” an official of the liberal opposition camp said, asking that he not be identified.Ban is to complete his second, five-year term as U.N. chief at the end of this year.According to a survey conducted by Realmeter of 2,018 South Koreans last week, Ban held an approval rate of 25.3 percent, outpacing other potential candidates from the opposition, who till now had been leading in the polls. Moon Jae-in, former leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea, held 22.2 percent in the same survey, up 0.7 percentage point from a week earlier.From news reports","not suitable for politics ,south korean prime minister ,diplomats are not suitable ,politics former south korean ,diplomats were not suitable","['south korean', 'Lee Hae - chan', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'New York', 'Lee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50554663  0.64557731

The trip came as South Korea and France prepare to celebrate the 130th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties.Park is set to meet with her French counterpart, Francois Hollande, on Friday -- the fourth such meeting between the two leaders -- to reaffirm their friendship and boost their partnership.The two leaders are expected to strengthen close coordination in enforcing the toughest U.N. sanctions ever imposed on North Korea over its fourth nuclear test and its long-range rocket launch earlier this year. France is one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.On Tuesday, North Korea's latest attempt to launch an intermediate-range ballistic missile ended in failure.The launch is widely seen as North Korea's latest defiance against U.N. sanctions, which ban the country from launching ballistic missiles.South Korea and France are set to ink cooperation deals to create new growth engines for their economies.Park and Hollande are also scheduled to adopt a joint declaration to mark the 130th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties, a move that Seoul says could be an important milestone in boosting bilateral cooperation.Last year, Park visited Paris to attend the U.N. climate change summit.Park arrived from Nairobi, where she met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, and they agreed to boost bilateral cooperation in business and trade.The trip has already taken her to Ethiopia and Uganda.","korean president in 16 ,in paris on wednesday ,south korean president park ,korean president park geun ,korean president park","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Paris', 'Park', 'french', 'France', 'south korean', 'South Korea', 'France']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.67402309  0.78798056

The suspects are then alleged to have taken the victim to one of the men’s flat where they sexually assaulted her and photographed her body.  The victim reported to the Swedish Embassy, which prompted the Korean National Police Agency to launch an investigation.The Mapo police said they were able to arrest all three suspects on May 24 based on the surveillance camera recordings and photos of the suspects left on the victim’s mobile phone. The case has since been passed on to the Seoul Western District Prosecutor’s Office. In March, a rape case involving an Australian woman in Hongdae sparked public fury when the victim disclosed details about irregularities in the local police investigation. Hongdae is a popular area for both locals and foreigners for its unique artsy ambience. However, in February a number of establishments barred foreigners, sparking controversy.

""As they don't possess passports, South Korean authorities are believed to be seeking cooperation with relevant organizations there.""The latest development is the second of its kind after a group of 13 North Korean restaurant workers defected en masse to South Korea in April.Last month's defectors worked at a restaurant in the Chinese eastern port city of Ningbo before they arrived in South Korea, with government insiders hinting at tougher international sanctions and mounting pressure by Pyongyang to earn money forced them to escape.The South Korean government confirmed last Tuesday that an unspecified number of North Korean restaurant workers have recently fled their workplaces, but it declined to reveal details, citing their safety and diplomatic impact.South Korea's unification ministry also declined to comment on details about the workers on Monday.""There is nothing that I can further confirm as the  is still underway,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing when asked about the three people's health conditions.Pyongyang has claimed that South Korea kidnapped the group of North Koreans who defected to Seoul last month, calling on Seoul to immediately send them back home. Seoul said that the North Koreans defected on their own free will.Overseas restaurants operated by North Korea have served as one of the main sources of hard currency for North Korea, with which the North is suspected of bankrolling its nuclear and missile programs.Such restaurants are known to be facing financial difficulty after the U.N. Security Council slapped tougher sanctions on Pyongyang for its January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February.South Korea estimates that North Korea is running approximately 130 restaurants in around 12 countries, including China, Vietnam and Cambodia, earning $10 million annually.","three north korean women ,korean women who fled ,in seoul this week ,board flight to seoul ,the north korean women","['north korean', 'China', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'Thailand', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'Shanxi']",5,"[ 1.          1.          0.         ... -0.74157584  0.59007066

If it comes to that, I don’t think there will be any more momentum within Japan .”Haruki Wada, professor emeritus of Tokyo University, speaks at the Jeju Forum. According to Wada, the nullification of last year’s Dec. 28 deal is likely to blur the outlook for any further agreement on the issue.Comfort women is a term euphemistically used to refer to some 200,000 women from Asian countries who were coerced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II. There are currently 42 surviving comfort women in South Korea.Wada pointed out that the Japanese leader’s resurfacing to power in 2012 had threatened the civil movement in Japan to address the topic.“The past 25 years of efforts to resolve this  issue seemed to go down the drain with Abe, and his actions sparked further backlash from Korea,” he said.“I don’t think Abe would have wanted the agreement. He was seen to be ‘running away’ , saying that there was no forcible recruitment of comfort women.”Last year, the scholar urged Abe to honor the 1993 Kono Statement and 1995 Murayama Statement and display his commitment to Tokyo’s apologies for its wartime atrocities. Former Japanese leader Tomiichi Murayama himself, who offered the watershed apology, recently urged Abe to offer written apologies to the victims.Wada said while the agreement has some shortcomings, it nevertheless represented Abe “taking a step back” from his former unyielding stance.But the December agreement once again evoked the decades-long disputes, especially from the surviving victims themselves.One of them, Kim Bok-dong, visited the National Assembly on Thursday, urging for the nullification of the agreement and renegotiation.The surviving comfort women have been protesting against Abe’s lack of direct apology and of admitting legal responsibility. They also demanded for clarity on the suspicion that the two governments may have agreed off paper to relocate a comfort women statue adjacent to the Japanese Embassy here.The term “final and irreversible,” referring to the nature of the agreement as specified by the two governments, has been another point of dispute.“The ‘final and irreversible’ clause may make it appear as if Korea can no longer criticize or make demands ,” Wada said.“But the fact is that the two countries agreed to deal with this issue on a state level. What can be gained from dismissing it as insignificant altogether?”By Yoon Min-sik","japan wartime sexual slavery ,women issue korean civic ,women settlement but japanese ,criticize the seoul tokyo ,wartime sexual slavery continue","['korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Koreans']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67743915  0.01958725

""I changed both of their diapers.""Kim's main interest was basketball, Ko said.""He started playing basketball, and he became obsessed with it,"" she said, adding that he even slept with a basketball.Kim is reported to have been a Michael Jordan fan and as leader he has hosted former basketball star Dennis Rodman several times in Pyongyang.Kim knew from 1992 that he would become North Korea's leader, Ko said. The signal came on his eighth birthday when he received a general's uniform and the country's military top brass began bowing to him.It remains unclear why Ko defected to the US, where she arrived with her husband after showing up at the US Embassy in the Swiss capital Bern.However, Ko's sister had terminal breast cancer and the couple believed they might lose their privileged status after the children they were charged with looking after in Switzerland grew up, the Post reported.Analysts suggested that they may have also been concerned about their position if Ko's sister -- their link to the regime -- died. After months of questioning, the family was eventually resettled in the US a few hours drive from New York City where they started new lives under assumed names not revealed by The Washington Post.They brought a house with financial help from the CIA. ""My friends here tell me I'm so lucky, that I have everything,"" she said.Ko's three children went to college and found jobs in the US, the Post reported.Though the couple still cooperate with the CIA, Ko's husband Ri insisted they betrayed no secrets.""They  thought we must know some secrets, but we didn't know anything,"" he said.

However, even that small percentage of wages does not reliably make its way to the employee.The media outlet also said that North Korean workers are paid more than before due to cheap expenses and a rise in demand, but their living standards do not show any improvement, as they always have to send most of their income to the Pyongyang regime.","meager wages to the ,korean workers in china ,many north korean laborers ,their meager wages to ,their meager wages","['north korean', 'China', 'north korean', 'China', 'Radio Free Asia', 'north korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6714682   0.64803296

141,141,141,[JEJU FORUM] Former Malay leader advocates ‘Criminalize War’ objectives,"Former Malaysian leader Mahathir bin Mohamad, who will be attending the 11th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, said the forum complements the struggle of the “Criminalize War” objectives.“Only if war is regarded as a crime and those who launch wars of aggression are tried and punished will we have less war or more peace.

With peace, there will be prosperity for all people,” said Mahathir, who heads the movement. In addressing recent tensions between the Koreas -- which was further escalated by North Korea’s formal claims of being a nuclear-armed state earlier in the month -- Mahathir also called for talks rather than sanctions.“Sanctions punish the people, not the leaders. North Korea is not a democracy and the people cannot influence the policies of their government,” Mahathir said, urging the leaders to find “nonviolent ways to settle the problem.” “It is therefore incumbent for the international community to meet North Korea leaders, especially those of countries friendly toward North Korea.” Well known as Malaysia’s longest serving leader, Mahathir will attend the Jeju Forum, which takes place from May 25-27 at the International Convention Center Jeju in Jungmun, Seogwipo City, Jejudo Island.An advocate of “Asian values” during his time in office, Mahathir’s tenure as prime minister stretched from 1981 to 2003. His political career spans nearly four decades.His time in office was marked by major infrastructure projects and economic growth in the 1990s.He also addressed the conflict involving his own country, which is currently locked in a sea border dispute with China, the Philippines and other countries in the South China Sea. “The countries concerned should hold talks to find a solution to the problem. Confrontation and war is not going to end the dispute no matter who wins,” he said.During his time in office, Mahathir had strongly stressed countries’ independent operations.When asked if such views still hold during an era of international cooperation, he said that while outside interference does limit a country’s independence, international bodies like the U.N. may interfere in “certain cases such as the genocide in Cambodia and the breakdown of law and order in some countries.” He, however, cautioned against big powers intervening on their own.Mahathir has retained a prominent position in political circles even after retirement. Most recently he criticized Prime Minister Najib Razak over the money laundering scandal. He is currently holding a signature campaign against Razak.“I believe the present prime minister has done a lot of damage to Malaysia. The legal system has been undermined so that there is no longer any protection for the people and the country,” he said, calling the situation “shameful.”","leader advocates criminalize war ,malay leader advocates criminalize ,advocates criminalize war ,advocates criminalize war objectives ,the criminalize war objectives","['malaysian', 'Mahathir bin Mohamad', 'Mahathir']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5142346   0.27484643

Those who disapproved of the chief executive’s job performance came to 62.9 percent, up 1.8 percentage points from a week before.The tension between the presidential office and political parties escalated with the clash over the status of the song “March for the Beloved” at the annual ceremony to commemorate the May 18 democracy movement. Liberals and the opposition have favored making the song an official part of the event, but conservatives, including the presidential office, remained reluctant to make the change. The government’s stance for the past several years has been to allow people attending the annual memorial service in Gwangju, 330 kilometers south of Seoul, the freedom of choice to sing the song if they choose to do so, but not to compel them. The song is viewed by conservatives with suspicions because it is used by labor unions and in most antigovernment protests, with many right wing groups stringently opposed to giving the song any formal status. The approval rating of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea reached 29.5 percent, marking the first time in four weeks that it surpassed the ruling Saenuri Party’s 28.4 percent. The minor opposition People’s Party posted an approval rating of 19.8 percent.","koreans last week 32 ,south koreans last week ,531 south koreans last ,song controversy korean president ,koreans last week","['korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'South Koreans']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61547881  0.61462212

Under last year's landmark deal, Tokyo expressed its apology and contrition for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation to be established by Seoul to support the surviving victims, euphemistically called ""comfort women.""The agreement, praised by many in the international community as a step in the right direction, aims to end the divisive issue which has been a thorn in bilateral relations for decades and has held up the forging of ties between Seoul and Tokyo. The United States in particular had pushed for a breakthrough on this issue between its two closest Asian allies.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were forced into sexual slavery at front-line Japanese brothels during World War II.The decision, however, has come under fire as some of the victims and their supporters have accused it of failing to obtain Japan's acknowledgment of legal responsibility. Detractors have also said the agreement was reached without prior consultation with the victims.The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, which organized the three-day conference, said the deal tramples on the efforts and aspirations of the victims and civil society who have worked on the issue.During the three-day conference which took place in Seoul, victims and progressive activists from Asian countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and Hong Kong, shared their testimonies and resolved to take collective actions.The wartime sexual slavery issue has been cited as one of the key stumbling blocks to closer South Korea-Japan relations, along with Tokyo's efforts to whitewash its history of aggression and territorial claims of South Korea's easternmost island of Dokdo.Public sentiment in South Korea is generally sympathetic to the plight of sex slaves, although there are some who view progressive groups supporting the victims as having ulterior motives unrelated to helping those used as sex slaves find peace with the past.Conservative elements have claimed that anti-government civic groups are actually using the sexual slavery issue as a political tool to hurt Seoul.","japanese military sexual slavery ,denouncing seoul tokyo deal ,wartime sexual slavery denounced ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,asian former sex slaves","['asian', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'japanese']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53141344 -0.09601535

Chun Doo-hwan, who took power following the turmoil left by the assassination of then-President Park Chung-hee the previous year. The late president had ruled the country for 18 years before his death and is the father of incumbent President Park Geun-hye, while Chun went onto to become a South Korean president as well.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and officials from the ruling and opposition parties all gathered in Gwangju to express their condolences to the victims’ families.""We have struggled to establish a liberal and righteous country under the democracy built on the spirit of the May 18 movement,""Hwang said, adding the government will make efforts to generate jobs and lend support to the livelihood of the people based on such achievements.""We will also root out corruption and unreasonable customs that harm the trust and unity of the public. By building a fair and transparent society that does not tolerate privileges and violations, we will continue to support the spirit of the democracy movement,"" he added.As announced earlier, the organizer did not obligate all attendees to sing the song that commemorates the uprising that resulted in a large number of deaths.Since 1997, the uprising's signature song ""March for the Beloved"" had been officially sung by attendees of the national ceremony every year, but the government of former President Lee Myung-bak decided in 2009 to have a choir perform the song.People could sing along if they wished, but the choice to do so was left to each individual.This practice set by the conservative president was continued by the Park administration despite strong urging to alter it by liberals. The government's stance sparked controversy here, with some claiming that the decision has damaged the spirit of the democracy uprising.Reflecting the heated debate, Patriots and Veterans Affairs Minister Park Sung-choon, whose office manages the event, was barred from taking part in the event by relatives of those killed in the democracy movement. The minister, citing the need to be even-handed and respect conservative elements of society, made a decision to not switch back to the old system of all participants singing the song.The controversy around the song derives from a wider public debate over the uprising, which conservatives downplay as an illegal armed revolt against the government.Some conservative South Koreans express discontent against the music as local labor unions and workers often play or sing the song when they stage protest rallies, even in events not related to the democracy movement.The president, meanwhile, did not participate in the event. She participated in the annual ceremony only in her first year of office in 2013.","korea commemorates democracy movement ,song quarrel south korea ,of key popular uprising ,korea commemorates democracy ,36th anniversary of key","['South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Chun Doo - hwan']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.55237806 -0.05354199

The opposition circle has been requesting that the song be re-designated as an official anthem so that all will have to sing-along.President Park Geun-hye, in her recent meeting with the floor leaders of key political parties, had gestured at embracing the opposition’s call.“I will instruct the MVPA to find a solution that does not cause a split in public opinion,” said President Park Geun-hye last Friday.Her words were directed to both opposition parties -- The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party -- but especially to the latter’s floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won who had brought up the issue at the meeting.The People’s Party, speaking for the southwestern city of Gwangju and the surrounding Jeolla provinces, has its reasons to advocate the disputed song.The citizens of Gwangju, having experienced a violent crackdown during the democratization protest back in 1980, have long considered themselves as victims to political powers, as well as aliens to the nation’s economic development. For them, the government’s official recognition of responsibility and expression of respect for the historic demonstration is the key to all communication. And designation of the song would be part of that. When the former conservative Lee Myung-bak administration struck the song off the official protocol, citing public opinion split over allegedly radical lyrics, it aggravated the decades-long grudge of the Gwangju-Jeolla regions.But the presidential office, even facing an opposition-dominated legislature, has few reasons to appreciate the activist song, which many conservatives deem to be provocative.According to leading conservative civic groups, including the Korean Disabled Veterans’ Association by Agent-Orange in Vietnam War, the song carries antigovernment, pro-communist messages. They claim that the term “beloved” in the song refers to North Korea’s deceased communist leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il and the term “new day” refers to a North Korea-led unification.Backing their claim, they point out that the song was sung in the official ceremonies of the former Unified Progressive Party, which was disbanded in 2014 for what the Supreme Court defined as antigovernment activities.But former North Korean figures, such as Rep. Ha Tae-keung, argue that the song is forbidden in North Korea and is in no way connected to the communist regime.Some experts pointed out that political circles should focus more on the gist of the event which the song is supposed to commemorate.“The key point of the May 18 democratization spirit is to promote citizens’ basic rights, not to discuss the status of the song,” said Song Ho-keu, a professor of sociology at Seoul National University.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com","shows deep political conflict ,activist commemorative song march ,korea history of political ,political conflict the repeated ,activist song dispute shows",['South Korea ’s'],5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19132061  0.44879472

North Korea's just-concluded party congress officially endorsed Kim's ""byeongjin"" policy of simultaneously pursing both nuclear and economic development, dashing hopes that Kim may chart a different course on its nuclear weapons program. In an editorial, the state-run China Daily newspaper said Kim's policy ""does signify a step forward from songun,"" or the military-first policy by his late father, Kim Jong-il. ""But it is simply beyond Pyongyang's competence to pursue the twin goals at once. The country's limited resources can't support both. Nor will the international community allow its nuclearization,"" the editorial reads. The Chinese paper said Kim ""appears unaware that his nuclear ambitions are poison for his country's economy."" ""They will not only exhaust his country's very limited resources but will further isolate his country from the rest of the world, politically and economically,"" it said. North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests since 2006. The latest nuclear test in January prompted China to back tougher U.N. sanctions against the traditional ally. Further consolidating his grip on power, Kim was elected chairman of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party during the party conclave, which was held for the first time in 36 years. Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message on Monday to Kim on his promotion, hoping to steadily develop the friendship between the allies.","korea nuclear ambitions poison ,nuclear ambitions poison the ,north nuclear ambitions poison ,nuclear ambitions poison for ,nuclear ambitions poison","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'chinese', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kim', 'Kim']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.37911659  0.27210748

The release came eight years after the official records, believed to have been drawn up from 1924, were discovered by the professor at a warehouse in Yokoamicho Park, a memorial park in Tokyo, in 2008.The professor, who has spent his whole life investigating the massacre, said the records could not have been revealed to the public earlier due to the two countries' diplomatic feud.According to the records, Japanese soldiers were involved in the massacre, which took place during Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910-45. Historians say up to 6,000 Koreans were killed in the aftermath of the magnitude 7.9-earthquake that devastated Tokyo, Yokohama and other surrounding prefectures. The massacre began as the Japanese government spread rumors of a planned riot by Koreans in a scheme to divert public attention from social unrest.","koreans killed in japan ,japanese professor on monday ,killed after 1923 quake ,1923 quake in japan ,koreans killed after 1923","['korean', 'Japanese', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Takano Hiroyasu', 'Japan', 'Otaru University of Commerce', 'Koreans', 'Japan']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4051111   0.54058963

The remarks by Kim, announced during a rare congress of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party and reported by the North Korean media on Sunday, reaffirmed the North's bid to become a nuclear weapons state, dashing hope that the young leader might chart a difference course on the country's nuclear weapons program. ""Our republic is a responsible nuclear state that, as we made clear before, will not use nuclear weapons first unless aggressive hostile forces use nuclear weapons to invade our sovereignty,"" Kim was quoted as saying by North Korea's state media. The Global Times newspaper, controlled by China's ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial that North Korea's isolation would deepen unless the North gives up its nuclear ambitions. ""International society is firmly against Pyongyang's nuclear program,"" the editorial reads. ""The external world believes that North Korea is playing a different card to test its effectiveness, and its ultimate goal is to legitimize its nuclear development."" ""Major countries will not change their stance to recognize North Korea as a nuclear state. As long as Pyongyang resists giving up its nuclear weapons, normalizing relations with the outside world will be highly unlikely,"" it said. ""To begin with, Kim's declaration was made from the perspective that North Korea is now a nuclear state,"" it said. ""The international community has not yet acknowledged North Korea as a nuclear nation, so therefore the latter's attitude has not changed, and neither has its biggest contradiction with the outside world been resolved,"" it said. However, the Chinese paper interpreted the remarks by Kim as a ""relaxed manner that might buffer the current touch-and-go tensions."" China's official Xinhua news agency also took note of Kim's pledge. Citing some Chinese experts on the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese news agency reported that the pledge by Kim was different from the North's previous threats that hinted the country could use its nukes to strike out at its enemies.","korean leader nuclear remarks ,leader nuclear remarks china ,on korean leader nuclear ,korean leader nuclear ,nuclear weapons state dashing","['China', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', ""North Korea 's"", ""Workers ' Party"", 'north korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34369197  0.36344895

He claimed that he has been suffering from depression after guarding against terrorism during his overseas post. The court said the correlation was weak.The former lieutenant colonel started his military career in 1983.He served as the defense attache at the South Korean Embassy in Iraq from February 2004 for one year and five months. He was in charge of making location plans for the South Korean troops deployed there to help rehabilitation and analyze the movements of terrorist groups there. His role included sharing information with the embassy and the troops, preparing diplomatic measures for emergencies and working with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.In June, 2004, the former military man helped bring the body of Kim Sun-il, a South Korean civilian who was abducted and beheaded by the Islamist group after the South Korean government refused its demand to pull its troops out of the international forces there and cancel its plan to send more. The man claimed he had to carry out emotionally difficult roles such as repeatedly checking Kim’s body during the process.Upon returning home, the man reportedly received psychological treatment in October 2010 due to amnesia and was diagnosed with depression. He was released from duty in October 2012 and applied to be registered as man of national merit, citing depression and posttraumatic stress in 2014. He claimed he developed these conditions by serving in Iraq and that his mission there was relevant to protecting the nation and the people’s lives.The court, however, ruled against him, citing laws that grant the status only to those who have injured themselves or become ill while serving overseas on reconstruction, medical and restoration missions.“While the role that  had undertaken may apply to the conditions for men of merit, he has not been directly involved in an accident or suffered an injury to his head,” the ruling said. It also cited that he continued to serve his duty normally until 2007, during which he received four commendations.","korean who was beheaded ,beheaded by terrorists ,was beheaded by terrorists ,beheaded by terrorists in ,by terrorists in 2004","['Iraq', 'South Korean', 'the Seoul Administrative Court', 'the Nambu District Office of Pat']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42923486  0.54264092

This has caused a rise in discontent among ordinary people, according to government officials in Seoul.The loyalty campaign also comes as the North has become ever more isolated after the U.N. slapped it with the toughest ever sanctions after the country detonated its fourth nuclear device in January and followed up on this provocation with the firing of a long-range ballistic missile.The NGO's letter pointed out that Kim, who assumed power after the death of his father in late 2011, pledged numerous times to improve the livelihood of ordinary people, but so far he has not kept his promise.","nk leader to halt ,urging north korean leader ,halt forcing its people ,to halt forced labor ,leader to halt forced","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Radio Free Asia', 'the Human Rights Watch', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'the International Labor']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05749818  0.01148807

In a survey of 1,400 defectors conducted last year by Kim Seok-hyang, a professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University, 26 percent said their accent was what made job seeking difficult. It was followed by lack of skills or experience, health, and age at 22.4 percent, 18.3 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.The report was commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission.Of the respondents, 37.8 percent said that they have been “mistreated or discriminated against” while working, of which 47.6 percent said that the cause was their accent. Visitors view an exhibition on the history, system, status and successful cases of North Korean defectors held at Hanawon settlement support center in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 24. But the report indicated that the defectors tended to refrain from actively seeking help regarding work issues. Upon having their rights infringed, 43.7 percent said that they kept it to themselves, while 20.8 percent and 9.4 percent said they addressed it via conversation or made complaints.Kim pointed out that the North Korean defectors do not fully recognize their rights as workers, and suggested that the state authorities should provide education on their rights. She also called for a career development program, employment consultation for the defectors, as well as a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of this issue.The number of people defecting from the communist country has been declining each year since the current leader Kim Jong-un took helm in 2011. A total of 1,502 defected and entered the South in 2012 compared to 2,706 in 2011. Last year, 1,276 people fled Kim’s repressive regime. But according to the Unification Ministry, 342 defectors came to South Korea in the first quarter of this year, which was 51 more than the number of defectors in the same period last year.The South Korean government has suggested that the sudden rebound may be due to economic hardship faced by the North Korean people, resulting from U.N.-led economic sanctions imposed since March.President Park Geun-hye said last month that the recent mass defection of 13 North Korean workers from a restaurant in China was a result of the sanctions.By Yoon Min-sik","survey north korean defectors ,accent hinders defectors job ,400 defectors conducted last ,hinders defectors job searches ,korean defectors say the","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'Kim Seok - hyang', 'north Korean Studies', 'Ewha Womans University']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.47054335  0.70285499

Participants try their hand at making kimchi, Korea’s traditional dish, at a cooking event in Tehran on Sunday on the occasion of South Korean President Park Geun-hye’s visit to the country. “Iranians have a profound interest in Korean culture, with a viewer rating of 85 percent for Korean TV drama Daejanggeum and some 2 million practitioners of taekwondo,” said Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok on Sunday, upon President Park Geun-hye’s arrival in Tehran for the first-ever state visit.Actor Song Il-guk, too, captured the hearts of Iranians with his megahit historic TV drama “Jumong,” or “The Book of Three Han,” potraying the life of the founding hero of ancient Gogureyo Kingdom.His popularity was so extensive that South Korean home appliance maker LG Electronics claimed to have visibly upped its market share in Iran by starring Song as the model for its flat screen television.The Mideast country, due to its strict dress code and moral standards, tends to be closed to western pop culture but seems to have found Korea’s historic soap operas both entertaining and compliant with its religious teachings, according to cultural observers.With the world’s 18th-largest population and a content market growing at 12 percent on average per year, Iran is considered one of the most attractive, underdeveloped markets for Korean cultural exports.“The most promising factor is that 60 percent of Iran’s 80 million population are aged under 30 and over two-thirds are highly educated,” the minister added.“This dynamic young population not only embraces new cultural contents from abroad but also opens doors to new growth opportunities such as the fast-growing smartphone market.”Cheong Wa Dae contends that the favorable impression of Iranian society toward Korean pop culture will act as a lever in expanding bilateral ties in the coming years.“When it comes to cultural exchanges, Iran has the highest regard for Korea, compared to any other potential partner states,” An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, told reporters Monday.South Korea’s top two mobile carriers, SK Telecom and KT, will close a comprehensive deal with the Iranian government on building an ICT network in the country, according to the presidential official.The health ministries of both countries, too, will be signing a similar deal on exporting South Korea’s medical insurance and hospital administration systems.Seeking maximum synergy from the president’s historic visit, the Culture Ministry announced that it will designate 2017 as the year of Korea-Iran cultural exchanges and establish a state-affiliated Korean culture center in Iran --the second of its kind in the Middle East, following the one in the United Arab Emirates.As an initiating event, the ministry hosted the Korea Culture Week, starting with a cultural exchange program Monday at Tehran’s landmark Milad Tower.Held in the presence of President Park and her Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, the event included performances of traditional music, martial arts demonstration and public screening of recent Korean TV dramas.

Meth, which can trigger side effects such as paranoia, hallucinations, delirium and delusions, is banned in South Korea.All told, 16 North Korean defectors were referred to trial. Seoul prosecutors say the seized drugs were mostly supplied by ethnic Koreans living in Chinese areas near the North Korean border.The prosecutors said they have secured testimony from some defectors that much of the smuggled meth was produced in Hamhung, Chongjin and other areas in North Korea's Hamgyong Province before being transported to Dandong, China, or being traded across the Tumen River through local brokers.They suspect that the seized meth was processed into fine, white powder and may be produced in North Korea, pointing at the possibilities of existing drug smuggling routes between the North and South via China.Among the detainees is a North Korean defector surnamed Choi, who allegedly snuck 140 grams of meth into the South. Choi is suspected of selling 120 grams to other North Korean defectors here. The defector most likely purchased the drug from North Koreans at the North Korea-China border near the Tumen River, the prosecutors said.Another North Korean defector, surnamed Cho, purchased the drug from an ethnic Korean in Dandong, northwestern China, and sold it to his fellow defectors. The prosecutors found that the drug is casually consumed by many North Korean defectors. According to the defectors, Philopon is considered to be a common commodity that replaces painkillers and is given as a gift in weddings and other congratulatory family events. ""Some of the defectors said they did not realize that the smuggling and consumption of Philopon are serious crimes,"" a prosecutor said.","20 north korean defectors ,charged with drug smuggling ,korean defectors charged with ,consumption south korean prosecutors ,korean defectors charged","['north korean', 'korean', 'South Korea', 'south korean', 'north korean', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31277961  0.44547522

It was only when he was treated by an Oriental medicine expert who performed acupuncture that his condition significantly improved. “I was very impressed,” the German physician told The Korea Herald during the International Congress of Oriental Medicine in Okinawa, Japan, earlier this month. “Now I’ve been practicing Chinese medicine and acupuncture  for the last 20 years.”Hambrecht is one of some 400 medical professionals who practice alternative or Oriental medicine worldwide, including Taiwan, the U.S., Germany and Japan, who attended ICOM this year. Prior to his training in acupuncture, Hambrecht was trained as a physician specializing in internal medicine at a non-Oriental medical school. Patients at his clinic -- more than 70 percent of them are those with chronic pain conditions -- can benefit from both Oriental and non-Oriental treatment options. Almost 80 to 85 percent of his patients are very pleased with acupuncture treatments, he said. “Many of the patients with pain problems had already visited many other doctors before arriving at my clinic. And when they see me, they’d say, ‘You are my last hope,’” he said. “And when I see a patient with a severe heart problem I’d arrange a western-examination and blood test.”Dr. Klaus Hambrecht, vice president of Germany’s Center for Safety of Chinese Herbal Therapy, speaks with Korean media at the International Congress of Oriental Medicine held in Okinawa, Japan, in April. According to the World Health Organization, traditional medicine -- referring to health practices incorporating plant based medicines and manual techniques such as Korean or Chinese medicine -- has maintained its popularity in all regions of the developing world and its use is rapidly spreading in industrialized countries. In Germany, 90 percent of the population have used a natural remedy at some point in their lives. Currently, medical cost for acupuncture treatments for knees or lower back conditions are covered by the state-run health insurance service in the country, said Hambrecht. According to a 2012 report released by the WHO, 93 percent of the 192 member states of the United Nations have acupuncture practice. Chinese medicine has spread to more than 100 countries and has grown into an industry. As of 2012, there are some 100,000 Chinese medicine clinics and some 300,000 Chinese medicine practitioners worldwide. Meanwhile in the U.S., the number of osteopathic physicians -- who often combine alternative strategies such as acupuncture and massage -- increased 73 percent between 2000 and 2012. They accounted for more than 6.5 percent of the total physician population in the U.S., as of 2012. Dr. Gary Deng, a New York-based physician who practices both Chinese and Western medicine at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said that cancer patients can immensely benefit from alternative medicine during and after chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. According to Deng, some 30 American medical institutions that specialize in cancer treatments, all designated by the National Cancer Institute of the country, currently offer both Western and alternative, or traditional, medicine for their patients. He stressed that there are specific conditions suffered by cancer patients that can only be eased by alternative medicine. For example, patients with the following cancers -- throat, tongue, head and neck cancers -- can experience dry mouths after receiving radiation therapies, as the treatment can damage one’s saliva salivary glands and reduce their saliva. “Your mouth is always very dry and your teeth can easily rot,” he said. Western medicine has no treatment options for dry mouths caused by radiation therapy apart from drugs that often cause side effects, but acupuncture can significantly improve the condition, he said. “We’ve done a lot of clinical trials and concluded that acupuncture treatments work much better than ” He also said alternative medicine can offer a lot to breast cancer patients who have underwent mastectomy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. A lot of them struggle with weight gain as a result of hormone therapy, chronic pain after mastectomy and anxiety as they worry about the recurrence of the disease, he said. Most Western-doctors only offer mammograms to survivors who have completed their cancer treatments every six months, but do not offer much for post-cancer conditions, Deng added. “So in the U.S., many western doctors refer such patients to alternative doctors, as alternative medicine such as acupuncture and herbal medicine can improve their quality of life.”Unlike the U.S. and Germany, western medicine doctors in South Korea have been fiercely protesting against Korean medicine practitioners expanding their area of expertise in the country. Most general hospitals here do not offer Western and alternative treatment options at the same time for cancer patients. The Association of Korean Medicine, one of the largest bodies of traditional doctors in Korea, has been demanding that the government guarantee their right to use nontraditional medical equipment, such as ultrasounds. The 2016 Okinawa Declaration of ICOM stated that its members “support and approve the active use of medical devices by oriental medicine practitioners of each country to enhance evidence-based objectivity of oriental medicine through the diagnosis and treatment in a modern scientific way.”“I think  Korean doctors can focus on conditions that Western medicine do not have a lot to offer,” Deng said. “So you are not taking something away from them. Meanwhile you help patients feel better and this can be a mutually beneficial relationship. Everyone has to be more collaborative, rather than competitive.""By Claire Lee","impressed the german physician ,medicine evolves worldwide okinawa ,expert who performed acupuncture ,an oriental medicine expert ,medicine in okinawa japan","['Japan', 'Klaus Hambrecht', 'oriental', 'german', 'the Korea Herald', 'the International Congress of Oriental Medicine', 'Okinawa', 'Japan']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67764306  0.56322312

He pleaded guilty and asked North Korea for leniency in an internationally broadcast press conference last month.His detainment first became known in a CNN interview broadcast on Jan. 11, soon after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test.Prior to his arrest, Kim lived in China near the North Korean border for 15 years and frequently visited the North Korean special economic zone of Rason.The North's state media said authorities nabbed him as he was waiting to receive a USB drive containing sensitive military information from a source in Rason.The sentence, handed down by the communist country's Supreme Court, follows a similar one given to an American college student, Otto Warmbier, who was caught trying to steal a propaganda banner from a Pyongyang hotel. Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor last month.Experts said the North has previously used detained Americans as leverage to force the U.S. to open bilateral talks with it.he North is under pressure as the United Nations Security Council imposed tougher sanctions against North Korea earlier this month over its nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.In 2014, Pyongyang released three detained Americans -- Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Fowle.Lim Hyeon-soo, a Korean-Canadian pastor, has also been held in captivity in the North since he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission in January 2015.In December, the North's highest court sentenced Lim to life in prison, citing his ""subversive plots"" against the North's regime.","sentenced detained korean american ,for spying north korea ,has sentenced detained korean ,sentenced detained korean ,korean american 10 years","['North Korea', 'korean - american', 'U.S.', 'Kim Dong - chul', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA).The KCNA', 'Kim']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27571875  0.0256415

167,167,167,[FEATURE] Hard knock lives of Koreans born to U.S. soldiers,"More than 50 years after her American solider father left South Korea, Jang Yeon-hee still longs to meet the parent who she has never known. “Whenever I take the subway I see a lot of foreign tourists en route to Incheon International Airport,” Jang said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “When I see such visitors I’d break down in tears. There are so many people coming in and out of this country, and yet the...","More than 50 years after her American solider father left South Korea, Jang Yeon-hee still longs to meet the parent who she has never known. “Whenever I take the subway I see a lot of foreign tourists en route to Incheon International Airport,” Jang said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “When I see such visitors I’d break down in tears. There are so many people coming in and out of this country, and yet the person who gave me my life left before I was even born and never bothered to visit again to see me.”Jang Yeon-hee is searching for her American soldier father, who left Korea while her mother was pregnant with her in the 1960s. Now 51, Jang last week took a DNA test at KoRoot, a Seoul-based adoptee advocacy organization, in hopes of finding her American father. The father left her Korean mother when she was pregnant with Jang in 1964. Jang is one of some 40,000 mixed-race Koreans born in South Korea from 1955-1969, many of whom were born to American soldiers who were temporarily stationed here. Many of the Korean women who gave birth to such mixed-race children were those who were trafficked by Korean brokers to work as prostitutes for the U.S. military. Many fathers simply went back to the U.S. and never returned. Mothers relinquished their children, as many of them had no financial means to raise them, while suffering from severe social stigmatization for being sex workers. Most of the children were adopted into American families. For those who remained in Korea, like Jang, life was filled with a sense of alienation, racist attacks and longing for their birth parents. Jang’s DNA test kit was donated by Thomas Park Clement, a mixed-race adoptee, and brought to Korea by 325Kamra, a non-profit group comprised mainly of mixed-race Korean adoptees in the U.S. Many of the group‘s members were born in Korea to American soldier fathers and Korean mothers throughout the 1950s and 60s.The free DNA testing was launched to help all Korean adoptees learn more about their Korean heritage. They also help those with positive DNA matches to potentially reunite. Katherine Kim Bradtke, one of the representatives of 325Kamra, said as a mixed-race adoptee she feels deeply for Jang, and hopes that her DNA will be able to give her answers. “She has a heartbreaking story, but it is likely the story that many of us mixed-race adoptees had,” Bradtke said.Young Jang Yeon-hee  and her mother Jang Boon-soon  ‘All I know is either his middle or last name is McDonald’Jang was born in 1964 in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, near Camp Humphreys, a U.S. garrison in the region. Her mother, named Jang Boon-soon , was from a poor family in Geojedo Island, South Gyeongsang Province. She was brought to the base by an elderly woman in her hometown, at age 18. Before leaving Geojedo, Jang’s mother was told by the woman that she would be doing laundry. She was 26 when Jang was born. The father, an American soldier who was stationed in Korea at the time, returned to the U.S. before she was born and never spoke to her mother again. All Jang knows about her father is that either his last or middle name is McDonald or MacDonald. Jang’s mother lived a lonely and impoverished life until her death 18 years ago. She drank heavily throughout her life, was never married and spent her last years in Seonghwan, a small town in South Chungcheong Province where she knew nobody. Jang never met her grandparents.“My mother purposely moved to a town where nobody would recognize her,” Jang said. “She suffered too much in Pyeongtaek. Her life was just filled with sadness.”Jang had to financially support her family by working at different factories right after graduating from elementary school. She also worked as a housemaid for several households. Jang was told by her mother’s friends that her father was aware of her mother’s pregnancy, but returned to the U.S. nonetheless. Her mother rarely spoke of him, even when Jang asked her questions. “I think it was just too painful for her to talk about him,” she said.Both Jang and her half-brother -- he was born from their mother’s relationship with another American soldier -- financially struggled throughout their lives. They were often discriminated for being mixed-race in South Korea. Jang was often bullied in school for her appearance. Her brother dropped out of middle school and worked as a factory laborer. “Even my own husband once told me during a fight, that I come from the lowliest roots,” she said. “I still hear racist slurs like twigi .” Jang became a Christian when she was 25. The reason was simple. “Finally, I had someone to call as my father,” she said. ‘One nation, one people’While interracial marriage was legally banned in parts of the U.S until 1967, the very first children from Korea who were sent overseas for international adoption in 1954 were mixed-race children born to American soldiers and Korean women. According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea’s 2003 report on mixed-race Koreans, South Korea’s ministries of justice, welfare and foreign affairs collaborated with private adoption agencies to send mixed-race children to the U.S. and other countries in the 1950s.“It was one of then-President Syngman Rhee’s ‘one nation, one people ’ policies, which emphasized on ethnic homogeneity,” said pastor Kim Do-hyun, a director of KoRoot. “The Korean government systematically sent out mixed-race children overseas. One cannot say which may have been better for them in the 1950s – living in poverty and discrimination in Korea or being raised by someone else in the U.S. But one thing that is clear is that the Korean government got rid of the children instead of taking it as an opportunity to fight racism.” Katherine Kim Bradtke , at age 2 or 3, at an orphanage in Korea before she was sent to the U.S. for adoption in 1961. Bradtke, who was born in 1957 in Bupyeong district of Incheon, stayed at an orphanage until she was sent to the U.S. for adoption in 1961. She was recently reunited with relatives of her late birth father, an American GI, through DNA testing. “It wasn’t until I read Bertha Holt’s book, ‘Bring my Sons from Afar,’ in which my orphanage was referenced, that I learned that the place was built by World Vision with the intention of housing mixed-race kids who were to be sent to the West for adoption,” she said.According to the NHRCK report, a large number of mixed-race Korean children and adults moved to the U.S. as adoptees and immigrants in the early 1980s, after the U.S. congress in 1982 approved its “Amerasian Immigration Act,” which prioritized U.S. immigration to children born in 1950-1982 and fathered by U.S. soldiers in Asian countries, including South Korea and Vietnam. In order to “encourage” mixed-race Korean men to leave the country, the South Korean government in the 1970s started running job training programs specifically for them. The classes offered tips on how to get employed overseas. In 1972, the government even introduced a special law that exempted them from serving mandatory military service -- which is required for all able-bodied male South Korean nationals – so that they would leave the country at an earlier age, according to experts. The law was in fact in effect until 2010. In 1982, 95 percent of surveyed mixed-race Koreans in Korea said they wished to move to the U.S., according to the report. Some children even volunteered to be adopted by U.S. parents even if it meant being separated from their birth mothers. The main reason was social alienation and racism.Life as a half-black Korean Like Jang, Kang Hwa-sim has never known her father. Born in 1951 to a Korean mother and African-American soldier father in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, she was constantly bullied and physically attacked for her appearance for the first 19 years of her life in Korea.Her mother was attending a nursing school in Hamgyeong Province in today’s North Korea before she was brought to the region by South Korean soldiers a year before the Korean War.She started living with Kang’s father, after suffering a scam marriage to a Korean who turned out to be a married man with children.    Not long after, however, Kang’s father drove a truck carrying explosives to the demilitarized zone and never came back. Her mother was pregnant with Kang at the time.Young Kang Hwa-sim  and her Korean mother  in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, in 1954. Her father, an African-American soldier who served during the Korean War, went missing while her mother was pregnant with her. To this day, Kang doesn’t know if her father died that day or simply decided to leave her mother for good. All she knows is his last name is Echo. After her father went missing, Kang’s mother had a number of live-in relationships with American soldiers, who supported her financially. Her mother soon started working as a dancer for the U.S. military, moving from one base to another. Kang lived in almost every Korean city that had active U.S. military bases, including Dongducheon, Osan, Paju, Pyeongtaek and Uijeongbu. During these years, Kang witnessed many teenage girls being trafficked or forced to work as prostitutes by Korean pimps and brokers. “Those brokers should still be tracked down now and jailed. … It’s not too late,” she said.Her mother had two more children with two other American soldiers. She died in 1970 at the age of 37, after suffering from another marriage scam.That year, Kang decided to leave Korea for good. She married an African-American GI and moved to the U.S. with him. “I’d had enough. I was so done with that country,” said Kang, who now lives with her husband in Killeen, Texas. Like Jang, Kang also left her middle school after suffering constant abuse. “There wasn’t a single day when I was not attacked either verbally or physically,” she said. “Kids would spit on my face. They’d hit me for no reason and call me a nigger. Even my mother was told by her acquaintance that she should just throw me into the river when I was born, because I was half black. I heard there were many half-black babies that were just relinquished in the mountain or the river shortly after they were born.”Katherine Kim Bradtke said both Jang and Kang’s stories echo other painful stories of mixed-race Korean adoptees. Among many cases, Bradtke knows adoptees whose Korean mothers gave up their children so they could marry Korean men. She said these mixed-race individuals involved in rampant cases of unruly relationships, failed marriages, abandonments and adoptions -- they could all be someone’s half-sibling.“This is entirely plausible. … If my mother or someone else’s mother remained in Korea and remained in the ‘industry,’ it is very likely that they may have had more children. So who is to say that Jang isn’t an adoptee’s half-sister?” she said.Bradtke is also still searching for her Korean mother. All she knows is that her name is Kim Chang-soo, although it may not be her real name as many adoption documents have been fabricated by agencies here since the 1950s. ‘A life-long wish’Jang is also looking for her younger half brother’s biological father, another U.S. soldier who returned to the U.S. while her mother was pregnant with his son in 1974. Her half-brother, whose blood type is RH B+, was born the following year.A photograph of Jerry Thomas Collins, who is said to be the biological father of Jang Yeon-hee’s younger half-brother. Jang believes he left Korea in 1974, after living with her and her mother for about 2 years. His son was born about a year after he returned to the U.S. Jang has more information and memories about her brother’s American parent than about her own father. She said his name is Jerry Thomas Collins, and he served three years at Camp Humphreys in the early 1970s. During his stay here, he had a live-in relationship with Jang’s mother for about 2 years, she said.“I remember he enjoyed painting,” Jang said, recalling her days living with Collins and her mother. “He had an oil painting easel at home. On his last day with us, my mother and I said ‘bye’ to him at Pyeongtaek Bus Terminal.”Jang said her mother had sent him a photograph of her half-brother taken on his 100th day birthday. He also wired funds from the U.S. for about a year, and eventually sent an invitation for Jang and her mother to live with him in the U.S. For whatever reason, her mother decided not to go. They lost touch since then. “It’s been our life-long wish to meet our fathers,” Jang said. “It’s a universal desire to know one’s roots. I hope my father understands that.”Jang still has an address which is assumed to be Collin’s parents’ in the ’70s. It is: 1539 W 228th street. Torrance, CA. 90501.

Security Council in a March sanctions resolution, political sources said Wednesday.The measure marked Hanoi's first implementation of the council's new sanctions in response to the North's fourth nuclear test in January and its subsequent rocket launch using ballistic missile technology.Choi Song-il, vice chief of the Hanoi branch of the North's Tanchon Commercial Bank and one of the 16 individuals on the list, returned to North Korea on a flight Saturday, the sources said. He had already been blacklisted by the United States in December last year.Under the resolution, the members of the world body are required to freeze overseas assets of organizations and individuals subject to the new sanctions, deport them and place them under a travel ban.It is believed that the Vietnamese government requested that Choi leave the country in consideration of its ties with the North rather than deport him, and Choi accepted the request, the sources said.Kim Jung-jong, the chief of the Hanoi branch who was also included on the U.N. blacklist, returned home about one month ahead of the adoption of the sanctions resolution, escaping deportation from Vietnam.The branch is suspected of having been involved in laundering and transmitting money earned from the North's deals of arms sold overseas, since it was relocated from Myanmar in July 2012. The U.S. believes that the bank was connected to Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. , which was also blacklisted by the U.N. sanctions committee for their suspected involvement in nuclear and missile development.The office of the bank's Hanoi branch is believed to be located in the North Korean Embassy in Hanoi.South Korea has been working on ways to place the replacement of the branch under the sanctions since he came to the post in January.","deported north korean diplomat ,fourth nuclear test in ,diplomat all but deported ,virtually deported north korean ,vietnam has virtually deported","['Vietnam', 'north korean', 'the U.N.

169,169,169,[FEATURE INTERVIEW] Foreign languages taught in N.K. to instill loyalty,"When John Kim, not his real name, defected from North Korea in 2007 and settled in the South, he had a tough time communicating in Korean. English words were used so pervasively that he could not do simple things like order food or read signs. “My friend told me to meet at ‘cafe Paris Baguette,’ but I had no clue what that meant.

English words were used so pervasively that he could not do simple things like order food or read signs. “My friend told me to meet at ‘cafe Paris Baguette,’ but I had no clue what that meant. When I read menus, I didn’t know the meaning of ‘don-kkas’  or ‘chicken,’” he told The Korea Herald last week. “English is part of life here and a necessary skill. It was not so in North Korea.”In the reclusive communist country, English is taught “for the sake of teaching” and people learn English “for the sake of learning,” according to Kim. English education starts in the last year of elementary school in grade five, and continues through the second year of university or professional vocational school. At the end of the fourth semester in university, students are tested on their ability to converse and translate.    Graduates from the college of education teach English with a “hard, uniform British accent,” making conversations with Americans difficult.“We are taught that learning a foreign language contributes to building a socialist and communist fatherland and nurturing masses loyal to the party and our supreme leader,” Kim said. “North Koreans learn English not as the language of our proclaimed enemy America, but as an international lingua franca. By the same token, despite our extreme enmity toward Japan, we studied Japanese as an official foreign language to translate advanced science and technology manuals, and also to help our ethnic compatriots in Japan, the ‘Zainichi.’” Kim is among 20 defectors from North Korea who will be enrolling in an English program launched by Serving Life International, a nonprofit humanitarian organization dedicated to the two Koreas’ unification and global peace. Since it was established in 2006, SLI has helped with defectors’ settlement here by providing humanitarian services and goods. The program, offered free of charge, consists of “Enjoy English,” a twelve-week course taught by native teachers starting in April and August, and “E++ English Unification Camp,” a three-day outing for students and teachers in mid-June. It is sponsored by the Korea Hana Foundation, which supports the settlement of North Korean refugees. In light of the marketization of North Korea, people’s “hearts and minds” have drifted away from the regime, Kim stressed. “Younger generations have grown up witnessing their parents muddling through the market, with no visible benefits from the state,” he noted. “They snort at the party and the supreme leader. No matter how closed off and reclusive the country is, change is inevitable.” Kim said a deluge of South Korean and American TV series and movies have seeped into the tightly controlled society. People watch heaps of DVDs through the night, stirring their monotony with images of a wealthy consumerist neighbor. “By watching South Korean dramas and movies, we realized that English was an essential part of life down south,” he highlighted. “We felt English proficiency would be necessary to develop our country and incorporate foreign cultures and technologies.” A “certain degree” of freedom exists in the North, Kim pointed out, adding that “fundamental freedom” is restricted in a system of entrenched surveillance. “We watch movies together, go out on picnics and drink, but you cannot share your innermost feelings, even with your parents or closest friends.”He added, “Everybody knows the situation outside, even those guarding the demilitarized zone. But you cannot protest, as three generations of your family will be purged and erased clean from records.” CEO of the Mordecai Investment Corporation Kang Hun-sok, former Vice Minister of Unification Um Jong-sik, English program teachers Stephanie Sodeke, Priscilla Sodeke and Chan Lee, Serving Life International chairman Simon Suh and Hallym University professor emeritus Kim Sung-jin at an inaugural ceremony for an English program launched by Serving Life International on Sunday.  With the United Nations sanctions coming into force, life will likely be more difficult, Kim projected, hoping that “people will still survive using skills acquired through the market.”“The hardest thing since coming here was loneliness,” the project manager at SLI said. “Language was difficult, but it could be overcome. What really hurt were the cold stares of friends and colleagues after the sinking of corvette Cheonan and bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010.“Children of defectors have a tough time in school because they are often ostracized by peers. They lose confidence and have to go to alternative schools.” According to a survey of 2,400 defectors by the Ministry of Unification and the Korea Hana Foundation, 60 percent of them identified themselves as part of the lower socioeconomic class and 35 percent as middle class, compared to 44 percent of South Korea-born citizens who answered they belonged to the lower class and 53 percent to the middle class. In contrast, 60 percent of the defector group believed that their children will fare better in the future, compared to 30 percent of South Koreans. Um Jong-sik, chairman of the Institute for Korean Integration of Society and former vice minister of unification, said at the program’s opening ceremony Sunday that the key to successful integration of defectors was employment and education. “It’s not unusual that people from North Korea fall behind their compatriots who grew up here,” Kim claimed, pointing out they are often better educated and have wider networks and deeper pockets. Highlighting over 30,000 defectors here, he said: “If people were a little more compassionate, understanding and supportive, it would help a lot. Treating everyone equally based on ability and merit, South Korea is a good society.” Stephanie Sodeke, 32, education manager at SLI and teacher for the program, pointed out that defectors tend to have less confidence than other South Koreans and give up often. “I want them to be able to introduce themselves in English by the end of the first course and gain confidence,” she said. “I hope that they can go to other countries and let people know about other aspects of North Korea -- that there is more to their lives than just a crazy dictator or nuclear bombs.”By Joel Lee","kkas pork cutlet from ,defected from north korea ,communicating in korean english ,interview foreign languages taught ,don kkas pork cutlet","['John Kim', 'North Korea', 'Korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68250179  0.63147759

The North has yet to formally confirm a date for the event.According to the source, some 200 North Koreans are employed at the Chinese fishery company. ""So far, each North Korean laborer used to be paid $500 per month, whereas much of the payment went directly to the North Korean regime while an average of $150 was paid to each worker later,"" the source told the online news media based in Seoul. But recently, such meager pay has triggered complaints with the source saying he heard some female workers expressing their desire to return home rather than stay in China under poor working conditions. The Chinese firm, which signed an export contract with Japan recently, has extended daily working hours to 13 hours so as to meet the requirements of its Japanese contractor.But the overtime work payment did not go to North Korean workers, with a portion of the payment for extra work actually going to a North Korean manager in the company who is responsible for North Korean workers there.""Complaints are heard here and there as the North Koreans have to work from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. without break,"" the source said.""They are not allowed any off-day or nights out."" The North Korean workers are staying in a poor dormitory under tight control, according to the source, told Daily NK.","advance wages for koreans ,monday north korean source ,wages for koreans north ,korea asks chinese firm ,chinese firm to pay","['North Korea', 'chinese', 'north korean', ""Workers ' Party"", 'north korean', 'China', 'Daily NK', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Dandong']",5,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.49659225  0.49837023

""We demand an immediate withdrawal of the .""Cho urged Japan to stop its ""futile claims"" and work to open a ""new future"" for bilateral relations by squarely facing up to history.Last month, Tokyo also approved a set of updated high school textbooks that repeated Japan's territorial claims to Dokdo. The authorization represented a bolstering of the claims because 27 of the newly approved 35 social studies textbooks -- or nearly 80 percent -- accused South Korea of ""illegally occupying"" the islets.South Korea rejects the claims as nonsense because the country regained independence from Japan's 35-year colonial rule in 1945 and reclaimed sovereignty over its territory, including Dokdo and many other islands around the Korean Peninsula.The ministry is expected to lodge a protest with the Tokyo government by calling in a Japanese Embassy official later in the day.Dokdo, a pair of outcroppings lying in the East Sea, has long been a thorn in bilateral relations. Seoul effectively controls the islets with a police detachment stationed there since 1954.The report still referred to South Korea as Japan's ""most important neighbor that shares strategic interests,"" saying Tokyo will improve bilateral relations following last year's agreement to resolve the issue of Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.The accord will be the key to opening a ""new era"" in the two countries' ties, it added.Last year's report referred to the South simply as the ""most important neighbor,"" which marked a toning down from the 2014 report that said the two countries share basic values and interests, such as free democracy and basic human rights.","korea denounced japan friday ,denounced japan friday after ,denounced japan friday ,south korea denounced japan ,korea slams japan","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Cabinet', 'japanese', 'japanese']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.5306325   0.4070566

The colonel-level intelligence officer came to Seoul last year and gave a “detailed testimony” on the Reconnaissance General Bureau’s espionage operations against the South, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unnamed source with knowledge on the inner workings of the communist state. Additionally, a diplomat in his 50s who oversaw economic affairs at the North Korean embassy in an African nation arrived here last May along with his wife and two sons due to “life-threatening” concerns, according to the Donga Ilbo daily. Another North Korean diplomat in an Asian country sought asylum in February as Pyongyang was moving to cut and call in the staff at overseas diplomatic missions. “There is truth to the reports, but I can’t speak about their identities or other details at the moment,” Unification Ministry spokesperson Jeong Joon-hee said at a news briefing. Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun also said: “I can confirm the facts. ... But as the issue is being dealt with by the National Intelligence Service and the Unification Ministry, my comments on the detailed background will be limited.” The revelation came three days after the Unification Ministry unveiled that a group comprising a male manager and 12 female servers of a North Korean restaurant landed in Seoul on Thursday. Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, which initially refused to comment, confirmed Monday that 13 North Koreans who formerly resided in China flew last Wednesday “with valid passports,” saying their departure was “legitimate.” The latest revelations gained traction due to their relatively high social status, minimum middle-class background and overseas experience that had likely allowed them easier access to South Korean culture and outside information. In particular, the intelligence agent appears to be of the highest rank among known military defectors, equivalent to a two-star general in the South Korean military.Launched in early 2009 by incorporating three military and party reconnaissance offices, the RGB is a key military organ trusted by leader Kim Jong-un and presumed to have orchestrated a series of GPS jamming and other attacks against the South. It had long been led by Kim Yong-chol, a hard-line military commander who is believed to be the mastermind behind Pyongyang’s deadly sinking of a South Korean corvette in 2010 and now serves as director of the United Front Department and a secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party in charge of cross-border affairs. But controversy persists over Seoul’s rare verification of the exiles, coupled with last Friday’s announcement, which deviated from its longstanding principles that any defectors be brought in through a low-profile operation and that it neither confirms nor denies their arrivals. Though officials repeatedly emphasized the latest cases as extraordinary, some critics pointed to the timing, accusing the Park Geun-hye administration of attempting to sway the April 13 general election by taking credit for the defections as the fruits of its ongoing sanctions push. Seoul launched a campaign last February to dissuade citizens from using any profit-making North Korean facilities abroad while upping unilateral sanctions targeting the regime’s financial and shipping networks in response to its recent nuclear and missile tests. On Sunday, the foreign and unification ministries held a background press briefing separately on the same theme: the effects of the sanctions against the North. The Unification Ministry voluntarily released the testimonies and a blurred photo of the 13 people, skipping an intra-agency questioning and other procedural steps. Moon’s remarks on the RGB official also represented the Defense Ministry’s first-ever confirmation regarding the defector issues. In reality, many North Korean restaurants across the globe have for years been struggling to keep afloat in the face of sour public sentiment toward the regime’s nuclear ambitions, according to diplomatic sources, though signs have been indicated that their hardship has deepened since the international and individual sanctions took effect. Further, the disclosure could pose a threat to other would-be refugees and those already on their journeys, especially given that several other North Koreans had reportedly worked alongside the 13. A top Unification Ministry official indicated during the briefing that some other left-behind colleagues may be seeking to follow suit, or on their way here now. Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jeong Yeon-kuk denied another news report that the presidential office had ordered the ministry’s news conference, calling it “groundless.” The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea criticized the government for breaching the standard procedure and posing risks to the safety of the defectors’ families in the North. “After all, it is difficult to quell speculation that the government arranged an unplanned announcement to consolidate the conservative forces ahead of the election by once again inciting ideological strife,” spokesperson Kim Sung-soo said in a statement.By Shin Hyon-hee","intelligence officer diplomats defect ,korean restaurant in china ,north korea military spy ,to seoul last year ,korea military spy","['North Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'China', 'Seoul', 'the Reconnaissance General Bureau ’s']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55124968  0.30559382

Extreme views, mixed with a large helping of ignorance, flogged in the name of “religion” and “politics” may be the worst combination for bigotry.    Korea’s Christianity Party recently pushed forth inflammatory policies to ostracize homosexual and Muslim population in Korea, disgruntling those in favor of diversity and freedom of expression. In the party’s 10 proposed polices listed in order of priority, the second policy argues the need to annul the current law that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. The party blames homosexuality as the main culprit behind HIV-AIDS and has a poster that reads, “Cure AIDS, Stop gay sex.”  Its fourth policy said building halal food factories will invite terrorists to the country. The party argued that as only Muslims can work in a halal factory, allowing such establishments will result in an influx of people of Islamic origins -- and that this would pose threats to the national security of South Korea.  Meanwhile, another supposedly religion-driven minority party, Christian Liberal Party, on Monday put out a promotional video featuring divorced actress Seo Jung-hee to publicize its policies to bring back adultery law and keep homosexuality and Islamists at bay “to protect the family.” In the video Seo, who had been abused and cheated on by her ex-husband and comedian Seo Se-won, said, “I came to support the Christian Liberal Party as I believed the revival of adultery law is a quintessential issue.” “A number of Koreans are longing for the return of the days when adultery was forbidden by law.

The government hinted earlier that the defectors were fearful that they would be punished if they were unable to send back money to North Korea. Many restaurants have been forced to close due to a drop in patrons, with estimates placing roughly half of them unable to send money back to the North. He said the workers who had access to outside media, including TV shows, as well as Internet connection were aware of conditions in South Korea.""Such information caused them to crave freedom and life in the South,"" the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.The insider then said that the one manager and 12 workers that arrived in Seoul on Thursday were all from upper middle class families, which in itself is meaningful.""The move by such people holding status in the North is bound to have some impact on North Korea ,"" he said.On the current overall circumstances surrounding the Korean Peninsula, the ministry official said Pyongyang is continuing to show its defiance against the latest set of sanctions and could opt to lash out. This, he said, makes the present state very grave.""Depending on how well Seoul handles the present situation, we can open a new chapter of change on the peninsula,"" he claimed.The ministry said that with the U.N. sanctions taking bite, North Korea is finding it harder to carry out financial transactions, while many of its overseas operations have come under restrictions from foreign governments. It said even the shipment of money by couriers is becoming difficult with many foreign companies shying away from conducting transactions with North Korean counterparts for fear they too will be penalized.North Korea is known to operate some 130 restaurants generating some US$10 million in cash inflow for the North Korean regime annually.Related to the defection, Seoul's foreign ministry also clarified to the media the 13 North Koreans made their escape on their own.The ministry sidestepped questions on whether it worked with foreign governments to expedite the defection, but emphasized it was the North Koreans who made the decision to flee.There has been speculation that the North Koreans had passports with them so they were able to legally move across borders.The ministry then said because there is a chance that other mass defections could take place, it is moving to work more closely with other governments to handle all eventualities.","future mass korean defections ,the restaurant workers defection ,mass korean defections ,workers defection the government ,ministry future mass defection","['North Koreans', ""South Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'United Nations']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.29761526  0.46645793

She recently regained consciousness after receiving treatment in an intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan, a city where she resides in China's Hubei Province. But she is having difficulty breathing, as the broken rib has sparked an infection in her lung, government officials said. South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and Consulate General in Wuhan said on Friday that they decided to have her treated at ChungAng University Hospital in Seoul upon request from her family in China.Her transfer to Seoul was scheduled after a team of doctors from the hospital visited her early this month for her diagnosis and judged it would be no problem to move her to South Korea. When Ha is moved to Seoul, she will be accompanied by a four-member medical team from the South Korean medical institution as well as her daughter and granddaughter.Korean Air Lines Co. said it put a bigger plane on the Wuhan-Incheon route and recomposed part of its inner space to make room for Ha's bed.The Chinese authorities also agreed to have an ambulance carrying her to move directly to the apron of Wuhan Tianhe International Airport without passing the check-in counter.After two and a half hours of flight, Ha is scheduled to land at the airport at 4 p.m.  before being transported by the medical team to their hospital.In the hospital, she will be admitted to an intensive care unit and get the necessary medical tests and treatment.The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family will cover all expenses for her treatment in Seoul.""We'll render full support so she can make a fast recovery in her home country,"" Minister Kang Eun-hee said in a statement.At the age of 17, she was forced to serve as a sex slave in Wuhan for Japanese troops during World War II. Even after Japan's defeat in the war, she did not return to her home country, according to her family. She lived in South Korea for a few years after recovering her South Korean citizenship in 1999 but returned to China because she had no living relatives in her home country.She is known to have spoken to her relatives that she misses her homeland so much and wants to die in South Korea where her parents are buried, according to government officials.Historians estimate the historical number of sex slaves at about 200,000, with less than 45 South Korean victims alive today.","injured korean ex sex ,she broke her rib ,former korean sex slave ,sex slave in china ,korean ex sex slave","['korean', 'China', 'Ha Sang - sook', 'China', 'Japan', 'asian', 'south korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46483636 -0.14934495

It did not reveal details including the location of the restaurant or the defection route. The ministry had cited the likelihood of a diplomatic rift, concerns over the defectors' security and other possible consequences.""The country where the defectors worked and the country they departed on the final leg of their trip to reach South Korea are not the same,"" the insider said.Local news reports said Saturday that the 13 had originally worked at a restaurant in Yanji in China's Jilin province near the Sino-North Korean border before being transferred to Ningbo, in northeast Zhejiang province, last December. They reportedly made their escape late Tuesday and arrived in South Korea two days later.On the other hand, another official hinted that the defectors had in fact worked in a Southeast Asian country before fleeing to the South.In a bid to earn foreign currency, North Korea's authorities reportedly operate more than 130 restaurants in a dozen foreign nations including China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand. Roughly100 of these restaurants are located in China alone.The businesses have suffered since the U.N. imposed tougher sanctions on Pyongyang for its nuclear and long-range rocket tests earlier this year. Such restaurants also lost clients because Seoul advised its people traveling abroad not to use such facilities.South Koreans, in the past, made up the majority of people who used such facilities, with some reports claiming the North Korean employees gathered intelligence from such patrons.Diplomatic source said that if the 13 defectors were originally from China, it pointed to Beijing cooperation or at the very least, acquiescence to allow North Koreans to leave the country so they could defect.","restaurant staff who defected ,koreans who recently defected ,at restaurant in china ,korean restaurant staff who ,koreans one male manager","['North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'China', 'North', 'China', 'southeast asian', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Ministry of Unification', 'the North Koreans']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.62939751  0.73949021

Nearly 63 years later, inter-Korean tensions are at their highest point in years as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un issues threats of nuclear strikes against the South and the U.S.The peculiar background means South Korea still has mandatory conscription for all able-bodied men. Nearly all adult men in Korea have hoisted and fired a gun and marched in military uniform with the purpose of protecting their country.It is not just the enlisted men. The Defense Ministry projects the number of enlisted women -- some 9,759 as of early this year -- to surpass 10,000 by the end of the year. From soldiers to officers, men and women in armed service say that it is a job that calls for a firm will and a sense of duty to protect one’s country.“The military is the final line of defense to protect the country, which requires a clear sense of duty and state, along with willingness to sacrifice one’s life. Being a soldier means you put the state over  an individual,” said Yoon Han-doo, a retired Air Force brigadier general. For most of South Korea’s 700,000 troops, the road to military service begins with contact by the Military Manpower Administration, which handles the conscription process. After going through physical and mental check-ups and subsequent training, men are deployed to each unit, with some candidates being designated to special assignments including medical and administrative duties.Army, Navy and Air Force officers are trained at the Korea Military Academy, Republic of Korea Naval Academy and Republic of Korea Air Force Academy. Those set to serve their mandatory services can apply to Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.Being a servicemen has some downsides too, namely the extremely low monthly wages for conscripted soldiers. Pay ranged from 129,400 won  a month for private second class to 171,400 won for sergeants in 2015. The legal minimum monthly wage for a 40 hour-a-week job is 1.26 million won.Even Yoon, who was a medical officer, mentioned poor financial status as one of the worst things about joining the military.“Poor finances, frequent transfers, meals I have away from my family and all those lonely nights were what made me want to quit,” the 59-year-old said.Adapting to civilian life is another issue for former soldiers. A former military officer said that there was a fundamental difference between how the military and how society works.“In the military, everything is excused for the ultimate purpose of preparing for war. But society requires immediate and cost-effective results,” he said. The lack of tangible productivity has caused some people to question the purpose of the military and the transparency of its operation, particularly with national defense being one of the most costly government operations. The defense budget for this year is 38.8 trillion won, up 1.3 trillion won from the year before.Conscripted soldiers also often lament the nearly two-year period spent in the military during the prime of their lives. “When I was back from my two years military service, girls who started college with me were already nearing graduation. I had to start work that much later,” said a 32-year-old office worker Song Min-ho. Retaining South Korea’s armed forces is a pricey operation in various aspects, ranging from money to time dedicated by the youth. But as a result, it yields a single but crucial product: safety.“Citizens and lawmakers ask, ‘What does the military do? They spend all that money with no result to show for it.’ Well, because of the military, people get to sleep safely at night,” said Yoon. “The sense of fulfillment from accomplishing given tasks is what kept me going as a military man.”By Yoon Min-sik","three year korean war ,year korean war ended ,korean war ended ,year korean war ,mandatory conscription for all","['inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.The', 'South Korea', 'Korea']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.20528774  0.42682222

One thing that surprised Tyler Kim when he joined a South Korean company last year after nine years of working in the U.S. was that his coworkers called him “chaekimnim,” a direct translation of his job title, manager.“It was a bit awkward at first,” he said, since it was the first time he was not called by his name at work.Hierarchy has been a key aspect of corporate governance worldwide. But it means more when it comes to the Korean corporate culture notorious for its top-down approach and rigidity. Society that ranks everythingWhen exchanging business cards, Koreans give particular attention to titles, as it reflects the person’s job type, rank, experience and social status. Inside the effective palm-sized card lies Koreans’ deep-seated awareness of acknowledging one another’s social cachet. It is also a surefire way of figuring out what level of person someone is dealing with.Experts say Koreans generally prefer to deal only with someone of equal rank.“Koreans tend to rank people based on occupation, hometown, academic background and more, which became a prevalent rule of hierarchy here,” said professor Kim Seok-ho of sociology from Seoul National University.“Inside a company, rank is the basis of what honorific title one is called by,” he added. In Korea, employees typically address one another by the person’s job title, mostly following his or her last name. It even usually applies to talking with coworkers of the same rank, regardless of whether the communication is in writing or face-to-face.To break the long-standing shackles of such rigid corporate hierarchy, chaebol groups here have recently decided to eschew the use of job titles.In March, Samsung group’s pharmaceutical arm Samsung BioLogics began to add “pro” or “nim” as the suffix to every employee’s name to replace existing job titles like daeri , gwajang , chajang  and bujang .In the same vein, Samsung Electronics is set to reshuffle job positions by streamlining five job titles into four for higher work efficiency.A thirtysomething employee who works at a Samsung affiliate said she was “confused at first.”“But since we keep the same job titles  for those above team leader, dropping the use of job titles is only applied to those who sit in the lower half,” she said.Time served vs. work performanceTitles convey one’s position in their professional career and many Koreans regard it as another name tag. But there is a powerful signaling value in job titles, as it is also closely connected to salary. Korean companies began switching from a step-based salary system to annual salary system in the late 1990s, but the transition has yet to be fully implemented.While in theory every employee’s salary fluctuates based on performance, pay is generally categorized by the years an employee has worked for the company, except in certain cases in which one has moved up the ladder or is recruited from outside.The salary compartmentalization by job title is stricter among officials working for public entities. According to relevant regulations overseen by the Personnel Management Ministry, public officials’ salaries are fixed based on the salary table that is decided upon the approval of the minister at the Ministry of the Interior.For Cho, an employee who worked four years on a public company’s human resources team, eradicating titles and streamlining positions is nonsense.“My company is actually adding more job titles now,” he said.There are currently a total of 11 job titles in his company.“ is because of the single salary table we use here. Public officials  are gridlocked with frozen pay, without any salary negotiation or incentive. All we can get  is a promotion or so-called ‘job title inflation,’” he said. Most Korean companies are still run top-down, because promotions are based on the amount of time served rather than performance. Hence, job titles can even show approximately how long a person has been at a workplace.But it can be quite the opposite in other countries.Jillian Smith, 31, who joined a local marketing company in San Francisco in 2009, is currently a supervisor at her workplace. She is the second most senior person in her team.She was promoted last year, six years after she joined the company as an intern.“To be honest, I wanted to fully understand the work I’m responsible for at my workplace. I can ask to be given a role that can expand my profession in my career,” she said.According to Jill, promotions in her company are only received among those who apply.Her boss, Sarah, a senior manager on her team, was promoted a year earlier than her, though they both started at the company in the same year. But Jill said it was not something she took offense to.“If you worked hard and people recognize it, then you deserve a chance to get promoted, no matter how long you have served,” she said. In Japan, where occupation and job titles are also regarded as important to social status, only those who make it through the manager’s exam will get promoted. “Many managers in the old Japanese company system do not work with responsibilities, since they just pass the exam to get promoted,” said an anonymous blogger on an online community in Japan.“Or if not, they may end up as ‘jichou’ ,” he added. Top-down system in Korean companiesThere have already been unsuccessful cases of dropping the use of job titles in the past. In 2012, local conglomerate Hanwha launched a campaign to standardize job titles from new graduate employees to senior managers. But within a three-year-period, the group decided to revive the use of job titles, citing confusion among employees and lack of motivation for promotion as the reason.“Projects and tasks are always, and still will be, led by experienced veteran employees, normally who are a lot older than me. Getting rid of superficial titles cannot really bring a big change to current work systems,” said a woman who works at the manufacturing firm’s HR team.Experts agree that dropping the use of job titles is not always the right solution for companies.“Strict rules and rigid work process may fuel some companies, while companies in such industries as art or entertainment will need creative opinions and freer ways of communication, without use of job titles,” said Gwak Geum-ju, a professor of psychology at Seoul National University.“Some -- not all -- companies may run with high efficiency when they bridge the psychological gap between workers,” she added.CJ group, a local food and entertainment empire, was the first South Korean company to start eradicating the use of job titles in 2000, using “nim” instead of specific job titles. Calls grow for flatter organizationNow, slowly but steadily, more Koreans are eying the importance of a flatter company culture, as the need for an innovative and motivating work environment surges to replace the conventional scheme in a time of economic slump.Lee Hye-min, who spent nearly five years working at STX, a local trading service firm, said she has learned that abolishing the use of job titles can definitely reshape company culture. Earlier this year, she quit and launched her own start-up company.“While working at STX, I was more likely to shut my mouth and hide my opinion in front of those with higher titles,” said Lee.“But as you know, start-ups are not run like big companies. We cannot communicate when stuck in a hierarchical system. That’s why I made my coworkers call me by my name instead of ‘daepyonim,’ or CEO.”Experts also say fundamental change is sorely needed in Korea’s corporate culture.“More conglomerates will focus on communication as a key factor in company culture like it is in the West. But adopting a more feasible work system so that individual workers can concentrate is more practical for Koreans for now,” said Choi Seung-jun of Hyundai Research Institute.By Kim Da-sol Interviewees that appear in the article declined to be named or did not wish to use their real names. --Ed.","korean company last year ,south korean company last ,korean company last ,korean companies seek to ,joined south korean company","['Seoul', 'Kim', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'hierarchy']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73405463  0.14901154

""Thus, internal division stemming from their protest seems to be inevitable.""Their protest has grown stronger as the Tokyo government appears reluctant to fully atone for its wartime misdeeds.Early this year, Tokyo once again refused to admit the forcible nature of Japan's sexual enslavement of Asian women in a report to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination -- a move that triggered an angry response from Seoul. In the formal document to the committee, Tokyo reportedly said it had conducted a ""full-scale fact-finding study on the comfort women issue since the early 1990s"" but found no evidence of any coercion.Analysts said that Japan's stance would likely continue given Japan's rightward political shift that has spurred the island country's ""historical revisionism"" -- a series of moves to justify or gloss over its wartime atrocities.""The possibility of Japan continuing to deny or avoid mentioning the forcible nature of the mobilization of Asian women for slavery at front-line brothels remains high given that nationalistic political leaders are moving the political swing to the right,"" said Lee Ki-wan, an expert on Japan at Changwon National University.What has further dimmed the prospect of full compliance and enforcement of the December deal is a legal battle that the victims and their supporters have been staging. Late last month, a progressive group of lawmakers filed a petition with the Constitutional Court, arguing that last year's deal on sex slavery violated the basic rights of the victims, including the rights to the state protection of their properties and dignities. It particularly highlighted that in the process of reaching the diplomatic agreement, victims were not fully informed of the details.The petition was made on behalf of 29 surviving Korean victims and the families of the eight deceased victims. Currently, a total of 44 Korean victims remain alive.Seoul said that it has made constant efforts to ""listen to"" the victims and will continue to do so in the future.South Korean and Japanese officials, moreover, said they are in the process of preventing further worsening of public opinion in regards to the deal.Most recently, during a bilateral summit between President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit on Thursday, the leaders reaffirmed their efforts to faithfully enforce the December deal.In a U.S. Human Rights Council session in Geneva last month, Seoul's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se also refrained from mentioning the issue of Japan's wartime sexual enslavement, whereas he had repeatedly mentioned the human rights dimension of the issue at previous international forums.  Kim Soung-chul, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute, a local policy think tank, predicted that when full-fledged efforts get under way to erect the foundation that will enforce the bilateral deal, victims and their supporters could re-evaluate the deal and move toward genuinely settling the issue.""It is still premature to evaluate the enforcement of the deal,"" he said. But after the foundation is established with the two sides setting in motion their full-fledged efforts to restore the dignity of the victims, things may be much better.""Observers say that efforts to establish the foundation may begin in earnest after parliamentary elections, slated for next Wednesday.","enslavement of korean women ,japan wartime sexual slavery ,sexual enslavement of korean ,wartime sexual slavery deal ,korean women an unrelenting","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the Japanese Embassy', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.41542226  0.00911202

Also, when displayed in stores, the products must show the front panel with warning graphics to the potential customers. “Asking us to fix stickers to the upper part of the packs is unreasonable, and the government is interfering with our rights to product design,” said a group of South Korean tobacco-makers in a statement.“Now almost all cigarette products will look identical to each other thanks to the new policy.” YonhapThe Korea Tobacco Retailer Association also expressed their opposition to the new antismoking measures.“We don’t think the government should interfere with the way we display products in our own stores,” the organization said in a statement. The warning illustrations show tobacco’s harmful effects as well as health conditions that may be triggered by heavy smoking, including heart disease, lung cancer and possible birth defects. In spite of the opposition, the Health Ministry said it had no plans to revise the proposal. Some 80 countries overseas require cigarette products to have warning illustrations, and of them, 63.8 percent make it mandatory for the warnings to appear in the upper portion of the packs, the ministry explained. In South Korea, home to almost 10 million smokers, an estimated 57,000 die every year due to smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer.In 2014, the parliament approved an 80 percent increase in the price of cigarettes, from 2,500 won  per pack to 4,500 won, in an effort to curb smoking.

Security Council sanctions on the North for its fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch, as well as the ongoing joint military drills between Seoul and Washington.But in its Friday report, the North's Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim has made field guidance tours of a machinery factory located in the eastern part of the country.Local experts speculated Kim's absence from the military exercises is an indication that he will wait and see the results of the ongoing two-day Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, which is to discuss how to tackle the threats of nuclear terrorism and how to strengthen an international regime for nuclear security.His visit to the Sinhung Machine Plant in Hamhung, South Hamgyong Province, took place four days after his visit to a commercial district and health complex in Pyongyang. In his tour to the machine plant, Kim, however, stressed the need for the plant to conduct more efficient education so that its workers can carry out the Workers' Party plan for economic growth.According to the KCNA report, Kim expressed pleasure over the fact that its officials and workers have made big strides in a drive to produce new kinds of high-performance machines.""The plant should keep the production going at a high rate to satisfy the needs of various economic sectors for machines, fulfilling the assigned plan without fail and breaking the world level in the quality of products,"" he stressed.""The plant has a very important role to play in building an economic power,"" he said, ""setting forth the tasks for updating it to meet the needs of the age of a knowledge-based economy and a highly civilized socialist nation so that it can lead the country's machine building industry.""","inspecting troops north korean ,absent from inspecting troops ,some 10 field inspections ,the country moribund economy ,troops north korean leader","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56827539  0.15669501

""They are living like refugee camps.""According to Yoon, on average a North Korean gets paid less than $100 a month, although the worker is nominally paid $500.Roughly 70 percent of the pay is taken by North Korean authorities with an additional 10 to 20 percent being deducted for lodging and food expenses.According to the civic center, approximately $200 million to $300 million in cash is being sent to North Korea's regime annually.He said that up to 100,000 North Koreans are dispatched to labor-intensive sectors in some 40 foreign countries such as China, Russia, Mongolia and certain Middle Eastern countries. But a government official said the number of the North's overseas workers has sharply increased to around 50,000 to 60,000 in recent years from some 20,000 in 2010.Yoon said some of the North Korean laborers often flee their work sites to get side jobs or defect to other countries like China and South Korea as they cannot endure the harsh oversight of their North Korean controllers.""There are reports of detention facilities operated by the North's state security ministry,"" Yoon said.The human rights center collected information from 20 North Korean defectors who previously worked overseas and also conducted an on-site survey of North Korean laborers in Poland and Mongolia.","korean workers earn 50 ,workers earn 50 100 ,50 000 workers abroad ,heavy labor north korean ,50 000 workers","['north korean', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Russia', 'Seoul', 'north korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52306473  0.36379269

In contrast, only 50 percent of those in their 20s and 59.6 percent of those in their 30s said they would fight against the North.Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs By occupation, workers in agriculture, fishery business and private business owners showed stronger willingness to participate in a war, while it was relatively lower among students and people in white-collar jobs. In 2015, South Korea’s average patriotism index scored 78.1 out of 100, with a higher score indicating stronger nationalistic feeling.The ministry added that the index was similar to that of 2014. “People who are now in their 50s and 60s probably scored higher on the Patriotism Index since some of them may have witnessed the Korean War,” said an official from the ministry.Meanwhile, another survey published Wednesday showed a less hostile attitude among the young toward the North.According to a survey on 1,004 Kookmin University students in Seoul by the Korea Institute of Future, 25 percent -- 251 of the participants -- said they would be willing to work in North Korean companies if there is reunification.About 74 percent answered that they could become friends with North Koreans, while 65 percent said they would be willing to work in a company with North Korean colleagues. When asked about dating or marrying a North Korean partner, almost 40 percent and 28 percent said yes, respectively.“More than half of the respondents in the survey said they view North Korea as a country that needs reunification and cooperation in the future, rather than a hostile target,” said a researcher in a statement.By Kim Da-sol","korea if war breaks ,north korea if war ,war against south koreans ,most willing to fight ,koreans in their 50s","['South Koreans', 'North Korea', 'the Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affairs', 'North Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75291693  0.63776195

The study by Hyundai Research Institute, commissioned by the Justice Ministry, suggested that the government fix its immigration system that is heavily focused on low-skilled workers and more effectively make use of foreign workers on a long-term basis in the wake of aging population and low fertility rate. YonhapAs of end-November 2015, 92.2 percent of the 629,671 foreign workers entered Korea on low-skilled visas, according to government data, while 7.8 percent were hired in professional sectors, such as universities, research institutes, and arts and entertainment.  Thirty-four percent of those on professional visas teach conversational foreign languages, followed by 6.5 percent working in research fields and 5.4 percent teaching university students. Just 1.3 percent work in highly skilled occupations, such as lawyers and accountants. According to a 2015 report by the think tank on 115 professional workers, the majority of them noted discrimination, lack of job opportunities for their partners, the language barrier, office culture differences and poor balance between work and family as major difficulties in living in Korea. They called for more language training, administrative support, help with translation and interpretation to enable them to settle and work here more easily. The report also showed that current policies on unskilled immigrant workers have been ineffective, with manufacturing, construction and hospitality sectors suffering a shortage of workers. The number of additional workers needed in the three sectors combined grew from 120,119 in 2006 to 135,688 in 2014, according to the report. Currently, the foreign workers on unskilled visa schemes come from 15 countries mostly in South and Central Asia on the Employment Permit System or are ethnic Koreans with foreign nationality coming on the H-2 working visit visa. After the government reviews labor shortages in each industry, it sets quotas and invites a certain number of workers to allow them to work here for three years. It can be extended by one year and 10 months with their employers’ agreement. According to a 2014 report by Korea Economic Institute, South Korea will need to receive 1.6 million immigrants by 2020 and 11.8 million by 2050 to offset the fall in the economically active population. “The lack of low-skilled laborers at the country’s small and medium-sized manufacturers is chronically high, but the current Employment Permit System has not been effectively utilized because authorities restrict the yearly inflow of foreign workers and their distribution in each industry,” the report said.“The policy on foreign workers should be more comprehensive so that it can maximize the use of foreign workers and reduce problems such as receiving untrained workers in large numbers and using them for a short term,” it said.

The health complex contains bathrooms, a barber's shop, a beauty salon and other facilities.Kim was accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-ju and sister Kim Yo-jong as well as other key officials including Choe Ryong-hae, a Workers' Party secretary. The KCNA did not mention the date of Kim's inspection tour. Kim's visit is widely seen as an attempt to promote his image as a leader interested in people's livelihoods and also to consolidate internal unity before the forthcoming seventh congress of the ruling Workers' Party scheduled for early May.The backdrop to his latest field inspection is continued bellicose North Korean rhetoric against South Korea and the United States in response to tougher U.N. Security Council sanctions on the North and ongoing joint military drills between Seoul and Washington.The communist country launched short- and mid-range missiles and artillery rockets on four occasions this month while upping its military ante.During his trip to the Mirae Shop, Kim noted that the new shop has turned into a larger and more modern commercial center and model for the country's commercial service field. He then urged salespersons to conduct service activities in a good manner, the KCNA report said.He said the shop should open its doors as soon as possible, and serve not only scientists and technicians but also other people.Kim also praised the complex's flawless architectural style and quality of construction.","wife sister north korea ,sister north korea kim ,accompanied by wife sister ,wife sister north ,by wife sister north","[""North Korea 's"", 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'Kim', 'the Mirae Shop']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86933583  0.27850741

Under the landmark deal, Tokyo expressed its apology and contrition for its colonial-era atrocities, and agreed to provide 1 billion yen  for a foundation to be established by Seoul to support the surviving victims, euphemistically called ""comfort women.""But the deal has yet to be implemented, as some of the victims and their supporters refused to accept it. They have lambasted it as ""diplomatic collusion,"" arguing the deal was pushed forward without sufficient consultation with them. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during the war.

In a press conference held at Gwanghwamun Square in the morning, some 30 civic organizations, including the nation’s first migrant workers’ union, groups of public interest lawyers and labor rights activists, gathered to shed light on the plight of migrant workers here. The groups accused the government of “institutionalizing” discrimination against migrant workers through discriminatory policies. “Migrant workers are on the edge of society suffering from human rights violations though  South Korean government invited them to fill low-pay jobs,” they said in a statement. “The current system of hiring foreign workers is a de facto slavery system, as migrants are forced to endure low pay, heavy workloads and long working hours.”The South Korean government launched an Employment Permit System in 2004 to invite unskilled workers from 15 nations, mostly in Central and Southeast Asia, to fill jobs left vacant by Korean workers. As of December 2015, 1.89 million foreign nationals resided in Korea, 3.7 percent of the entire population of 51 million.Under the scheme, migrants can work for up to three years and extend for one year and 10 months if their employers agree. Migrant advocacy groups hold a press conference at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Monday to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. YonhapBut migrant workers and civic groups have blasted the system for being too employer-friendly, taking issue with how the system does not allow workers to change workplaces and pays them severance money only after they return to their home countries, among other issues. Last year, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea said that it received 37 complaints related to racial discrimination. “Given that foreign workers illegally residing in Korea have difficulties in filing complaints, we expect the number of discriminative cases to be higher,” an official from the agency said. A recent poll of 560 foreign workers from 17 countries in Gyeonggi Province by the Gyeonggi Institute of Research and Policy Development for Migrants’ Human Rights found that migrant workers experienced discrimination most commonly at work , followed by on streets  and at restaurants and stores .The United Nations Special Rapporteur on racism, Mutuma Ruteere, had urged during his visit to South Korea last year to enact a comprehensive antidiscrimination law to curb racism and xenophobia, given the country’s history of ethnic and cultural homogeneity. South Korea has attempted to legislate the antidiscrimination bill aimed at rooting out discrimination on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion for the past decade. But it has since been scrapped at the National Assembly. The migrant workers and their rights groups also expressed worries over the recently passed “antiterrorism” act, claiming that the government’s crackdown on the Muslim community in Korea has intensified since the terrorist attacks in Paris last year. The government released a series of measures to step up monitoring on suspected terrorists traveling in and out of country in recent months, including expansion of the government’s access to the personal information of foreigners. “Existence of migrant workers is not a danger. Prevalent racism poses a bigger threat to society as it hurts diversity and democracy,” the group said. “The government should stop causing conflicts among members of society, but it should rather adopt laws and institutions that can guarantee human rights for migrants.”The U.N. General Assembly set March 21 as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 1966 to remember the massacre of peaceful demonstrators in South Africa in 1960. During the demonstration, police opened fire and killed 69 people protesting against the apartheid pass law.Korea joined the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1978.By Ock Hyun-ju","seoul on monday marking ,racism day south korea ,central seoul on monday ,seoul on monday ,anti racism day south","['South Korea ’s', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3009547   0.40130553

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout and ways to go forward. This is the ninth installment. – Ed.For Milene , a 25-year-old asylum seeker from a small country in West Africa, life has very little to offer. She waits each day for the result of her refugee application and seeks ways, if any, to somehow survive. Back home, Milene had to escape her homeland as her family had beat her and forced her into prostitution. She came to Korea in 2012 to work as a dancer at the African Art Museum in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, but she had to flee again due to the punishing hours in return for a third of the minimum wage. “The situation was unbearable. I worked day and night, but received only 400,000 per month. I injured my legs after falling on a slippery floor, but I had to keep dancing because my boss threatened to send me back to my country,” the French speaker told The Korea Herald. She then worked illegally at a factory in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province, for two years. She simply did not know what to do to avoid going back to her country. It was then that she came to know that she could claim asylum and applied for it in 2013. But for the past three years, she has been rejected twice by the Justice Ministry. Her case is pending in court. Her prospects of winning refugee status seem bleak, her lawyer Go Ji-woon said. “I think Milene should be recognized as a refugee. Her society put her life in danger, but her own government could not protect her,” she said. “But it might not be easy for her to receive refugee status because the Justice Ministry and the court tend to suspect applicants’ motives when they have experience of illegally working and residing here.” Burmese refugee children in Korea. YonhapCurrently, selected asylum seekers are offered monthly living expenses and state-run housing in the first six months upon their application. After this period, all they are granted a work permit that should be renewed every six months. But the long refugee screening process, which takes up to three years, often leaves asylum seekers with no option other than finding illegal employment to pay for rent and feed themselves. Such illegal acts often dent their chances to secure a refugee status, the lawyer Go said. “Though the court rejects their request for asylum, viewing their application as an excuse to extend their stay, they are not able to go back home,” said Go, who is currently representing four asylum seekers. “They are then likely to fall into the vicious cycle of working illegally again.” For Milene, it is a matter of life or death. “It makes me so sad. It is a really big problem and threat for me. I cannot go back to my country. I don’t know what to do. I just want to be free,” she said in tears.Her only wish is to know the decision on her refugee status so that she can seek other options to stay in Korea or elsewhere far from her country. Milene is one of 5,442 asylum seekers who have come to Korea in search of a safer future but is now stuck in the long asylum process. While Europe is struggling with the most severe refugee crisis in decades with millions of people fleeing violence in the Middle East, South Korea also saw a surge in the number of asylum seekers from 1,574 in 2013 to 2,896 in 2014 and 5,711 last year.  Syrian refugees hold a rally in Seoul, calling for support. Activists and lawyers have pointed out that the government’s efforts to distinguish between “genuine” refugees and economic migrants seem to prolong the screening process, which causes further distress to the lives of asylum seekers here. “For asylum seekers, it is very long, precious three to four years in their lives to prepare for their own future,” Kim Seong-in, head of a refugee advocacy group NANCEN said. “Economic migrants also deserve to lead decent lives as human beings. If the Korean government cannot accept them, it should decide quickly and efficiently so that asylum seekers can find other alternatives.”The Justice Ministry said that it had trouble processing the growing number of refugee applications and keeping border controls due to a lack of personnel and budget. It added that it takes a long time to review the applications as the country has seen a rising number of migrant workers disguised as asylum seekers to earn money with a legitimate work permit. Since South Korea started receiving refugee applications in 1994, it has accepted only 576 cases out of a total of 15,250 asylum applications, putting the refugee acceptance rate at 3.7 percent.Kim Jong-chul, a human rights lawyer for APIL, pointed out that a faster screening process could discourage economic migrants from abusing the law to prolong their stay here. “If the process quickens, there are less reasons for them to apply for refugee status in the first place,” Kim said. “As any law has its loopholes, the government should devise a plan to curb such abuse cases rather than making the process and asylum seekers’ lives more difficult.”South Korea joined the U.N. Refugee Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees in 1992 and became the first Asian country to enforce the independent Refugee Act in 2013. The U.N. agencies and international community have touted the refugee law as “advanced.”As South Korea is quite new to accepting refugees, the government and civic groups have wrestled to set their own boundaries in coping with the influx of asylum seekers and refugees, according to Song Young-hoon, a politics professor at Kangwon University.“The government tends to tighten its grip on managing refugees, while refugee rights groups have some distrust in the government,” Song said. “But it is not practically possible for the government to take control of the inflow of refugees. The role of the government and civic groups should be separated.”Song suggested that the government should play its part in processing asylum claims while civic groups take care of them in the local community. That way, the refugee screening process can also become quicker.“The government should lay a groundwork for civic groups to be involved in the early stages and provide them with funds to help refugees settle in the society,” he said. Refugees are often described as a “burden” in Korean society, but studies have found that, in the long run, welcoming refugees has a positive effect on a host country’s economy and society when they are well integrated. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, refugees will add around 0.19 percent of gross domestic product to public expenditure in the European Union in 2016. GDP in the EU as a whole could increase by 0.05 percent, 0.09 percent and 0.13 percent in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.“Rapid labor market integration is key to reducing the net fiscal cost associated with the current inflow of asylum seekers. Indeed, the sooner the refugees gain employment, the more they will help public finances by paying income tax and social security contributions,” the report said. The Korea Economic Institute also suggested in a 2014 report that Korea accept more immigrants to achieve sustained growth amid the rapidly aging population and low fertility rate. Korea’s population is expected to shrink in 2017 and the country will need to take in 605,000 more immigrants by 2020 and 4.27 million more foreign workers by 2030, according to the report. Currently, the number of migrant workers in the nation stands at 1.79 million. Nani Ronel Chakma Nani Ronel Chakma, one of the first Jumma people to be recognized as a refugee in Korea, said that the key to successfully integrating refugees in Korea is to support them at the grassroots level. “When asylum seekers are finally granted refugee status, they have difficulties in settling down without financial support from the government,” said Chakma, who earned refugee status in 2004 and now works as a community coordinator at the Gimpo Foreign Citizen Support Center.“I also had difficulties in enrolling my child at Korean public schools because I was not fluent in Korean and could not get help,” he said of his experience as a refugee supporting his family here. He escaped the Bangladeshi government’s crackdown on his ethnic Jumma tribe. “It would be very helpful for refugees if the government can offer social benefits like low-interest loans, start-up funds for refugees to open their own businesses in the legal framework,” he said. “It is a shame that many refugees are educated, but most of them work at factories. If local community centers can provide them with vocational training and help them to make use of their knowledge, expertise and experience, it could be good for Korean society as well.” Chung Ki-seon, a senior researcher at IOM Migration Research & Training Center, noted that refugees should not be treated as a group in need of help so they can better integrate into society.“As refugees are traumatized by their experience, there need to be welfare services specializing in refugees such as psychological therapy sessions,” Chung said. “But they should not be branded as a collective group in need of help. Policies for them should be devised within the framework of the entire migration population .”Despite being aware of the need for better implementation of policies to help refugees, the Justice Ministry argues that the biggest obstacle is the possible public backlash. “Korean society has low understanding of refugees and policies should keep pace with the public sentiment,” a ministry official said, citing the fierce opposition among Korean residents against the opening of a refugee help center near Incheon International Airport in 2013. Chakma is aware of the public sentiment toward asylum seekers and refugees, based on his own experience. “More interaction between Koreans and immigrants is needed. Civic groups can bolster such a communication,” Chakma said, citing as a good example the “Social integration committee for migrants” launched in Incehon this year. Activists, migrant workers and government officials come together through the committee to discuss ways to improve the livelihood of immigrants. “The situation for asylum seekers and refugees has improved in Korea since the refugee law came into force. It is easier to claim asylum, asylum seekers’ lives became relatively better off and various groups were set up to help those forcibly displaced,” he said. “But there is always room for improvement.”By Ock Hyun-ju","on refugees in korea ,refugees in korea their ,in korea their hardships ,refugees in korea ,trapped in long refugee","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Ed']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.51710784  0.19225469

On Friday, the Japanese Education Ministry approved of a set of textbooks that will be used at high school beginning April 2017.About two-thirds contain statements claiming sovereignty over Dokdo, or accusing Seoul of illegally occupying the islets. Some of the textbooks also use terms like “recruited” when describing how Asian women were forced into sexual slavery by colonial Japan. Relations between Seoul and Tokyo had appeared to be back on track after President Park Geun-hye met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a summit in November.In December, the two sides struck an agreement on resolving the issue of compensation for South Korean sex slaves.

The newspaper is an organ of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.Ma, former director of the design department at the North's powerful National Defense Commission, was among North Korean officials who accompanied the North's leader Kim Jong-un on his inspection of a site for a new street in Pyongyang.It is not immediately known why Ma's rank has been lowered, but speculation is rampant that he may have mishandled an important project.Ma returned to the public eye in October last year after a one-year hiatus amid rumors that the North's leader had purged him for a mishap in the construction of a new airport terminal in Pyongyang.When he spearheaded the construction, he was blamed for the terminal's failure to boost national character. The new terminal opened in July last year.When he reappeared to the public last year, he was demoted to the rank of major general from a lieutenant general following the purported purge.Under Kim's regime, Ma has been leading major construction projects such as the high-profile Masikryong Ski Resort on the North's east coast.","demoted senior north korean ,construction likely demoted senior ,senior north korean official ,been demoted photos carried ,demoted senior north","['north korean', 'the Rodong Sinmun', 'Ma Won - chun']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46659476  0.31632587

The city is some 455 kilometers southwest of Seoul.The ship is one of 31 vessels belonging to North Korea's Wonyang Shipping Corp. that has been blacklisted by U.N. Security Council Resolution 2270.The council adopted the resolution earlier this month, imposing the harshest sanctions yet on North Korea, to punish it for its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch last month.The ship, which departed from the Nampo port near Pyongyang on Tuesday, is known to be bound for the communist country's northeastern port of Chongjin. It is expected to arrive at the port around Sunday at 7 p.m. if it maintains the current speed and heading.Since the ship entered regions regulated by South Korea at around 11:45 a.m., the Coast Guard dispatched two cutters and is closely monitoring the ship's progress in line with the foreign ministry's policy directive.Authorities said some 20 North Korean crew members are presumed to be on the 2,389-ton vessel, shipping some 3,600 tons of anthracite.The ship itself is registered as Mongolian via a practice called flag of convenience that aims to avoid taxes and other regulations.Under the sanctions, several North Korean vessels have reportedly turned back after being denied entry at Russian and Chinese ports, while another ship was impounded in the Philippines.","blacklisted north korean ship ,south korean waters blacklisted ,waters blacklisted north korean ,korean ship sailing near ,korean waters blacklisted north","['north korean', 'south korean', 'Coast Guard', 'Yeosu', 'Seoul', ""North Korea 's"", 'Wonyang Shipping Corp.', 'U.N.

Commission on the Status of Women. “The current administration defines sexual assault and domestic violence as social evils and focuses its policy capacity on eradicating such crimes against women. As a result, rates of unapprehended sexual crimes and recidivism rates in sexual violence have dropped to show visible improvement.” South Korea`s Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee attends a U.N. meeting in New York. YonhapWhile Kang attended the U.N. event as a representative of the South Korean government, the Gender Ministry is currently not officially in charge of policies on children’s rights and preventive policies on violence against minors. While it runs shelters for victims of sexual violence, which also accepts minors, and support programs for school dropouts, the ministry does not offer any programs that are specifically aimed at eradicating physical and emotional abuse of children. It collaborates with the Welfare Ministry for only one program related to children’s welfare -- education of parents on child care. “Minister Kang attended the event as a representative of the South Korean government, not the Gender Ministry,” said an official from the ministry. “She decided to speak about child abuse as it is one of the most important issues nowadays.”While Kang vowed to eradicate violence against children at the U.N. event, a research by Seoul National University, which analyzed this year’s government budget allocated to child abuse prevention programs showed that it in fact was cut by 27 percent from the year before. The report also showed that there are only 56 state-run child abuse prevention centers nationwide, each institution operated by nine social workers. This means one social worker is responsible for dealing with 18,000 Korean children, the research showed. South Korea has seen a number of recent child abuse cases prior to Kang’s U.N. visit, including the latest of Shin Won-young, a 7-year-old child who had allegedly been locked up and beaten for three months by his stepmother before his death in February. The number of child abuse incidents in Korea nearly doubled over the last 10 years. Among the 10,027 confirmed child abusers last year, 8,207 were the victims’ parents.  The number of reported sexual and domestic violence cases have also been steadily rising.While the nation’s recidivism rates in sexual violence dropped, the number of sexual violence cases increased from 17,242 in 2009 to 29,517 in 2014. The number of domestic violence cases also increased from 8,762 in 2012 to 40,922 in 2015.

It also calls for creating a regular dialogue mechanism between the State Department and Korean-American separated families.""Time is running out for these reunifications to happen, and more families will have no knowledge of their loved ones' whereabouts,"" Kirk said in a statement. ""We need to make sure that there is an official channel to assist in the reunification of Korean-Americans, including the 60,000 Korean-Americans in Illinois. This bipartisan bill gives a voice and hope to the thousands of families seeking reunification.""Warner said that the legislation will encourage the State Department to prioritize opening up family reunion opportunities to Korean-Americans by requiring discussions on the matter during bilateral negotiations with South Korea.""These families have waited long enough,"" Warner said.Millions of Koreans remain separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.Since the first summit of their leaders in 2000, the rival Koreas have held 20 rounds of face-to-face family reunion events, including the latest one in late October. But these reunions did not involve Korean-Americans.More than 100,000 Korean-Americans are believed to have loved ones in the North.Last year, the two senators introduced a similar resolution calling for North Korea to permit reunions between Korean-Americans and their relatives in the North.

He speculated that the submarine may have lost power causing it to drift or sink.The South Korean and U.S. military said they have observed efforts underway by the North Koreans to find the missing vessel.""Because these subs are very old, they are susceptible to mechanical breakdowns and due to North Korea's economic situation, it is not likely that they have been well maintained,"" the military official, who declined to be identified, said.The Yugo class boats are the same type as one that was caught in a fishing net in the East Sea in June 1998. These boats, in their infiltration role, can carry six on board, besides the two-person crew.They are 21 meters-long, 2.75 meters wide and propelled by a diesel-electric system. They possess two 533-millimeter torpedo tubes.The North is thought to have some 70 submarines in its inventory with the largest being the Soviet-era Romeo-class boats and the smallest being the Yugos. Besides the Yugo, the country's is known to have some 40 Sang-O class submarines with a displacement of 325 tons. One such vessel was found stranded in September 1996 near Gangneung, 237 kilometers east of Seoul.

""Multicultural children,"" on the other hand, mainly refers to Korean-born children born to a Korean national and his or her foreign-born spouse. “We believe different policies and programs are needed for foreign-born children, as their needs are different from those of children of multicultural families who were born in South Korea,” said Yoon Ji-yeon from the ministry’s multicultural policies division.123RFAccording to the Ministry of Justice, it takes at least two years for children born to non-Korean citizens overseas to obtain South Korean citizenship after arriving in the country. In order to do so, the child needs to be legally adopted by his or her Korean stepparent. As of last year, more than 85 percent of all marriage migrants in Korea were women.“Public education is currently guaranteed for foreign-born children even when they are waiting for their South Korean citizenship,” Yoon said. “But there are certain social services one cannot receive without the citizenship, including all job training programs offered by the Ministry of Labor.”According to a report by the International Organization for Migration report, there were some 12,000 foreign-born children born to non-Koreans overseas who moved to Korea upon one of their divorced parents’ remarriage to a South Korean national, as of 2013. Among them, the largest number are from China, followed by those from Vietnam, Japan and Mongolia. “Forming a relationship with a stepfather who doesn’t speak one’s mother tongue, while trying to adjust to a completely foreign environment can be an overwhelming situation for foreign-born children who moved to Korea,” said the IOM report. “This language barrier creates a number of challenges for the children’s family life, and in some extreme cases, the children decide to return to their home countries.”The proportion of young foreign-born Koreans who are NEETs -- an acronym for young people who are not in education, employment or training -- stood at 32.9 percent, significantly higher than the proportion of young South Korean NEETs in the same age group, which was 10.9 percent as of 2012. The proportion was also higher than children of multicultural families born in South Korea who were both out of school and work, which was 20.3 percent in the same year. The number of multicultural children in South Korea increased dramatically from 2006-2015, from 25,000 to 208,000. The proportion of school dropouts among multicultural children was higher than that of South Korean children.Their reasons for dropping out of school were diverse. While none of multicultural children decided to quit school because of language barriers, more than 15 percent of all foreign-born children who quit their education said it was because of language difficulties  Also, while almost no multicultural children dropped out of school because of cultural differences they had with their peers, 12.1 percent of foreign-born children said cultural conflicts were what made them leave. Also more children born overseas said they left schools due to family problems. “We acknowledge that foreign-born children can be more vulnerable to stress resulting from family life, as many of them experienced their parents’ divorce before moving to another country,” the ministry said in a statement. “We are thinking of many programs that uniquely target foreign-born children according to their needs and wants.”By Claire Lee","young naturalized koreans struggle ,naturalized koreans struggle to ,koreans aged 15 24 ,born south koreans aged ,wednesday foreign born children","['South Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Gender Ministry', 'South Koreans', 'Korea', 'non - korean']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.80734104  0.6725235

The document was presented by China's National Development and Reform Commission at the opening of the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, on Saturday. According to the document reviewed by Yonhap News Agency, there was no mention of North Korea in China's five-year economic projects with foreign countries. With regard to economic projects in China's northeastern provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, the document proposed business projects with Russia, South Korea, Japan, Germany and Israel, but it stopped short of mentioning North Korea. Last week, the United Nations adopted a raft of tougher sanctions against North Korea following the North's fourth nuclear test and rocket launch this year. The new U.N. sanctions came as a result of an agreement between the U.S. and China, North Korea's economic lifeline. The Chinese provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, which border North Korea, have also scaled back their economic cooperation projects with the North, according to their documents published in January.A diplomatic source in Beijing said the moves by the Chinese provinces were likely to be reflected by the Chinese central government's decision to join the new U.N. sanctions.Winning China's cooperation is key to ensuring the effectiveness of U.N. sanctions against North Korea because China accounts for nearly 90 percent of the North's foreign trade.Still, China is unlikely to vigorously implement sanctions on North Korea because a sudden collapse of the regime could spark a refugee crisis at its border and lead to a pro-U.S., democratic Korea on its doorstep, analysts say.","korea omitted from china ,omitted from china five ,omitted from china year ,and china were omitted ,were omitted from china","['North Korea', 'China', 'China', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'National Development and Reform Commission', ""the National People 's""]",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70835948  0.42118225

His company, named “Bio Hazzard,” offers cleaning services after murders, suicides and unattended deaths in private homes.

His company, named “Bio Hazzard,” offers cleaning services after murders, suicides and unattended deaths in private homes. He is also often contacted by South Korean hoarders, who have inability to discard large quantities of objects -- including food garbage and animal feces -- that literally overwhelm the living areas of their properties. The cleanup specialist in his 40s cleans the homes of the loneliest, including hoarders who get discovered weeks or years after their unattended deaths along with piles of collected items they’d been living with. Once, he was asked to clean the house of a man in his 70s, who died alone and was found many weeks later. The man, who had been living by himself for 40 years, was separated from his children and wife after he was jailed for theft.  Cleanup specialist Kim Sae-byul deals with many clients who have difficulty throwing out garbage that literally covers the living areas of their homes. His home was filled with all kinds of brand new goods, including frying pans and piles of new underwear, unused and unwrapped. The house was so packed that Kim couldn’t see the floor or the walls. “Many of them were purchased 20 or 30 years ago,” Kim said. “I heard from his grown up children that he went to jail after stealing for his kids. He never contacted his family.”Hoarding disorder is a mental condition that is slowly receiving public attention in South Korea. A number of extreme cases have been featured in reality TV shows, including a woman in her 90s who lived alone with more than 100 tons of garbage, broken furniture in a mouse-infested house in Gayang-dong, Gyeonggi Province. While the mental condition has a number of different causes, overseas studies and local experts suggest that one of the biggest reasons is loneliness and social isolation.“Social isolation is the biggest cause of almost all mental diseases,” said Kim Suk-joo, a psychiatrist at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul. “When suffering from unfulfilling relationships with close friends and family, some people start to form relationships with objects and animals. You give meanings to them, and every single object becomes simply unreplaceable.”Recent statistics have shown that more Koreans are living alone, spending less time with their families while feeling disconnected to the world. From 2010-2015, the proportion of single-person households increased significantly from 15.8 percent to 27.1 percent. According to the OECD data last year, 28 percent of Koreans said they have no meaningful social support network at all -- not a single person they can speak to or rely on -- in times of crisis. This rate was the highest among member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Suicide has become the fourth most common cause of death here, with up to 40 people taking their own lives every day. Following a recent government study that revealed 90 percent of Korean suicide victims had diagnosable psychiatric illnesses -- while only 15 percent of them sought medical help due to fear of stigma and lack of information -- the Health Ministry on Tuesday announced a set of measures to improve public mental health. The measures include easier access to antidepressants and more prevention programs for alcohol and Internet addiction.“Many Koreans wouldn’t even think of hoarding as a medical condition,” said psychiatrist Kim. “It’s especially easy for hoarders who live alone to keep their condition a secret, as no one is going to find out as long as they don’t invite anyone to their house. And this can make them even more isolated.” In 2014, Seo Yoo-na, a 21-year-old compulsive hoarder, was featured in an EBS reality TV show. Seo, who was suffering from a severe eating disorder, was abandoned by her parents at age 3 after they divorced, and was raised by her grandparents. Growing up, she never had any close friends. In the show, she would constantly purchase and hoard food that she had no plans of eating. “I just wanted to be loved, and that’s why I started losing weight ,” she told her therapist in the show, sobbing. “But even after losing weight, I had no one by my side.”Cleanup specialist Kim, who previously worked as a mortician at a funeral house, witnessed about 1,500 unattended deaths after establishing his cleaning business in 2009. He said of the 1,500 cases, about 80 percent were suicides, and 30 percent of the deceased were hoarders or lived in an extremely unsanitary environment. And of the suicide victims, about 70 percent were young Koreans in their 20s and 30s, Kim said. All of Kim’s clients that The Korea Herald approached declined to be interviewed.Kim’s experiences are reflected in the latest statistics released by the Health Ministry, which showed that the biggest proportion of all Koreans who sought medical help for obsessive compulsive disorder from 2010-2014 were those in their 20s and 30s.  Another hoarder's house filled with garbage. One of the cases Kim encountered was a man in his 30s, who worked as a delivery man at a parcel service company on contract. He had been living alone, had never been married and had been suffering from severe work-related stress. He committed suicide at home a few months after incurring a serious self-inflicted injury when he was drunk that left him disabled and unable to work. His body was found weeks later by his landlord. When Kim stepped in, the house was completely filled with garbage and countless empty soju bottles.“My experiences relate to OECD data ,” Kim said. “While cleaning the house, I met the man’s brother, whom he had not spoken to for years prior to his suicide. He said his late brother had a rather ‘peculiar’ personality and it was impossible to make conversation with him. It was as if he knew all along this was going to happen. I’ve seen a lot of cases where family members were no better than strangers to the suicide victims.”Kim has also witnessed more than 150 extreme hoarding and animal hoarding cases. “I think there are two different types or hoarders,” he said. “One keeps their place sanitary, in spite of the piles of stuff they collected. The other kind lives with rotting food garbage and dirty sanitary pads.”Notably, Kim said 90 percent of the “unsanitary” hoarders he encountered were women. One of them was a young, alcoholic divorcee in her 20s who was living alone with her 2-year-old son. She would leave her child alone in the house, with piles of garbage and a smartphone for him to play with. Her child accidentally called the police while crying alone at home. The court eventually ordered that the child live with his father instead. Kim, who was asked by the police to clean the house, ended up disposing of 50 tons worth of garbage from the property. “It was a gorgeous apartment,” Kim said. “Except all of the TV screens were broken and there were broken pieces of soju glasses everywhere. I thought it was a miracle that the child didn’t get sick or injured after living in that kind of environment for a long time.”Another client, a woman in her 30s, used one of her rooms as a garbage can. The entire room -- from the floor to the ceiling -- was packed with all kinds of garbage, including rotting food. “She had a professional job and had a degree from a prestigious university,” he said. “The rest of the house was very clean and tidy. No one would’ve guessed that secret of hers.”Another woman in her 20s, who lived alone with a cat in Seoul and had a decent-paying job, was forced to get Kim’s help by her landlord who received complaints from her neighbors who couldn’t bear the odor. When he stepped in, Kim could barely open his eyes because he felt a burning sensation from the strong smell of cat urine. He ended up using 10 of the largest-available garbage bags to dispose just cat feces alone. “She said she stopped throwing garbage out after breaking up with her boyfriend. Her parents, who lived in the country, rarely visited her.”Psychiatrist Kim said inability to throw out animal feces and food garbage is more likely a symptom of severe depression or even schizophrenia, rather than hoarding. “Depression kills motivation and interest,” Kim said. “Patients with depression suspend taking care of day-to-day chores, such as cleaning.” An Hui-jean, a professional counselor and psychologist, suggested that South Korea’s high suicide rate today, as well as growing number of reported child abuse cases and mental illness, was a result of accumulated transgenerational trauma stemming from the 1950-53 Korean War. “Most of the time, someone’s trauma and mental illness are linked to his or her dysfunctional relationship with their family, especially their parents,” she said. “And it’s very likely that their parents also had dysfunctional relationship with their parents. After the Korean War, many Koreans shared that collective trauma, but almost no one received any professional and psychiatric treatment. Instead, there was a collective obsession over economic development. Koreans didn’t get to acknowledge that they have been wounded and seek help.”A 2014 study by University of Zurich found that traumatic events can change a person, and often, years later, affect their children. “I think this vicious circle is still carrying on from one generation to the other in Korea,” An said. “And this is making more young people vulnerable to mental conditions, as family no longer serves as a meaningful support network for many Koreans. When your needs were not met as a child, it’s very difficult for you to be considerate of needs of others, including your own children.”One of the most heartbreaking cases Kim encountered was a divorced father in his 50s, who lived alone while battling stage-4 liver cancer. He was discovered days after his unattended death. While cleaning his house, Kim found a very large number of books on Korean herbs believed to be effective in treating cancer. He had kept his illness a secret from his ex-wife and their two young daughters, while feeling desperate to survive as he felt obligated to at least finance their university education.“It seemed like he would work every weekday in spite of his fatal illness, and would visit mountains on weekends in hopes to find the rare herbs that may cure his disease,” Kim said. “And until his unattended death, his children had no idea.” By Claire Lee","koreans become hoarders die ,lonely south koreans become ,south koreans become hoarders ,lonely south koreans ,feature lonely south koreans","['Kim Sae - byul', 'South Korea', 'south korean']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.43442038  0.73689574

Seoul Central District Court handed down the ruling that the government should give 3.3 billion won  to four victims and their families from the manipulated probe that has been dubbed the “Hakrim” case.In 1981, the Chun Doo-hwan military government illegally detained and tortured dozens of people who were members of a pro-democracy movement as part of its move to oppress antigovernment protests. After being forced to make false confessions that they were pro-communist, the protesters were sentenced to at least two years in jail in the following year. The victims were cleared of the charges in a retrial in 2012. Eight victims and their families sought compensation of 23 billion won against the government. “The investigators dragged out false confessions through illicit arrest and torture. It’s an illegal act to put them in jail with a wrongful trial based on fabricated evidence,” the verdict said. “They must have suffered severe mental and physical anguish as their human rights were infringed on by the government which was supposed to protect the people’s fundamental rights.” The court, however, did not accept the compensation requests of four other victims, ruling that they had already received subsidies in 2006 from a public body in charge of recovering the honor of such victims. It also did not acknowledge the need for compensation for those who had become affiliated with the victims after their jail term, such as spouses and children. On the other hand, compensation for parents and siblings was acknowledged. By Lee Hyun-jeong","korea 1980s military dictatorship ,court on monday ruled ,billion won 66 million ,manipulated 1981 investigation seoul ,victims who were tortured","['Seoul', 'Korea', 'Seoul Central District Court']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32069698  0.1149496

On Jan. 23, the North's Korean Central Television showed a filmed broadcast of the Asian Football Confederation's U-23 Championship quarterfinal in which Qatar defeated North Korea 2-1.Such a broadcast underscores Kim's love for football, observers noted. Kim, along with his wife Ri Sol-ju, has been seen watching a football game at least once a year since 2013. Kim was also seen greeting a group of female football players, who won a competition of the 2015 East Asian Football Federation, at a Pyongyang airport last August.Football does not seem to be the only sport the young North Korean leader loves. Kim threw a party for gymnasts and wrestlers who won gold medals in the Asian Games in Incheon and the World Championship in October 2014.Kim also seems to be fond of ice skating as the North has constructed skating rinks in major cities, including the capital of Pyongyang. He has also built the large-scale Masikryong Ski Resort on the country's east coast.Analysts said the North Korean leader seems to be taking advantage of sports to win the hearts of North Koreans suffering from suppression and poverty.""Taking advantage of the dynamic nature of sports, Kim, whose political legitimacy is weak, seems to be seeking to elicit people's loyalty,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University.In November 2012, Pyongyang launched a national sports guidance committee to build sports-related infrastructure and promote sports activities among its people. The committee consists of senior officials from the ruling Workers' Party, government and military, indicating that Kim has prioritized sports. The committee is led by Choe Ryong-hae, a secretary of the ruling party and close confidant of the North Korean leader. Jang Song-thaek, Kim's executed uncle, was the inaugural committee chief. Pyongyang is also seeking to strengthen sports education. In April 2015, it announced a plan to establish colleges specializing in sports in six cities -- Chongjin, North Hamgyong Province; Hyesan, Yanggang Province; Ganggye, Jagang Province; Haeju, South Hwanghae Province; and Wonsan, Gangwon Province.","frequent broadcasts of football ,broadcasts of football matches ,slogans to promote sports ,promote sports the communist ,north korean leader","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.15380351 0.78134435 0.49386892],KH디지털1,North Korea,2,2016,"state television broadcast football game ,football players who won competition ,frequent broadcasts of football matches ,its state television broadcast football ,television broadcast football game in","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang', 'Korean Central Television', ""the Asian Football Confederation 's"", 'Qatar', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Ri Sol - ju', 'Kim', 'East Asian Football Federation', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'Kim', 'Incheon', 'Pyongyang', 'Masikryong Ski Resort', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'Kim', 'Chang Yong - seok', 'the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies', 'Seoul National University', 'Pyongyang', ""Workers ' Party"", 'Kim', 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'north korean', 'Jang Song - thaek', 'Kim', 'Pyongyang', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'Hyesan', 'Yanggang Province', 'Ganggye', 'Jagang Province', 'Haeju', 'South Hwanghae Province', 'Wonsan', 'Gangwon Province']",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.15380351 0.78134435 0.49386892]

Jingwan of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism in an interview with Yonhap News Agency.""Although I didn't have the chance to fully dedicate myself to delivering the teachings of Korean Buddhism, I felt certain that the city could be a milestone of fostering Korean Buddhism in Latin America,"" the revered leader of the Mujinjang Buddhist Culture Research Institute said. ""I thought Cuba was a monolithic Catholic nation, but I was pleasantly surprised to see many temples of diverse religious origins,"" he continued. Cuba tends to put strong emphasis on the patriotic values in a religion, according to Ven. Jingwan, which strongly resonates with the historical roots of Korean Buddhism. Throughout ancient Korean history, Buddhism thrived on the support of royal families, courtiers and commoners, thanks to the religion's creed to protect the nation. In times of foreign invasion and other major national crises, the Buddhist monks stood up for justice.Despite the existing operation of Nichiren Buddhism in Cuba, the actual number of local believers in Buddhism is very few, Ven. Jingwan said.During his week-long stay in Cuba from Jan. 26, the Korean monk met with state administrators and officials of private organizations to share his vision of Korean Buddhism in Cuba. On the streets, he was a walking amusement to children.""The kids would join their palms and bow when they found me out on the streets in my grey robe. I think they've seen enough Chinese kung fu movies."" The monk himself was amused, too, when the children burst into dance to the beat of his block.Ven. Jingwan's Cuban visit was arranged by a civil organization that supports cultural ties between Korea and Cuba.  The organization is pushing to invite Alexander Castro, a photographer and son of Fidel Alejandro Castro, the former First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, to Korea for a visit. In July, the junior Castro is slated to have 25 pieces of his work displayed in an exhibition in Korea. Buddhist circles are pinning hopes on holding the exhibition in one of the galleries run by Jogye Temple in central Seoul. Also on the prospective invitation list is Aleida Guevara, the daughter of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, Argentine Marxist revolutionary and a key figure of the Cuban Revolution. Ven. Jingwan said he would like to invite the younger Guevara to a temple stay at Jingwan Temple in Seoul, operated by Buddhist nuns, to show the rich culture of Korean Buddhism.In the future, Ven. Jingwan will organize a group of Buddhist missionaries to Cuba.""Cuba is a country of islands and archipelagos with easy access to the  sea. The country is warm in winter, and will make an excellent spot to build a temple alongside the beach, to welcome the Buddhist monks to contemplate.""The monk also said the Buddhist circles in Korea, China and Japan could join hands in passing down the teachings of Buddhism of Far East Asia.","dreams of korean buddhism ,buddhism flourishing in cuba ,first south korean monk ,buddhism in the cuban ,of korean buddhism flourishing","['south korean', 'Cuba', 'cuban', 'Havana', 'Cuba', 'buddhist', 'Ven', 'the Jogye order of Korean Buddhism', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Korean']",5,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.09977666 0.53084856 0.08587015],KH디지털2,Social affairs,2,2016,"korean monk to visit cuba ,of korean buddhism in cuba ,buddhist missionaries to cuba cuba ,korean buddhism in cuba ,of buddhist missionaries to cuba","['south korean', 'Cuba', 'cuban', 'Havana', 'Cuba', 'buddhist', 'Ven', 'the Jogye order of Korean Buddhism', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Korean', 'Korean Buddhism', 'the Mujinjang Buddhist Culture Research Institute', 'Cuba', 'catholic', 'Cuba', 'Ven', 'Jingwan', 'korean', 'korean', 'buddhist', 'Nichiren Buddhism', 'Cuba', 'Ven', 'Jingwan', 'Cuba', 'korean', 'Korean Buddhism', 'Cuba', 'chinese', 'Ven', 'Jingwan', 'cuban', 'Korea', 'Cuba', 'Alexander Castro', 'Fidel Alejandro Castro', 'the Communist Party of Cuba', 'Korea', 'Castro', 'Korea', 'buddhist', 'Jogye Temple', 'Seoul', 'Aleida Guevara', 'Argentine', 'Marxist', 'Jingwan', 'Guevara', 'Jingwan Temple', 'Seoul', 'buddhist', 'Korean', 'Ven', 'Jingwan', 'buddhist', 'Cuba', 'buddhist', 'buddhist', 'Korea', 'China', 'Japan']",12,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.09977666 0.53084856 0.08587015]

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the eighth installment. ― Ed.Then 3 years old, Aylan Kurdi became a totem of the refugee crisis in Europe and the Middle East last September, after being found drowned and washed up on a beach while trying to reach Greece through the Turkish resort town of Bodrum, fleeing his conflict-stricken homeland. The portrait of his tiny lifeless body being swooped up by the somber-faced coast guard instantly fueled anger across social media. European and North American leaders scrambled to relay pledges to take more refugees and work for a resolution to end the plight of the Syrian people. Five months later, however, the world is still grappling with the refugee crisis. Before long, many European nations sought to curb the quota and fortify their borders, some involving razor-wire fencing, in the face of an overwhelming influx of asylum seekers and consequent internal and continent-wide strife. A glimmer of hope is growing after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday a provisional cease-fire settlement has been reached and it could take effect in the next few days. The U.S., Russia and other world powers agreed Feb. 12 on a deal calling for the halt of hostilities within a week, the delivery of aid to besieged areas of Syria and a return to peace talks in Geneva.  A Syrian family seeking refuge in South Korea waits for authorities to begin the process at Incheon International Airport on Nov. 18, 2015. According to the National Intelligence Service, of the 200 Syrian asylum seekers who arrived in Korea, 135 have been recognized with “humanitarian status,” while 65 are still waiting inside the airport as of the end of last year. South Korea, for its part, has provided a total of $23.45 million in humanitarian assistance for Syria, in addition to this year’s $12 million commitment unveiled early this year. About 13.5 million people are in urgent need for aid inside the war-ravaged country alone, Seoul’s Foreign Ministry says, more than half of them are children.As of last November, at least 200 Syrian refugees have flown to South Korea. Of them, 135 were granted “humanitarian” status, and the remaining 65 are still at the airport “under strict monitoring” by the National Intelligence Service. Other data provided by civic groups put the number of Syrian refugee applicants at more than 500 last year alone. Many activists criticize what they see as an overly strict screening process, which lands more applicants in the humanitarian position rather than with the full “refugee” status that ensures job, medical, educational, child care and other state support. The “humanitarian stayers,” in contrast, are only allowed to reside and work here, with little social protection, and are required to undergo screening every year to renew their status. Most of them live in a resettlement center in a remote part of Incheon, which makes it even harder for them to find decent employment. The trend inevitably undercuts South Korea’s prestige as a member of the 1951 Refugee Convention and a nation that enacted Asia’s first standalone refugee act in July 2013, critics say.Another emerging factor is rising concerns over a possible terror attack by Islamic fundamentalists such as those linked with the Islamic State group, especially in the wake of recent incidents in Paris, Istanbul, Jakarta and elsewhere. The Park Geun-hye administration is pushing for counterterrorism bills, which include steps to preclude physical and cyberterrorist acts and trail the suspected perpetrators’ money and network. But they have never been put to a floor vote due to resistance from the opposition camp on concerns that they will make way for the NIS to spy on civilians and engage political maneuvering in particular during election seasons.The spy agency also reported 48 foreign nationals have since 2010 been deported for their supposed ties with international terror organizations or posing potential terror threats themselves. Among them, an Indonesian who had worked at a factory complex in Daegu for years joined the IS group after leaving the country, later dying in an operation. Last August, the IS named South Korea a member of the U.S.-led “crusader coalition,” alongside Japan, Taiwan and many other nations. Seoul notched up its four-tier alert level from “concern” to the second-highest of “caution” and tightened security at major facilities in the aftermath of the deadly attacks on Paris two months later. NIS director Lee Byung-ho called during the parliamentary session for “full readiness for the possibilities for an establishment of terrorism infrastructure in the form of a ‘lone wolf.’”“The perceived rigidity surrounding agencies like the Justice Ministry partly probably reflects the current atmosphere,” Park Mi-hyung, head of the International Organization for Migration’s Seoul office, told The Korea Herald. “It’s a tremendous irony to think of and treat the refugees as potential terrorists at a time when they are running away from the real terrorists. The application procedure itself is a huge challenge for them, on top of the arduous journey from their home.” Jang Ji-hyang, director of the Middle East and North Africa Center at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, also says that the asylum seekers would pose little, if any, threats here. “Even though large numbers of Syrian refugees would be settled here, it’s unlikely to lead to an active Muslim community highlighting their identity in a nation with a strong cultural solidarity like Korea,” she says. “It’s more probable that the discontent harbored by Muslim workers or those from underprivileged multicultural families could turn into extreme violence in the face of the tyranny of vicious, high-handed employers.” While scaling up its financial contributions and support for overseas refugee camps, Seoul should let in and embrace more Syrian asylum seekers as one of the world’s most affluent democracies, experts say. The U.N. has requested its members provide an additional $7.75 billion in humanitarian aid this year for Syria and its neighboring countries. In December, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs launched its largest-ever life-saving appeal worth $20.1 billion for 2016, citing conflicts in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen as top drivers of humanitarian needs. Syria’s five-year civil war has so far killed at least 250,000 people. Its population dwindled to 16.6 million last year from 22.85 million in 2013, U.N. figures show. The U.N. Refugee Agency places “total persons of concern” at more than 4.7 million, including some 4 million registered Syrians in Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and some North African countries. They are aside from another 1 million unregistered and 7 million internally displaced people -- meaning more than half of the population has been forced to move. “South Korea should diversify ways to take part in the global drive and share more of the burdens. And in terms of resettlement, it’s vital to support the refugees for their social integration,” Jun Hae-won, a professor in European and African studies at the Korean National Diplomatic Academy, says in her report released at the end of last month. “Bracing for a protraction of the current refugee crisis, the government needs to pursue further cooperation with Europe on the humanitarian diplomacy front and to expand bilateral partnerships, while considering joining the EU-level initiative with a comprehensive, mid- and long-term approach that includes not only refugee aid but also reconstruction efforts.” The view is echoed by Jang from Asan, who also calls for Seoul to take a more “forward-looking” stance and boost humanitarian contributions for its long-term national interests. With the perennial standoff with North Korea, the debacle in the Middle East and Europe could offer lessons should any sudden, popular uprising and eventual civil war take place across the border, however unlikely it may seem for now, she says. “South Korea should practice global norms on the world stage, looking beyond economic interests,” Jang says. “It is a quite costly policy, but to push the North and resolve the peninsular issues, the international community’s cooperation is pivotal. And Seoul would be able to press Beijing only with the support of global opinion and moral authority.” By Shin Hyon-hee","on refugees in korea ,refugees in korea their ,refugees in korea ,in korea their hardships ,reeling from syria refugee","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Ed']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.65061814  0.1824531

Ko defected to South Korea in 1991 after serving as a North Korean diplomat at the North’s embassy in Congo.“I have received threats before, but never has the alert level been this strong,” Ko reportedly told Yonhap.“It seems that this time,  has signaled an actual assault, not just an intimidating threat.”South Korea’s spy agency National Intelligence Service said Thursday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had ordered greater preparations for terrorist attacks on the South.The Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North’s intelligence body, is said to be gearing up for cyberattacks on key South Korean websites, physical assaults against government figures and North Korean defectors and explosive attacks in public facilities.The most plausible scenario is a string of cyberattacks on government, media, and financial companies’ websites, officials said.“Having performed a nuclear and missile test in January-February, North Korea is highly likely to perform cyberattacks in March-April, before its national party convention slated for May,” the ruling Saenuri Party’s Rep. Lee Cheol-woo said Friday in a radio interview.He pointed out that it has been the usual practice for the North over the past years to first initiate a military provocation and then move on to cyberattacks in the following months.As the party’s representative for the parliamentary information committee and a former senior official at the NIS, Lee is recognized as an expert in North Korean affairs and intelligence issues.It is amid such concerns that South Korea’s military recently upgraded its Information Operation Condition, a five-tier warning system against computer network attacks.The level, which had been raised from the lowest level five to four after Pyeongyang’s nuclear test in January, was further raised to level three earlier this month, following the North’s ballistic missile launch. The South Korean Navy’s underwater demolition team carries out an antiterrorist attack drill on a marine ship in the East Sea on Thursday. NavyThe military is also preparing for direct military aggressions.The Navy and Marine forces carried out a joint drill in the East Sea on Thursday, under the assumption that a North Korean warship kidnapped a South Korean civil ship. The Army, too, conducted a joint drill with the U.S. troops on Friday, working on promptly dispatching the U.S. forces to the Korean Peninsula during contingencies, officials said.Meanwhile, the ruling conservative party quoted the growing inter-Korean tensions to push for passing the terrorism prevention bill, which has been pending at the National Assembly for months due to opposition resistance.“The risk of terrorist attacks is very much tangible, which is why it is crucial to pass the terrorism prevention bill urgently,” said the party’s floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul.The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea claims that the disputed bill would bestow the spy agency with excessive investigation authority and thus infringe on the people’s rights to privacy.By Bae Hyun-jung","seoul beefs up antiterror ,ranking north korean defectors ,government friday the police ,beefs up antiterror guard ,antiterror guard south korea","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'Ko Young - hwan', 'north korean', 'Institute for National Security Strategy']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.48296529  0.27581343

Under the program, South Korea can provide a one-on-one mentoring program to North Korean students.The number of North Korean students attending elementary, middle and high schools in South Korea came to 2,475 last year, compared with 1,143 in 2009.The dropout rate for youth defectors declined to 2.2 percent in 2015, compared with 10.8 percent in 2009, according to the data provided by the ministry.The ministry also said it plans to allocate teachers -- who are bilingual in Korean and Chinese -- to a high school tailored for North Korean defectors, citing the growing number of students whose Korean language proficiency is low.The number of student defectors who were born in third countries, including China, more than doubled from 608 in 2011 to 1,249 in 2015, according to data.Currently, South Korea is home to more than 28,000 North Korean defectors, including students.","korean students better adapt ,korea while expanding mentoring ,young north korean defectors ,expanding mentoring program for ,north korean students better","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's""]",5,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.35924041  0.32964543

Saenuri’s Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, member of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee, said that the North may target the country’s power supplies or public areas. He added members of the media who criticize the Kim regime may be victims.Officials said the highlight of the upcoming seventh convention of Pyongyang’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea -- slated for May 7 -- will be the nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch earlier this month. An antiterrorism unit of the UDT/SEAL  of the Navy conducts a drill inside a ship along the east coast on Thursday. Lee also said the North has been claiming the recent shutdown of Gaeseong industrial park -- intended as a punitive action by Seoul against Pyeongyang -- was its intent.Preluding stronger and more proactive measures against North Korea’s provocations, President Park on Tuesday said the government will take “effective measures” to create an environment that forces North Korea to realize that nuclear programs will lead to a “collapse of its regime.” The following day, the U.S. flew four of its F-22 stealth fighter jets over the Korean Peninsula, the latest deployment of its strategic assets here in what was widely viewed as demonstration of power and the Seoul-Washington alliance. Later in the day, Cheong Wa Dae echoed escalating concerns of a possible terrorist attack by the North and called for the prompt passage of a pending antiterrorism bill at the National Assembly.The bill remains deadlocked upon the opposition parties’ claim that it is politically devised to elevate the civilian surveillance capacity of the National Intelligence Service. Meanwhile, North Korea has been uncharacteristically quiet in the wake of combined pressure from the allies, touching off speculation that further provocation from Pyongyang may be imminent.The 38 North website, operated by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, recently warned that North Korea may conduct its next nuclear test with little or no warning. But Koh Yoo-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University, said military altercations or nuclear testing is unlikely in the near future.“North Korea has already carried out a nuclear test and a missile launch, which leads them to believe they hold some kind of strategic advantage ,” he said, adding that the communist country will not feel compelled to react to each blow, such as Park’s strong rhetoric.Furthermore, Koh explained that the North is well aware that it is unwise to provoke the allies when their forces are fully prepared. He said, however, that Pyongyang may strike again if it feels enough pressure from inside and outside the country, such as growing discontent from its citizens and U.N.-led economic sanctions.By Yoon Min-sik","recently ordered terrorist attacks ,un recently ordered terrorist ,warns of korean terror ,ordered terrorist attacks in ,recently ordered terrorist","['the National Intelligence Service', 'the National Assembly', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north korean', 'Saenuri ’s', 'Lee Cheol - woo', 'the National Assembly Intelligence Committee']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52101558  0.26994935

Park said South Korea cannot allow a situation to continue in which its money is used for North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.On Sunday, South Korea's point man on North Korea said that 70 percent of the money that flowed into the factory park was funneled into the ruling Workers' Party to bankroll the country's weapons development.But Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo retracted his claim a day later, citing a lack of ""clear evidence.""The development underscored challenges in separating the legitimate use of money from money diverted to the weapons programs.Park said the closure of the factory park is just the ""beginning"" of sanctions that South Korea and the international community will take against North Korea.The U.N. Security Council has been working on a resolution that will slap sanctions on North Korea over a recent fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.Park vowed to take stronger and more effective measures to make North Korea recognize that its nuclear program ""will only hasten its collapse,"" not ensure its survival.Still, it remains unclear whether U.N. sanctions will make any difference.North Korea has already been under U.N. sanctions for its three previous nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, though sanctions have failed to deter North Korea's nuclear ambitions.The North has repeatedly pledged to boost its nuclear capability, describing its nuclear program as a ""treasured sword"" against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy towards it.","korea nuclear program president ,cash to north korea ,dollars south korea paid ,in north korea nuclear ,nuclear program president park","['Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', ""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Gaeseong', '2004.south Korea']",5,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.47870904  0.35450178

In 2015, nine former sex slaves died.Only 238 women have registered with the South Korean government as former sex slaves, though historians estimate more than 200,000 women, mostly Korean, were forced to work at front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war.South Korea and Japan reached a landmark accord on Dec. 28 to end their dispute with Tokyo's acknowledgment of responsibility, an apology from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japan's offer of 1 billion yen  in reparations to the victims.The issue of the ""comfort women,"" a euphemistic term for the former sex slaves, had been a major thorn in bilateral relations.The deal sparked protests among some victims and their supporters, who argued the government failed to hold Japan legally accountable in the deal and failed to consult with them beforehand.","wartime sex slavery dies ,dies another south korean ,by japan her death ,choi died monday ,japan her death","['south korean', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo', 'Choi', 'the Korean Council', 'the Women draft for Military Sexual Slavery', 'Japan']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3334803   0.4567613

This marks the first case to follow the international convention on the abduction of children. Seoul Family Court ruled in favor of a 39-year-old Korean-Japanese woman who filed a lawsuit against her Korean husband, who had taken their children to Seoul without her approval.   YonhapThe international couple, married in 2005, has been separated since 2013. While they agreed that the wife would keep the parental rights in the divorce agreement, they did not complete the divorce process. In July last year, the 41-year-old husband took the children to Seoul, saying he would like them to see their hospitalized grandfather. He promised to bring them back to Japan the following month.The husband, however, severed contact with his wife and changed the residential address of the kids to Korea.The court said the children must be returned to Japan according to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Enacted in 1980, the Hague convention covers international parental child abduction. Its application can be made when a child is taken or retained across an international border, away from the habitual residence, without the consent of a parent with custody rights. The two countries of the parties must be members of the convention. There are 93 country members of the agreement currently. Korea joined the agreement in 2012 and Japan in 2013.  “The wife seems to be the actual fosterer of the children, as she raised them in Japan. The husband broke the promise to bring their children back in August last year, breaching the wife’s custody rights. Therefore, the husband has the obligations to return the children to his wife,” the verdict said.By Lee Hyun-jeong","separated japanese wife seoul ,against her korean husband ,separated japanese wife ,to separated japanese wife ,lawsuit against her korean","['Seoul', 'korean', 'korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56896806  0.00637163

""In her address, Park will discuss her constitutional responsibilities as the president to protect the people, and will stress the need for unity of the people to prevent further provocations and to ease security concerns,"" Kim added.This would be her first parliamentary speech other than the annual budget speech.Park is expected to explain what led her government to shut down the joint industrial complex in North Korea and declare that she will place her policy priority on the country's nuclear disarmament.The factory zone in Kaesong, just north of the inter-Korean border in the communist North, opened in 2004 following the first-ever inter-Korean summit four years before. With some 54,000 North Korean workers on the payroll before last week's shutdown, the once symbol of reconciliation between the divided Koreas has often been considered a cash cow for the impoverished North.Officials say she will also call for the parliament's cooperation to win early passage of bills to revitalize the economy and labor reform as the nation's economy faces a crisis.Park may also meet with leaders of the rival parties after her address, according to the presidential office.","north korean provocations president ,provocations lawmakers said sunday ,korean provocations president park ,park to address parliament ,north korean provocations lawmakers","['Park Geun', 'north korean', 'the National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Seoul']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31031698  0.67917192

The late leader's birthday is also referred to as the Day of the Shining Star.It also comes after South Korea's intelligence service claimed that Kim Jong-un recently executed Ri Yong-gil, the second highest ranking Army officer, on charges of corruption and second-guessing the young leader's orders.According to Korean Central Television picked up in Seoul, Kim, who is the supreme commander of the North's military, promoted Kim Sang-gap, Ju Tong-chol, Sim Jong-thaek, Ri Yong-min and Ri Song-hak to Army lieutenant general ranks, along with Ho Yong-ho, who serves in the Korean People's Internal Security Forces.The report said that Ri Su-gyong, Kim Kwang-il and Jang Chun-won were posted as rear admirals in the Navy and An Pyong-chil and Choe Chol-su were appointed Air Force major generals, with Nam Kil-hak and Kim Il-ung being given major general ranks in the country's Strategic Force.The lieutenant general rank in the North is equivalent to a two star general officer in South Korea's military, while a major general is on par with a one-star officer.North Korean watchers in Seoul said the promotion of the large number of general officers is a move to strengthen Kim's control over the military, critical for the regime's survival, and raise the morale of troops. Tensions have mounted on the Korean Peninsula after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test and fired off its sixth long-range rocket coming into this year.","father birthday north korean ,father birthday major holiday ,birthday north korean leader ,late father birthday north ,late father birthday major","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kwangmyongsong Day', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - il']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4728834   0.59727383

Officials said the meeting will be called again Monday. The opposition camp, on the other hand, reproached it as an unnecessary provocation. Some radical members went as far as to suggest the government and ruling camp may be taking advantage of the North Korean factor to kindle security issues ahead of the April general elections.“The total closure of the Gaeseong complex was an inevitable decision for the government to take under the circumstances,” the ruling Saenuri Party’s chief spokesperson Rep. Kim Young-woo said Friday in a statement.He also blamed opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea for belittling the industrial park closure as an election strategy.“The Korean Peninsula is currently in an emergency situation, so this really is no time to play political games,” Kim said. It is typically considered to be in the favor of the conservative party in power when a national security threat takes place before a key election.The ruling party also stressed that the recent military provocations from the North added to the legitimacy of the pending terrorism prevention bill.“If a terrorist attack were to take place right now, who would then be held responsible?” posed party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung during a meeting on immigration safety held at the Incheon International Airport.“The opposition party may but face the blame that it neglected the security of the people and the nation, should it keep countering the bill for no reason.”The Minjoo Party, however, underlined the fact that the government’s strong responses snapped the feeble inter-Korean ties.“I am worried that the peninsular trust-building process may now turn into a hate-building one,” said Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. The trust-building process is a policy baseline that President Park Geun-hye has been repeating over the years in promise to improve the tens relations with the North in conjunction with its denuclearization.“We would have accepted the closure, although with a heavy heart, had there been serious threats to national security or sufficient bridging measures in between,” Lee claimed.“But the government has never suggested detailed evidence to back its claim that the North Korean regime was appropriating the park’s profits for the sake of its weaponry development.”Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, cohead of the new centrist People’s Party, remained at a step back from the bipartisan conflict, focusing on compensation for the expelled companies.While parties stood at odds over the closure, the company representatives called for compensatory actions.“We demand for the establishment of a damage investigation committee, consisting of the ruling Saenuri Party, or at least the three opposition parties,” said Jeong Ki-seop, association chairman of the group of Gaeseong industrial park businesses.The Office for Government Policy Coordination had earlier announced a series of compensation measures, including the postponement of loan redemptions for the affected companies. “The state should have protected the lives and assets of its people in the first place,” Jeong said, after the government announcement.“Redeeming taxes or lending money is no fundamental solution.” By Bae Hyun-jung","korean relations stiffened rapidly ,expelled businesses the ruling ,businesses the ruling conservative ,south korean government hard ,political feuds intensify over","['inter - korean', 'Gaeseong', 'south korean']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56645644  0.40063152

North Korea should take all responsibility for what will happen from now on,"" Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo said at a press briefing.The minister warned North Korea not to damage South Korean assets at the factory zone.

The second-biggest number of complaints was related to sexual harassment at 9.3 percent, followed by discrimination against social status at 5.2 percent, age at 4.5 percent and gender at 3 percent. Appearance, education status and country of birth were sources of discrimination at 1.1 percent each. The statistics come after a series of discriminatory incidents took place against the disabled.  YonhapLast year, the NHRC issued recommendations for a high school that expelled a man with mental disability due to requests by parents of his fellow students. The school allegedly said it expelled the student for creating a ruckus in the classroom and posing a threat to the learning environment. The human rights watchdog accused the school of violating the Disability Discrimination Act, saying that it forced the disabled student to transfer to another school against his will. The Disability Discrimination Act came into force in 2007 to defend the rights of the disabled and curb discrimination against them. The bill prohibits discrimination against the disabled without a justifiable reason. Among the 2,179 cases, the NHRC imposed recommendations on 35 cases, with 1,922 cases having been dismissed or rejected. The agency is looking into 164 cases.As of 2014, South Korea had a total of 2.49 million people had mental and physical disabilities, based on those registered with the municipalities. Among them, 58.1 percent were men and 41.9 percent women.By Ock Hyun-ju","disabled most common victims ,half of the complaints ,discrimination in south korea ,disabled most common ,discrimination against disabled people","['South Korea', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.22199841  0.23716946

I decided to appeal in order to secure my visitation and parental rights,” he said in a two-page note handed to the media in front of the court.  Lim Woo-jae heads to submit the appeal petition at the Seongnam Branch of Suwon District Court, Gyeonggi Province, Thursday. The couple ended their 17-year marriage last month as the local court ruled in favor of Lee who filed for divorce in October 2014. The court granted her both the parental right and custody of their 7-year-old son while only allowing Lim a monthly visit. With the appeal, the two continue to be legally married.“Although I have already hurt my son, I cannot give up the parental right since I know that the father’s absence cannot be fulfilled by any other person. I will spend much more time with my son, family and myself. I cannot lose the time that I can spend with my child,” he added. He immediately left the court after he submitted the appeal petition. Married in August 1999, the couple reportedly had marital problems in the past few years. They attempted to reach a divorce agreement but failed, resulting in a legal battle.","divorce ruling samsung heiress ,husband appeals against divorce ,against divorce ruling samsung ,samsung heiress husband appeals ,divorce ruling samsung","['Samsung', 'Lee Boo - jin ’s', 'Lim Woo - jae', 'Samsung Electro - Mechanics']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27391252  0.21941501

Korea is emerging as a country of prime focus with which to further expand economic ties, given the government’s economic policy framework, which is focused on promoting investment and exports, integration in global value chains, and creating a knowledge economy. Sri Lanka has identified Korea from among a small basket of countries with which to explore the possibility of entering into a bilateral preferential trading arrangement  or a free trade agreement  in the future.  In this regard, an initial joint study to examine the potential in trade and investment was launched in 2015 and is still in progress. There has been a proposal to establish a Joint Working Group  between Sri Lanka and Korea to explore new avenues of enhancing bilateral economic cooperation.  Under such a mechanism, some important areas could be discussed. This includes customs cooperation, technology transfer, addressing market barriers -- such as regulatory requirement on imports -- and steps towards enhancing trade, investment and tourism. Korea remains as one of the most important sources of foreign direct investment  in Sri Lanka.  Korean investment has resulted in over 70 companies being based in Sri Lanka. This has generated more than 4,000 job opportunities in the country.  There are many possible target sectors for Korean investment in Sri Lanka including electronics manufacturing, the development of industrial zones, tourism and leisure as well as knowledge-based industries.Korean investors and joint ventures can make use of Sri Lanka’s ideal location along the Indian Ocean Sea to access and service markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and East Africa, through the Indian subcontinent.  Sri Lanka’s FTAs with India and Pakistan can also be utilized.  The Sri Lankan government has also proposed to establish 11 business and technology development zones throughout the country, as well as an information and agricultural technology zone in Kandy this year. This will provide added impetus to attract Korean investment.  The Sri Lankan government also hopes to introduce an investor-friendly Foreign Exchange Management Bill , which would help attract foreign exchange flows.  There has been a modest but steady increase in bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Korea which currently stands at approximately $487 million.  The main export from Sri Lanka to Korea is apparel, accounting for 34 percent of Sri Lanka’s total export earnings from South Korea in 2014. Sri Lanka also exports Ceylon tea, rubber, spices, diamond and jewelry, among other things. Hence there exists tremendous potential to further access the Korean market.   Ambassador Manisha GunasekeraSri Lanka also has global monopoly in the supply of “True Cinnamon” commanding over 85 percent of the supply share in the world market. There also exists much potential to export sea foods and fisheries products, aquarium fish, fruits, vegetables and floriculture products to Korea.Cooperation between the two countries has provided an effective framework to further enhance trade and investment ties.  Memorandums of understanding exist between Sri Lanka’s Chamber of Commerce and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry as well as the Busan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment has a memorandum with the Small and Medium Business Corporation of Korea.  Plans are also underway for an exchange of visits by investment trade delegations of both countries this year.In addition, Sri Lanka and Korea are members of the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement, formerly known as the Bangkok Agreement, whose member countries cover a total population of about 2.5 billion, which provides a vast potential market to increase the level of intra-regional trade flows among participating states.Sri Lanka has enormous potential to attract more tourists from Korea with the commencement of three direct flights per week via Korean Air between Seoul and Colombo since 2013.  Korean tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka which stood at 4,318 in 2010, jumped to 14,373 in 2015. Sri Lanka is a unique tourist destination that offers a remarkable combination of experiences.  Within a mere area of  65,610 kilometers lies 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 1,330 kilometers of pristine coastline and 15 national parks with abundance of wildlife including herds of elephant. Not to mention nearly 500,000 acres of lush tea estates, 250 acres of botanical gardens, 350 waterfalls, 25,000 water bodies as well as ancient cities and cultural sites that are 2,500 years old.  Korean official development assistance to Sri Lanka is an important aspect of the bilateral relationship between the two countries. Its importance is demonstrated by the fact that Sri Lanka stands as the second highest recipient of such assistance in terms of cumulative disbursements -- $ 430.4 million -- and is placed at number five in terms of commitments out of 52 developing countries.  In Sri Lanka, Korea stands at the fourth place among donors.  Korean official development assistance has contributed toward Sri Lanka’s development process through the Economic Development Cooperation Fund , and grant assistance via the Korea International Cooperation Agency .  KOICA has generated long-lasting goodwill between the two countries, in the priority sectors of development.  KOICA volunteers continue to be effective cultural ambassadors of Korea.  This bilateral partnership has been further strengthened by the recent visit of the President of the EXIM Bank of Korea Lee Duk-hoon to Sri Lanka this January.   A very important aspect of bilateral cooperation is labor relations, with approximately 30,000 Sri Lankan contractual workers engaged in the manufacturing, construction and fisheries sectors under the employment permit system in Korea.  The Sri Lankan government pays high attention to the welfare of its worker community in Korea, through regular visits to employers, briefings and cultural events, among other things.  The government of Sri Lanka is deeply appreciative of the opportunities granted to Sri Lankan workers by the Korean government whose contribution and remittances continue to make a significant impact on the economies of the two countries.    There are over a hundred Sri Lankan students studying in leading Korean universities. The scholarships offered to some of these students by the Korean government and some private foundations are greatly appreciated.  The Sri Lankan workers and students in Korea speak fluent Korean and continue to be a valuable conduit of cultural relations between the two countries.Korea’s Saemaul Undong  program or the ‘new village movement’, based on the principles of diligence, self-help and cooperation, resonates with Sri Lanka. The program is implemented in two model villages in Sri Lanka, with plans for further expansion to other regions.  Action is underway by the Sri Lankan government to revitalize the rural economy. In this regard, Sri Lanka’s state minister of agriculture led a senior level technical delegation to participate in the Global Saemaul Leadership Forum in Daegu last November. There remains great potential for the further enhancement of relations between the two countries in sectors such as science and technology, defense, and cultural relations. Action is underway to enter into and renew bilateral agreements to enhance cooperation in these sectors.  Korean drama and k-pop are increasingly popular in Sri Lanka, and the showcasing of each other’s cultures can lead to the further elevation of this friendly and mutually beneficial partnership.","of korea enjoy longstanding ,enhancing sri lanka korea ,korea enjoy longstanding friendly ,korea enjoy longstanding ,cultural links spanning centuries","['the Embassy of Sri Lanka', 'Sri Lanka', 'the Republic of Korea', 'buddhist', 'Sri Lanka', 'Korea']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74007839  0.51529264

A road sign in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, reads “Gongyeongjuchajang,” which is the Romanization of “public parking lot” in Korean but means absolutely nothing in any other language.  An example of a confusing sign directing to a public parking lot in English. In response to complaints about unclear and downright wrong English signs, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday that it will overhaul English signs and public notices that are grammatically incorrect or misleading for foreigners.According to officials, the ministry will gather input from state agencies and regional governments about signs which need to be fixed. The focus will be mainly on signs that foreign visitors routinely come across, particularly at tourist sites and cultural properties.The ministry will then collect opinions from native speakers in cooperation with ChattingCat -- a platform that provides grammatical corrections for poor English -- to come up with possible alternatives. Feedback from native speakers will be uploaded on the government’s online data processing “On-Nara BPS system” for government bodies to see.Unhelpful English signs are scattered all across the country.For instance, a road sign in Korea’s resort destination Jejudo Island says, “Seobjikoji , without any indication that it is a beach.Signs in the popular shopping district of Dongdaemun present challenges as well. While some signs say, “shopping center,” others say, “sangga,” which means shopping center in Korean. According to data provided by Rep. Kang Eun-hee of the ruling Saenuri party, 29.6 percent of the 9,077 English signs across the country were inconsistent with government standards. The situation was the worst in South Jeolla Province, where 41.8 percent of English signs were found to be incorrect. Some mistakes are even supposedly done on purpose. “Some Sevit,” the artificial island on the Hangang River, is a combination of the Korean word for island, “seom,” which sounds like “some”, and its name, Sevit. According to officials, they used the word “Some” on the sign to refer to “awesome,” which they hoped would be visitors’ response. However, the name of the island is not used consistently, appearing as “Sebitseom” on the introductory section on its homepage and as “Some Sevit” at another area of the page. By Yoon Min-sik","confusing english signs tourist ,korea to revise incorrect ,english signs tourist stumbling ,incorrect confusing english signs ,confusing english signs","['Hannam - dong', 'South Africa', 'Korean', 'Jeonju', 'North Jeolla Province']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17514396  0.01505776

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry  and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi approach to shake hands after attending a news conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing on Jan. 27. AP-YonhapOver the last two decades, China has been pushing to develop longer-range missiles and artillery platforms with longer operational ranges, and greater lethality, survivability and accuracy -- so as to keep potential adversaries including the U.S. at bay in case of any conflict. However, America’s beefed-up missile defense involving the support of its core allies such as South Korea and Japan could help offset China’s missiles and coastal artillery, putting the Asian power at a disadvantage, observers noted.“The U.S. can launch counterstrikes after fending off missile attacks with a missile defense system. Although the system is defensive, China would think it is being exposed to the threat of U.S. strikes,” said Park Won-gon, security expert at Handong Global University.“It is an exemplary case of a security dilemma that is induced by a lack of bilateral trust. Due to this dilemma, China believes THAAD represents a security threat to itself, though it is an interception platform, not an offensive system.”Nam Chang-hee, military expert at Inha University, said that THAAD could pose a “strategic and psychological” burden to China given that U.S. forces in Korea are those closest to China that could be deployed in case of a contingency involving the two major powers.“From China’s perspective, U.S.’ Osan and Kunsan air bases are the closest staging points in case of a conflict,” he said. “Thus, in light of their military operations, China remains sensitive to any fortified missile defense systems for these bases.” Nam, however, pointed out that China’s complaints about THAAD are “unfair” given that it has not taken any substantive steps to address North Korea’s missile threats.“For Seoul, missile defense is an urgent issue to fend off North Korean attacks. Seoul -- facing a serious security challenge -- is not in a position to care too much about China’s complaints,” he said. Another reason why Beijing remains opposed to the deployment of THAAD is the symbolism associated with the system, a core element of the U.S.’ global multilayered missile shield program.Observers say that even though it would be operated by the U.S. forces here, the deployment of THAAD would immediately symbolize Seoul’s participation in the U.S. MD program, which China thinks would ultimately target it.Seoul has been pushing for its own Korea Air and Missile Defense system, arguing that it would develop an indigenous system, called L-SAM, similar to THAAD. Seoul’s Defense Ministry on Monday said that should both L-SAM and THAAD be operated on the peninsula, it would be helpful for the country’s security. Chinese officials have expressed discomfort over any discussions regarding THAAD, saying that it is hardly understandable that its friendly neighbor like South Korea would do anything to undermine its security interests.China, in particular, is concerned about an AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar that comes with the THAAD battery. The radar is known to have a detecting range of around 18,000 km, meaning its coverage can go well beyond North Korea to reach China as well.The U.S.’ fortified missile shield could also complicate China’s nuclear strategy -- deterrence with the threat of unacceptable damage to its adversary through assured retaliation -- and make the emergent Asian power more vulnerable to foreign attacks.Robust deterrence can be established when there is a clear prospect that an act of aggression will lead to unacceptable damage in return. But when a potential adversary believes it has a defense mechanism strong enough to counter a retaliatory strike, deterrence could crumble.

Yet, he could settle down in Korea only after a grueling six-year process to win refugee status, enduring poor treatment toward asylum seekers and discrimination against African migrants. Yiombi Thona “Korea is my second home which gave me protection. I appreciate it,” Thona, a Congolese refugee and professor at Gwangju University told The Korea Herald. “But living as a refugee in Korea has been challenging, mainly because Koreans don’t know what a refugee is.” Thona, who was born to a royal family and served as a national intelligence agent for eight years in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, fled his motherland after being tortured and jailed for blowing the whistle on a dubious deal between the government and the rebel army. With the help of his colleagues, Thona managed to obtain a fake passport to travel to China. He stayed in Beijing for a week looking for a third country where he could claim asylum, as China was diplomatically too close to Congo. He then secured a visa to enter Korea in 2002. “I barely knew about Korea. I thought I was going to Pyongyang because, in Congo, we were only familiar with North Korea,” he said. “But it didn’t matter where I was going. I just had to stay away from my country.”After a two-day ferry journey, Thona arrived in Incheon. He took a taxi and ended up at a hotel near Seoul Station. “I only had a small bag and very little money. I had nowhere to stay and no one to talk to,” he said, recalling the first day he arrived in Korea. “For the first three days, I didn’t go out, eat or do anything. People walking outside the window seemed very strange.”A few days later, Thona wrote a letter to the U.S. office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees asking for help. With its help, he applied for asylum and went through 15 interviews only to be rejected. The Justice Ministry took issue with the lack of documents to prove his identity and his inconsistent testimonies during the interviews, Yiombi said. “But it is nonsense. I couldn’t bring documents from Congo because I had to escape urgently,” he said. “I could not explain my side enough as I was not provided with interpreters who could speak good French.” Defying the ministry’s rejection, Thona brought the case to the court without knowing that the legal process would take another three years. “When I asked the Justice Ministry officials where to live and what to do, they said they didn’t have any programs to support asylum seekers,” he said. “They just told me not to work illegally as they would have to arrest me otherwise.”Under the Refugee Act that took effect in 2013, the government now provides selected asylum seekers with monthly living expenses and state-run accommodation for the first six months upon their application. After that, they are granted a work permit to get a job while their claims are being processed. But in 2002, without the Refugee Act in place, refugee applicants were banned from working in the country under the immigration law. Without any financial assistance from the government or the U.N. agency, Thona began to work illegally in factories. There, the French-speaking African, who spoke neither Korean nor English, had to endure several injuries and appalling conditions. “My bosses sometimes called me ‘nigger’ and beat me when I was slow in understanding new machines,” he said. “I had never done physical work before. I cried day and night. My body ached all the time.”One night his arm got stuck in a machine and he started to bleed. While his boss yelled at him without helping him, it was a refugee rights lawyer who took him to a hospital at 2 a.m. But the hospital tied Thona to the bed to prevent him from running away as he did not have money to pay for medical expenses, he said. “South Korea signed the Geneva Convention to receive refugees. But the country offered neither housing nor food to help us to survive back then,” he said. “I wondered where human rights were in this country. How could a human being live like that?” South Korea’s first engagement in the international refugee movement dates back to 1992 when it joined the U.N. Refugee Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.Yiombi ThonaSince the country began to accept refugees in 1994, the Justice Ministry has completed reviews on 7,735 applications and granted refugee status to 522 of them as of 2014. Putting aside thousands of pending applications, its refugee acceptance rate stood at 6.7 percent, far lower than the U.N. average of 38 percent. Thona was eventually recognized as a refugee in 2008. He was then entitled to work, medical insurance, documents to travel outside Korea and, most importantly, the right to bring his family to Korea. But even after he won refugee status, his ordeal was far from over, he said. Even with a legitimate visa to work here, employers were reluctant to hire him as he was a refugee. Whenever Thona attempted to pass through border controls with his travel document issued by the Korean government, he was rejected and then had to wait for hours while immigration officers worked out his refugee status. “It is good that protection for refugees is written in the law, but measures are not properly being implemented due to lack of awareness of refugees in Korean society,” Thona said. “Banks, hospitals, public servants … they don’t know who a refugee is and the refugee law.” Thona is also worried about his two stateless children born in Korea. As they grow older, he says, they will need a nation to give them a sense of unity and protection. “My children don’t have any nationality. They are neither Congolese nor Korean,” he said. In Korea, the Refugee Act does not stipulate the status of refugees’ newborn babies. In Congo, the babies cannot be Congolese unless they are registered with the government within six months after birth. Now, Thona is trying to raise awareness about refugees in Korea and abroad. He has campaigned for refugee rights, attended conferences to share his experience and published a book titled “My Name is Yiombi.” “The world should help asylum seekers to better integrate into their society,” Thona said. “Nobody knows who will become a refugee next. It can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime.”Between busy schedules, Thona misses his homeland every day. One day, he would love to go back. “I can go anywhere except for Congo. It is sad,” he said. “I don’t forget my people. When I go back, I want to teach Congolese what I learned about Korea’s rapid economic growth and Koreans’ patriotism.” “My second home is Korea and I am a transnational guy now,” he said. “But my final destination will always be Congo.” By Ock Hyun-ju","refugee in korea with ,korea only after grueling ,refugee in korea ,as refugee in korea ,settle down in korea","['Yiombi Thona', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'african']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66439599  0.05626342

The target amount is 10 billion won to establish an independent foundation to replace what the two countries agreed to set up with 1 billion yen from the Japanese government.    Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for the Japanese military during the war.

It claims that such experiences can have serious lifelong consequences on victims both emotionally and clinically. The study raises concerns about South Korea’s current child protection legislation, as well as child welfare policies that do not specifically include childhood exposure to domestic violence in definitions of child maltreatment. The psychiatrist, Choi Ji-wook from the Catholic University of Korea Daejeon St. Mary’s Hospital, claimed in her study that young adults who as children had frequently witnessed their caregiver being subjected to violence, and those who were repeatedly abused verbally in childhood, had weaker connections in two areas of the brain -- the hippocampus and the amygdala. A brain scan of a young Korean adult who was abused as a child shows long-term changes in key brain circuits. YonhapThe two components of the brain perform functions in the processing of emotional reactions, fear and the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Many overseas studies -- which have also discovered similar changes in key regions of the brains of adult child abuse survivors -- have suggested that such changes may leave them more vulnerable to a number of mental disorders as adults, including addiction and depression. According to UNICEF, children who witness domestic violence are more likely to be affected by violence as adults -- either as victims or perpetrators. The organization also stressed that children in the earliest years of life are particularly vulnerable, as many studies show that domestic violence is more prevalent in homes with younger children than those with older children. In a number of states in the U.S., a conviction for domestic violence committed in the presence of a child may result in harsher penalties, which usually mean longer jail terms or increased fines. In five states -- Delaware, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah -- exposing a child to domestic violence is a separate crime that can be charged separately or in addition to the act of violence.

Do you know why we came to Japan?"" Lee said at the press conference, strongly demanding a formal apology from Abe for Japan's wartime atrocities toward the women.    ""The deal is making a fool out of us. It was agreed upon without any consultation with us. How can they agree  by pushing us aside? I'm furious,"" said 89-year-old Kang Il-chul, who traveled to Japan with Lee.   The two women are the first to have come to Tokyo to make remarks at a press conference following the Seoul-Tokyo deal.On Dec. 28, South Korea and Japan agreed to end a drawn-out dispute between the two countries over the issue ""finally and irreversibly,"" with Tokyo pledging to provide 1 billion yen  for a new South Korean foundation aimed at helping the aging former comfort women.   Kang and Lee are among the 10 women living at the House of Sharing, a group home for former sex slaves on the outskirts of Seoul. A total of 46 survivors now live in South Korea.   Amid controversy over the agreement, Abe told a parliamentary meeting last week that there is no evidence to prove the women were forcibly brought to Japan by its military during the war.   But South Korea has made it clear that Korean women were forced against their will to provide sexual services for Japanese soldiers, rebutting contrary claims by the Japanese prime minister.   The agreement has sparked a wave of public protests among victims and their supporters, who claim Japan got the better end of the deal by obtaining Seoul's promise to settle the issue once and for all if Tokyo fulfills its commitments.   During a meeting with local civic groups, the victims also shared their painful experiences, stressing their desperate hope for better ties between Seoul and Tokyo by settling the pending issue.   ""How could a teenage girl have served 40-50 people everyday?I'd rather die. It was nothing but a guillotine ... If we willingly went there  to earn money, how come we have been demanding all these things at this age?"" Lee said.    Upon Korea's independence in 1945, she was taken to China by Japan and had stayed there before managing to return home in 2000 at the age of 75.    ""When I returned home, my parents and family members had all died, and they had reported to the government that I had died,"" she cried out.   Underlying the fact that ""Japanese citizens are not to be blamed,"" Kang extended her gratitude to Japanese civic groups and citizens for supporting her.   ""I hope such a thing will never happen again, and that South Korea and Japan maintain their amicable relationship by resolving all these matters,"" she added.","women criticize korea japan ,comfort women criticize korea ,korean comfort women criticize ,women on tuesday reiterated ,women criticize korea","['korean', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'japanese']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58051419  0.43153706

This is well below the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 69.2 percent, and significantly lower than the 80-90 percent levels found in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.The think tank's report, based on information collected from the OECD's Health Data, showed only Japan had a reading of below 40 percent among the world's developed market economies with high income.Despite what people perceive, the life expectancy for a South Korean stood at 81.8 years, higher than the 80.5 years for the OECD.""The difference in perception and life expectancy derives from social and cultural views on health,"" KIHASA said. ""Different views on weight played a role.""The institute said that South Koreans generally tended to equate obesity with bad health and that, compared to other OECD members, more often believed they were overweight. It also said women were more likely than men to think they are fat.Other fallouts from the subjective perception of ill health can be found in the average days a South Korean spends in a hospital compared to people living in other countries.On average, a South Korean spent 16.5 days in the hospital, vis-a-vis 8.3 days for the OECD, although part of the reason is due to the longer time that dementia patients spend in convalescent hospitals.The report also showed that from 2004 to 2013, the number of hospital beds jumped two-fold, which is a much sharper increase compared to the 10 percent growth tallied for the OECD as a whole.While there has been an increase in the size of medical facilities, Asia's fourth largest economy had the third lowest number of doctors per 1,000 people. Within the OECD, the average stood at 3.3 per 1,000, while corresponding numbers for South Korea stood at 2.2.This has led to a much greater number of patients being checked by local doctors, which can affect the quality of care given, it said. On average, a South Korean doctor checked 6,487 patients as of 2011, 2.7 times larger than the average of the OECD.","health concerns south koreans ,excessive health concerns south ,suffering from bad health ,koreans weighed down by ,bad health despite having","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'South Koreans', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43067384  0.30626297

Kim Yong-chol, who has been leading the North's reconnaissance bureau, is likely to replace Kim Yang-gon, who died in a car accident in late December, as the secretary in charge of affairs with South Korea at the Workers' Party, the sources said.The Youido Institute, a think tank under the ruling Saenuri Party, delivered a report on the new intelligence to its leadership earlier in the day.Gen. Kim, known as a hard-liner, is believed to have orchestrated Pyongyang's two deadly attacks on the South in 2010 -- the sinking of the Cheonan warship and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. The two attacks killed a total of 50 South Koreans, including two civilians.He is also known for having masterminded the planting of land mines across the inter-Korean border that severely injured two South Korean staff sergeants in August last year.Since 2009, Kim has led the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau tasked with intelligence operations in foreign countries and cyberwarfare.""We are closely monitoring the relevant situation,"" an intelligence agency official said.Kim's possible nomination may cast clouds over the already strained inter-Korean ties, which have dropped to one of the worst levels as a result of the North's fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6.Kim Yang-gon, known for a dialogue-seeking figure, was called ""the closest comrade-in-arms"" of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Kim, who served as the head of the United Front Department in the party, was part of the North's delegation to rare inter-Korean high-level talks in August following heightened tensions sparked by the land mine blast.The two Koreas reached a rare deal on Aug. 25 to defuse military tensions and make efforts to promote inter-Korean civilian exchanges.","top north korean general ,top north korean military ,died in car accident ,north korean military official ,korea top north korean","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Kim Yong - chol', 'Kim Yang - gon']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38839704  0.62948668

Park Yu-ha, a professor at Sejong University, has been ordered to pay a total of 90 million won  -- 10 million for each of the nine surviving victims who filed the suit against her last year -- in compensation.In her controversial book published in 2013, titled “Comfort Women of the Empire,” Park argued that some of the Korean “comfort women” were lured or trafficked to work as sex workers for the Japanese military by Korean collaborators and private Japanese recruiters, who mostly approached financially struggling young women in need of jobs.  Kang Il-chul, one of the plaintiffs, react to the court’s sentence on professor Park Yu-ha at the Dongbu District Court in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, Wednesday. YonhapShe also argued that some of the women fell in love with Japanese soldiers while being enslaved, while some of them supported the Japanese military. In 2014, the nine surviving victims filed a compensation suit against Park, asking the court to ban the book from being sold and promoted. They also asked the court to order Park to pay 270 million won -- 30 million won for each of the victims -- in compensation for defamation. In February last year, the court ordered Park to delete a total of 34 sections in the book which ""defamed"" the surviving victims. The original version of the book had been banned from being sold since then. The professor, who attended college in Japan and received her Ph.D. in Japanese literature from Waseda University, has been claiming that she had no reason to defame the surviving victims, and that she wanted to give a more nuanced analysis of the particular history.Park is also on trial on the criminal charge of defaming the victims. The first hearing is scheduled for Jan. 20. Last month, a total of 194 scholars and writers, including author Jang Jung-il and Yonsei University professor Kim Chul, released a statement criticizing the judiciary, claiming the indictment of the professor violates the freedom of speech.

Moon Jae-in’s leadership will lose Gwangju and Jeolla voters, who have for decades remained supportive of the opposition camp.“For the first time in my almost 60-year political life, I have decided to leave my party of my own will,” Kwon, who had been acting as the party’s senior adviser, said at a press conference Tuesday.“I have given my best efforts to achieve unity, but cannot hold out any more.”The political veteran, who had served three parliamentary terms, is expected to be followed by 40 or more party members, including senior incumbent lawmakers such as former floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won.Kwon directly pointed his finger at the party chief for being “self-righteous and exclusive,” and for creating a “pro-Roh hegemony” within the party.Moon, who was chief secretary to late President Roh Moo-hyun, has often been blamed for excluding conventional key figures and acting against the Honam  voters’ sentiment.Honam voters, whose support is considered crucial for opposition victory in elections, have increasingly grown apathetic since Moon, who is considered a political heir to Roh, took the wheel.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the former incarnation of the Minjoo Party, had formerly enjoyed 48-55 percent approval ratings in the area, according to local pollster Gallup Korea. But this figure dropped down to the low 40 percent range upon Moon’s inauguration in February last year, and dipped further to around 30 percent amid escalating factional feuds late last year.“There is no hope or future for a party that does not take responsibility for consecutive election failures,” the senior politician said.Kwon had earlier demanded that Moon step down and give way to an emergency council. The demand for Moon’s resignation was one of the key sticking points between the colliding factions, eventually leading to former cochairman Ahn Cheol-soo’s defection in December. He, however, hinted that he would not join Ahn‘s forthcoming People’s Party and that he will remain a supporter of the opposition camp in general.“Kwon’s defection shows that the Minjoo Party has parted with the Honam region for good and slipped into a leftist activist group, short of political legitimacy,” said third-term lawmaker Park Joo-sun, who had earlier defected from the party.Leader Moon held himself together and accepted the breakup.“ reflects the public sentiment of the Honam region, and this we should accept with a humble heart,” Moon told reporters. “But with the help of new members, our party will advance into a whole new, young and capable political power.”Independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  and professor Han Sang-jin , cochairman of the party preparatory committee, pay respects at the cemetery of the late President Roh Moo-hyun in Bongha Village, South Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. While the main opposition camp remained divided over the pro-Roh clique dispute, Ahn visited the late president’s Bongha Village in South Gyeongsang Province on Tuesday and paid respects at his cemetery.During his visit, some Roh supporters held up signs protesting Ahn’s visit, blaming him for splitting up the opposition.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles shedding light on refugees in Korea, their hardships, the systematic fallout, the country’s own history and ways to go forward. The following is the seventh installment. ― Ed.It was a late evening in autumn 2013 when Ryu Ha-eun crossed the Tumen River in her perilous search for freedom ― something she had yearned for while living in North Korea for some 20 years.Along with several other North Korean compatriots, Ryu waded through the waist-deep waters, shuddering with fear, for if caught, she would face harsh punishments that would not only hurt her, but also her family.As the full moon shone brightly over the river bordering China, her heart began pounding uncontrollably. Chills ran down her spine due to the strident sound of border troops walking in formation for a change of shifts.“Just halfway across the river, we heard border troops gathering nearby. We held our breath and tried to hide ourselves to avoid being caught,” Ryu, who came to Korea last March, told The Korea Herald. “It was a nerve-racking moment that I don’t want to be reminded of.”Ryu is one of the thousands of North Korean defectors who flee repression and poverty each year for what they hope will be a better future outside the isolated country. Refugees usually cross the river into China and seek safe haven there, in South Korea or elsewhere. But their hopes for a better life crumble soon after they arrive in China where they are labeled as illegal border crossers subject to immediate repatriation. Due to their status, they are often mistreated, with some exploiting them and forcing them into hard labor, prostitution and other forms of abuses, mostly in remote Chinese villages. “As North Korean female refugees have no legal protection in China, they become an easy target for human trafficking by vile brokers who treat them like animals. This shatters all their hopes for a better future and deprives them of their fundamental human rights,” said Chun Ki-won, a Christian pastor who has supported North Korean defectors since 1999.“Some are sent to rural areas in China where they are forced to marry . They are also sent to bars or forced into sex trade. These days, many are forced to work for some obscene computer chatting programs.”Despite growing international criticism, China has continuously repatriated North Korean refugees, arguing they have contravened local border entry rules. Observers say that Beijing refuses them refugee status in consideration of its traditional relationship with Pyongyang, and because the move could help fuel separatism in Tibet and Xinjiang. “We don’t call them defectors. They are violators of  immigration law and related regulations. They have also disrupted the order along the border,” Beijing’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying told visiting Korean reporters last month.“Just like South Korea, China also deals with these people in line with its domestic laws, international law and humanitarian principles.” Lawmakers listen to testimony from a defector during a parliamentary session held at the Hanawon settlement support center for North Korean refugees in Ansong, Gyeonggi Province, in October. Over the last several years, it has been increasingly difficult for North Koreans to defect from the repressive state. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reportedly ordered his troops to tighten border control. He is also said to have warned of the “extermination of three generations” of any family if a member is caught defecting.“Kim apparently believes that defectors are shedding light on his country’s woeful human rights situations. He is, therefore, rumored to have directed his military to tighten border security,” said Chun. “Once refugees arrive in China, it is difficult to move to areas bordering a third country, such as Mongolia, via which they can come to South Korea, because of China’s beefed-up crackdown on illegal residents. Thus, the overall situation has turned unfavorable for those seeking to flee the North.”Indeed, the number of defectors to South Korea has steadily declined since the young North Korean leader took the helm of the dictatorial regime upon his father’s death in December 2011, according to government data. The total number, which stood at 2,706 in 2011, dipped to 1,502 in 2012, 1,397 in 2014 and 1,277 last year. Currently, nearly 28,610 North Korean defectors ― 70 percent of whom are female ― live in the South.Defectors’ hardships do not end even after they land in South Korea. They face the tough process of adapting to the capitalist society where they are forced to compete with better-educated South Koreans.Some of them have been embroiled in criminal activity, hurting the overall image of North Korean defectors. As of January this year, 102 North Korean defectors have been imprisoned for various crimes, the Justice Ministry told The Korea Herald, refusing to specify the crimes.The Seoul government has carried out various resettlement programs, including a three-month education program at the Hanawon resettlement support center. Yet, those programs are not enough to help them lead a stable life in a new environment, defectors said.“It is very difficult for us to adapt to a completely new, different life here,” said Joo Ye-un, a North Korean defector in her early 20s. “I hope people would welcome defectors more and that the society would become more inclusive.”The difficult task of integrating the defectors into society has indicated that the country would face even tougher challenges when it is ultimately unified with North Korea with a population of 24.8 million ― a reason Seoul needs to improve its policy to support defectors, particularly when it is seeking to lay the foundation for reunification.Kim Heung-kwang, chief of the Seoul-based North Korea Intellectual Solidarity, said Seoul should include defectors when crafting policies for them rather than sidelining them in the process.“The government has tended to craft and implement its policy toward defectors without due consultations with them, and that is the reason why the policy lacks efficiency,” he said.“There are still people who think of defectors as coming to South Korea for begging or something. They should regard and support the defectors as those who could play a central role in realizing our long-cherished dream of national reunification.”By Song Sang-ho","korean refugees risk perilous ,north korean refugees risk ,korean refugees risk ,refugees in korea their ,on refugees in korea","['South Korea', 'the Korea Herald', 'Korea', 'Ed']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.39803112  0.45129406

The country is under a state of emergency after attacks Nov. 13, and a police station was attacked Thursday by a man whose background is still unclear.    Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo unveiled a plaque Sunday in memory of victims targeted at newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market, a rock concert, cafes, a stadium and elsewhere.    The ceremony took place at Place de la Republique, a plaza that has become a symbol of Parisians' solidarity since the attacks, which began Jan. 7, 2015.    French rocker and national icon Johnny Hallyday joined the army choir in a special, somber musical performance.    The violence left some 150 victims dead, and several attackers were also killed.    Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve called for national unity and insisted the government is doing all it can to protect France.    Many questions remain about the Nov. 13 attacks, including how many people were involved and may still be at large.    Cazeneuve said on i-Tele television Sunday that ``We don't know where Salah Abdeslam is,'' referring to a fugitive gunman. Abdeslam crossed into Belgium Nov. 14 and Belgian authorities believe he hid out in a Brussels area apartment used to make bombs for the Paris attacks before moving on.","honor 2015 attack victims ,2015 attack victims french ,rocker honor 2015 attack ,attack victims french president ,2015 attack victims","['french', 'Francois Hollande', 'islamic', 'Paris', 'european', 'France']",5,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29411152  0.66032296

The league office said the sanctions will cover games in the Futures League, the KBO's equivalent of the minor league, and also the preseason and postseason.Should there be less than half a season remaining at the time of their return, the ban will then extend into the following season.Both are top-notch closers with proven track records. Oh is the KBO's all-time leader with 277 saves, recorded over nine seasons with the Lions. He then led the Central League in saves in both of his two years with the Tigers. In 2014, he had 39 saves with a 1.76 ERA while striking out 81 in 66 2/3 innings. Then last year, he tied Tony Barnette with 41 saves, despite a leg injury that prematurely ended his season in December, along with a 2.83 ERA and 66 strikeouts in 69 1/3 innings.Oh and the Tigers are no longer talking. Should he choose to return home, the Lions are the only KBO club he may join, and it appears unlikely they will acquire him after releasing Lim for the same gambling charges.Lim is one of only a few South Korean players to have competed in the KBO, NPB and MLB.

North Korea is being tightly controlled by the North's leader Kim Jong-un's ironfisted rule.""In the early stage of the post-unification period, there is no need to operate a local autonomy government system in North Korea in the same way as that of South Korea,"" it said. ""It would be desirable for South Korea to take a gradual step by taking into account the North's situation.""North Korea has rebuked South Korea for preparing to unify the divided two Koreas by absorbing it, while South Korea has said its official position is that inter-Korean unification should be done through mutual agreement.","north korea after unification ,korea after unification report ,korea for social integration ,north korea for social ,stability to unified korea","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'North Korea', 'Korea', 'North Koreans', 'the Industry Academic Cooperation Foundatio']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.3377887   0.29991892

The two countries are to hold their regular working-level talks on the program in the near future.""South Korea will draw up some measures to classify Chinese soldiers' remains more correctly and solve the issue with China in a forward-looking stance,"" another ministry official noted.No official response has been made from the Chinese government so far over the allegations.","of chinese soldiers killed ,chinese soldiers in 2014 ,of 437 chinese soldiers ,chinese soldiers killed during ,chinese soldiers killed","['the Defense Ministry', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'China', 'South Korea', 'chinese', 'North Korea']",5,"[ 2.          2.          0.         ... -0.41530657  0.46322018

The student councils of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and Ewha Womans University also called on the government to scrap the agreement, while encouraging other universities to join their cause.The group of Korean professors, tentatively named “the association for establishment of the society on comfort women,” called the agreement “a diplomatic blunder” by the Korean government that could never be a closure for victims of Japan’s wartime atrocities.Seoul and Tokyo had agreed on what they called a “final and irreversible” deal on Dec. 28, in which Japan apologized to the victims “for its involvement” and funding 1 billion yen  to support the surviving victims. But the survivors and associated organizations have criticized the deal for omitting Japan’s recognition of its legal responsibility.“The key to the comfort women issue is that Japan, as a country, is responsible for coercing countless women into sexual slavery. ... Yet the agreement does not clarify Japan’s crimes and does not mention punishing those responsible or including  in its history lessons,” the group said in its press release.HUFS students accused the government of deliberately ignoring the voices of the victims for its “diplomatic accomplishment.” Ewha students urged the Japanese government to recognize its legal responsibilities and apologize in order to reach a closure on the issue.By Yoon Min-sik","councils scholars denounce sex ,wartime sex slavery saying ,student councils scholars denounce ,scholars denounce sex slave ,denounce sex slave deal","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Hankuk University of Foreign Studies', 'Ewha Womans University']",5,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.23445691  0.21461393
