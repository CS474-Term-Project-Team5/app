It ranges from dramas, movies and K-pop to TV shows like “Running Man,” which has an especially large following in Southeast Asian countries.North Korea, one of the poorest countries in the world, has been controlling the flow of information from the outside world. This is to back its propaganda about the self-proclaimed excellence of the Kim Jong-un regime and the supposed malicious and depraved nature of other countries. Professor Kang Dong-wan of South Korea’s Donga University shows a Chinese EVD portable video-playing device, referred to as “Note TV or Note-tel” by North Koreans, in this photo dated Nov. 22, 2013. Former North Korean defectors recently testified at a forum in New York that bringing in information from the outside world -- which often take place on the sidelines of smuggling -- is considered one of the worst crimes in the country. But technological advances and the growth of the black market in the hermit kingdom has made it more difficult to keep the citizens from accessing outside media. The South Korean Unification Ministry believes that the North’s central distribution system collapsed in the mid-1990s. One of the most popular means of enjoying Hallyu is said to be Notetel, a type of portable media player that plays DVDs and enhanced versatile discs. It was legalized in 2014 under the condition that it is limited to certain channels of the regime’s choice.Thae testified that any North Korean who works abroad can easily access the internet via smart devices, although the regime urges them not to. They are, however, prevented from conveying the information they learned to others, due to the authorities spying on them upon their return to North Korea.“North Korea’s control over the internet is crumbling, and Kim knows it,” he said.Exposure to South Korean culture is affecting North Korean lives as well. According to Thae, young North Koreans even talk like South Koreans. Although the two Koreas have the same language, regional dialects and their 66-year separation have resulted in their citizens speaking in a very different manner.“They say words like ‘jagiya’ , ‘oppa’ , ‘kkk’ , which don’t even exist in the North Korean language,” he said.Using these words is subject to the authorities’ crackdown, but Thae said it can be fixed by paying certain fees to the authorities. “North Korea attempts to control its people, but there are two things you just can’t stop. Drugs and Hallyu,” he said.He said the exposure to South Korean culture is slowly bringing the Kim regime down from the inside. “The Kim regime appears stable from the outside, but is rotting from the inside. ... We  hail Kim Jong-un during the daytime and watch South Korean films and dramas at night under blankets,” he said. Thae said this is why Kim keeps such close tabs on the country’s elites and executes anyone who falls out of line. “I was afraid that the ‘slave life’ will continue until the time of my grandchildren’s children. I told my family that I am severing the chains the moment I leave the embassy,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","watching south korean dramas ,culture seeping into korea ,south korean pop culture ,korean culture seeping ,korean culture seeping into","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'North ’s', 'north korean', 'North Koreans', 'south korean']",14,"[ 1.          2.          1.         ... -0.19060008  0.90817416

The Afternoon School for the Gifted, or Youngjae-oh in Korean, is an education center that is a key player in the development of education for the gifted. Since its establishment in 2003, Youngjae-oh has come up with numerous educational materials and programs for children’s brain development, based on its study of the field. The materials developed by Youngjae-oh are popular among mothers and educators. Currently, about 37,000 children learn from the materials developed by Youngjae-oh, which focuses on raising the self-directed learning capabilities of children. One of its most popular programs is the 8Bastket program, which aims to evenly stimulate eight parts of the brain. It helps children learn comprehensively through activities such as line drawing, Hangeul , math, mazes and fairy tales. “Wrong education methods may lead to lopsided thinking. For balanced development, it is important to make progress in all eight parts of the brain,” said Lim Seo-young, the center’s chief. The center stresses the importance of parents recognizing and responding to children who show exceptional abilities or potential. It has been making efforts to communicate with these parents and encourage them. On Sept. 10, Youngjae-oh held a charity event to donate some 270 rice sacks, along with parents, as part of its efforts to engage them. Youngjae-oh will also donate all profits from sales of the first 3,000 copies of its new book -- set to be released early next year -- to Seungil Hope Foundation’s campaign to establish a hospital dedicated to patients of the Lou Gehrig’s disease. The center will further expand its business to promote the education of the gifted and provide parents with the help they need in raising their children, Lim said.","south korean parents education ,korean parents education ,korean parents education is ,education is top priority ,children for south korean","['south korean', 'the Afternoon School for the Gifted', 'Korean']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.22021902  0.52336067

The Park Geun-hye administration has pushed for the state-issued textbooks to fix what it called predominantly ""left-leaning"" content in existing private publications and to forge a ""common understanding"" of history. Opponents said the government should not dictate the way history is written and taught.

Attocube is a startup company that develops diverse types of educational content using wooden blocks as well as IT-based smart toys.  Attocube CEO Sangtaek Han  and Executive Director Battuya Banzar of the Mongolian Association of Private Pre-school Center recently signed an MOU on the company’s entry into the Mongolian infant/toddler market. Based on the memorandum, Attocube will export approximately 1,000 sets of wooden blocks and related educational content. The company joined the economic mission sent to Mongolia in July, where it held a meeting with the Mongolian Association of Private Pre-school Center. This quickly led to local tests of educational toys and export negotiations. An Attocube spokesperson said, “One of the member kindergartens of the association is already conducting pilot classes based on our wooden blocks and workbooks.”In addition to its wooden cubes, Attocube’s educational content consists of workbooks, picture books, role-playing books, and board games. Children arrange the wooden blocks into the configurations outlined in the workbook, which are then used to create stories or engage in role-playing activities. The blocks can also be used in conjunction with board games or textbooks to promote creative thinking.To accompany its offline products, Attocube will be releasing online/offline products that can be linked to a smartphone within the first quarter of 2017. These products will involve arranging wooden blocks to re-create shapes that appear on the smart device’s screen.Attocube’s products have proven effective in promoting multi-sensory learning for children three to four years of age by stimulating the senses of sight, touch, and hearing and engaging critical thinking skills. An Attocube spokesperson said, “Through the memorandum, we now have an opportunity to establish a significant presence in the Mongolian education market, where interest in preschool education is very high. And we will continue expanding our presence in key strategic markets overseas.” Attocube receives support, including assistance with marketing, from the Gyeonggi Center for Creative Economy & Innovation in its efforts to enter foreign markets.","to enter mongolian preschool ,mongolian preschool education market ,enter mongolian preschool education ,entrance into mongolia preschool ,into mongolia preschool education","['the Mongolian Association of Private Pre - school Center', 'Sangtaek Han', 'Battuya Banzar']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42523518  0.17641051

I was pissed off, left home and traveled up to Seoul with a friend,” she said, whose biological parents divorced when she was 8 years old. Having grown up in a small city in North Gyeongsang Province, Kim and her friend had no money, no one to turn to and nowhere to stay in Seoul. She ended up living on the streets. Stock image“I spent nights wandering around the city or killing time at internet cafes. We did not have money so we often skipped meals,” she said. After two months of the rough life on the streets, she sought refuge at the Geumcheon center. “I could not stand life on the streets any longer,” said Kim, who recently returned to her family after a one-year stay at the shelter. “It was fun to participate in various activities. I even learned to play musical instruments, make coffee and bake bread.” There are 119 such shelters across the country, funded by the Ministry of Gender and Family and local municipalities. They provide vulnerable teenagers with accommodation, food and counseling services for up to three years. Designed to help them safely return home and lead law-abiding lives, the centers also offer the juveniles job training, education on how to quit smoking and have safe sex as well as opportunities to participate in cultural activities, such as watching movies or theatrical performances.In the first half of this year, 14,221 teenagers stayed at state-run shelters. Last year, the facilities housed 25,012 youngsters.“One of the major reasons for kids to run away from home is family dissolution. Especially in the process of parents getting divorced and shifting responsibility for raising children, their kids grow mentally unstable and end up running away from home,” said Choi Eun-young, a head counselor at the Geumcheon center. Police data put the number of teen runaways at 11,383 as of June 2016. But, the actual number might be higher than reported, she added.“As teen runaways are desperate to get money, feed themselves and belong somewhere, they often put up with being exploited and underpaid,” she said. “They are often lured into crimes, such as theft or sex trade.”Many of the teenagers who left home choose to live in a “runaway family,” the term they use to describe a group of runaways who meet in internet chat rooms and develop relationships based on committing crimes together.Girls are more vulnerable, Cho went on, as they are often forced into selling sex. According to a survey of 92 runaway teen girls in Daejeon, 38 percent said they had worked as prostitutes. About half, or 48.6 percent, of them said they started at ages 14-16. Asked who had brokered the sex, 31.4 percent said an older or younger acquaintance, followed by friends at 31 percent and themselves at 17.1 percent.Yang Ye-seul, 16, who is set to return home at the end of this year, was one of the girls who turned to prostitution while living on the streets.“I ran away because of my stepfather. I stayed in my friend’s house in Seoul after I left home,” she said, with her eyes fixed on her phone. Yang, whose biological parents are also divorced, was caught selling sex to adults and received probation from the court. Yang came to the shelter because the court determined her parents were not able to protect her. “My life here has been okay. The relationship with my family got better.”“In most cases, it is not children’s fault that they run away. Most of the children end up on the streets because they are neglected at home and school,” said the counsellor Choi. “What runaway children need is continued care, love and trust from society.”“The government should help parents to fix their relationships with their runaway kids and not to give up on them,” she said. “Parents need to change too -- as much as their misbehaving children.”Former runaway Kim was recently accepted into a university in her hometown and will begin to study social welfare in March.“I am so happy. I feel rewarded. My father is proud of me. My only wish was to live like an ordinary person, like a salaried worker,” she said. “Having gone through all this, I want to become a social worker and help other children not to be like me.”By Ock Hyun-ju","teen runaways she descr ,female teen runaways she ,female teen runaways ,for female teen runaways ,teen runaways she","['Kim Young - eun', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58558559  0.18333358

Nearly 3.4 million poultry had been culled as of Monday morning. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, some 2.5 million chickens, 790,000 ducks and 71,000 quails have been slaughtered nationwide as part of the quarantine, after nearly 70 farms were confirmed or suspected of having avian influenza, or bird flu, outbreaks.Most of the ducks were culled at farms in Eumseong and Jincheon in North Chungcheong Province, two of the hardest hit areas. Those two places account for more than half the farm ducks in North Chungcheong Province.So far, 69 farms in seven cities and provinces have confirmed H5N6 cases since Nov. 16, when the H5N6 strain of bird flu was first reported at a chicken farm in Haenam, South Jeolla Province. A reed field in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, is burned on Monday as part of the quarantine authorities’ attempt to contain and eliminate the H5N1 virus, a highly contagious strain of bird flu believed to be carried by wild birds. Over the weekend, a chicken farm in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, also tested positive for the highly pathogenic strain of the virus. It was the first time the virus outbreak had been confirmed in Gangwon Province, since the outbreak was mostly reported in towns by the west coast and throughout Gyeonggi Province.The Gyeongsang provinces remain unaffected by the virus, but experts warn it is just a matter of time until it spreads there.Farmers worry the damage is so widespread it may have a lasting impact on the nation‘s poultry business. “Even if the authorities have the situation under control, the economic damage is already too severe to calculate. It will take a long period of time for the region to recover,” a farmer said. According to the ministry’s emergency guideline for bird flu outbreaks, the movement of stockbreeders at flu-hit poultry farms is banned for 30 days after they complete the slaughtering process of affected poultry. In 2014, when the country’s worst bird flu outbreaks hit North Chungcheong Province, the movement ban was lifted 88 days after the first virus case was detected. Nearly 1.8 million poultry were culled.

Compared to their peers, this group also showed a higher level of satisfaction in their quality of life and relationships with children, made fewer visits to hospitals and scored higher in cognitive ability tests. They also believed they had better psychological and physical health, the study found. The research team noted that raising grandchildren for too long could lead to a deterioration in the physical health of the grandparents, as the number of hospital visits they made went up in tandem with the cohabitation time. However, their life satisfaction and cognitive ability levels stayed high. Those who were not living in the same house as their grandchildren but were helping to raise them on a regular basis did not show the same improvements in psychological or physical health, the team said. “One reason could be that this group of grandparents have limited opportunities to create bonds with their grandchildren compared to the ones who live with them,” the researchers said in the study. When grandparents are too old or have a low level of cognitive ability to deal with everyday tasks, they did not show any improvement in health even if they lived with their grandchildren, they added. The study was based on a survey of some 8,500 South Koreans aged over 45 from 2008-2014.By Kim Da-sol","grandparents are happier healthier ,with grandchildren study grandparents ,grandparents are happier ,grandchildren study grandparents who ,their grandchildren and help","['Ahn Tae - hyun', 'Sogang University']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.16578782  0.34534395

Protesters are attaching flower stickers to the police buses blocking off access to Cheong Wa Dae. The stickers appeared last week, paid for through arts crowdfunding site 7Pictures. The stickers were artist Lee Gang-hun’s idea to resist the police by turning the wall of buses into a “wall of flowers.”After last week’s protest, some protesters volunteered to remove them again. Korean National Police Agency chief Lee Chul-sung said he would tolerate the use of flower stickers, citing the title of a book – ""Don’t Hit People, Even With a Flower.""  7:50 p.m. In Gwanghwamun, the heart of Seoul, over 1 million South Koreans are waving candles and singing along to legendary folk singer Yang Hee-eun’s “Morning Dew,” as the fifth massive weekend rally against President Park Geun-hye reaches its climax.

Professors for Democracy organized the rally for professors across the nation, who have until now only been taking part in protests as individuals.  “Adding professors’ voices to calls to oust President Park Geun-hye would help the general public significantly,” said Yoo Yong-tae, a history education professor at Seoul National University. “What causes this huge number of people to take to the street is that the president has been negligent of her duties and committed criminal acts.”A group of SNU professors held the flag of the country’s most prestigious university in protest against the president.The professors group will demand Park’s immediate resignation, the nomination of a new prime minister and the disbandment of the Saenuri Party, according to Yoon.Yoo also said that the government’s push for revising history textbooks should be immediately scrapped, calling it “fake.”He also criticized the closed-door agreement on the exchange of confidential military information between Korea and Japan. “The Park government has no authority to handle diplomatic issues now. It was an absurd agreement,” he said.3:30 p.m. Pro-Park protesters wave the national flags at a rally in Daegu on Saturday afternoon. Staunch supporters of President Park Geun-hye rallied at Seoul and the southern city of Daegu from 1 p.m. to counter today’s anti-Park protests across the country.

The Korea Peasants League started a protest outside Seoul City Hall at 2 p.m. They were unable to take their tractors past the Yangjae Interchange in Southern Seoul and had to leave them in a side street before heading into central Seoul. The association had come to Seoul in various farming vehicles from different rural areas across the country, taking some of them more than 10 days to get to the capital in some cases.Korea Peasants League Chairman Kim Young-ho criticized the government’s agricultural policies, including those concerning the rice market, but added that his association had broader concerns today.“The government has exploited farmers and laborers for decades, divided the country into two and used the division for their political agenda. We are farming history now. We are not just here to talk about raising rice prices. We are writing, farming a new history,” he said.2:38 p.m.Former Democratic Party of Korea leader Moon Jae-in shields composer Kim Hyeong-seok at a ""piano rally"" in Hongdae.Opposition politician and potential presidential candidate Moon Jae-in was in Hongdae just now, speaking at a piano concert organized as a precursor event to the main candlelight vigil in Gwanghwamun in the evening. Between piano performances by composer Kim Hyeong-sok and citizens, he criticized President Park’s actions, saying she must be “on another planet” to be thinking the way she does. “The president’s chief of staff said that the president is working from morning to night, so wherever she is, she is at her workplace,"" he said. “Is that acceptable? If she is playing golf, are the golf links her place of work? Even apart from the missing 7 hours on the day of the Sewol’s sinking, she has been absent from work many times.”2:32 p.m.A protester shields against the sleet as he holds up an anti-Park Geun-hye placard. People are gathering here and there at Gwanghwamun Square, but there are not many of them so far. All of them are wearing hats or raincoats and it is difficult to move about comfortably because of the weather.2:06 p.m.It is sleeting now in central Seoul, which could have an impact on protest attendance. The weather is 2 degrees Celsius, with large flakes coming down fairly heavily. The snow is expected to continue until the evening, with the temperatures expected to remain largely the same.Elsewhere, it is 5 degrees Celsius and raining in Gwangju and rain is expected later in other southern cities with protests planned, including Daegu and Busan. Children hold up placards reading ""Park Geun-hye, Resign!"" in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul on Saturday. Up to 2 million people are expected to protest across the country today to call on President Park Geun-hye to step down. This is the fifth week of major protests against the president, which were sparked by revelations surrounding the president’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Choi is alleged to have meddled in state affairs, used her connections to gain improper college admission for her daughter, and pressured companies into donating to funds which she is then suspected of using for her own personal gain.Protest organizers expect 1.5 million people to gather in Seoul’s Gwanghwamun area and half a million more in other parts of the country.","million south koreans took ,daughter into prestigious university ,editing key presidential spe ,of million south koreans ,million south koreans","['South Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Choi']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68465608  0.46034363

""Rising youth unemployment rates and higher rent discouraged young couples from deciding to tie the knot.""Meanwhile, the September number of divorces and deaths gained 3.4 percent and 3.3 percent to 9,100 and 22,100 from a year earlier, respectively, the data showed.Coupled with rapid aging, the low birth rate has been regarded as one of the biggest threats to the South Korean economy as it leads to a reduced workforce and increased welfare costs, undermining the growth potential of Asia's fourth-largest economy.The latest census data showed that people aged over 65 years made up 13.2 percent of all 51 million citizens last year. Nations become an ""aged society"" when the demographic reaches 14 percent.The country's fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, has hovered around 1.2 in recent years, despite the government's constant efforts to encourage people to have more children.","korea fell 10 months ,childbirths fall for 10th ,marriages also fell percent ,south korea fell 10 ,fell 10 months in","['South Korea', 'Statistics Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71080613  0.8627947

BASH, which stands for ""Building Amazing Start-up Here,"" is an institute under Infocomm Investments that nurtures and incubates startups. It provides a 3-month-long ""accelerating"" course aimed at helping startups get off the ground and an incubating course for those selected firms for up to some 7 months. Launched about two years ago, BASH offers mentoring, offices and other support aimed at helping small but promising companies.The source told the foreign ministry's joint press corps that the North Koreans did not join the courses with their own business ideas but went through the entire process learning how to find and support promising startup companies and help them advance to the market with their final products. He remembered that the North Koreans showed enthusiasm to study and showed fast learning capability but cited lack of language skills and ability to ""translate thinking into the market"" as their major weaknesses. ""They had two problems. No. 1 was language because not many spoke English. No. 2 was their ability to translate their thinking into the market,"" he said.

In 2015, there were 10.96 million women with jobs, up more than 205,000 from the year before and significantly higher than the 9.52 million employed in 2005.Starting in 2013, the number of women finding work exceeded that of men.""In effect, despite the passage of time and greater role of women in the workplace, the difference in how long a woman stays at her job vis-a-vis a man remained fixed at 2.1-2.2 years,"" KEIS said.It said child bearing and taking care of the family, as well as greater emphasis on women managing domestic duties despite being employed, is forcing many to leave work.Analysis also showed that while men generally stayed longer at a job after passing 40 and into their 50s, the reverse was true for women.On average a male worker between 50-54 stayed at his job for 9.4 years, while the corresponding number for women stood at four years. This number is even lower for women between 35-39, which stood at 4.6 years.Yoon Jeong-hye, a KEI researcher, said that while state policy has helped women become more involved in work, disruptions in their careers are causing many to quit. This, she said, could lead to lower job security for women as a whole, which needs to be addressed.","korean women on average ,affecting women careers data ,data south korean women ,women careers data south ,women careers data","['south korean', 'the Korea Employment Information Service']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.97076547  0.42358321

The proportion of male students who did so was 15.7 percent in 2009 and the proportion for female students was 5.4 percent in the same year. Reasons for not exercising included not having time , not wanting to sweat  and not having people to work out with . The report also showed that 1 in 3 teenagers have tried losing weight within a month. About 17 percent said that they tried losing weight by skipping meals or taking weight-loss supplements that do not require a doctor’s prescription. This proportion went up by 1.1 percentage points from the previous year. “These key findings from the report underlines South Korean’s changing diet, while early diagnoses of childhood and adolescent obesity and chronic diseases have also become necessary,” said professor Kang Jae-hon from Seoul Paik Hospital, who participated in the study.

These are the key findings of the annual Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to be released Monday by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This year’s report has revealed some worrying trends in Koreans’ overall lifestyle and diet patterns. Obesity has increased markedly for men, found the report, particularly among those aged 30-39. The male obesity rate stood at 39.7 percent in 2015, a 5 percentage point increase from a decade ago. For those in their 30s, the figure increased from 38.1 percent to 43.6 percent over the 10-year period. For women, the obesity rate fell slightly from 27.3 percent in 2005 to 26 percent in 2015.  Forty-one percent of Koreans “walk regularly” --- walking five days a week for at least 30 minutes per day and more than 10 minutes at a time. A decade ago, the ratio was 60.7 percent. As for alcohol consumption, more than half of Korean men are heavy drinkers, which are defined by drinking more than seven glasses of soju at one sitting at least once a month for the past year. For women, the bar is lower at five glasses of soju, and the survey showed that 23.2 percent of them belong to this category.  The number of female heavy drinkers have been growing, but the 23.2 percent of 2015 is a new record. It also marks an increase of 6 percentage points from a decade ago. The smoking rate among men dropped to a record low in 2015, dipping below 40 percent for the first time. About 39.3 percent of Korean men aged 19 or older were smokers last year, down 3.8 percentage points from the previous year’s 43.1 percent. That marks the lowest level since the data began to be complied in 1998.  The male smoking rate has been declining since peaking at 66.3 percent in 1998. The number fell below 50 percent by 2007 and continued to fall, reaching 42.1 percent in 2013. The exception was 2014 when it rebounded to 43.1 percent.  The percentage of teenage smokers has also declined, dropping from 14.3 percent in 2005 to hit 9.6 percent in 2015 -- the first time it recorded a figure below 10 percent. “The decline in the numbers of male and teenage smokers are attributable to anti-smoking policies such as expanding non-smoking areas and raising cigarette prices,” the Health Ministry explained. The male smoking rate includes those who have smoked more than five packs or 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and are still smoking. For teenagers, the rate is calculated by counting those who have smoked at least once in the recent month.By Jo He-rim","33 of koreans obese ,koreans are obese record ,obese 23 of women ,south koreans are obese ,koreans obese 23 of","['South Koreans', 'Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'the Center for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Koreans']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85802436  0.81838596

South Korean men's average life span is 78 years, 11.7 years longer than their counterparts in North Korea.The longevity gap began to appear in 1990, which the report attributed to North Korea's bout with floods, a series of natural disasters that caused food shortages and economic troubles, as well as dilapidated medical services.  In 1965, South Korean women lived an average 57.6 years, not far different from 54.6 years for North Korean women. The difference narrowed for some time until it widened again to 3.3 years in 1990, after which the gap grew bigger, the report said.In the case of men, South Koreans lived an average 52.3 years in 1965 compared with 48.4 years for North Koreans, a difference of3.9 years. The gap became bigger starting in the 1980s, it said.The report cites estimates from Statistics Korea to predict that the lifespan difference will remain at close to 10 years until 2060. By that year, South Korean women will live for 92.1 years compared with 81.6 years for North Korean women, it said. South Korean men will have an average life span of 86 years compared with 76.1 years for North Korean males.""The difference in longevity between South and North Korea is much bigger than that for East and West Germany before their unification,"" Cho Kyoung-soo, who authored the report, said.

But a new, more efficient method has emerged: Facebook. Liberal and conservative politicians alike now rely on social media to broadcast their thoughts on issues ranging from nuclear armament to economic policies. According to data from the Assembly’s Research Service released in August, among the 253 lawmakers directly elected to represent constituencies in April’s general election, 9 out of 10 incumbents used Facebook during the election campaign. “One of the strengths of Facebook is that it allows politicians to promote their views regardless of time and place,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a senior researcher at Opinion Live, a Seoul-based political consulting firm. “It helps attract a lot of feedback and prompts media to reproduce their messages.”Moon Jae-in‘s facebook page Spearheading the trend are presidential hopefuls seeking to raise their political profiles by distancing themselves from partisan tit-for-tat at the legislative body and weighing in on contentious issues with more measured and informed tones. Moon Jae-in, a standard-bearer of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, is one of the most Facebook-savvy politicians. Most recently, the former presidential candidate wrote an article on his Facebook account urging President Park Geun-hye to temporarily halt the procedure for deploying a US advanced missile system. His critical comments about the government’s decision to install the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery here attracted 3,457 likes as of Wednesday afternoon and has been covered extensively by major media outlets. “We prefer communicating via Facebook,” an official working at Moon’s office told The Korea Herald requesting anonymity. “Public statements or press releases are only available to media outlets. But Facebook can reach out to the general public and draw various feedback.”The king of Facebook politics is undoubtedly Seoul Mayor Park won-soon, whose account has been updated on an almost daily basis and contains clips featuring social events sometimes broadcasted by himself. The activist-turned-politician is also said to attract the biggest number of Twitter followers among local politicians. As of Wednesday, his account has gained some 1.65 million followers and, according to the Seoul city government, the number is bigger than any other politician in South Korea. The popularity of Facebook extends to conservative politicians in the ruling Saenuri Party and centrist lawmakers in opposition parties, such as 76-year-old former Minjoo Party leader Rep. Kim Chong-in who created his account in August and vowed to “communicate boundlessly” using the platform.The ruling Saenuri Party’s former leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung as well as its former floor leaders -- Reps. Yoo Seong-min and Won Yu-chul -- have updated their Facebook accounts with posts about their daily lives and observation on contentious issues. But social networks do not always work in favor of the politicians using them. When being offered without proper context, their messages have often thrusted the politicians into the center of controvery.For instance, the third-biggest People’s Party former leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo drew criticism for what critics viewed as an “insensitive” comment on Twitter about the death of a subway worker in June. He said, “The worker would have found a less dangerous job, if he had had more leisure time.”For such reasons, South Korea’s politicians prefer social media that target selected audiences who “like” their Facebook accounts or share their thoughts via mobile messengers, rather than Twitter, where messages are often widely available to the public, experts said. “Twitter as a political platform has been somewhat corrupted in South Korea,” said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy. “Outside of energizing their staunch supporters or informing  events, Twitter does not do much justice to election campaigns.” The trend offers a stark contrast to the 2016 US election campaign during which Twitter has been one of the most favorite platforms used by both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates -- Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Analyst Yoon attributed the difference to South Korea having a less diverse spectrum of voters and constituencies than the US, geographically and demographically. “In South Korea, short messages like Twitter are not as effective for the election campaign as Facebook,” he said. In the meantime, social media’s influence on politics is expected to grow, as more and more people use online platforms to get information about politicians’ positions. The censorship of such platforms has also been gradually lifted. The Constitutional Court ruled in 2011 that election campaigning that uses social networks or other online platforms does not violate the election law, which forbids candidate from campaigning from six months before Election Day until the official opening of the campaign period.

The participants were from various provinces across the North, aged between 28-80, and had jobs such as laborer, doctor, homemaker, factory worker, cook and sauna worker.CSIS did not provide further details, including who conducted the survey and when.The key findings are that North Koreans know they do not live in a socialist paradise, they no longer rely on the public distribution system and they express ""the most animosity toward the government when it undercuts their entrepreneurial activities,"" CSIS said in a report. stock image ""The results of the poll are telling. Respondents' discontent with the regime was evidenced by their very negative responses to the question 'Does the public distribution system provide you with what you want for a good life?' Zero of 36 respondents indicated that they currently receive enough through the public distribution system to maintain a good life,"" it said.Given the growing significance of market activities in the lives of North Koreans, it is not surprising that ""anger over government predation of market activities and individuals' entrepreneurial efforts to better their lives was prevalent,"" the report said. In particular, many respondents said the regime's 2009 currency reform ""caused them to feel the greatest animosity toward the regime."" Under the currency reform, the North put a limit on the amount of money citizens can exchange for new bills, rendering the excess cash worthless. ""From the voices of North Koreans themselves, for the first time, we hear them saying their system does not work for regular citizens,"" the report said. ""Through reliance on the North Korean system alone, these citizens are not able to achieve their standards for a good life.North Koreans are angered when the regime interferes with the people's entrepreneurial efforts to improve their lives on their own,"" it said.","korean residents shows animosity ,rare survey of korean ,survey of korean residents ,entrepreneurial activities rare survey ,of north koreans living","['North Koreans', 'North Koreans', 'US', 'the Center for Strategic and', 'North Kore']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82098043  0.43037933

Kim Joong-ro, a former Army general, said that based on data submitted by the Military Manpower Administration, 17,229 Korean men subjected to compulsory military duty lost or rescinded their nationality from 2012 to July this year.Among them, 15,569 forfeited their Korean nationality by acquiring a different nationality through long-term residency overseas.Some 1,660 were those that had held dual citizenship and later decided to choose the foreign nationality before they turned 18. Most of them were those who were born in a foreign country while their parents were residing there for studies or work. Kim did not reveal any corresponding statistics of Korean women who renounced their citizenship.Most, or 8,747 of former Korean nationals, chose citizenship in the US, followed by 3,077 in Japan and 3,007 in Canada.Kim explained that 31 of them were related to some 27 high-ranking public officials. “Those who are able to stay overseas long-term such as by studying abroad generally means that they have parents that can financially support them. ... It is also a big problem that polarization occurs in terms of serving the military,” Kim said.He added that men who evade the military service by relinquishing their Korean nationality must receive stricter re-entry qualification and restrictions on their economic activities here.There has been constant debate here by those advocating the necessity of stronger implementation of military service in a country that remains technically at war with North Korea. They are challenged by those who underscore the right to choose one’s nationality and a more flexible ethical measure on those that acquired dual citizenship due to their parents serving the country overseas. In a different report also released Monday, Kim said that there were 92 high-ranking officials out of 2,520 public servants with grade 4 and above who were exempted from the military service and who also had their sons avoid military service.These officials held influential positions, including lawmakers, senior judges, chief prosecutors, diplomats, educators and deans of universities, he said.“We must delve into the situation where news of high-ranking officials and their children being exempted from the military service continuously frustrate the general public,” Kim said.South Korea began its compulsory military system for men from 1951 upon the outbreak of the Korean War .Recently, some lawmakers and opinion leaders such as Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pill have reproached the agenda of introducing a voluntary military system, but they are opposed by those that argue it is premature at a time of intensified cross-border tension.Proponents of the voluntary system contends that a change is needed in preparation for the population decline, such as by providing the soldiers with monthly pay of around 2 million won  and increased benefits.Opponents such as former Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min counter that such a system would create a wider gap among different income groups, with most of the voluntary conscripts being those from lower-income households The military currently plans to reduce the 630,000-strong force to 520,000 by 2022.The wait list of military service has been protracting in recent years as young men choose to serve in light of an aggravating job market. As of 2015, some 52,000 men aged between 18 and 40 are currently on the waiting list to enter the military after passing their physical examinations.While reports vary, North Korea is said to have a force 1.2 million strong through its selective obligatory military system that also applies to women, with the service period ranging from nine to 13 years.","men drop nationality annually ,drop nationality annually lawmaker ,400 korean men drop ,annually lawmaker over 400 ,korean men drop nationality","['korean', 'People ’s Party', 'Kim Joong - ro', 'Army', 'the Military Manpower Administration', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23381078  0.25192487

The FKI, the largest business lobby in South Korea, represents the top 600 companies here.The employers' organization argued people's ill feelings toward labor strikes partly stemmed from their belief that unionized workers are only after looking out for their own interests.For instance, 43.2 percent of those surveyed said labor unions and their efforts to protect their vested interests were partly responsible for the high unemployment rate of the young, compared with 23.7 percent who said labor unions had little to do with the youth jobless rate.The survey was conducted on 700 people aged 19 years or older.The unemployment rate for young people aged between 15 and 29 years came to 9.2 percent in July, down from 10.3 percent the previous month but still much higher than 3.5 percent for the entire workforce.Those surveyed especially expressed their opposition against some labor unions and unionized workers who are allowed to pick their own successors in what is known as job inheritance.When asked about problems caused by labor unions, 32.4 percent cited job inheritance as the most serious problem while 27.6 percent pointed to violent labor strikes.""A majority of the people hold a negative view against massive labor strikes as the country's economy faces difficulties at home and abroad.

Gukbap According to the traditional Korean food serving protocol, which sets rice and soup in separate bowls along with other side dishes, the single-pot gukbap may be belittled as a lesser meal.But thanks to its convenience, gukbap has long been a staple for merchants in market places, for travelers stopping over at inns and for farmers looking for a quick, full meal after a hard day’s work. It also made life easier for the sellers as all they had to do was boil a full pot and scoop out a bowl upon individual orders.The first official record of gukbap traces back to the Joseon Dynasty , though its actual history is presumed to go back further, possibly to the era of the Three States in the 4th-7th century.The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, the official history compiled by the royal house, describes common people gathering at their neighborhood inn at the end of the day to eat a bowl of gukbap, perhaps with some makgeolli.In an agricultural society where meat, especially beef, was rare, the ingredients used were mainly vegetables such as dried radish leaves or cabbages.Some claim that the gukbap format derived from seolleongtang, a stock soup made by boiling cow bones and stew meat, which presumably originated in the Shilla Dynasty  to last up to this day.The story is that kings performed ancestral rites at altars called “seonnongdan” and pulled a plow at a nearby field, in a gesture to encourage farming. During the ceremony, a cow was offered as a sacrifice and then used to boil the soup to feed the numerous participants.The ingredients and format of gukbap have changed greatly over time and are different in each region, reflecting the living environment of the people.The pork gukbap, one of the signature dishes in Busan, is a result of such alterations, according to experts.“During the Korean War, a majority of refugees fled to the southern port city of Busan, where they used local ingredients to recreate the food from back home,” said Hong Shin-ae, a cuisine researcher.“The pork gukbap quickly settled in the community as it was an easily accessible meal for homeless refugees, as well as a cheap meat treat for ordinary people.“By Bae Hyun-jung","hot pot of soup ,certain that rice soup ,instinctively crave hot pot ,that rice soup ,when hungover most koreans","['Koreans', 'Korea', 'Gukbap']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05035487  0.42224437

Among them, 81.9 percent were women, while 89.9 percent were nondrinkers. Only 9.1 percent were either drinking heavily or had done so in the past.The researchers noted that part of the reason could be that the proportion of Korean female heavy drinkers in general is significantly smaller than male heavy drinkers. Last year for instance, only 6 percent of all Korean women aged 20 or older said they were drinking heavily -- defined as drinking more than five glasses of alcohol weekly. On the other hand, 20.7 percent of all Korean men said they were heavy drinkers.123rfThe study also found that elderly heavy drinkers tend to detect their dementia symptoms early.The researchers said this could be due to how for elderly Koreans, being a drinker often indicates the person is socially active, as most social gatherings in Korea often involve alcohol.“Drinking is an indicator of social interaction ,” researchers wrote in the study. “As activities of drinking can include certain cognitive tasks and social interactions, patients who never drank may have a delay in medical attention until the disease becomes much more serious.”In 2014, the Health Ministry has announced that a heavy drinker is 7.42 times more likely to develop dementia than a person who does not drink. The ministry has been discouraging the public from drinking, in its effort to decrease the number of future dementia patients, by banning alcohol sales and drinking at university campuses.The study by Konkuk University, however, suggested that nondrinkers in Korea may be more vulnerable to the particular disease not because they do not consume alcohol, but because they are more likely to be socially isolated. Its research findings showed that a large portion of the surveyed patients had other tendencies of “social outsiders.” The study did not delve into the medical correlation between alcohol consumption and dementia.For example, 91.9 percent of them were physically inactive, and 67.1 percent were either not religious or not engaged in any physical religious activities, such as going to church on weekends.A government report last year also showed that 80 percent of elderly Koreans are known to spend their leisure time solely watching TV at home.“Factors that are associated with being a social outsider, such as nondrinking, physical inactivity and religious inactivity were the barriers to timely access to health care services,” the researchers wrote in the study. “For one, participating in religious activities requires social interaction and strategies that involve executive functioning -- such as problem solving, reasoning and attentional control. Those who are not involved in such social activities have a lower chance of realizing their symptoms as being alone and inactive does not involve such functioning.”While social isolation was found to be a major cause of late detection of the disease, the study found another paradoxical point: elderly individuals who live alone had a much lower risk of late detection of dementia than those who live with their family members.“Elderly patients who live alone are required to perform all of their daily activities and chores on their own. This makes it easier for them to detect dementia symptoms early as even a subtle cognitive decline could make their lives difficult when they have no one to rely on,” the researchers wrote in the study.“However, those who live with their family members are often dependent on their family members, even for very simple and basic chores. This also has to do with Korea’s tradition of respecting the elderly and adult children being obligated to do all the chores for them when their parents become old. This can also lead to physical inactivity which can cause late detection of the disease.” By Claire Lee","most dementia patients ,most dementia patients are ,south korea elderly patients ,research on 554 patients ,korea elderly patients with","['South Korea ’s', 'Konkuk University Medical Center ’s']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48098552  0.41218537

According to their research findings, 42 percent of all teenage mothers made four or fewer prenatal visits to medical clinics throughout their pregnancies. Also, 14.4 percent of them never received any pregnancy check-ups or screenings. The numbers were significantly different from mothers in their 20s and older. Only 11.6 percent of them made 4 or fewer prenatal visits, while only 3 percent made no visits to medical clinics. A baby box installed by a church to help protect abandoned babies in South Korea. A total of 3.7 percent of all teen mothers experienced premature deliveries, which was much higher than the proportion of mothers in their 20s and older who had the same experience -- which was 1.3 percent In South Korea, pregnant women in general are recommended to make about 13 to 15 visits for checkups during their pregnancies. Lee Seung-mi, one of the researchers for the study, wrote that not receiving any prenatal checkups can increase a woman’s risk to a number of conditions, including preterm deliveries. At least 50 percent of premature births are preventable if a woman receives prenatal care, she added. “Prenatal visits are also important because they are almost the only way for women get diagnosed if they have any pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.”Preterm births among teen mothers are also common in other countries. A 2010 study published by an UK-based scientific journal found that pregnant women aged 14-17 are at higher risk of preterm births and having babies with low birth weight -- especially if they are having their second baby while still a teen. “It is possible that the increased risk of poor pregnancy outcome is related to biological immaturity,” professor Louise Kenny, consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist at Cork University Maternity Hospital in Ireland was quoted as saying in Science Daily. “It is also possible that the increased risk of poor pregnancy outcome in the second teenage pregnancy is related to numerous complicating factors such as greater social deprivation and less prenatal care.”Unwed motherhood and teenage pregnancies are still largely considered taboo here. On record, the country’s out-of-wedlock birth rate in 2010 is 2.1 percent, significantly lower than the rate in countries such as Norway  and Ireland . Lee said many teenage mothers are unwed parents, and those who never receive medical prenatal care are those who are forced to keep their pregnancies a secret.An NGO advocating for youth rights have reported a number of human rights violations against teenage mothers, including forced adoption, being disowned by the parents, as well as coerced abortion procedures. A 2009 study by Studies on Korean Youth, which surveyed a total of 15 Korean teenage unwed mothers, also showed that more than half of the women were either thinking of or had already given up their children for adoption, because they did not have enough social and financial support. Also, 86 percent of them ran away from home, and all of them were raised by low-income households.Lee said all mothers deserve to receive appropriate prenatal care regardless of their age and marital status. “Pregnancy complications can lead to fatal outcomes without appropriate care and diagnosis,” she wrote. “It’s extremely important to provide both education and care for young pregnant women who are at risk.”By Claire Lee","south korea pregnant teenagers ,mothers neglected in prenatal ,premature babies than mothers ,teen mothers neglected ,korea pregnant teenagers do","['South Korea ’s', 'SMG', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68451607  0.1835814

36,36,36,‘Majority of female doctors pressured not to get pregnant',"About 70 percent of South Korean female resident physicians, as well as 40 percent of women nurses are pressured not to get pregnant by their employers to minimize the number of workers on maternity leave, a report by a local human rights watchdog showed Monday. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea said it is issuing recommendations to the Ministry of Health and Welfare as well as the Ministry of Employment ...","About 70 percent of South Korean female resident physicians, as well as 40 percent of women nurses are pressured not to get pregnant by their employers to minimize the number of workers on maternity leave, a report by a local human rights watchdog showed Monday. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea said it is issuing recommendations to the Ministry of Health and Welfare as well as the Ministry of Employment and Labor to improve working conditions for female health care workers to prevent human rights violations against them, including pressure to avoid pregnancies and sexual harassment. The proposal also recommends all employers provide education on gender equality and human rights to health care workers. 123rfAccording to the watchdog’s report, which surveyed 130 female health care workers, including nurses and resident physicians last year, 71 percent of resident physicians and 40 percent of nurses said they were unable to make family plans as they are constantly pressured by co-workers and superiors not to get pregnant. The report also showed that at some medical institutions, there is an unspoken rule that female workers cannot get pregnant at the same time. Everyone in each team is given their own “turn” to get pregnant, and those who become pregnant “by mistake” face constant workplace harassment, the report showed.In one case, a female health care professional suffered a miscarriage after working many shifts while keeping her pregnancy a secret. Kim Jin-hee , a female resident physician at a general hospital, said there is no such rule that one has to wait for her turn to get pregnant at her workplace. But everyone in her team shares the opinion that becoming pregnant while a resident physician is simply “selfish behavior.”“It has to do with the system. When a resident physician goes on maternity leave, her employer does not hire someone to fill the space . Her teammates have to fill in for her,” she said. “And it’s like that at every hospital. I think in rural areas it has to do with labor shortage. But in most big hospitals in the metropolitan area, I think it’s just employers trying to save labor costs.”Kim said that recently one of her teammates had to take three months off because she was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Three of her colleagues, including herself, had to cover her colleague’s duties.“It was hard for all of us. Nothing will change unless the government pressures educational institutions and hospitals to train and hire more nurses and physicians.”South Korea has universal health insurance and nearly all citizens are beneficiaries of the program. Yet the state-run National Health Insurance Service has been experiencing significant deficits since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Private health care providers’ overtreatment -- to get more coverage by a third-party public or private insurance payer -- as well as a shortage of health care professionals have been often highlighted as major causes of NHIS deficits and medical accidents.  Previous studies have shown that resident physicians are often abused and exploited in the current system, regardless of gender. According to a study by the Korean Intern Resident Association, which surveyed 1,912 intern and resident physicians in 2014, health care professionals on average only slept 5.4 hours a day, and worked 93 hours per week. They also on average only took 8.3 days off every year. Also, 61.5 percent of intern physicians and 44.4 percent of resident physicians said they have been verbally abused at their workplaces at least once by their professors, senior colleagues and patients. The report also showed that almost 50 percent of the surveyed physicians nearly made medical mistakes due to physical fatigue and sleep deprivation, while 79 percent of them could not help dozing off during shifts. “I don’t think the current system is safe for both physicians in training and patients,” said Kim. “We are often told that the training must be tough so we can be prepared for the worst medical situations. But no medical training should put patients at risk.”By Claire Lee","korean female resident physicians ,female doctors pressured ,majority of female doctors ,women nurses are pressured ,of female doctors pressured","['south korean', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare', 'the Ministry of Employment']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.40759802  0.22781885

According to the report released by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, which surveyed 2,000 Koreans aged 15 or over, Koreans on average drank 4.9 cups of beer  and 6.1 shots of soju, a popular grain-based liquor, at a time in the first half of this year.These findings are a slight decrease compared to 2013 when the average beer intake was 5.6 cups and 6.4 shots of soju per person. The intake of fruit-based drinks with low alcohol content rose from 2.2 shots per person to 6 shots on the back of growing popularity of lighter alcoholic drinks.Since early last year, leading alcohol manufacturers such as Lotte Chilsung and its rival Muhak have rolled out a series of fruity soju products containing 14 percent alcohol, which is lower than the usual 20 percent.The proportion of heavy drinkers also fell, which the ministry saw as an indicator of the social move towards a healthy drinking culture.Of the surveyed, 58.3 percent showed a pattern of high-risk alcohol consumption by downing more than 8.8 shots of soju for men and 5.9 shots for women, a drop from 82.5 percent in 2013. While 55.8 percent of the surveyed said that they drank “soju bombs,” soju mixed with beer, in 2013 the figure shrank to 45.7 percent this year. The report also showed that men drink 7.3 shots of soju and 5.6 cups of beer at a time, while women consume 4.2 shots of soju and 4.5 cups of beer.The World Health Organization guidelines state that drinking 5.8 shots of soju and 5.6 cups of beer for men is within the level of low-risk alcohol consumption. For women, drinking no more than 2.9 shots of soju and 2.8 cups of beer is identified as low risk. Those in their 20s were more prone to heavy drinking, with 65.2 percent falling under a category of high-risk alcohol consumption. Half of them said that they had soju bombs. In South Korea, drinking is considered crucial part of social life to bond with friends and colleagues. It is notoriously the biggest consumer of hard liquor in the world, downing 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average, according to data released by Euromonitor in 2014. An excessive alcohol consumption has led to social problems including violence, driving under the influence and health risks, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare projecting that alcohol-related social costs amount to more than 16.3 trillion won a year. According to 2014 government data, 33.9 percent of three serious crimes -- murder, rape and violence -- took place when suspects were heavily intoxicated. “Koreans are advised to drink no more than the recommended guidelines by the WHO and should be careful about drinks with lower alcohol content,” said an official from the ministry. “Especially, fruit-based soju products can be dangerous as they contain 16 to 32 percent of the recommended daily sugar intake for Koreans.” By Ock Hyun-ju","koreans on average drank ,koreans drink less hard ,less hard liquor more ,surveyed 000 koreans aged ,beer about two pints","['South Koreans', 'the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'Koreans', 'Koreans']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63357568  0.49112132

According to the survey “holiday stress,” such as nagging family members, cooking for an enormous crowd and driving long hours back to remote hometowns, makes for restless few days.The online travel agency targeted more than 1,000 Korean men and women between ages 20 and 50 on Aug. 19 and found that 50 percent of the total respondents said they have experienced “planning an alternative trip because of holiday stress.” Reasons for why they dislike the annual family-oriented holiday time vary according to age.Those in their 20s said the main reason they wanted to avoid the family reunion was because of the nagging they had to endure about job hunting and settling down. Those in their 30s said the laborious cooking bothered them the most, while those in their 40s said traffic congestion was the worst.Other popular reasons were the “financial burden” and “having to entertain the nephew.”  Every year, Koreans nationwide flock to their hometowns for the mid-autumn holiday, “Chuseok.” Men often drive the family long hours through traffic while women take up the cooking and cleaning. Older family members are expected to offer money to younger children for good fortune. Expedia’s survey showed that not many of the respondents had gone through with their alternative travel plans. Only 22 percent of the respondents actually went on an alternative trip, with the majority opting to travel domestically. The rest said they withdrew the plan because they had to show at the family gathering, or because they had failed to reserve the tickets or that they did not have money or time to spare.By Lim Jeong-yeo","50 of koreans stressed ,stressed by family holiday ,nagging family members cooking ,koreans stressed by family ,commitments half of koreans","['Koreans', 'Expedia']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44527251  0.54144001

When she filled in the resume form provided by the company, she was surprised to find that there was no need to write in a TOEIC score or any experience in overseas studies. Instead, the company asked for details about any internship at marketing firms.123rfShin’s experience reflects a shifting trend in Korea’s job market. More companies now require candidates to inform them of job-related experiences rather than information such as English proficiency that was previously considered important. According to a survey of 518 companies’ hiring managers conducted by the Ministry of Employment and Labor and Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry from June 14 to July 6, job-related abilities topped requirement categories, with about 55 percent of respondents picking it as the most important credential. Academic credentials took second place, with 34.8 percent choosing it as crucial, while internship experience was third at 28 percent, the report said. Only 11.2 and 3.1 percent of respondents said they valued overseas experience and the TOEIC score, respectively. The findings were also reflected in the hiring process of some Korea’s conglomerates. Since the first half of 2015, SK Group has not required job-seekers to describe “unrelated credentials” such as the TOEIC score and overseas studies experience. LG group has done the same thing since the second half of 2014. Private information was not required in resumes as well, the survey showed. The proportion of companies requiring blood type and height  information was 10.3 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively. In 2015, 20.5 percent needed blood type information and 24.5 percent asked for applicant’s height or weight.“I think it is a big change in the way Korean companies hire their employee,” said Uh Soo-bong, a professor at Korea University of Technology and Education, who also serves as the president of KOREA TECH graduate school’s hiring research department. But the survey also highlighted that the bigger the companies, the more diverse their resume requirements.Among companies with more than 1,000 employees, about 85 percent requested for GPA scores, while 77 percent asked about foreign language test scores and 50 percent asked about awards. On the other hand, among companies with less than 300 employees, the proportion of those that asked about GPA, language scores and awards were 54 percent, 43 percent and 28 percent respectively. “It feels like double jeopardy for the job-seekers,” said Kim Sang-hun, a 26-year college student at the Seoul-based Sungkyunkwan University. “Job-seekers feel more pressured to have professional skills on top of academic records to meet a company’s abstract standards.” Lee Keun-hwa, a 27-year-old with a bachelor’s degree in management, said that the new hiring process could also push job-seekers to fill their resume with “flamboyant but irrelevant experiences” such as a hiking experience in the Himalayas or even running fake startup companies. Professor Uh said there was a need for job recruitment to be more in sync with the actual line of work.“Most conglomerates still require job-seekers to have experience that might have nothing to do with what they would actually be doing at companies. We need to find a way to ensure better fairness in the hiring process,” he said.By Yeo Jun-suk","most college graduates my ,korean companies unlike most ,companies unlike most college ,most college graduates ,year old job seeker","['Shin Ji - min', 'english', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86425054  0.64150602

Bringing the heated debate to the Supreme Court, the Seoul city government said the ministry violated a string of laws while abruptly prohibiting the program, going beyond its authority, and asked the court to nullify the decision. It also sought a suspension of the ministry's ban on the allowances until the court rules on the case. The plan is designed to support people between the ages of 19 and 29, who have lived in the capital city for a year or more and work less than 30 hours a week. Enrolled students cannot apply for the program.The city government said it has already provided the allowance to 2,831 applicants, who have signed agreements with the metropolitan government.The central government has been opposing the plan, saying that the allowance plan does not solve the fundamental cause of the high unemployment rate and that it will only lead to more side effects, including moral hazards among young jobseekers.The unemployment rate for people aged between 15 and 29 reached 10.3 percent last month, up from May's 9.7 percent, according to the report compiled by Statistics Korea.","won 448 per month ,seoul city government filed ,jobseekers earlier this month ,thousands of young jobseekers ,500 000 won 448","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41084266  0.16124588

The study surveyed 2,383 single Koreans aged 20-44 last year. Among the surveyed men, the largest proportion of them, 32.6 percent, said ensuring job security for more workers should be included in such “marriage” policies, followed by 27.4 percent who said the government should provide funds for newlyweds for housing. 123rfAt the same time, 23 percent said the policies should focus on combating youth unemployment, while 6.5 percent said the government should come up with measures to change the nation’s wedding culture, which often requires couples’ parents to finance housing and the cost of wedding ceremonies.Most of the surveyed Korean women also felt the same way, with 28.6 percent saying the nation should tackle job security among young workers and 24.1 percent saying the country should support newlyweds struggling to find housing. Some 20.3 percent of them also said there should be government regulations against the workplace discrimination of married individuals. “It looks like for single Korean women, there are three problems when it comes to employment,” wrote Lee Sam-sik, who organized the research for the think tank. “One is potential unemployment, the second is limited job security and the third is disadvantages they face as married women both in the job market and workplace.”South Korea’s increasing number of late marriages is one of the biggest factors behind the low fertility rate, which stands at 1.21 children per women. As single parenthood, especially of unwed women, is often socially stigmatized here, Korea has one of the lowest out-of-wedlock birthrates in the world, marking 2.1 percent as of 2010. The figure is significantly lower than other countries like Ireland  and Norway . This means most Koreans do not generally have children unless they are married, but those who put off marriage have increased dramatically. More than 50 percent of Korean men born between 1976 and 1980 were single for the period 2006 to 2010, whereas only 13.9 percent of those born between 1956 and 1960 were not married at that age, according to Statistics Korea. While the youth unemployment rate has been soaring, Korean couples spent an average of 238 million won  on their wedding ceremonies in the last two years, according to wedding consulting firm Duowed. Meanwhile, the average annual income of a young university graduate and a full-time employee is 30 million won. To encourage more Koreans to get married -- and eventually boost the low fertility rate -- South Korea has been implementing a number of measures, including matchmaking services as well as state-funded “small weddings” in which couples can use public properties as wedding venues at a cost ranging from 200,000 won to 300,000 won.

According to prices and purchasing power parities, despite long working hours, South Koreans earned an average of $33,110 for the year, just 80 percent of the OECD average of $41,253.By hourly wage, workers here made $15.67 per hour, whereas the OCED average was $23.36.YonhapIn contrast, an average employee in Japan worked 394 fewer hours than the average South Korean, but made $2,670 more last year.This pattern was also found in comparison to Germany.An average worker in Germany worked 1,371 hours last year and earned $32.77 per hour.

The study, compiled by the Korean Society of Gerontological Social Welfare, surveyed 358 elderly who belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of the elderly population as well as 1,462 individuals with household income of 1 million won  or less a month.  The study found those who were wealthy and did not need financial support still felt unhappy if they were not getting contributions from their children. Meanwhile, elderly individuals with low income said their inability to financially support their grown children was one of the things that made them unhappy. 123rfChun Mi-ae, a professor at Chongshin University who organized the research, said there could be a number of reasons why the wealthy seniors felt this way. “One of the possible scenarios is that parents who don’t get any allowance from their children are more likely to have estranged relationships with their children,” Chun told The Korea Herald. “They may not be spending a lot of time with them, or not speak to them very often. Regardless of one’s income, unfulfilling relationships with grown children may make them unhappy.”Another possibility is that their grown children are not doing well financially. “So regardless of their own income status, such parents may feel bad about their children who are financially struggling,” she said. “Also, some of them may feel that their children are being ungrateful, not showing appreciation for the financial support they were given while growing up.”For the financially struggling parents, Chun said they may feel they were not fulfilling their duties as parents. “Many Korean parents still feel it is their responsibility to finance the cost of their children’s education and weddings,” she said. “Inability to do so can make one feel guilty and unhappy.”According to a report by the government-funded Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 48 percent of Korea’s elderly were living in poverty as of 2013, which is defined as earning 50 percent or less of the overall median household income. “It seems that senior Koreans’ relationships with their children are largely affected by both their own and their children’s financial situations,” Chun said. “The government should take that into account when creating policies and welfare programs for the elderly.”By Claire Lee","south korea wealthy elderly ,wealthy elderly feel unhappy ,children south korea wealthy ,korea wealthy elderly ,korea wealthy elderly feel","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korean Society of Gerontological Social Welfare']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77829194  0.01917909

Lee Jong-kul of the Minjoo Party of Korea.Since 2013, the Korean Adoption Services has been digitizing birth record documents housed by adoption agencies here. Of the 230,000 documents, only 79,653 have been digitized as of this year. Adoptees whose records are not archived by the KAS are often left with the only option of visiting the agency personally to access records. Some of them might even have no agency to visit as it might no longer be in business.Several adoptees have suggested that even if the digitizing process is completed, it may not be able to help them search for their birth families. Many adoption papers have false information, such as false names -- both the names of the child and their birth parents -- and incorrect birthdates, which make it difficult for many adoptees to reunite with their birth families. Still, Kim Eun-hee, the head of the Korean Unwed Mothers Families Association which advocates birth mothers’ rights, said digitization of the documents is crucial as it at least gives information on which agency is responsible if an adoptee finds out that his or her records were fabricated. “That’s still an important information I think,” she told The Korea Herald. “This way at least adoptees will know the very first agency that created their records, whether they are false or not.”Kristin Pak, an adoptee who is with Adoptee Solidarity Korea – a group of adopted Korean adults living and working in Korea -- agreed with Kim. She argued that some adoption agencies forged the documents to make each child “adoptable,” and to keep the supply of children flowing while laundering their identities. Children who were younger, “orphaned” or “abandoned” – even when their biological parents were alive – and those without siblings were considered more “adoptable” than others, she explained. “The agencies should be held accountable for falsifying the files,” she told The Korea Herald. Hanna Johansson, a Korean adoptee in Sweden, said archiving hard copies of adoption files was also necessary. “I think being able to see, touch and smell our own history is important, too,” she told The Korea Herald. “You can’t do that in a digital archive.”Pak from ASK said the South Korean government should be in charge of DNA testing with an outreach campaign, on top of archiving the documents, to help those who wish to reunite with their birth families. “The government can cross reference with missing persons reports ,” she said.By Claire Lee","birth records hinders adoptees ,slow digitization of birth ,number of korean adoptees ,records hinders adoptees searches ,birth records increased dramatically","['korean', 'the Ministry of Health and Welfare']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64218295  0.47060233

The study was jointly compiled by Lina Korea -- the Korean unit of U.S. insurance giant CIGNA -- and a local sexologist clinic, and surveyed some 1,100 Koreans aged 20 or older. The study found that 50.8 percent of the surveyed men, and 9.3 percent of the surveyed women, have cheated on their legal spouses at least once.  123rfThe study also found that the surveyed Korean men in their 50s had extramarital affairs with an average of 12.5 partners. At the same time, 53.7 percent of the men in their 50s said they’ve cheated on their wives. Among surveyed women in their 50s, 9.6 percent said they’ve had affairs while married. They on average had relationships with 4.3 partners. The study also revealed that men and women have different views on whether or not paying for sex is cheating. While 40.5 percent of the surveyed men said they don’t consider buying sex as an act of infidelity, only 15.1 percent of the women thought the same. Notably, 43.3 percent of the respondents that did not consider paying for sex as cheating had extramarital affairs at least once. However, 20.9 percent of those who considered buying sex as cheating -- in the same way as having an affair -- still pursued extramarital relationships. Income level, on top of gender, also had an impact on his or her likelihood of cheating. Among those whose household income is 5 million won  or more, 34.1 percent of them have cheated on their spouses, while 25.4 percent of those whose household income is 3.5 million won or less have engaged in extramarital relationships.In terms of occupation, the highest proportion of those who have cheated, 40.6 percent, were running their own businesses. The second largest group, accounting for 39.3 percent, were office workers, followed by physical laborers who accounted for 33.8 percent.South Korea’s Constitutional Court legalized adultery last year, abolishing a 60-year-old law that made extramarital affairs illegal and punishable with a prison term. Prostitution still remains illegal.Since 2004, the year South Korea passed its antiprostitution law, both buying and selling sex is considered a criminal activity and punishable with a maximum of one year behind bars.

Still, it said many defectors had a hard time finding full-time jobs.Even among professionals who were doctors, teachers and researchers in the North, only 51.3 percent were employed in the South, with just 16.8 percent being hired in their original areas of expertise. Government data showed 685 North Koreans who held professional jobs had arrived in the South so far.Among young people, those that gave up their studies have decreased over the years, but the high school dropout rate for defectors stood at 7.5 percent, which is much higher than it is for their South Korean counterparts.""Despite many gains over the years, the latest data on defectors showed the need for more systematic and active support to help those that have escaped the North to become productive members of South Korean society,"" NABO said.","korean defectors wages are ,korean escapees earned 54 ,defectors wages are 67 ,escapees earned 54 million ,korean defectors wages","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'the National Assembly Budget Office', 'north korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31938636  0.56651497

The difference was even larger for jobless men and women aged 30-34. While almost 86.7 percent of unemployed Korean women in the age group were married, only 19.4 percent of jobless men had legal spouses as of 2015.At the same time, the report found that the proportion of married women among those who are unemployed is higher than those who have professional careers. For unemployed women aged 30-34, 86.7 percent were married, while the proportion was 57.2 percent for those in the same age group who were working. The pattern was the opposite for Korean men. While 19.4 percent of unemployed men in the same age group were married as of last year, 54.2 percent of men with careers were living with their legal spouses.  Kim Young-ran, a researcher at the KWDI, said in spite of changing gender roles, men are often expected to be breadwinners of the family in Korean society. “So accordingly, young men who are unemployed are often seen as incapable of supporting his future spouse and children,” she told The Korea Herald. As for why a large proportion of unemployed women are married compared to working women, Kim said it is because many women end up quitting their jobs after getting married, particularly after having children in their early or mid-30s. She also said that many employers are hesitant to hire mothers with young children. “So the ‘unemployed’ women in this data includes married women who once had careers but ended up quitting after getting married for whatever reasons,” she explained. “The data also reflects the trend where many women with professional careers, especially those in their 30s, delay marriage and child bearing. That’s one of the reasons why the proportion of those who are married is smaller among working women than unemployed women.”Kim Jun-kyu, a 33-year-old who works in Seoul, said it is “virtually impossible” for an unemployed Korean man without any savings to get married in Korea, especially because of the nation’s common practice in which the groom’s family buys the house for newlyweds.  “I think the biggest problem is that when you are unemployed, you are ineligible to apply for any bank loans,” he said. “And when you can’t get loans, it’s very difficult to get housing. I know it’s changing, but men are still expected to somehow finance the housing when getting married. Unemployed men can’t do that unless their parents have the financial means to help them.”Kim also said he thinks there is a stigmatization against men who are out of work. “I think having a job is still considered by society as an option, rather than a duty for many women,” he said. “But men, especially those with children, not having a professional career -- or quitting their job -- is not really an option, according to the social norms in Korea. Such fathers are easily considered as incapable or irresponsible.”   By Claire Lee","unemployment affects korean men ,korean men marriage prospects ,percent of unemployed korean ,majority of jobless korean ,affects korean men marriage","['korean', 'korean', 'the Korea Women ’s Development Institute', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50358206  0.14117596

It took about four years and three months for college students to graduate school, about one month extended from a year ago. The average period has broken records every year since 2012. Out of 3.31 million graduates who are employed, 40.7 percent had jobs in the service industry, trailed by those in retail, food and accommodation with 26 percent and the manufacturing sector with 18.7 percent.

Researchers found that among all participants, a total of 2.306 of them have engaged in sexual or romantic encounters with same-sex individuals. They accounted for 0.6 percent of all surveyed teenagers.The report discovered that gay and lesbian teenagers were more likely to develop ""health-risk behaviors,"" such as drinking and using drugs, as well as mental conditions such as depression, than heterosexual school children.While 75.7 percent of all surveyed gay and lesbian teenagers said they consumed alcohol, 51.2 percent of heterosexual teenagers said they had the same experience. Also, a significantly higher proportion of gay and lesbian teens --14.4 percent -- have used drugs compared to heterosexual teenagers. Only 1.3 percent of the surveyed straight children said they had experience with drug use, which is currently illegal in South Korea.An anti-gay rally is being held in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province last month. The proportion of gay and lesbian teenagers who have been exposed to violence was 20.6 percent -- much higher than the proportion for heterosexual students, which was 2.9 percent. Some 26.4 percent of the gay and lesbian teens also said they have attempted to take their lives at least once, while 7.8 percent of straight teens had the same experience. The study also showed that about 60 percent of homosexual teens have experienced suicidal thoughts and depression, a figure that is almost double that for straight teens. “Homosexual adolescents report disparities in various aspects of health-risk behavior, including the use of multiple substances, suicide attempts and depressive mood,” researchers wrote in the report. “These factors should be addressed relevantly to develop specific interventions regarding sexual minorities.”However, Sapo, an LGBT activist at the Lesbian Counselling Center in Seoul, said such research narratives may stigmatize gay or lesbian school children. “You can still be gay even if you have no sexual or romantic encounters with same-sex individuals and those children have not been included as homosexual in this study,” she said. “I’m worried that people may start thinking all LGBT teenagers have such health-risk problems and behaviors. That’s not always the case.”123rfYu Sang-geun, another LGBT activist, said he has witnessed many LGBT teens who were either suicidal or clinically depressed. “I also have friends who took their lives,” he said. He said being a sexual minority can be more stressful for teenagers, as they still need to depend on adults -- who may not accept their queer identity -- both financially and emotionally.“It’s a combination of many different things,” he said. “Sometimes you want to come out of the closet but your family members are very homophobic. Some teens are stressed about and fear the possible consequences of coming out. Others feel guilty and feel sorry for their parents. All of these things can be overwhelming.”Yu stressed that it is not homosexuality itself that makes LGB teens vulnerable to substance abuse and suicidal thoughts. “It has to do with the constant discrimination that they face, as well as the sense of isolation and helplessness ,” he said.Homosexuality still remains largely taboo in South Korea, where almost 30 percent of the population is Christian. According to a 2013 research jointly conducted by a local daily and the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, among 1,500 Koreans who participated, 78.5 percent said they objected to homosexuality. Only 21.5 percent of the participants said they did not feel “uncomfortable” with it.Last year, the country‘s Gender Ministry was criticized by a group of activists for ordering the Daejeon Metropolitan City to scarp articles that guaranteed LGBT rights in the city’s newly revised charger of gender equality. Meanwhile, the same study by the SMC found that 34 percent of all surveyed straight students have engaged in sexual relationships in the past.

This is an increase from 30.3 percent in 2001. People with a body mass index of 25 or above are categorized as overweight.The average daily calorie intake was 2,063 in 2014, up from 1,881 in 2001, according to the study. The latest figure exceeds the daily recommended intake of 2,000 calories for an adult.The Nonghyup study said the weight gain likely came from the Westernized diet that tends to be greasier, and more people dining out rather than eating home-cooked meals.Among the three main nutrients, carbohydrates accounted for 64.5 percent of the intake, down 1.1 percentage points, and protein 14.5 percent, down 0.6 percentage point from 2001. But fat intake increased 1.7 percentage points to 20.9 percent, the study showed.In detailed terms, a South Korean adult consumed 98.27 grams of fat on an average day in 2014, compared with 83.9 grams in 2001, it said.The amount of vegetable fat in the diet had visibly increased, up from 58.2 grams in 2001 to 68.5 grams in 2014, equal to 70 percent of total fat intake. By comparison, consumption of animal fat increased only slightly from 25.7 g to 29.8 g.Hwang Myoung-chul, head of the research center, said South Koreans were following the same pattern as the Japanese in their eating habits.""In the past when excessive weight was a social issue in Japan, vegetable fat was named the No. 1 cause. The dietary change in South Korea is showing a similar pattern,"" he said.""The government has started a campaign against sugar consumption to prevent obesity and diabetes.

He thinks that both the groom and the bride should share the cost. All of his ex-girlfriends, except just one, fiercely disagreed. “They said the groom’s family should provide the marital house as that’s the norm and the tradition,” The 36-year-old told The Korea Herald. “My parents have no such money, and I can’t really afford an apartment in Seoul by myself in spite of my full-time job and personal savings.”Shin is one of many single Korean men who think Korea’s traditional wedding culture, which dictates that the family of the groom buys a house for the newlyweds -- while the family of the bride buys the furniture and household items -- should now change. According to a recent study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, almost 80 percent of the surveyed men said they are against the custom. The study surveyed 2,383 single Koreans aged 22-44 last year.For Shin, financing a marital house on his own means to have a huge mortgage. About five years after obtaining his university degree, he’s been employed full-time since 2011. Shin, who claims to now have a frugal lifestyle, currently has personal savings of 80 million won . “The housing that I'd like to live  costs about 300 million won,"" he said. “I don’t mind having mortgage debt. It’s just too much of a burden to pay it off on my own.”According to a 2014 study by local NGO Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice, it would take on average of 29 years for a newly married double-income couple to save enough to lease an apartment in Seoul -- which on average costs about 280 million won as of 2014 as a lump-sum deposit under Korea’s “jeonse” real-estate system -- if they choose to avoid borrowing. The average cost for an apartment under “jeonse” in Seoul marked and 400 million won as of this March.And as of last year, the average monthly wage of all first-year, university-educated employees was 2.9 million won.“I think it’s virtually impossible for anyone in Korea -- regardless of their gender -- to afford a debt-free house in the early 30s,” said Lee Kyung-eun, a 31-year-old female office worker in Seoul. “It’s impossible even if they were employed at one of the biggest conglomerates at the age of 25.”With such a housing situation, as well as the still-prevalent traditional wedding culture, the cost of wedding and marital housing are still being financed by couples’ parents in Korea, especially the ones of the grooms. As of 2013, 66.5 percent of Koreans who were married for less than 3 years said parents should finance their children’s housing and wedding “as much as they can,” according to a report by the Korean Women’s Development Institute.According to a recent report by the Samsung Economic Research Institute, which surveyed 1,501 Korean parents with grown, married children, they on average spent 125.05 million won on their children’s weddings and marital housing. The report also showed that the parents spent significantly more on their sons’ weddings and housing. They, on average, spent 94 million won per son, while 42 million won per daughter. In total, 63.8 percent of all surveyed parents financed 40 to 100 percent of all cost needed for their children’s weddings and housing. At the same time, 75 percent of them said paying for their children’s wedding and housing had an impact on their post-retirement finance.Shin said he does not want to financially burden his parents anymore by getting married. “I relied on them financially for all of my education,” he said. “I don’t think it’s ethically right to ask them to pay for my housing. I know a lot of other people get apartments from their parents when they get married, and I sometimes wish I were that lucky. But that doesn’t mean I should make my parents take the burden.”Yet Kim Yoo-jin, a 33-year-old female working professional in Seoul, said it’s all about “being practical” in today’s society where social mobility is severely limited. She said among her group of friends, those who are considered the most fortunate are women who “marry up” -- meaning they get an apartment financed by their in-laws, and are no longer required to view their jobs as a means of survival rather than as a career choice. “I work full-time and I also have my savings. But there’s no way I can get decent housing with my salary anytime soon. For many people marriage is the only way to secure housing and financial stability. So if you find someone whose parents are willing to provide those for you, why not?”Kim Young-ran, a researcher who specializes in family studies at KWDI, said the continuation of the particular custom and hypergamy -- the notion that women should marry up and men should marry down educationally and economically -- reflects the prevalent gender disparity that exists in Korea’s patriarchal society. “If we lived in a society where women can take care of their own housing, we would not see this happening,” she said. “And when you think about it, the kind of young women who are most popular in the Korean marriage market are not those who are most educated, or most successful. The ones that are most wanted are women with wealthy parents -- most likely wealthy fathers -- who can provide their future sons-in-law with opportunities and other material goods.”Kim said sexism in Korea’s labor force, gender wage gap, and poor work-life balance of working women as well as stigmatization and financial insecurity experienced by single women all contribute to the culture. A change in the widespread phenomenon of a heavier financial burden on the groom’s family should bring greater benefits to both men and women, she said.“Once you get a free house thinking this is what you deserve as a wife and a future mother, you become subordinate to the marriage. Having some financial independence within your marriage gives you the opportunities to seek equality at home. It’s easier to share domestic chores and child care with your spouse when you have that independence and contribution.”And that‘s exactly what Park Hee-jin, a 30-year-old Seoulite wants to do. “I still want to be myself after getting married,” she said. “I don’t think I can do that if I‘m too financially related to my in-laws. I want to marry someone who manages his finances well and does not mind starting off somewhere small and simple. I think it‘s really about making a choice, between your independent freedom or financial wealth and security.”By Claire Lee  Shin Ji-hun and Lee Kyung-eun are not their real names.

On a scale of zero to four -- with four being the most stressed -- those who live in non-city regions, such as farming or fishing villages, on average rated 2.90, higher than the average for city residents, which was 2.86.The study also found that individuals who live in smaller towns have a higher stress level than those living in big cities. Koreans who live in towns that have a population of 100,000 or less on average rated their stress level 2.97 out of four, while those who live in cities that have a population of 500,000 or more rated 2.84 out of five.In all regions, those in their 30s had the highest stress level. While those who live in cities experienced a lower amount of stress as they aged, citizens in remote regions experienced a higher level of stress as they aged, especially after entering their 60s.A similar pattern was noticed in the prevalence rate of illnesses and other health conditions. Among those who live in towns with a population of 100,000 or less, 0.88 percent of them have suffered one of 10 major health conditions, including high blood pressure, depression, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infraction and angina pectoris. Yet the proportion of residents living in cities with a population of 500,000 or more who have experienced one of the 10 illnesses was significantly low at 0.57 percent. Those living in small towns also weighed more than those living in big cities, which suggests that obesity may be more prevalent in regions with low population density. The average body mass index rate for those living in towns with a population of 100,000 or less was 23.03, higher than Koreans living in cities with a population of 500,000 or more, which saw an average BMI rate of 22.83. One’s weight is considered normal if his or her BMI rate ranges from 18.5 to 24.9. The study suggested that one of the biggest reasons behind the statistics may have to do with a larger proportion of elderly individuals in small towns, who are more prone to sickness and social isolation. “The government should take these statistics and regional differences into account when coming up with policies,” the report wrote.By Claire Lee","some 197 000 koreans ,small towns more stressful ,cities study south koreans ,000 koreans on scale ,197 000 koreans on","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7700929   0.64829719

It also plans to hear an explanation from Volkswagen Korea on July 22. “There is no concrete plan on how to respond to the ministry request as of now. We expect the prosecutors’ investigation result will come out at the end of July,” Kim Ki-hoon, the director of the Korean unit of Volkwagen told The Korea Herald.“We will then come up with plans and solutions on how to cooperate with the prosecution and the ministry’s request on recall plan,” he added.Volkswagen AG’s Korean unit has been the center of criticism for not following the ministry’s earlier recall order.Last November, the ministry had ordered the recall and suspended sales on 126,000 vehicles of 15 Volkswagen models -- including Tiguan, the best-selling foreign car here in 2015 -- for emissions manipulation. Following the order, Volkswagen AG’s Korean unit had submitted recall measures in January, March and June, but these were all rejected by the ministry as there had been insufficient information and a lack of details on improving emissions. The ministry said the company did not admit to using a defeat device to trick emissions test.On Friday, former Volkswagen Korea managing director Park Dong-hoon was summoned again for questioning regarding the emissions rigging. Park reportedly argued that he had no authority to give such orders. By Kim Da-sol","000 disputed volkswagen models ,79 000 disputed volkswagen ,disputed volkswagen models sold ,it will ban sales ,golf and audi a8","['the Ministry of Environment', 'Volkswagen', 'the Seoul Central Prosecutors ’ Office', 'Volkswagen', 'Audi A8']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83974349  0.28745586

This ranges from the regular army and the navy to auxiliary police and the marines. Among these choices, serving in KATUSA, or the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, is almost a dream come true and the most envied. KATUSA soldiers and U.S. soldiers jointly participate in a combat exercise in this file photo. Each year, around 2,000 are chosen for KATUSA. They are selected from those who have preliminarily qualified by achieving the minimum required scores on English proficiency tests. Competition among those vying for these positions is extremely high. According to the Military Manpower Administration, last year’s competition rate for 2016 recruitment was 8.1 to 1 which meant only 2,041 candidates out of 16,992 applicants would make the cut. But serving as a KATUSA soldier is by no means a walk in the park, as being a Korean soldier in a U.S. barrack can sometimes be challenging and involve misunderstandings. Han, a 24-year-old part-timer at a convenience store in Seoul, finished his military duty last October as a KATUSA soldier. Han had joined KATUSA with the expectation that it would involve better treatment and a less intense training schedule at the U.S. Army base.But the reality was quite different after he was dispatched to the U.S. Garrison in Yongsan after eight weeks of basic training. “Unlike those in KATUSA, the U.S. comrades were those that signed up for the service voluntarily. They loved what they were doing as a soldier. It made a huge difference,” Han said.“Twenty one months were all I needed to get back to normal life. I did not need any medal of honor. I just hoped for the time to pass by in a blur.”KATUSA soldiers who failed to actively participate in training programs and classes in comparison to highly-motivated U.S. soldiers often faced severe disciplinary actions -- regardless of their ranks -- day and night by superiors, Han added.Another former KATUSA soldier, who declined to be named, could not stand the prejudice that his fellow U.S. soldiers held against his peers. “They believe their rank is earned and not given for free,” he explained. “The automatic promotion of ranks for Korea’s enlisted soldiers is therefore viewed as less deserving of respect and less worthy in their eyes.” Nevertheless, the popularity of joining KATUSA derives from the fact that they can receive better treatment, including meals, compared to regular South Korean military units. These perks include the freedom to leave military posts on weekdays with relative ease, and a comparably less hierarchical relationship with supervisors. Above all, they get more educational opportunities, especially for English. KATUSA soldiers participate in a team training exercise in this file photo. However, there are also some common misconceptions about KATUSA. For instance, although the KATUSA selection process is random among those who have scored the required level in the English test scores, it is common to find questions online asking whether there is any appropriate level of scores to maximize chances of winning the KATUSA “lottery.”According to the Military Manpower Administration, candidates are divided into three groups in accordance with their levels in the English fluency tests. A more important factor is which month to apply for the KATUSA. Its recruitment takes place every September. The applicants can choose their desired month to enter. Some months are more preferable, meaning higher competition. Park, a 23-year-old college student, chose March, the most competitive month, when applying for Katusa last year. He was lucky to be selected. “I wanted to minimize the time gap after finishing military service,” Park said, referring to how new semesters in schools begin in March each year.Another point of confusion is whether the KATUSA belongs to the Republic of Korea Army or the U.S. Army. It is a branch of the ROK that is augmented to the 8th United States Army. KATUSA soldiers must go through five weeks of ROK Army basic training and another three weeks of education and physical training by the U.S. Army at Camp Jackson in Uijeongbu.

In explaining its decision, the council backgrounded that many secondary schools and colleges in Thailand are teaching Hangeul and that more and more students show increasing interest in it, according to the official. ""The adoption is expected to be applied from the 2018 college entrance test that will be carried out in the latter half of next year,"" the official said. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian nation to make the adoption. The United States, Australia, France and Japan have already done so.The Thai government adopted Hangeul as a second foreign language in 2008, and South Korea dispatched some 50 Korean-language teachers in compliance with the Thai government's request the following year. The Seoul government has also helped train some locals as Hangeul teachers, and set up Hangeul institutions in the country. As a result, the number of students learning Hangeul soared from about 3,000 at some 30 schools in 2010 to 25,000 at 120 schools as of now, the official said.","korean language for college ,of korean dramas movies ,entrance exam the korean ,thailand adopts korean language ,thailand adopts korean","['korean', 'Thailand', 'Hallyu', 'korean', 'the south Korean Embassy', 'the Council of University Presidents of Thailand', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59274215  0.14589766

According to the survey by the Institute of Language Research and Education, 32.8 percent of foreign students said that they had trouble adapting to the country’s hierarchical culture while living and studying in Korea. Just over 16 percent of the students had difficulties adjusting due to Koreans’ indifference toward them, followed by gender discrimination at 16 percent, drinking culture at 15.6 percent and the culture that places heavy importance on respecting the elderly at 6.2 percent. Other reasons behind difficulties included the nation’s culture of always being in a rush and Koreans’ unkindness. The ILRE, which is affiliated with Yonsei University, conducted the poll on 400 foreign students from 45 countries to find out problems faced by foreigners and their perception of Korean society. The poll was released by Yoo Hyun-kyung, who heads the ILRE, at a workshop aimed at discussing ways to better manage foreign students here. Foreign students take part in an event reenacting a confucian ceremony in Daejeon. The biggest challenge faced by foreign students here was the language barrier with 33.7 percent of the survey’s participants saying so, followed by financial problems at 12 percent, Korean food at 10.4 percent, housing expenses at 9.1 percent and cultural differences at 8.5 percent, the survey showed. The most entertaining thing to do in Korea for the foreign students was eating Korean food, with 20.9 percent of them saying so. This was followed by making Korean friends at 18.6 percent, going on a trip at 18.4 percent and shopping at 17.3 percent. Most, or 34.3 percent said they were learning Korean to pursue higher education here, 23.8 percent said they were driven by their interest in the Korean culture. Some 16.3 percent said it was to find employment here and 9.9 percent said it was to hold conversations with their Korean families. Nearly 83 percent of those surveyed were contented with the quality of Korean language programs, while 17.1 percent were not satisfied. According to the Justice Ministry, the number of foreign students here was 106,138 as of March, about four times higher than the 24,779 in 2005. The biggest group of foreign students here were the Chinese, followed by Vietnamese, Mongolian, Japanese and Americans.

This stems from the fact that most of the female workers work at establishments with the inability to provide full-time regular positions -- small establishments with less than 10 workers or the hospitality service industry. Furthermore, Korea’s social conditions make it hard for women to have work-life balance, contributing the most to this phenomenon. Even though 50 percent of women are participating in the labor market, housework is still considered women’s burden. There is a saying among women in Korea: “After work, I go back to work at home.”This saying shows how the burden is only confined to women, and under such circumstances, work-life balance seems a far-fetched idea. Under the same context, men’s low participation in child-rearing in Korean family culture is another underlying cause of the problem. According to Statistics Korea, the amount of time women spent on housework is 5.6 times higher than the time spent by men in dual-income families. This is in line with recent polls that showed the greatest obstacles to women’s employment are the “burden of child rearing ”and “social practices and prejudices against women.” Moreover, Korea has the highest working hours among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The culture of long working hours results in difficulties in improving both gender’s work-family life balance, child rearing and quality of life. In addition, inflexible organizational culture brings disadvantages to women’s evaluation and promotion during women’s pregnancy, childbirth and child-rearing. Lee Myung-sun Such factors discourage women from seeking employment and lead to career breaks. As a result, Korea’s labor force participation rate by age is still shaped like an “M” when plotted on a graph -- women in their early 20s experience the highest employment rate but the rate drops significantly when they are in their 30s, as they get married and have children. This also does not meet the typical female employment rate of 70 percent in well-advanced countries. Unlike advanced countries such as the Nordic nations, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States where flexible work arrangements and performance-centered human resource management are well instituted, Korea suffers from long working hours and difficulties in work-life balance. If these issues do not get resolved, even if the best system is established, for most women, work-life balance and continuing a professional career will continue to be a pie in the sky. Among advanced countries, Sweden holds the reputation of having the best work-life balance for parents. And it is one of the countries with the smallest gender gap. Sweden’s female employment rate is 71.8 percent, which is one of the highest among in EU countries. Sweden’s parental leave is known for its length , and income retention rate -- out of 480 days, 80 percent of 390 days of income is guaranteed. Most of all, its focus on gender-equal parental leave deserves attention. In Sweden there is a parental quota in which one of the parents have to spend at least 90 days of the parental leave. Therefore, the percentage of Sweden’s paternal leave is 35 percent, which is the highest among OECD countries. Women can be an engine to a country’s development and growth, and women’s employment stands at the center of it. In order to realize this dream, the culture of work-life balance should be well rooted in society. And this is why the Korean government is cooperating with private firms here as part of efforts to expand flexible employment and encourage the use of paternal leave, among other aims. We should look forward to seeing the fruit of these policies to continuously contribute to the development and growth of Korea.

This roughly translates to daily consumption of 62.9 grams per person, an 11 percent fall from the estimate by the health ministry in 2010.The institute's research found that 2 out of 100 Koreans hadn't eaten kimchi for an entire year, and more than half of this group said they hadn't because their daily diet was mostly Western foods, such as bread and cereal.As alarming as the consumption fall is, there's also a sharp increase in kimchi imports from China, the institute said. Imports of kimchi jumped from $51.34 million in 2005 to $112.37 million in 2015, and 99.9 percent of them came from China, according to the research. South Korea's exports of the food, on the other hand, fell from $92.96 million in 2005 to $73.54 million in 2015.The Codex Alimentarius Committee in July 2001 recognized Korean kimchi as the global standard, giving it official recognition over other varieties, including ""kimuchi"" from Japan.

The report explained that the rise in the number of job seekers appeared to be proportional to the economic slowdown.Among job seekers aged 20-24, those who were preparing to take state exams or who have done so already reached 47.9 percent. It was higher, at 53.9 percent, for those aged 25-29.The largest number, or 45.5 percent, of them were preparing to become entry-level, or 9th grade, public servants. Following were those readying to take exams to become teachers , accountants and other professionals  and slightly higher-ranking 7th grade public servants and other positions in public service .  The report said the trend appeared to show the rising preference toward securing more stable employment in the midst of an economic slump.The phenomenon was also evident in another report also released by the agency Sunday.YonhapBy tracing the job statuses of some 18,000 college graduates aged 20-34, it showed that 72.1 percent of them had succeeded in landing their first job as of 2014.Of those graduates, 10.4 percent were hired by large companies with at least 300 employees as regular workers. The other 34.3 percent were hired as regular workers at smaller businesses, 21.2 percent as irregular workers at small or medium-sized businesses and 6.1 percent as irregular employees at large businesses.The wage gap was significant, with the monthly salary of irregular workers at big companies rating 77.1 percent of that of regular workers. Comparatively, the figure was 76.0 percent for regular workers and 68.7 for irregular workers at smaller businesses. While only 12.3 percent of college graduates with regular jobs at bigger companies left, 27.9 percent of those with regular positions in smaller companies and 29.3 percent of irregular workers at bigger companies did so. Some 40.8 percent of irregular workers at smaller companies quit.Regular workers regardless of the company size tended to quit to seek for better work opportunities, while irregular workers left as their contract period ended, the report said.“Involuntary resignation of young college graduates create additional cost for reemployment, and acts as a factor to raise the unemployment rate,” said researcher Kim Ha-young. Kim added that the results showcased the importance of creating a labor market that enabled young college graduates to settle down.","young koreans seeking jobs ,employment surged to 542 ,most young job seekers ,half of young koreans ,state exams over half","['Koreans', 'the Korea Employment Information Service']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1626913   0.69381833

Many studies at home and abroad have been showing that gender disparity is prevalent in South Korea. Last year, the country ranked 115th out of 145 nations on gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum. The women’s employment rate here remained at 49.9 percent last year.Having worked as an IT businesswoman many years prior to stepping into politics in 2012, Kang emphasized that South Korea has been making continuous efforts to provide training programs for unemployed women who wish to work in the nation’s ICT industry. In 2015, the Korean government established a special support center for women who are seeking employment specifically in the ICT field, which provides courses on JAVA programming, data management and computer-aided drafting. “South Korea’s Ministry of Gender Equality runs professional training courses on ICT at the Women’s reemployment Center, such as ICT electric fusion technology and web designing,” said Kang. While women’s employment remains low here, South Korean women are some of the most educated in the world. Last year, more girls  enrolled in post-secondary education than boys . Minister Kang also stressed that female students accounted for 21.9 percent of all Korean engineering students in post-secondary education institutes last year, which was the highest figure in the nation’s history. Kang nevertheless acknowledged the existing gender disparity in the particular field, pointing out that female workers only accounted for 26. 9 percent of the entire 1.63 million ICT professionals in Korea in 2014.“We encourage more women to start their own business,” she said. “Our focus is to nature career-interrupted women into professionals through collaborative partnerships with women business associations.”By Claire Lee","gender equality during meeting ,more girls are majoring ,south korean gender minister ,achieving gender equality minister ,girls are majoring in","['south korean', 'Gender', 'Kang Eun - hee', 'Lima', 'Peru']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.38074571  0.48575154

73,73,73,Female breadwinners rise in stature in South Korea,"South Koreans’ general views of breadwinning women have changed from pity to admiration since 2005, a government study showed Thursday.According to a study released by the Gender Ministry, 52.9 percent of Koreans said this year that they admire female breadwinners for their capabilities, a significant increase from 32 percent in 2005. Meanwhile, the number of those who said they doubted the women’s husbands – for ...","South Koreans’ general views of breadwinning women have changed from pity to admiration since 2005, a government study showed Thursday.According to a study released by the Gender Ministry, 52.9 percent of Koreans said this year that they admire female breadwinners for their capabilities, a significant increase from 32 percent in 2005. Meanwhile, the number of those who said they doubted the women’s husbands – for possibly being financially incapable and making their wives support the family – dropped from 38.4 percent to 23.7 percent.At the same time, the proportion of those who said they pitied such women also dropped from 10 percent to 6.4 percent in the same time period.123rf“Traditionally, Koreans have thought that women who have to financially support their families are unlucky,” said the ministry’s Lee Myung-eun. “Most Koreans in the older generation used to think that a ‘happy and fortunate’ woman is someone who is married to a financially capable and caring men and raise children at home without having to worry about money. But the trend is certainly changing, as shown in the statistics.”According to Statistics Korea, the proportion of households headed by women also increased significantly from 1990-2016, from 15.7 percent to 28.9 percent. The government agency predicts that such households will account for 34 percent of all Korean households by the year 2030. “It’s because a large number of single women are starting to live on their own -- they are the heads of their single-person households -- and more women in their 40s and 50s are supporting their families, regardless of their marital status,” said an official from the Gender Ministry. The changing perception also has to do with women’s high level of education in South Korea, according to the ministry. Last year, more girls  enrolled in post-secondary education than boys . “I think Korea is starting to see capable women who actually want to work and succeed in their careers, whereas in the past working women were seen as people who were forced to work because of unfortunate circumstances such as poverty or incapable husbands,” said Gender Ministry official Choi Sung-ji. “More Koreans think of working women who earn high salaries as people who are admirable, as many now know that their achievements are not easy to obtain, especially if they are also parents who have children to raise.”In spite of such changing perceptions, gender disparity is still prevalent in Korean family life and the nation’s education system, the same study showed. Among the 500 Korean school children surveyed for the study, 33 percent said their fathers spent most of their time at home watching TV. Also, 13.4 percent of them said their fathers were “always lying down on the sofa” when they are home, while 10.4 percent of them said their fathers are occupied with their cellphones or computers when spending time at home.However, their responses were dramatically different when asked about their mothers’ daily activities at home. Twenty-seven percent of them said their mothers spent most of their time at home cooking, while 19.6 percent said their main job was caring for their children. Meanwhile, 13.4 percent said their mothers spent a lot of time doing dishes in the kitchen, while 12.8 percent said their mothers were often occupied with laundry at home. Also, 25.75 percent of the surveyed children said their teachers treat their students differently according to gender. Notably, 26.2 percent of male participants said male students receive harsher punishments than their female counterparts, while 24.6 percent of the female students said their teachers assume that most girls will not excel in physical education. The study also showed that 39.8 percent of Korean school children, and 58.7 percent of Korean adults think gender disparity exists in Korea’s wedding culture and marriages. Almost 70 percent of Korean adults, and 38.4 percent of the students, said the biggest gender disparity in wedding culture lies with the Korean custom that dictates that the family of the groom buys a house for the newlyweds. Meanwhile, Korean schoolchildren had very different thoughts on what should be improved to combat gender disparity in married life. While 53.3 percent of the male students said men should no longer be fully responsible for financially supporting the family, only 9.3 percent of the female students thought it needed to change. At the same time, while 49.2 percent of female students said women’s domestic chores should not be solely women’s responsibility, only 21 percent of the male students said the same.

Ryanggang's high number is followed by South Hamgyong with 27.1 percent, North Pyongan with 26.3 percent, North Hwanghae at 25.7 percent and North Hamgyong standing at 25.5 percent.Undernourishment in Kangwon Province on the east coast came to 24.4 percent, with South Hwanghae at 22.4 percent and South Pyongan at 19.8 percent.The WFP conducted the nutrition survey last year for kids between the ages of six months and five years in 85 cities and counties, excluding the northern province of Jagang. Moreover, Ryanggang Province's rate of kids who are underweight hit 12.2 percent, the highest among all areas checked, while South Pyongan's rate recorded the lowest at 7.5 percent. The average underweight rate for North Korean children stood at 10.2 percent, the report said.North Korean children's intake of protein and fat also remain at 70 to 85 percent of international standards, the report pointed out.The WFP will conduct a nutritional assistance project for 1.7 million North Korean people for 2 1/2 years starting next month, for which some $126 million in support is required.","korean children undernourished report ,north korean children undernourished ,korean children undernourished ,of north korean kids ,of north korean children","['north korean', 'the World Food Program', 'North Korea', 'Voice of America', 'United Nations', 'north korean']",14,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.24817011  0.62825996

The largest monthly payment reached 1.88 million won. The number of pensioners was up from 3.59 million a year earlier with the total payments also marking an increase from 1.18 trillion won.In 2002, the number of pension recipients stood at 917,000 with pension payments totaling 173.6 billion won. With the national pension system maturing further down the road, the number of pensioners is expected to rise to 5.93 million in 2020 and exceed the 10-million mark in 2030, the NPS said.Senior Koreans are entitled to receive national pension payments after paying premiums for up to 10 years until the age of 60 during their working years.In a report released a week ago, the NPS estimated that 91.3 percent of 17.62 million Koreans aged 65 and older are projected to receive various state pensions in 2060, when the country's national pension fund is estimated to dry up.Experts point out that Korea's aging population is putting a strain on the pension system as the number of elderly grows faster than the labor force due to the chronically low birthrate.Korea is on the verge of becoming an aged society, with the share of senior citizens reaching 13.1 percent of the country's population of 50.62 million last year. A country is defined as an ""aged society"" if more than 14 percent of the population are 65 or older.","monthly korea state pension ,pension service 98 million ,million people monthly with ,tuesday the state pension ,people monthly korea state","['Korea', 'the National Pension Service']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31484938 -0.13892972

Of the children, 635 children were aged 10-12. Among the surveyed parents, 31.7 percent perceived themselves to be good parents, while 55.3 percent said they were neither good nor bad as mothers or fathers. At the same time, 13 percent said they were not doing a good job of raising their children.Among those who perceived themselves as inadequate parents, the largest portion of them, 34 percent, said it was because they often react too emotionally toward their children. Meanwhile, 20 percent said they were unable to spend enough time with their kids, while 17 percent said they were incapable of giving their children enough financial support. Also, 7.5 percent said they had trouble balancing work and family life, while 5.9 percent said they simply didn’t know how to be with their children. Almost 3 percent of the parents said they couldn’t help but compare their children with others.However, the study showed the vast majority of the surveyed children were in fact happy with their parents. Among participants, 91.9 percent said their mothers were great at parenting, while 87.7 percent of them said the same on their fathers. Yet the study showed that the surveyed children and parents had different views on what makes for good parenting. Although the largest portion of both groups -- 46.4 percent of parents and 23.6 percent of children -- said a good parent is someone who is a good listener and spends a lot of time talking to their children, they thought differently on other qualities and aspects, such as temperament and financial support. While the second largest portion of the children, 16.1 percent, said a good parent is someone who makes time for their kids, only 6.7 percent of the parents thought the same. Also, 10.4 percent of the children said a good parent is someone who can put themselves in their shoes and makes effort to understand their perspectives. Only 6.1 percent of the surveyed parents felt the same way. The groups also had different views on financial support. While 6.5 percent of the children said a good parent is supposed to give full financial support, only 1.3 percent of the parents agreed. Also, only 1.1 percent of the parents saw “not being overly angry” around their children as an important quality of a good parent, although 5.7 percent of children felt this way. More than 5 percent of the children also said a good parent keeps his or her promises to their children, but only 1.4 percent of the parents thought the same. The Gender Ministry has been promoting policies to curb child abuse -- among which a majority of 80 percent is committed by parents -- and encourage constructive relationships between parents and children. As part of the measures, the Gender Ministry has been actively encouraging young parents to attend educational programs on child care and parenting since earlier this year.But another ministry study found that only 23.6 percent of the surveyed parents have attended parenting classes. When asked why they did not consider taking such classes, 49.5 percent of them said they simply did not have the time, while 34.6 percent said they didn’t think such classes were necessary.Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee said the government plans to come up with a parenting education program in which teachers visit homes and workplaces of students, adding that 78.6 percent of the surveyed parents said they would be willing to take such classes if they were more accessible.  “A happy family life requires education and preparation,” said Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee. “Our goal is to make sure every parent has access to parenting education as long as they want to participate.”By Claire Lee","inadequate parents full 13 ,13 percent of koreans ,ministry surveyed 000 parents ,percent of koreans think ,parents full 13 percent","['South Koreans', 'the Gender Ministry']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16851063  0.46929345

Of the respondents, 50.1 percent said that they agreed that major government bodies such as the National Assembly and Cheong Wa Dae should move to Sejong City, compared to 38.6 percent that did not agree. Some 11.3 percent said they were not sure.YonhapConstruction for the special administrative district began in 2007 as part of the measure to balance out the country’s development which is heavily concentrated in Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan region. The district was created from parts of the Chungcheong provinces near Daejeon.Since the official launch of what is formally called the Sejong Metropolitan Autonomous City in 2012, a total of 36 ministries including the Prime Minister’s Office, agencies, committees and affiliate organizations have been relocated. Calls within the political circle to relocate the two key government organizations – the presidential office and the parliament – have persisted, as the dual administrative locations were cited as a major hurdle for efficient operation.The survey also found that those who were more supportive of the relocation of Cheong Wa Dae and the Assembly included 73.4 percent of those living in Sejong and nearby regions, 61.8 percent of those in their 30s, 64.2 percent of those in their 40s, and 57.2 percent of those with progressive disposition. In comparison, only 37.8 percent of Seoul’s residents, 37.7 percent of those aged 60 and over, and 42 percent of those that identified themselves as conservatives agreed to the need for the relocation.","half of south koreans ,more koreans agree with ,south koreans supported relocating ,more koreans agree ,koreans agree with relocating","['South Koreans', 'Cheong', 'the National Assembly', 'Sejong City', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65058118  0.86777067

Among the participants, 40 percent of them inaccurately perceived themselves as overweight. Also, 67.7 percent said they were on a diet solely to look more “attractive.”Researchers also found that those who wrongly perceived themselves as overweight are more vulnerable to stress and depression. 123rfAccording to the study, such women had a risk of developing depression that was 1.82 times higher than those with a positive body image. They were also 1.65 times more vulnerable to emotional stress than those with healthy self-perception. “The purpose of this study was to prove that negative body image makes one vulnerable to mental conditions on top of eating disorders,” researchers wrote in the report.Symptoms of negative body image may include thinking disparagingly about one’s own body and frequent comparison of their own shape and size to other people, especially celebrities. Last year’s study by Soon Chun Hyang University, which monitored South Korea’s public broadcasters for six months, found that body shaming of plus-size women was prevalent on Korean TV, as well as lookism against individuals who are deemed “ugly.” Also, almost 94 percent of 1,796 Koreans who sought medical help for bulimia from 2008-2013 were women. “Body shaming and lookism in the media are so normalized in Korea that a lot of people don’t even realize that it’s a problem,” said professor Shim Mi-seon from Soon Chun Hyang University’s mass communication department. “I think it’s necessary to approach lookism as a human rights issue. People shouldn’t be bullied or shamed because of the way they look.”Similar discussion has been taking place in other countries. Kathy Kater, a psychotherapist who treats body image and weight disorders in the U.S., says that it’s important for women to be media savvy. “Advertisers spend tons of money on strategies specifically designed to make you feel there is something wrong with you,” she wrote in her 2006 essay titled “Promotion of Healthy Weight: Helping without Harming,” which is available online. “If they first advertise an unrealistic standard of beauty, that leaves you feel deficient by comparison, a product that promises to improve your condition is an easy sale.

High Commissioner for Refugees, while a total of 74 are being assisted by the UNHCR.The report did not specify the distribution of defectors per country. As the figure does not include defectors who have acquired permanent residence in other countries, the actual number of defectors is expected to be higher.The U.N. agency files the report each year based on statistics from each government, affiliated organizations and studies conducted on its own.The number of North Koreans defecting to the South -- which peaked at 2,706 in 2011 -- has been declining since Kim Jong-un rose to power there in 2012. It dropped from 1,502 in 2012 to 1,276 in 2015, which observers have attributed to economic improvement compared to the late 2000s and a reinforced crackdown by Pyongyang authorities on defectors and those condoning such acts.But the South Korean Unification Ministry last month said that 493 North Koreans came to the South from January to April, marking a 16.3 percent on-year increase from 424 in 2015.In April, 13 North Koreans who had worked at a China-based restaurant arrived in Seoul, followed by another group defection of three North Korean employees in May. Seoul government said that the U.N. Security Council sanctions -- imposed against Pyongyang after its Jan. 6 nuclear testing and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch -- may have affected the defectors’ decision.But local liberal lawyers’ group Minbyun raised questions on whether the defectors came to Korea of their own free will. The defectors’ families in North Korea have claimed that the South kidnapped them. Conservative groups have lambasted such allegations, with ruling Saenuri’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk saying Tuesday that Minbyun is being used by the communist country.The UNHCR report also showed that global forced displacement has increased in 2015 to 65.3 million, marking a 5.8 million jump from the year before and an all-time high.Some 21.3 million were refugees while another 40.8 million were internally displaced. About 86 percent of the world’s refugees were hosted by developing countries, the highest figure in more than two decades.The leading hosts were Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon, each at 2.5 million, 1.6 million and 1.1 million.An estimated 10 million were stateless in 2015, although the data garnered by the UNHCR was limited to only 3.7 million stateless individuals in 78 countries.During 2015, 201,400 refugees were returned to their countries of origin. Most were from Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia, respectively at 61,400, 39,500 and 32,300.Children unaccompanied by their guardians or separated from their families came to 98,400, the highest since the UNHCR started keeping records in 2006.By Yoon Min-sik","103 north korean defectors ,north korean defectors living ,103 worldwide the refugee ,were 103 north korean ,korean defectors living","['U.N.', 'north korean', 'U.N.']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42862529  0.86068362

The two-year average marked an increase of 33.4 years tallied 10 years earlier, according to the report.The average age of women at first marriage also rose by 2.4 years over the cited period to 32.7.The findings were in line with an earlier report from state-run Statistics Korea, which said the average age of all South Korean males at the time of their first marriage reached a record high of 32.6 years in 2016, with that of females also climbing to a record high of 30 years the same year.Duo officials said the rise in average marriage age may have to do with growing prices that apparently require young people to work longer to save enough money to start a marriage.The growing unemployment rate of the young may be another reason.Currently, the jobless rate of those aged between 15 and 20 years remains at around 10 percent after peaking at an all-time high of 12.5 percent in February. In May, the unemployment rate for young people stood at 9.7 percent, compared with 3.7 percent for all eligible workers.The Duo report showed the average annual income of its male members who got married between the two-year period of 2014 to 2015 was at 64.03 million won , with that of female members coming to 41.04 million won.","koreans average marriage age ,koreans average marriage ,tuesday suggesting economic issues ,marriage age rises report ,their wives through matchmaking","['south korean', 'Duo']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.63277847  0.67893499

""The ministry has started to come up with measures to deal with the change.""The increase in the number of multicultural soldiers is attributed to a surge in the number of multicultural children aged 18 or younger, which came to 208,000 in 2015 from 25,000 in 2006.As cultural backgrounds are becoming diverse among soldiers, the Army should help these soldiers serve in stable surroundings, the official said, adding, ""We need to respect and understand multicultural values in order to manage military units confronting the increasing diversity of multicultural backgrounds in the Army.""As part of efforts to orient the Army into a multicultural organization, the ministry plans to conduct a survey on soldiers' understanding of multiculturalism and discrimination against multicultural soldiers, if any, in order to develop teaching materials helping servicemen know how to accept people from different cultural backgrounds.Under the plan, the ministry will commission a private company in the second part of the year which will be tasked with an analysis on patterns of discriminatory actions against multicultural soldiers, among other issues.Two years of military service is mandatory for all healthy South Korean men, as the Korean Peninsula remains technically at war ever since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.","multicultural starting in 2025 ,become multicultural starting 2025 ,multicultural starting 2025 ,multicultural starting 2025 an ,starting 2025 an increasing","['Army', 'the Defense Ministry']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60166407  0.34962201

More than 92 percent of the lawmakers from the minor People's Party espoused the revision.Compared with the two opposition parties, the ruling party appeared to have a more cautious stance as President Park Geun-hye has shown opposition to the revision on the grounds that the issue could divert attention from more urgent issues, such as revitalizing the economy.As for the question of how to alter the nation's governing structure through a constitutional revision, 46.8 percent of those polled said they favor a presidential system in which the chief executive is allowed to serve for two four-year terms. The current system bars the president from seeking reelection. For the same question, 24.4 percent of the lawmakers said they are in favor of a ""dual executive system"" under which more power is given to the prime minister, while 14 percent supported the adoption of a purely parliamentary cabinet system like the one in Japan.The dual executive system is a power-sharing model in which the prime minister is given substantial power in handling state affairs, such as public security, economic policies and personnel, while the president is in charge of external affairs, including foreign affairs and defense.As to the timing of the revision, 47.6 percent of the questioned said that the revision should be completed before the presidential election in December next year, while 41.2 percent said that the revision should be carried out under the next government.Meanwhile, the survey also found that 65.6 percent of those in favor of the constitutional revision acknowledged that the revision should come along with a change in the current election system. But 28.8 percent of them remained opposed to the change in the election system.The current election system is based on a mixed form of a small electoral system, where one person represents one constituency, and a proportional representation arrangement. It has long been criticized for worsening regionalism and encouraging elected politicians to focus only on the interests of their provincial voters. It remains to be seen whether a change in the Constitution could actually be pushed for as there has been little consensus among potential presidential contenders over when and how it should be carried out.To rewrite the Constitution, either the president or half of the 300 lawmakers should propose a change in a motion, which must be approved by more than two-thirds of the lawmakers and supported by a majority of the voters in a national referendum.","300 lawmakers also found ,10 south korean lawmakers ,eight in 10 lawmakers ,10 lawmakers support constitutional ,korean lawmakers support constitutional","['south korean', 'Yonhap News Agency']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.1653588   0.71899867

Responses were drawn from those with at least one of their parents or parents-in-law living.Results said 56.7 percent were economically assisting the parents, the responsibility lying heavier on older children of the family, but the amount of supportive money being larger among younger offspring.For children in their 20s, 18.3 percent said they were helping their parents financially. The number was 52.8 percent for those in their 30s, 71.1 percent for 40s, 79.3 percent for 50s and 71 percent for 60s.  The average amount of support was 348,000 won  a month. The amount decreased with age: Those in their 20s gave an average of 435,000 won compared with those in their 60s who provided 150,000 won a month.  Eldest sons on average bore the largest amount, 476,000 won, compared with the 339,000 won for younger sons. The situation was the same for daughters, with the oldest ones providing 287,000 won and the younger ones 266,000 won.Financial support for parents accounted for an average 9.7 percent of children's income, the survey said.The institute also polled public opinion on support for parents and found that while 89.9 percent of the people in 1998 believed the family is responsible for taking care of them, only 31.7 percent felt that way in 2014. Instead, 51.7 percent said society should take care of parents, compared with 2 percent in 1998.The traditional notion of responsibility of the eldest son has also weakened. In 1998, 22.4 percent said eldest sons should be responsible for supporting their parents. In 2014, it fell to 2 percent. Compared with the 7 percent in 1998 who said all sons are responsible, in 2014, only 1.1 percent said so. Comparatively, 24.1 percent in the latter year said all children are equally responsible, up from 15 percent in 1998.In an analysis of the findings, the institute said the long-held notion of the family taking care of the parents is changing as childbirths fall and women join the workforce, placing more responsibility on society.""We need to expand on a public care system in which the state handles the financial support, while the family provides emotional care,"" the institute said. ""We also need to work on improving job availability for the elderly and social safety networks, and help financial aspects of aging parents through programs preparing them for the later years of their lives.""","parents financially survey nearly ,recent survey showed tuesday ,parents financially survey ,of 10 south koreans ,supporting parents financially survey","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24400948  0.50546223

It runs the classes for 2 1/2 hours, three days a week, at a school for Koreans in Tehran. This is proof of the growing interest among Iranians toward the Korean language although exchanges between the countries have been restricted due to the international sanctions imposed on Iran.""It'd be better if a student could finish all five courses in a row. Unfortunately, however, we're unable to do so because there are so many on the waiting list,"" said Choi Yeon-suk, chief of the institute, on Wednesday.Choi says a considerable number of the applicants already have experience learning Korean by themselves. About 90 percent of them were women whose interest in Korean TV dramas and K-pop music has spilled over into Korea and its language.Some of them are dreaming of landing a job or going to South Korea to further their studies, according to Choi.""I'm learning Korean with a plan to study at a Korean university,"" a student said. ""I practice Korean and its writing system by watching 'Descendants of the Sun' these days.""Broadcast simultaneously in South Korea and China from Feb. 24 through April 14, the military-romance drama became a sensation in both countries, as well as other Asian nations.Demand for learning Korean has soared recently with the lifting of the sanctions on Iran.As Korean firms rush to grab business opportunities in the new market, the demand for manpower who can speak both Persian and Korean fluently is ever rising, the head of the language institute said.Iranian college students attending the King Sejong Institute, in particular, are considered assets to Korean firms because in many cases they also have good English skills.""Iranian people favor Korean companies because they have a favorable impression of the country,"" she said.

Multiple answers were allowed. Marriage expenses in Korea usually include money for housing and other fixtures for the newlyweds, wedding ceremony, honeymoon and various gifts for the in-laws.123rfNearly 12 percent also said they took out a loan to pay for the wedding. Some 23 percent of the surveyed parents whose children were not yet married also said they were willing to get a loan to support their children.Such spending accounted for 55 percent of the retirement funds the parents had accumulated, the report said. Some 75 percent of the parents whose children are all married said the cost of supporting the weddings put a strain on their retirement life.The report also showed that parents were more conservative toward the concept and method of marriage and weddings. Among the parents, 67 percent viewed it as a “marriage of the two families,” and 71 percent said their children getting married was a task for the parents to accomplish.While 56 percent of the parents said they accepted their responsibility of supporting the wedding, only 28 percent of the children agreed.Some 30 percent of the parents also believed that the newlywed’s house must be provided by the groom and furniture by the bride, as is customarily done in Korea. Only 14 percent of the children said they wanted to stick to such traditions.While 30 percent of the parents also thought that gifts for the in-laws should be of a certain quality, only 16 percent of the children saw it as necessary.“As parents in their 50s and 60s at present are expected to have two or threefold longer years of their retirement  from the past, they should be more cautious in planning their support for the weddings of their children,” the report said.","korean parents spend w130m ,parents spend w130m to ,million won in marriage ,parents spend w130m ,wedding south korean parents","['south korean', 'Samsung Life Retirement Research Center']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.62822187  0.46022192

While the employment rate of women with degrees from vocational colleges or higher measured 62.7 percent in 2015, almost the same as the year before, the rate for those in their late 30s dropped from 56.7 percent to 56.4 percent.The increase in the number of economically inactive population among the highly educated was more marked in the late-30s group, rising 20,000 to 503,000 last year. This made the late-30s the most non-employed segment among all age groups of women. Park Jin-hee, who authored the report, said while the country's economic downturn likely had its toll on the job market for women, the lack of quality in the jobs available compounded the problem.The report cited 10.1 percent of educated women in their 30s who said they voluntarily abandoned their career because the demanded work hours and the level of pay did not satisfy them. This was an increase from 8.9 percent in 2014.""The availability of jobs that are stable and have flexible hours and unemployment insurance has stagnated in 2014 and 2015,"" Park said.  ""We have to induce these women to choose at least to work part-time rather than end their careers by creating good quality jobs.""","women leaving workforce for ,of 836 000 women ,south korean women ,women leaving workforce ,says women leaving workforce","['south korean', 'the Korea Employment Information Service']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.72189808  0.15382464

The greatest jump was seen among long-term residents who accounted for about 75 percent of all foreigners, up 30 percentage points from 2002. At this pace the country will soon have more than 2 million foreigners.International marriages and employment of foreign workers have been the driving force behind the growth. Last year, 305,000 foreigners were living on a spousal visa in South Korea, a figure that only took five years to jump two-fold. South Korea first started encouraging single men in the country to marry foreign women in the 1990s to prop up the nation's agricultural industry, and as a result, the number of such unions quadrupled between 2000 and 2005. The trend came to a screeching halt in 2011, as the justice ministry tightened regulations for South Koreans trying to marry foreigners as part of efforts to crack down on immigration fraud and domestic violence in these households.Employment of foreigners, however, has risen consistently in recent years. There were 938,000 foreign workers in South Korea as of May 2015, up 20 percent from 2012, which is the year when the data was first collected.South Korean companies started hiring immigrants in the 1980s to secure a steady supply of workers in emerging industries. The government became involved in 1993, launching a program training immigrants for South Korean firms, and nearly 160,000 people graduated from this scheme by 2002. Two years later, South Korea announced stricter regulations for employers, requiring them to ensure equal rights for local and foreign employees alike.Due to South Korea's geographic proximity to China, ethnic Koreans from the world's most populous country make up 1 in 3 foreigners here, or 630,000 people. More Chinese people of Korean descent have settled in South Korea since the peninsular country instituted a legal basis for their employment here in 1999.It became even easier for them to enter South Korea in 2007 when Seoul created a Working Visit  visa for ethic Koreans, including those who do not have family ties in South Korea.The worldwide boom of Korean pop culture, known here as ""Hallyu,"" has also brought in an increasing number of foreign students studying in South Korea. Between 2011 and March this year, they increased 20 percent to 106,138, according to the justice ministry.A string of foreigners have become household names in a variety of fields in South Korea. In the 90s, naturalized South Korean lawyer Robert Holley and Ida Daussy from France became popular TV personalities. Lee Charm, a German-born entrepreneur, became the highest ranking foreign official in South Korea by heading of Korea Tourism Organization in 2009. Jasmine Lee from the Philippines became the first foreign-born lawmaker in South Korea after securing a seat as a proportional representative for the ruling Saenuri Party in 2012.As long-term residents grow, households consisting of one or more of them have naturally increased as well. About 1.3 percent, or 278,036, of all households in South Korea were ""multicultural"" in 2015, according to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.Considering the average South Korean household consists of 3.16 people, that means some 880,000 people were part of a multicultural family last year. The same data also showed that the number of multicultural family members jumped more than three-fold between 2006 and 2015. As South Korean families diversify, the government has been forced to shift its multicultural policy from assisting the families' adjustment to helping them find jobs and get educated.Challenges still remain for foreigners living in South Korea. Government policy has centered on foreign spouses even though the profile of a foreigner in the country has become much more diverse.Government programs sometimes overlap from ministry to ministry.Some South Koreans are still reluctant to accept foreigners as part of their community, as a World Values Survey ranked South Korea at 51st out of 59 countries in terms of racial awareness. Some 44 percent of South Koreans felt negative toward foreign workers and immigrants in the same survey, which was the fourth highest ratio among all countries studied.Researcher Oh Jung-eun at the International Organization of Migration Research & Training Center stressed that South Koreans must start learning to view foreigners as equals to them rather than objects for sympathy.""To realize true social integration, South Korea should set policies that allow immigrants to do their part in society and provide them with proper education,"" she said.","rising immigration pushes korea ,immigration pushes korea toward ,immigration pushes korea ,march 94 million foreigners ,rising immigration pushes","['korean', 'South Korea', 'South Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19500481  0.54207373

The state-run institute questioned 8,000 youths aged 18 and younger between 2013 and 2015 to find out the extent to which children are exposed to the environment.The study found that the children aged 3-9 spent 34 minutes a day playing outside, less than a third of the time American kids spent . Canadian children played outdoors for 100 minutes each day. Korean children aged 7-9 spent 36 minutes outdoors per day on average, while they spent twice as long taking extra classes and watching TV, respectively. They spent 34 minutes surfing the Internet.  The lack of outdoor activities is often linked to heightened health risks for children’s mental and physical well-being. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children spend at least 60 minutes in daily unstructured free play which it called “an essential part of children’s physical and mental health and social development.” The body pointed out that children who play outside are less aggressive and have better concentration, among other health benefits. Richard Louv, chairman of the Children and Nature Network, noted in his book “Last Child in the Woods” that the disconnection between children and the natural world causes childhood depression, asthma, obesity, vitamin D deficiency and type 2 diabetes. In terms of the exposure to chemical vapors, fumes or dust in the air, Korean kids aged 5-6 inhaled 10.8 micrograms per cubic meter, while American kids were exposed to 12.16 per cubic meter. When it comes to food intake, Korean children aged 1-2 consumed 2.35 grams of grains, 7.8 grams of vegetables, 10.9 grams of fruits and 1.9 grams of meat. American children of the same age group, in contrast, took a lot less grains  and more meat .The release of the study in the form of a handbook comes as the state-run environment agency plans to systematically compile data on children’s exposure to environmental risks.

98,98,98,Air pollutants blamed for rising birth defects in South Korea: study,"　The number of South Korean babies with birth defects has increased significantly since the early 1990s, likely due to traffic-related air pollutants and endocrine disruptors, a study showed Monday. 　The report, by Inha University’s Social and Preventive Medicine department, researched the national health insurance data of 403,250 infants aged 0-1 living in Korea’s seven metropolitan areas between 2009 and 2010. ...","The number of South Korean babies with birth defects has increased significantly since the early 1990s, likely due to traffic-related air pollutants and endocrine disruptors, a study showed Monday. The report, by Inha University’s Social and Preventive Medicine department, researched the national health insurance data of 403,250 infants aged 0-1 living in Korea’s seven metropolitan areas between 2009 and 2010. It found that 5.5 percent of all infants researched during the period had birth defects, an increase from the 3.3 percent of those born between 1993 and 1994. Among all birth defects reported in the period of 2009-2010, hypospadias -- a birth defect of the urethra where the urinary opening is not on the head of the male genital -- had the highest increase rate of all birth defects from 1993-2010. The prevalence rate of the abnormality increased from 0.7 per 10,000 in 1993-1994 to 9.9 per 10,000 in 2009-2010. Meanwhile, the number of cases of cryptorchidism, the absence of one or both testes from the scrotum, also increased significantly from 2.6 per 10,000 to 29.1 per 10,000.Researchers suggest the increasing number of defects in the Korean newborns’ genital and urinary systems may have been caused by pregnant women’s exposure to air pollutants and endocrine disruptors. Citing overseas studies published in the past, the researchers suggested the increasing number of defects in the Korean newborns’ genital and urinary systems, such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, may have been caused by pregnant women’s exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and endocrine disruptors such as Bisphenol A, which is primarily used to make plastics. They said that an environmental surveillance system needs to be established in South Korea to prevent birth defects. Among all birth defects reported from 2009-2010, genital and urinary tract defects were in fact the second most common condition, with a prevalence rate of 130.1 per 10,000, following heart defects which stood at 180.8 per 10,000. “Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of undescended testis increased during the past half century in industrialized countries,” the paper noted. “A study conducted in China reported an average annual increase in the overall prevalence of hypospadias of 7.34 percent from 1996 to 2008. The authors suggest that environmental exposure might play a critical role in the development of hypospadias.”A 2013 study by Stanford University School of Medicine also found an association between traffic-related air pollutants and malformations of the brain and spine of newborns in California. The Inha University study also suggested that exposure to endocrine disruptors -- chemicals that, at certain doses, can interfere with the hormone system in humans -- may have increased the number of newborns with birth defects in Korea. According to the paper, chemicals such as pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, naturally occurring plant estrogens, bisphenol A and mycotoxins have been reported to affect human pregnancies. This correlates to a French study published last year in European Urology, which found that pregnant women who are exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals at work, such as cleaners, hairdressers and laboratory workers, are more likely to have baby boys with a genital defect. The Korean researchers also found that South Korea’s prevalence rate of spina bifida  -- a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord -- is notably higher than the rates in other developed nations, such as the U.S. , Finland  and Canada . The paper suggested that this may be associated with the inadequate consumption of folate acid among Korean women. “The lack of this nutrient is known to cause spina bifida. … A recent study in Korea reported that only 10.3 percent of Korean women consume folate acid in the periconceptional period.”Meanwhile, cases of Atrial Septal Defect, a congenital heart defect which involves a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the organ, also increased significantly from 9.7 per 10,000 newborns to 117.9 per 10,000, while cases of congenital polycystic kidney disease, a disorder in which clusters of cysts develop within kidneys, also increased from 0.7 per 10,000 to 29.1 per 10,000.

By surveying 1.5 million students aged 11, 13 and 15, the study found that 200,000 of them were obsessed with their devices, with 55,000 of them addicted to both the Internet and smartphones.Notably, the number of 11-year-olds -- fourth graders in elementary schools -- who are at risk of Internet or smartphone addiction increased from the year before, from 40,218 to 49,560. 123RFThe statistics show that more young children are becoming vulnerable to this particular addiction, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said.Symptoms of Internet and smartphone addiction can have negative effects on teenagers and their lives, according to the ministry. Signs of addiction include difficulty waking up in the morning, feelings of anxiousness when they are not online, sleep disturbances and having trouble completing tasks at school and home. Government data showed that children of double-income families and single-parent households were more likely to be addicted to the Internet and smartphones as they tend to spend a significant amount of time alone after school. According to a report released by the Gender Ministry earlier this year, 37 percent of all Korean elementary schoolchildren spend time alone after school as of last year. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, with more than 80 percent of its entire population owning smartphones as of last year. To tackle smartphone and Internet addiction among teens, the country’s Gender Ministry has been running a state-run institution that offers therapy sessions and exercises for teenagers addicted to Internet and smartphones, since 2014.  By Claire Lee","children addicted to smartphone ,korean schoolchildren are addicted ,addicted to smartphone internet ,surveying million students aged ,smartphone internet in korea",['south korean'],14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.85613912  0.408153

According to the report released by the Korean Women’s Development Institute, 16.6 percent of Koreans said in a survey conducted in 2014 that an individual is responsible to finance their own post-retirement years. It showed a 1.7-fold increase from 9.6 percent in 2002. At the same time, the number of those who think family members, including grown-up children, should emotionally and financially care for their aging parents dropped dramatically from 70.7 percent to 31.7 percent over the same time period.  Those who felt that the government and family members should share the cost of caring for elderly parents increased from 18.2 percent to 47.3 percent.Filial piety – caring for one’s parents both emotionally and physically -- has been largely considered as one of the most important traditional values here. Until the mid-1980s, all grown-up children in Korea, especially sons, were “expected to have the responsibility and obligation for their aged parents’ well-being because of the reciprocal dependence of successive generations,” according to scholar Keun Young Chung Peng’s 2000 book “Virtuous Transcendence.”“Parents may depend on all their sons because all their sons have depended on them,” the scholar wrote in the book. “Each son has a debt from his early years that has to be repaid.”The current law also states that all adult Koreans are legally obligated to financially support their spouses, parents and parents-in-laws. Yet with the nation’s changing family structure along with its high youth unemployment rate and expensive living cost, more elderly citizens here are becoming unable to rely on their children to take care of them. As of last year, 1.38 million elderly Koreans were living alone, almost a two-fold increase from 777,000 back in 2005. Those who live alone accounted for 20 percent of the entire Korean elderly population last year. According to a recent study by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, only 4.2 percent of elderly Koreans who lived alone said they didn’t have any problems while living on their own. The biggest proportion of them, 37.2 percent, said the most concerning issue was having no one to take care of them when they were ill. Meanwhile, 24.4 percent of them said they suffer from loneliness and anxiety, while 21.6 percent said they are worried about their finances.The report from the KWDI also found that the proportion of elderly Koreans who receive financial support from their grown children dropped from 40.1 percent to 23 percent from 2005-2014. Meanwhile, the number of Korean parents who sued their children for financial support more than doubled from 135 in 2004 to 262 last year. More than 75 percent of elderly Koreans surveyed by a local pollster last year said “filial duty contracts” – a legal document that makes it mandatory for all grown children to financially care for their aged parents – are necessary should children receive any gifts such as real estate or stocks from their parents. Health Ministry data showed that of 5,772 reported instances of elderly abuse in 2014, 51.1 percent of the abusers were the victims’ adult children. A study last year by the National Pension Research Institute found public transfer payments, such as retirement benefits and living allowance, only made up about 28.8 percent of the average income of the Korean elderly, with almost 50 percent of them living below the poverty line – the highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member nations. In other developed countries such as Denmark, Finland and Australia, public transfer payments accounted for at least 70 percent of the average income of their elderly citizens. By Claire Lee","aging parents fewer koreans ,parents study showed sunday ,parents fewer koreans believe ,16 percent of koreans ,for aging parents fewer","['Koreans', 'the Korean Women ’s Development Institute', 'Koreans']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35865453  0.65059453

IUI is the deliberate introduction of sperm into a uterus or cervix for the purpose of getting pregnant.123rfQuoting data from the World Health Organization and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the researcher claimed that only about 30 percent of all men and women who get treated for infertility worldwide get diagnosed with unexplained infertility. Meanwhile, 52.8 percent of Koreans who received state allowances for external fertilization, and 77.2 percent of those who received the funds for IUI, had unexplained infertility, the report said.  The researcher referred to a 2005 government report which showed that only 21.4 percent of all Koreans with infertility did not know their causes, while 32 percent were caused by men, such as abnormal sperm.In an interview with The Korea Herald, Hwang argued that it is possible that a large number of patients who underwent the procedures may have been either misdiagnosed or not properly tested at all. According to the WHO, a couple is diagnosed with unexplained infertility when the cause of their condition remains unknown even after an infertility work-up, usually including semen analysis in the man and assessment of ovulation and fallopian tubes in the woman. Some of the most common treatment options for unexplained infertility include IUI and external fertilization.“But until 2015, there was no clear definition of what unexplained infertility in Korea’s government guidelines for infertility patients,” she said. “It was only in October of last year that the guidelines specifically stated that those with unexplained infertility are individuals who couldn’t achieve pregnancy for three consecutive years starting from the date that they received their test results - semen analysis and assessment of ovulation and fallopian tubes -- that were normal.”As one of its demographic policies to tackle low birthrate, the South Korean government has been providing state allowances since 2006 for Koreans who suffer from infertility. In 2010, the government started giving allowances to those who wish to receive IUI and external fertilization procedures. To be qualified, each couple has to earn 150 percent of the national average monthly income -- about 5.27 million won  -- or less. For IUI, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won, which covers about half of the total cost, for up to three procedures. For external fertilization, up to 3 million won is given to couples, according to their household income, for up to four procedures. From 2006-2015, a total of 100,993 newborns were born here to parents who received state support for their infertility treatments. The budget for the program increased dramatically from 31.5 billion won in 2007 to 92.5 billion won this year. “Right now we have no data to find out whether the patients were informed of other treatment options other than IUI,” Hwang said. “We currently don’t have much data that could explain to us why the proportion of unexplained infertility patients is so high. All I can say is it is highly likely that they were not tested properly or misdiagnosed. We need a monitoring system and thorough new guidelines, and make sure those who are not unexplained infertility patients get informed about other treatment options available. We also need to do this to better manage taxpayers’ money.”By Claire Lee","75 percent of koreans ,koreans study more than ,infertility high among koreans ,high among koreans study ,among koreans study more","['Koreans', 'Hwang Na - mi', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44973704  0.52174532

This was followed by a lack of skills or experience at 22.4 percent, while health issues and age accounted for 18.3 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.In another poll of 624 respondents, 236 of them, or 37.8 percent, said they experienced inappropriate treatment and discrimination while working. Nearly half cited their North Korean accent as the cause of unfair treatment.As of late last year, more than 28,000 North Korean defectors had moved to the South in search of freedom, but many are facing difficulties in finding work or resettling due to deep-rooted prejudice, according to another report by the human rights commission.The human rights commission poll, meanwhile, showed that when confronted with infringement of their labor rights, 43.7 percent of the 404 respondents said they never tried to tackle the issue head on, but rather opted to exercise restraint.Some 20.8 percent said they solved the problem through dialogue, but 9.4 percent replied they protested the wrong treatment.","many north korean defectors ,north korean defectors aged ,korean defectors face problems ,400 north korean defectors ,korean defectors aged 15","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'the Institute of Unification Studies of', 'Ewha Womans University', 'the National Human Rights Commission']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74950111  0.55656826

The number of illegal immigrants has been increasing steadily from 183,106 in 2013 to 208,778 in 2014, along with the number of tourists who visit the country using the no-visa entry program.South Korea's resort island of Jeju, which actively runs the program, saw the most dramatic increase in the number of illegal aliens.Under the special act for Jeju island, all visitors except for nationals from terrorism-linked countries can enter and stay on the resort island without a visa for up to 30 days if the purpose of their stay is tourism.The number of tourists visiting the island increased from 1 million in 2011 to 1.81 million in 2013 and 2.62 million in 2015, according to the data. In 2015, Chinese nationals accounted for 85.3 percent of the total.The number of tourists using the no-visa program also soared from 113,825 in 2011 to 429,221 in 2013 and 629,724 last year.

Only 2.7 percent said they are not interested in reunification.The foundation is a South Korean government agency tasked with supporting millions of Koreans living outside of South Korea. The survey was conducted by the private Inter-Korean Economic Research Institute during July and August last year at the request of the foundation.As for the need for the Korean unification, 40.7 percent replied that the two countries should become one because Koreans live in the two countries, while 26.3 percent said that Korean unification will help South Korea make the next leap forward. A further 10.8 percent said it will improve human rights.Other reasons cited for the need of unification are to reduce military clashes, which made up 10.2 percent of the responses, and to alleviate the pains of separated families between the two Koreas, which stood at 9.6 percent.China was cited as the most influential country in regards to Korean unification with 51.2 percent of those polled sharing this position, followed by the U.S. with 35.6 percent, Japan with 6.7 percent and Russia with 4.5 percent.If North Korea's Kim Jong-un regime collapses, 29.5 percent of respondents guessed that another Communist regime would be established in the North with China's intervention.However, 22.6 percent of them said that Korean unification will be realized by South Korea taking the lead. Some 20.2 percent replied that collective leadership will be established like past cases in the Soviet Union and China. Some17.7 percent said other family members of Kim Jong-un, such as his brothers Kim Jong-nam or Kim Jong-chol, will take over power.The latest tally showed that 79.5 percent said South Korea will see more development through unification, while just 20.6 percent answered that the country could run into difficulties. The gap between the affluent South and poor North was cited as the biggest stumbling block to unification with 41.6 percent expressing such fears, followed by ideological conflicts with 28.8 percent. The poll showed that unification could cause a rise in crime and regional conflicts, and 3 percent said that there may be more taxes. Nevertheless, most Korean-Americans were upbeat about inter-Korean relations with more than 60 percent anticipating improvements, while merely 6 percent saw the future negatively.On the question of the roles of Korean-Americans for Korean unification, they cited the need to offer more support to the Seoul government's unification policy and diplomatic efforts. They said Koreans living in the U.S. can also do more to improve the human rights situation in North Korea.","of 10 korean americans ,676 korean americans 81 ,of 10 koreans living ,korean americans 81 percent ,10 koreans living","['Koreans', 'the United States', 'the Overseas Koreans Foundation', 'korean', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15276188  0.62246835

Since leaving school, she had stayed only at home and refused to make contact with anyone, becoming a basement-dweller.While typical treatments for her would involve psychological consultations, Gangnam Severance Hospital offered a different approach in helping the patient return to everyday life. Nam was provided with a virtual-reality  treatment to help her ""practice"" encounters she might make on a daily basis.After two months of VR-assisted treatment provided by the Seoul-based hospital, Nam eventually gained confidence in herself and returned to school to continue her studies.Nam is only one of the numerous people who have sought VR treatments to overcome mental illnesses.Treatments based on VR devices are no longer science fiction.Global tech giants have been rolling out various VR devices and content, with many of them being already available on the market.South Korea's tech giants Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. have their own VR devices which connect to smartphones, struggling to create their own ecosystem in the industry.""The study for applying VR technologies to treat disorders started in 2001 in South Korea. The full-fledged development in the program kicked off in 2003,"" said Kim Jae-jin, a professor of psychiatry at Yonsei University College of Medicine.Although applying the VR technology in the realm of psychiatry began more than a decade ago, experts said the latest achievements in the tech industry over the past few years have opened a new era by sparking social awareness of the treatment.""Previously, adopting virtual-reality technology on psychological treatments were costly and complicated,"" said Kim.""As the technology develops, however, such equipment has now become more affordable and simple.""According to the professor, while previous VR treatments involved costly equipment and wires, the development of mobile-based VR technology has made the treatment more accessible.Kim, who manages the virtual-reality clinic at the hospital, added the VR treatment can be helpful in overcoming various mental illnesses from personality disorders to alcohol addictions.The VR-based treatment is not an independent treatment by itself, but a supplement that can help patients better overcome their issues. Patients are provided with VR support along with traditional means of therapy.The treatment at Gangnam Severance Hospital involves entering a dusky, relaxed room. The patient is then given VR glasses equipped with a tracking sensor, so that the screen moves along with the movement of the wearer's head.Doctors can select various scenarios for the patients depending on their problems, such as ""conversation with friends,"" ""dinner plans,"" or ""talking with a boss."" Each situation shows an animated character that starts conversations with patients.The patients then can have conversations with the characters, which are monitored by the doctors. This allows psychiatrists to understand the conditions of the patients, while the subjects can familiarize themselves with uncomfortable situations, such as standing in front of many people.""For example, those who have trouble with cutting alcohol are given scenarios in which they are asked to have a drink by others.This way, they can practice how to turn down such tempting offers,"" Kim said, adding similar approaches can be made for other addictions like gambling.""We can find solutions by having patients interact with avatars. This helps them improve relationships with others,"" Kim added. ""Most of the patients are quite satisfied with the outcomes.The hospital also features VR content that rotates 360-degrees to deliver more realistic experiences to the patients.Gangnam Severance Hospital is not the only institution that has adopted the VR technology for treatments. Bundang CHA General Hospital, located south of Seoul, has also employed the technology to develop patients' cognitive functions.""Although the VR treatment is not an independent cure itself, it can help patients improve their concentration and memory,"" said Professor Kim MinYoung, an expert on rehabilitative medicine at the hospital.""Rather than sell the VR programs to patients, we are currently providing the service to patients struggling with rehabilitation,"" she added.Another achievement made in the VR-medical industry is to provide the patient with a smartwatch that can track heartbeats, which tells medical experts more precise details on the conditions of the subjects.Experts say VR treatment is also efficient for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.""The VR therapy also helps a person who lost a limb from war or an accident. It helps the patient ease the shock by showing himself as before the disaster,"" said Kang Byung-ju, who heads the VR business of Sidenine, a South Korean developer of contents for VR devices. ""It allows the patient to face reality in a more gradual manner.""Sidenine currently develops the VR programs for CHA Hospital.Experts added that the latest boom of VR headsets among general consumers is also a plus for the future of the VR-based medical studies.U.S.-based industry tracker Strategy Analytics estimates the global market for VR headsets to reach $895 million this year.The increase in the number of VR devices sold will lead to a boom of home-based VR psychological treatments, industry watchers added.""Currently, there aren't enough programs available. But hospitals are expressing deep interest in the sector. We can say the treatments are quite effective,"" Kang said.As a wider scope of users are being familiarized with VR technology, patients of various age groups are knocking on the doors of the clinic.According to the hospital, most of the patients seeking VR help are people who are struggling at work. But even the elderly aged above 60 are also expressing interest in hopes of overcoming trauma.""South Koreans are more familiar with VR devices. Those in their 40s and 50s are also accustomed to the latest technology. I believe more people will use VR therapies to fight Alzheimer's, when the generations get older,"" Kang added.""Many say the key areas of the VR industry are gaming and pornography. But I believe that the medical segment is also significant,"" Kang said. ""The market for VR-based medical treatment will jump as more people utilize the technology for simpler activities at home.The rush to tap the VR medical treatment is a global trend, experts said.""Each country has its own area of focus. For example, the United States boasts strong presence in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Kim Jae-jin said. ""South Korea focuses on treatments involving social interactions. In terms of technology, we do not lag behind other countries."" Gangnam Severance Hospital is now starting a new project to lend a hand to those suffering from gaming addiction. As such, South Korean medical experts are tapping deeper into VR treatment, casting a brighter outlook over the industry.""The South Korean government should expand support on promoting the VR medical industry,"" Kim MinYoung said, hoping the country will utilize its top IT and medical technology. She added the latest boom of artificial intelligence also implies another opportunity for the VR medical industry.""On the back of the artificial intelligence , we can significantly improve the quality of the VR treatment,"" Kim MinYoung said. ""For example, the AI can guide elderly patients within VR programs. There is so much potential.""","korean student dropped out ,dropped out of college ,anxiety since leaving school ,south korean student dropped ,korean student dropped","['south korean', 'Gangnam Severance Hospital']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.54071307  0.21800523

The children were all fourth graders in 2011 and were attending middle school as of last year. They were asked questions on their sense of identity and citizenship, as well as multiculturalism.As of last year, more than 80 percent of all marriage immigrants in South Korea were women. The report found that about 25 percent of the surveyed children either identified themselves as hyphenated Koreans, such as Vietnamese-Koreans, or a foreign national, despite holding South Korean citizenship. Each child’s relationship with their parents, especially the foreign-born mother, had the biggest influence on their ethnic and national identities, the report showed.According to the research, schoolchildren whose mothers were interested in their academic performances as well as school life here were more likely to identify themselves as Koreans. Those who experienced bullying in school, those who did not have fulfilling relationships with their Korean teachers, and those who were born overseas and moved to South Korea after one of their divorced biological parents remarried a South Korean national were more likely to identify themselves as non-Koreans. Other studies have shown that foreign-born, naturalized South Korean children are in need of more support when it comes to Korean education and job training, as they are more likely to have a stronger sense of belonging to their countries of origin. A government report released earlier this year showed that more than 30 percent of foreign-born South Koreans aged 15-24 are not in school and out of work, while for 58.3 percent of them, their parents had divorced before they moved to South Korea. “It is important for children of multicultural households to be well-adjusted to the mainstream society,” researchers wrote in the paper released by the National Youth Policy Institute “If they don’t integrate well, it can cause a number of social problems, such as segregation of minority groups as well as discrimination.”However, Ahn Sang-soo, a researcher at the Korea Women’s Development Institute, said there is nothing wrong with hyphenated identities, such as Vietnamese-Koreans or Chinese-Koreans. “I don’t think it is necessary to assimilate all children of multicultural households so they can identify themselves as Koreans,” he told The Korea Herald. “What’s more important is to respect every individual’s sense of belonging and ethnicity while making sure they also feel connected to the mainstream society.”As of this year, there are some 82,500 “multicultural” schoolchildren nationwide. They account for more than 2 percent of all elementary school students in the country.By Claire Lee","koreans study about 25 ,south korean citizenship study ,their south korean citizenship ,korean citizenship study showed ,25 percent of children","['south korean', 'korean', 'south korean', 'the National Youth Policy Institute', 'south korean']",14,"[ 0.          3.          0.         ... -0.758551    0.38891056

But that didn't stop her from wanting to make peace with the first three and a half years of her life, which were spent here with her single mother and then at an orphanage.""I feel a lot of gratitude, I've done a lot of things, but that was the one thing on my bucket list,"" said Kim, who is now a founding member of the U.S. non-profit organization 325Kamra, which seeks to reunite families through DNA. ""That was the inspiration for searching.""The search began with a DNA test five years ago. For Kim, her first close match came in October with a relative on her then-unknown American father's side.The match, who turned out to be her cousin's son, helped her trace her lineage to her biological father, whose name was similar to a name she'd seen on her adoption documentations, just spelled differently.""I figured it was him. Then I contacted the family,"" Kim said.The reaction she got was mixed, as some were welcoming while others would have nothing to do with her. Her deceased father, as she later found out, had planned on marrying her mother and bringing them over to the U.S., but apparently gave up in the face of various administrative hurdles. Interracial marriage was still illegal in most of the U.S. in the late 1950s.""For me, it's significant because it's knowing your line, knowing your ancestors,"" Kim said. ""To me, it's profound to see his photo and see where I get my nose, to know that I'm part German and Welsh, and I would love nothing more than to learn about my Korean side, what my mother looked like, where she came from.""Kim was among thousands of children born to American GIs and Korean women working in camp towns near U.S. military bases after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Because the conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, the U.S. has maintained a troop presence here to this date to deter North Korean aggression.Knowing that DNA could be a game changer for adoptees, Kim and several other biracial adoptees who had experienced similar successes came together in September to launch 325Kamra -- 325 being the number of the hotel room they stayed at and Kamra an acronym for Korean Adoptee Mixed Race Association.This month, Kim and 325Kamra President Sarah Savidakis, another mixed-race adoptee, are in Korea to spread the word about their work and collect as many DNA samples as possible with the 300 DNA kits they brought with them.It's all for free, they stress, and the personal information of those who test will be kept within the organization until a significant match emerges, say, within two generations. Names will appear on public databases simply as ""325kamra.""""It's not just in Korea that adoption is shrouded in secrecy,"" Kim said. ""It's also in America. In most states, adoption records are sealed. They're not open to adoptees. Historically, it's always been kept in secret.""Some estimates put the number of biracial adoptees from Korea at more than 4,000 between 1953 and 1965. Data from South Korea's health ministry suggests more than 7,000 mixed-race adoptees were sent abroad by the late 1960s, but that number includes disabled adoptees. To date, about 200,000 Korean children are believed to have been sent for international adoption.In December, Savidakis made a fact-finding trip to Korea during which she met with a 95-year-old Korean woman whose wish was to meet her daughter.She agreed to a DNA test and the result has been uploaded onto American DNA databases for ""match-making.""The concept is new in South Korea, where DNA testing is only done to prove a relationship between two suspected relatives. In the U.S., however, there are four well-known public databases carrying the DNA of between a quarter of a million and 3 million people. So far, 325Kamra has tested five Koreans.Savidakis, who also found her now-deceased American father and family through DNA, said that while reuniting families is the ideal end result, her organization aims to do more than just that.""We're also here to collect medical history, because a lot of us have had health issues that's genetically linked,"" she said.For example, the majority of 325Kamra's founding members have had cancer.""I've had it and I have also had liver issues,"" Savidakis said.""They  don't know what's causing it. First thing they ask me is: 'Anybody in your family?' I don't know.""Biological families may not want to meet adoptees for various reasons. In some cases, the GIs were married and had children before they were dispatched to Korea. The Korean mothers, meanwhile, often suffer from guilt.What Kim and Savidakis both stress, however, is that adoptees are still entitled to their medical histories.""If I had known there were certain things that were in my medical history, we might have done something that was preventive, and that's what's really important for us, because it's not just for us, but our children,"" Savidakis said. ""We want to keep our children safe. We don't want them to inherit something  be more proactive in their health care.""Anyone who sits down for a DNA test will also be asked to provide information about their medical history.Kim and Savidakis will only be here for a couple of weeks, but there will be others here to continue their work.Kim, who has yet to cross off her wish from her bucket list, made sure to add: ""We would take a photo. So that the adoptee also has a picture of the family member and they would get that as well.""","her korean mother adopted ,her korean mother ,korean mother adopted by ,of her korean mother ,korean mother adopted","['korean', 'Katherine Kim', 'korean', 'american', 'California', 'Kim', 'U.S.', 'Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60880703  0.55297643

He imagined that she would wake him up with a cup of coffee, prepare breakfast and pack him a box of fruits for a snack. In reality, his wife wakes up, grabs juice from the refrigerator and rushes to the office while touching up her makeup on the subway.“I think it would be too boring to stay at home as a housewife,” his wife had said to him.Kim’s ideal morning is becoming less conventional in South Korea, with more than two thirds of 300,000 married couples last year consisting of wives who work, according to statistics released Monday.123rfStatistics Korea said that more couples are working together to make a living, mainly to secure double incomes amid rising economic burdens as well as a higher employment rate among women who are of marriageable age.The number of women who got married while unemployed was 102,915 last year, a 4.7 percent drop from the year before. The number has been dropping since 2011, according to Statistics Korea. The decline was 4.2 percent in 2011, 8.6 percent in 2012, 6.3 percent in 2013 and 10.2 percent in 2014.The ratio of marriages involving unemployed women also continued to fall, with it making up 34.0 percent of all marriages last year, compared to 54.0 percent in 2005.Statistics Korea explained that the trend is also attributable to more people choosing to get married later in life.According to data, in 2015 the average age of women and men who got married for the first time was 30 years old and 32.6 years old, respectively. Meanwhile, among women in their late 20s and early 30s, 68.6 percent and 59.8 percent were employed, respectively. The figures were at 63 percent and 48.6 percent respectively in 2005.“With the continuing economic crisis, marrying at an early age seems like a loss to me, since I would have to contribute my time and money to my new family including my parents-in-law,” said a 29-year-old office worker surnamed Kim.Analysts pointed out that as women become better educated and enter the workforce, they have greater desire to embrace both family and work.“Unlike conventional thought, the main nurturer of a child does not necessarily have to be a woman,” child psychology therapist Kwon Yoon-soon told The Korea Herald.She said, “The quality of time spent with children is more important than the number of hours spent at home nurturing. It is definitely possible for the family to benefit from a working mother as long as they can manage a stable source of nurturing.” In this way, the social pressure felt by involuntary stay-at-home mothers can also be prevented, she added.

Cherry blossom season has finally arrived in Korea, marking the start of spring. As lovely as these cherry blossoms are, it is a bittersweet season for some singles who feel pressured by the many couples that can be spotted enjoying the flowers together. Many Koreans, especially college students in their 20s, believe that being alone is something to be ashamed of. In spring, their anxiety about being single grows. For Park, 21, a college student in Seoul, spring is just another reminder of his loneliness. On March 31, he anonymously posted a message on Facebook saying that he would like to hire a “fake girlfriend” for one day so he could go look at the cherry blossoms with someone. The required activities, he said, would include taking a photo while looking at the flowers and having dinner together. Another condition, he added, was to hold hands so that they would give the impression that they are in a relationship. Around 20 women responded to Park’s message, and he picked one of them to attend the cherry blossom festival in Yeouido with him. Park is not the only individual who would pay for someone’s companionship. Another female college student, Kim, 25, also said on social media that she would pay the minimum wage of 6,030 won per hour for someone to act as her boyfriend for one day and look at cherry blossoms with her. She said in her post that she is too busy to have a boyfriend as she has to work on her college assignments while looking for jobs. Other similar cases can easily be found on social networks. Experts say this new phenomena is becoming common among the young as they are increasingly unaccustomed to making new friends and getting into romantic relationships. Lee Na-young, professor at the Department of Sociology at Chungang University said that children these days depend too much on their parents. When they become college students, they are often afraid to meet new people. There is also the widespread belief that one has to have money in order to be in a relationship.By Bak Se-hwan","young koreans hire dates ,lonely young koreans hire ,lonely young koreans ,bloom cherry blossom season ,popularity among young koreans","['Koreans', 'Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44928291  0.56424075

According to a survey conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the Korean Alliance to Defeat AIDS, 75.6 percent of respondents said they thought most AIDS patients contracted HIV from prostitution. Some 74 percent considered people with HIV or AIDS as those having a promiscuous sex life. The survey was conducted with 1,000 individuals aged 15 to 59 in 15 cities through one-on-one interviews. It aimed to analyze public perception and level of awareness toward HIV and AIDS.More than 70 percent said it would be difficult to get along with neighbors who have HIV or AIDS if they lived close by.YonhapGeneral impressions toward HIV and AIDS were also negative. About 25 percent said words such as “death” and “incurable disease” came up first when thinking of HIV and AIDS, followed by “homosexuals,” “promiscuous life” and “prostitution.” The rest thought of words such as “fear” and “contagious disease.” “Although AIDS is a chronic disease that would not affect life if sufficient care is given, many still misunderstand that AIDS is a serious illness that is linked to death,” the report said. The level of awareness toward HIV and AIDS was also low. Of the respondents, 35 percent thought that they could contract HIV through mosquitoes. Yet, the majority of those surveyed overlooked the possibility of being infected with the virus. Almost 93 percent said they had a low possibility of contracting it, with 40 percent considering the possibility “very low.” Nearly 89 percent said they had never taken an HIV test. When asked about the scenario of being infected, about 40 percent responded that they would live alone without telling others. About 8 percent said they would consider making “a life or death decision.”As of 2014, the number of Koreans with HIV or AIDS in the country exceeded 11,500, with 10 percent newly infected in the same year.By Lee Hyun-jeong","aids patients contracted hiv ,prostitution some 74 percent ,prevalent misperceptions of hiv ,most aids patients contracted ,contracted hiv from prostitution","['South Korea', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'the Korean Alliance to Defeat AIDS']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53367609  0.19669548

Many gave the wrong answers to questions related to sharing food and public toilets, and on epidermal contact such as kissing or shaking hands. Among the respondents, 75.6 percent said HIV-AIDS were mostly transmitted through prostitution, while 74.4 percent said people with HIV-AIDS lead promiscuous sex life. Seven out of ten respondents said they will have difficulty getting along with HIV-positive neighbor. The report said only 0.6 percent of the respondents had actual experience in meeting an HIV-positive person.KCDC is concerned that the widespread misconception toward AIDS may discourage people from learning about the disease. It said that once under control, the disease is merely a kind of chronic illness that is non-life threatening. The level of AIDS awareness was highest in the 40s age group which scored an average of 68.9 points. Following close behind were those in their 50s with 67.6 points and those in their 30s with 66.9 points. Those in their 30s and 20s scored 66.9 points and 63.8 points, respectively. Those between 10 and 19 years old had the lowest score of 55.9 points.

The total amount of investments reached 64 billion won  this year, an increase of 1.3 billion won from 2013. Under the scheme, foreigners who invest about 500 million won or more in the projects designated by the Justice Ministry can get F-2 residential status visas that give them economic freedom here. After five years, they can obtain F-5 visas that allow them to reside in Korea permanently. The investments are used to provide low-interest loans to small and medium-sized enterprises with relatively low credibility. Some 125 companies benefited from the program, the ministry said. By Ock Hyun-ju","in 10 immigrant investors ,immigrant investors are chinese ,10 immigrant investors ,10 immigrant investors are ,investors are chinese","['South Korea', 'China', 'the Justice Ministry', 'chinese', 'Hong Kong', 'Iran']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65714777  0.4302443

Those who live overseas also face difficulties in dealing with language barriers, cultural differences, racism and financial problems.The research, written and published by the Korean Women’s Development Institute, surveyed 1,360 ethnic Korean women living in 20 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan, Russia, and Germany.South Koreans attend an exhibition on immigration in Seoul. Each participant was asked to rate their level of satisfaction in life on a scale of 0 to 4, with 4 being the happiest. The average satisfaction level was 3.25. Those who live in Brazil had the highest level of satisfaction at 3.86, followed by residents in Japan and Russia at 3.83. Women living in Germany, Canada and the U.S. also had satisfaction levels above average.“It is difficult to verify at this point the reasons behind the respondents’ satisfaction level in each country. In general, the satisfaction level tends to be higher in places where the country offers an environment where one is able to adjust to the culture smoothly and with relative financial stability at the start of the immigration,” researcher Lee Soo-yeon told The Korea Herald.The research was partly organized for the Korean government to learn about women’s needs and challenges as ethnic minorities living abroad. South Korea’s Gender Ministry currently runs the Korean Women’s International Network that connects ethnic Korean women living overseas by allowing them to network with one another.The survey also showed that women residing in Guatemala are the least content, with a satisfaction level of 2.95. Those in Columbia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and France also had satisfaction levels lower than the average. One in four of the women surveyed, or 25 percent, said that the language barrier was one of the challenges they faced as an ethnic minority abroad. Another 21.1 percent said they experienced cultural conflicts, with 7.2 percent citing racism. More than 10 percent of the women surveyed also had conflicts with their children and faced financial difficulties.Those who speak Korean and enjoy Korean cuisine as well as those in the earlier stages of immigrating overseas had a higher level of attachment to their Korean origin, researchers said.

This is lower than the average of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.123rfThe study on depression researched a total of 5,937 South Koreans from 2006-2012 in four different sessions. It showed that women whose spouses have retired from work are 70 percent more likely to suffer from depression than those with working husbands.On the other hand, Korean men’s likelihood of developing depression was not affected by their spouse’s employment status. “We think the results were affected by Korea’s traditional ideas on gender roles, that men are supposed to be breadwinners of the family while women should be responsible for domestic affairs and caring for children,” researchers said. According to another study by the KB Financial Group Research Center last year, most South Koreans are short on retirement savings. After surveying 2,906 Koreans aged 25-59 nationwide on their household finances, the think tank concluded that Koreans need an average monthly income of 2.26 million won  for postretirement expenses.However, based on the surveyed individual’s savings, public and private pension plans and other financial assets, they only had an average monthly income of 1.1 million won for their postretirement days. Physician Kang Mo-yeol, who researched Korean women’s likelihood of developing depression and its connection to their spouses’ retirement, said in single-income households the breadwinner’s retirement can affect both the mental and physical health of all the family members. “When a man is the only source of household income, losing that income can change a lot of things for his wife and even adult children,” the researcher said. “The situation can be very stressful if the spouse feels the family is ill-prepared for the postretirement days.”A 29-year-old woman in Seoul whose father recently retired said the change in his employment status a few years ago brought a number of new challenges to her family, especially for her mother. “Prior to his retirement, my father never cooked a single meal and still doesn’t know how to cook or clean,” she said, adding that her mother is stressed although not depressed. She wished her name not to be published for privacy reasons. “Now that he’s at home most of the time, my mother has to cook three times a day for him, not to mention her not being used to spending so much time with him all the time. I hope my father realizes that the situation is different now and if he is willing to change it would definitely help.”By Claire Lee","affects south korean women ,south korean women mental ,korean women mental health ,health south korean women ,korean women mental","['south korean', 'South Korea', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.74315703 -0.0866091

South Korea, the fourth-largest economy in Asia, has the highest incidence rate of TB among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, partly due to the lack of epidemiological research of the disease since the Korean War .Health Minister Chung Chin-youb speaks at a press conference Thursday. “We estimate that some 400 Koreans have been infected with TB since after the Korean War,” said Health Minister Chung Chin-youb at a press meeting in Seoul. “Although state-run health centers performed epidemiological research very thoroughly after the war, things became different after we introduced our national health insurance system in 1989. When the new system took effect, many state-run health centers were replaced by private clinics that focused on treatments rather than epidemiological research on infectious diseases.”The Health Ministry aims to drop the prevalence rate of the disease to 12 patients per 100,000 people, which is the OECD average. In 2014, South Korea marked a TB incidence rate of 86 patients per 100,000, seven times higher than the average rate of the developed nations.The newly introduced measure requires all Koreans to get tested for latent TB -- a condition in which the TB bacteria is in the body but inactive and causing no symptoms -- at least twice in their lives. The first test should be taken at age 15, with the second at 40. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB some time in their lives.Participants to a special event promoting prevention of tuberculosis perform a special dance asking the public to cover their coughs to prevent the spread of the infectious disease in central Seoul, Thursday. “With proper treatment, latent TB patients can avoid developing TB by up to 90 percent,” said Minister Chung. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no developed nation currently requires all citizens to be tested for latent TB. However, Japan and the U.S. made it mandatory for young children to be tested for the disease from 1965-2002, and 1960-1990, respectively. “Japan also struggled with TB after World War II,” Kwon Joon-wook, who heads the Health Ministry’s bureau of public health policy, told The Korea Herald. “The number of newly diagnosed latent TB patients decreased significantly throughout 1965-2002, after requiring all children to get tested twice, at age 7 and 13.”South Korea has recently seen a number of TB cases occurring at facilities with a large number of people, such as schools and postpartum centers. Last year, TB cases were reported in 974 schools, 332 military bases and 91 day care centers and postpartum care facilities. While the number of newly diagnosed TB patients here last year was the lowest in 15 years, new TB patients between 10 and 14 years old increased over the same period. “South Korea is cornered by countries where the incidence of drug-resistant isolates is the highest in the world: India, China, Russia and North Korea,” said Dr. Vincent Delorme from the Seoul-based Institut Pasteur Korea. “With the increase in tourism and ease of travel, combined with the fact that TB is an extremely contagious disease, it is not surprising to see more and more drug-resistant strains circulating in Korea.” The medical researcher also said there is a lack of genomic information regarding TB isolates circulating in South Korea, which makes the epidemiologic studies incomplete.At the same time, Delorme said bacilli has become resistant to more than 10 available TB drugs in South Korea.  This means that only drugs that have been introduced in recent years are now effective, he added.

The study, which surveyed a total of 2,552 single-parent households nationwide last year, revealed that 27 percent of the parents said they have no meaningful social support network at all -- not a single person they can speak or rely on -- when they face financial difficulties. More than 65 percent of the households consisted of single mothers and their children.The report showed that more than 60 percent of all Korean single parents are in their 40s, while 77 percent of them are divorcees. Also, 60 percent of them never received post-secondary education. More than 40 percent of them were relying on government subsidies and 78 percent never received any child support payments from noncustodial parents.A significant portion of the parents -- more than 30 percent -- said they were in poor health. Also, the proportion of those who were suffering depression was much higher than the national average. Although 20 percent of the parents said they were depressed, only about 6 percent of them sought professional medical help. More than half of them said they simply “endured” the symptoms of the mental condition and 21.9 percent said they found comfort in alcohol. The employment rate of the parents was almost 90 percent, which is much higher than the national average. Yet the study showed that a large number of them had very limited job security and were receiving low wages. Some 36.7 percent of them were in contract positions or working as day laborers. Another 15.3 percent of them had their own businesses or worked for family businesses without being paid. The average monthly income of single-parent households was 1.73 million won , which was significantly lower than the national household average income of 3.9 million won.The largest proportion of the parents were working in the service sector and almost half of them worked more than 10 hours a day. As a result of their parent’s long working hours, many children of single-parent households were left by themselves after school. In addition, almost half of the children never spent time with their noncustodial parents.By Claire Lee","south korean single parents ,single parents south korean ,korean single parents ,parents south korean single ,job insecurity depression",['south korean'],14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.69640362  0.13857618

According to the poll by recruitment site Saramin on 1,401 married and unmarried workers, 71.8 percent of women said that tying the knot had a harmful impact on their career, while 75.9 percent of men saw marriage as a boost to their working lives. YonhapMost of the female respondents  cited housework and child rearing as the major factors, followed by the possibility of career interruption , companies having no consideration for married women  and office culture forcing married women to quit .For male workers, 69.6 percent of them said that marriage helps them perform better at work because it gives them emotional stability. Nearly 68 percent said marriage motivated them to work harder. Additionally, 46.8 percent said they benefit from their wives’ support and 21 percent cited economic stability. Out of 386 married female and male respondents, 23.8 percent said they benefited from being married while working.  Nearly 15 percent of them, however, said that they had been discriminated against due to their marital status. They felt discriminated against when their employers forced them to quit their job, excluded them from promotions, gave them an unreasonable workload and pressured them not to take paid parental leave.  The survey seems to reflect the social atmosphere that pressures women to leave their regular employment when they get married or are expecting a child. According to 2014 data by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the employment rate for women aged 25-29 was 68.8 percent, 0.6 percentage points lower than men. But the figure significantly drops to 57.7 percent for women aged 30-34 and to 54.9 percent for those aged 35-39.

The study surveyed a total of 4,000 South Koreans aged 19-74 nationwide last year. It asked them to rate their agreement on a scale of 1 to 6 – with 1 being the lowest – toward 22 statements on multiculturalism, national identity and ethnic diversity among others.  Participants hold up cards with slogans that promote better protection of the rights of immigrant workers, during an event marking International Migrants Day in Seoul in December, 2015. On average, the surveyed Koreans showed a tolerance level of 53.95 out of 100 – with 100 being the most tolerant. This was a 2.78 points increase from 2011. The research findings also showed that tolerance levels were lower than average among Koreans who are low-income earners, those with low education levels and housewives.Ahn said Korean farmers, fishermen and construction workers, as well as those who belong to the same socioeconomic class, may feel that they need to “compete” against migrant workers. According to Statistics Korea, about 90 percent of migrant workers in South Korea are employed in occupations that require physical labor, including farming and fishing. More than 70 percent of all foreign-born workers in South Korea’s farming industry are male, according to the International Organization for Migration’s 2013 report. “Our research showed that Koreans, regardless of their education levels and occupation, who have foreigners as friends, colleagues at work, or relatives, have a high level of tolerance towards immigrants,” Ahn told The Korea Herald. “But those who work in those particular industries – farming, fishing and construction – had lower tolerance levels .”Currently, South Korea’s Employment Permit System, which was introduced in 2007 to attract more foreign workers to the country, makes it nearly impossible for those under the scheme to be granted permanent or long-term residency. The permit is limited to a maximum of 4 years and 10 months. Individuals must live in South Korea for five consecutive years and have general knowledge of the Korean culture and language to become a naturalized South Korean citizen.Given such criteria, the easiest – and practically the only – way to acquire South Korean citizenship is through marriage to a South Korean national. As a result, more than 80 percent of foreign-born marriage migrants in South Korea are women. Kang Mi-ok, assistant professor at Utah Valley University in the U.S., pointed out that South Korea’s immigrant policies are discriminatory against foreign laborers and support international marriages between Korean men and women from overseas. In her book, “Why the  Conservatives Chose Multiculturalism,” she argued that migrant women were thought to be easier to assimilate into Korea’s patriarchal system and that there are not enough efforts made to protect migrant workers from workplace abuse and discrimination.  The research also found that 60.4 percent of Koreans think job opportunities should be given to Korean nationals first instead of foreign-born workers when the job market is down. Also 31.8 percent of them did not want to have immigrants as neighbors. At the same time, a very low number of South Korean adults have participated in educational or social activities on multiculturalism, the report showed. Only 5.5 percent of them have taken classes on pluralism and diversity and 4.2 percent have volunteered at multicultural events or institutions.Researcher Ahn also added that many surveyed Koreans had prejudiced views toward foreigners based on their country of origin. For example, many agreed to such statements: “Workers from first-world nations would be better at their jobs at work than those from developing countries” and “It’s better to make friends with those whose first language is English.” By Claire Lee","migrants survey south koreans ,korean farmers laborers less ,korean farmers laborers ,threatened by migrant workers ,farmers laborers less tolerant","['South Koreans', 'the Gender Ministry', 'South Korea', 'South Korea ’s']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36223853  0.39974338

It takes into account eight factors, including whether the person perceives himself or herself as a global citizen and willingness to befriend a foreigner.South Korean adults scored 54 out of 100 points on the index in a survey conducted between September and November, up 2.8 points from four years ago, the poll designed by the ministry and conducted by Gallup Korea showed.The younger the respondent, the more likely he or she was to be open to other cultures. Adolescents scored 67.63 points, followed by those aged 20-29 with 57.70 points and those in their 30s with 56.75 points.Participation in cultural events positively correlated with cultural tolerance. Those who have been educated on multiculturalism just once scored 56.29 points, but those who took such courses three times scored much higher at 64.03 points.Compared with other developed countries, however, South Korea was behind in cultural tolerance. For instance, some 60 percent of Koreans agreed that more jobs should be given to Korean nationals than others during recessions, according to the World Value Survey conducted from 2010 to 2014. Americans and Australians were more or less divided on the subject, with the Swedes showing the greatest tolerance with 14.5 percent.The least tolerant groups in Korea were those who have immigrants as neighbors and those who work mostly with immigrants.That's because sharing a living space and competing for jobs probably reinforces a negative image of immigrants, the ministry said.With more than 820,000 members of multicultural families and 1.7 million foreigners in South Korea, ""moving towards a multicultural society has become the natural course of Korean life,"" Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee said in a statement. ""True social integration happens when no one gives a second thought to the word 'multiculturalism.'""The minister vowed to implement policies specific to each demographic to better engage the people and expand programs that increase exchanges between immigrants and Koreans.Some 4,000 adults aged 19-74, as well as 3,640 adolescents in middle and high schools, were interviewed for the survey, which is the first Statistics Korea-licensed study on the subject. It had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.91 for adults and 0.94 for adolescents, meaning the scales used in the survey are highly reliable.","koreans more accepting ,koreans more accepting of ,koreans have become more ,more accepting of immigrants ,than before south koreans","['South Koreans', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61986452  0.82853866

The institute surveyed 1,200 men and 300 women aged 15-34 in October last year to look into gender equality and conflicts that arise from gender-specific perceptions and roles. To questions about how they felt toward terms such as “Kimchinyeo,” “Doenjangnyeo” or “Seonggue,” 54.2 percent of men said they identified with them. The terms are wordplays that have been used widely since 2000s to describe some women or South Korean women as a whole. They respectively refer to women taking advantage of men; those with vain preference for extravagance; and those who have undergone massive plastic surgery. Debate has persisted over the reasons behind the phenomenon, including social discontent among the young, sense of crisis in hegemonic masculinity, and stronger emphasis on women’s rights and reverse discrimination.The ratio of women agreeing to the use of the terms was lower at 24.1 percent.The research showed that more men in the younger age group tended to agree with using such terms.Those with “hostile” sexism or those who suffer from conflicts arising from gender roles tended to be fine with using the deprecating terms, the report said.Out of all the respondents, 8.6 percent said they have actually posted writings online or on social media expressing hatred toward women. On a scale of one to five -- with five being the most stressed – measuring the level of pressure they felt from gender roles, the average among male respondents was 2.45. Some of the sources of conflict included: needs for success, power and competition, compatibility between work and home, difficulty in showing emotion, fulfilling family responsibility and restraint in showing affection toward same gender.By demographic group, working men showed the highest at 2.50, while teenagers scored 2.39 and college students 2.42.The paper said the results show that working men tend to feel more pressured to support the family, succeed socially and compete, while being equally burdened with maintaining the “superiority of men.”Majority of the male respondents said they thought women in their 20s and 30s were in the most advantageous social position to live well in South Korea.“This research shows that social criticism toward women among men tend to start from their teenage years, and they go on to believe that young women get more social advantages,” the research said.","more south korean men ,korean men feel disadvantaged ,half of south korean ,sunday more working men ,institute surveyed 200 men","['south korean', 'the Korean Women ’s Development Institute']",14,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.6777699   0.66933072

According to the state-run Korea Health Industry Development Institute’s report, foreigners’ satisfaction rate toward clinics was around 3.82 to 4.30 out of 5 points. The survey was conducted online on some 1,200 patients from countries such as China, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates to analyze the recognition of Korean medical services overseas.The Chinese had the highest satisfaction rate at 4.3 points, with more than 90 percent being at least somewhat satisfied with clinic services here. The Vietnamese gave 3.96 points, followed by UAE nationals with 3.82 points. The reasons for choosing Korean medical services were different across the countries. About 27 percent of Chinese said Korean clinics were good at medical checkups and treatment while 25 percent of Vietnamese said they visited clinics here because of the credibility of foreign medical institutions. About 38 percent of the UAE respondents said they preferred Korean medical equipment. Some respondents, however, said they would not visit Korean clinics again, citing as reasons cost, unfriendliness and inconvenience. The UAE visitors were the most reluctant to return, with about 35 percent of them indicating so, followed by the Vietnamese at 16.4 percent and the Chinese at 15.3 percent. In response to complaints from foreign patients over the past years, the Korean government has been trying to improve the service at clinics and rooting out possible overpricing. The number of foreign patients here has surged with the accumulated number surpassing 1 million last year, the institute said. To boost information transparency, the Welfare Ministry has provided information online about the average cost and time needed for plastic surgery as well as the necessary recovery period. This information has been available in five languages at www.medicalkorea.or.kr since last year. The municipal government also took similar measures. Last month, the Seoul Metropolitan Government released the medical costs of 50 clinics including large hospitals such as Seoul National University Hospital. Late last month, the health authorities also opened a medical support center for foreign patients, offering services such as translation, legal consulting and visa counseling in four languages -- English, Chinese, Japanese and Russian. Starting from next month, the ministry will also allow tax refunds for medical tourists who undergo plastic surgery or dermatological treatments The tax benefits will be offered temporarily only for a year, officials said. Foreign patients must first check whether the clinics carry out the tax refund policy, they added. By Lee Hyun-jeong","korean clinics expressed hesitation ,reluctant to revisit korean ,who visited korean clinics ,korean clinics foreigners who ,revisit korean clinics foreigners","['korean', 'Korea Health Industry Development Institute ’s']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31832787  0.58916765

The organization surveyed earlier this year a total of 5,627 South Koreans, including 674 family members of senior patients who needed geriatric care, as well as 996 health care workers in medical facilities that treat elderly inpatients. The research found that 95.9 percent of the respondents said they are against the government’s decision last year to prohibit geriatric medical facilities from rejecting AIDS patients who wish to be treated as inpatients. Also, 96.2 percent of them said the newly introduced legislation should be abolished. 123RFThe Korean Association of Geriatric Hospitals claimed that most geriatric hospitals here currently don’t have medical experts who specialize in AIDS care. It also asserted that AIDS patients who have tuberculosis may increase the infection risk for vulnerable senior patients, especially those with weakened immune systems due to chronic or preexisting medical conditions.A reasonable solution, according to the organization, would be to designate 23 of the geriatric hospitals as official long-term care centers for AIDS patients, instead of “enforcing” all geriatric facilities equally to accept the government measure.The government, however, labeled such concerns as unnecessary and discriminatory.“Regardless of AIDS infection, a TB patient cannot be treated at institutions that do not have proper quarantine facilities,” said an AIDS policy supervisor at the Health Ministry-affiliated Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who requested not to be named.“The survey contains a number of discriminatory and stereotypical remarks against AIDS patients.”The center‘s data showed that a total of 12,757 AIDS cases were reported in the country from 1985-2014.

According to data compiled by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of foreign patients diagnosed with TB surged nearly threefold from 637 in 2009 to 1,858 in 2014 over the past five years.  As of 2014, 63 percent of the TB patients were men. By age, the majority of TB patients, or 34.2 percent, were in their 20s, followed by 19.7 percent in their 30s, 18.1 percent in their 50s, 17.3 percent in their 40s and 6.5 percent in their 60s.Korea tops the list of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations for tuberculosis occurrences and death rate for the disease. Tuberculosis is a treatable and curable disease, but drug treatment requires that a number of antibiotics be taken for a prolonged period of time, usually six to nine months. According to the World Health Organization, TB is second only to AIDS as the greatest killer among infectious diseases. In response, the government said Tuesday that it would tighten rules for people applying for long-term visas as part of its efforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease in the nation. The Justice Ministry said that in partnership with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it will step up monitoring and screening on foreign visitors from countries with a high record of TB cases. Countries considered at high risk of TB are those that have more than 50 cases per 100,000 people. Health authorities have identified 18 countries, including Nepal, Russia, Vietnam, Mongolia, Indonesia, China, as having the highest risks of TB infection. People from those countries who wish to reside in the country for more than 91 days are required to submit their medical records to the immigration office after receiving a checkup at a state-designated hospital. The health authorities also revealed beefed-up measures for foreign workers not getting treatment or not taking necessary medication despite being diagnosed with TB as well as those suspected of entering the country to benefit from cheap medical costs for TB treatment. The foreign patients, like local residents, can receive medication and treatment free of charge from community health clinics. Foreign nationals suspected of visiting purely for cheaper healthcare or skipping treatment will be put under intensive monitoring by the health authorities, and can be subject to deportation upon their recovery, the KCDCP said. “There are people who we suspect of coming to Korea to treat TB cheaply. We have seen some foreigners who go straight to hospitals to treat TB as soon as they arrive in Korea,” an official from KCDCP told The Korea Herald.According to a 2014 survey by TB-specialized hospitals on 134 foreign patients, 28 percent of them were assumed to have entered the country for cheap medical treatment, she said. “It is more difficult for us to manage and monitor foreign TB patients because they tend to move around the country without a certain residence. And there are also language barriers too,” she said. “We are trying to tighten the monitoring.”But those who are legally staying in the country and have contracted TB can still reside in Korea as long as they receive check-up and treatment under the government’s guidelines, according to the KCDCP.“It is understandable that the government steps up pre-screening on foreign workers to prevent the spread of the disease,” said Lee Kyung, an activist for Human Rights Center for Migrant Workers. “But I am a bit worried that the Justice Ministry might abuse the system to keep foreigners out. Assuming that foreigners enter the country to seek cheap TB treatment -- I don’t think that’s entirely true.”By Ock Hyun-ju","diagnosed with tb surged ,tb surged nearly threefold ,foreigners diagnosed with tb ,patients diagnosed with tuberculosis ,with tb surged nearly","['Korea', 'Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57674599  0.82476127

The average age of the patients was 32.5. They were on average 24 weeks pregnant at the time of their diagnosis.According to the paper, 69 out of 87 women -- 79.3 percent -- chose to keep their babies in spite of cancer. Among them, 68 women -- 98.5 percent -- gave birth to their newborns safely. One remaining patient died while being treated for leukemia during her pregnancy. 123RFThe women were on average 37 weeks pregnant when they gave birth. Their newborns were on average 2.53 kilograms when they were born. Among the 68, 50 percent of the babies were born prematurely, while 36.8 percent were placed in the neonatal intensive care unit. Three babies who were born prematurely died in the early neonatal period. The hospital explained that there are a number of treatment options available for cancer patients even while pregnant. Many of those who were diagnosed in the later stages of pregnancy chose to wait until their delivery to receive the necessary chemotherapy. Also, doctors may suggest inducing labor early to protect the baby from cancer treatments for some women, although it is preferred to continue the pregnancy until natural labor. Some cancer treatments may be used during pregnancy, according to the hospital. Surgery -- removal of the tumor -- poses little risk to the growing baby and is largely considered the safest cancer treatment during pregnancy. While chemotherapy during the first trimester carries risks of birth defects or pregnancy loss, doctors can give several types of chemotherapy without apparent risk to the fetus during the second and third trimesters, according to the hospital. A total of 24 women out of 69 women received cancer treatments while pregnant at the Samsung Medical Center. Abortion is legally prohibited in South Korea except in certain circumstances, such as when the woman or her partner suffers from a contagious disease or when the maintenance of pregnancy could severely injure the health of the pregnant woman for medical reasons. “Cancer during pregnancy is certainly a difficult situation, but it is not impossible to be cured from the disease while delivering a healthy baby,” said Choi Suk-joo, a gynecologist who organized the research at the hospital. “I just want to let the pregnant cancer patients know that there are options available and they need to study these options carefully before making their decisions.”The Samsung Medical Center said they were not aware of any overseas studies to compare the statistics. “We can’t say Korean pregnant women are more likely to continue with their pregnancies after cancer diagnosis ,” said Chloe Park from the hospital’s communication team.

According to Statistics Korea, the economically inactive population holding a university degree stood at 3.34 million last year, up 4.7 percent from a year earlier. (Yonhap)The number of economically inactive university gradua...","The number of Korean university graduates giving up on looking for a job or not working at all has continued to increase, data showed Monday, highlighting bleak job prospects for young people. According to Statistics Korea, the economically inactive population holding a university degree stood at 3.34 million last year, up 4.7 percent from a year earlier. The number of economically inactive university graduates who are neither employed nor have lost a job has more than doubled from 1.59 million in 2000. It broke the 2-million mark in 2004 and 3-million milestone in 2013. The economically inactive population refers to those who are not looking for a job, are unable to work or do not want a job. It includes people who could be suffering from illness or disability, those studying full-time without a part-time job and those looking after young children or the elderly at home. The highly educated accounted for 20.8 percent of the entire economically inactive population, which stands at 1.6 million, up 0.7 percent from the previous year during the same period.The unemployment rate for youths aged between 15 and 29 was 9.2 percent last year, up 0.2 percentage points from a year earlier, marking the highest in 16 years. Of this proportion, the unemployed among university degree holders increased by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent. The employment rate is the proportion of all people aged between 16 and 64 who are in work, while the unemployment rate is the number of people who are unemployed divided by the economically active population. But an official from the Ministry of Labor and Employment told The Korea Herald that the job situation for the young is as not bad as it looks. “It is a predictable result of the population growth, especially those highly educated,” he said. “Also, the employment rate for the young rose at the same time as the unemployment rate. It means that in Korea’s economic context, the young are highly educated, and they struggle to find a job that lives up to their expectation.” Among the economically inactive population with university degrees, the number of those not entering the labor force but instead taking private classes to prepare themselves for better jobs stood at 609,000, a rise of 8 percent from a year earlier.“The young prepare themselves for better-paid jobs rather than taking any job now. The problem is a mismatch in supply and demand for jobs,” he said. “So the government should focus on raising the quality of jobs.”Since 2000, both the youth population and those receiving university degrees have also risen. The population aged 15 and over was 7,031,000 in 2000, but it more than doubled to 15,121,000 last year. The number of those who had secured a job soared from 5,209,000 in 2000 to 11,351,000 in 2015, according to government data. But the job market doesn’t look rosy this year, with the government data indicating that 91.4 percent of enterprises with more than 300 staff members will not recruit any employees.Kim Jong-jin, a research fellow for Korea Labor and Society Institute, pointed out that the government should take the situation more seriously. The increase in the economically inactive population could mean the rise in the number of people involved in irregular employment, he said. “The figures mean that there are more people not entering the official job market, not signing contract, getting under-the-table jobs, which cannot be calculated by the government,” he said. “It will reduce tax revenues, which will in turn cut back on welfare benefits for the poor.” “The government should not only focus on boosting employment rate, but also should take a closer look at the changing job market structure that further disadvantages those on the edge of the society like the young, women and elderly.” By Ock Hyun-ju","inactive graduates hits record ,university graduates giving up ,monday highlighting bleak job ,korean university graduates giving ,economically inactive graduates hits","['korean', 'Statistics Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54018861  0.65110618

Among the participants only 35.7 percent of the travelers said they were vaccinated before leaving for their destinations.Among the vaccinated travelers, the highest proportion of them, 72.4 percent, were vaccinated for yellow fever, a disease that is carried by mosquitoes and can lead to liver failure and death. Also, 29.8 percent of them received DPT vaccine – a class of combination vaccines against three infectious diseases: diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. Among the diseases that are preventable by being vaccinated, typhoid fever was the most common disease contracted by Korean travelers. The largest number of patients contracted the disease during and after visiting India. However, of 214 surveyed travelers who traveled India or Bangladesh last year, only 27 of them, 12.6 percent, were vaccinated for typhoid before visiting.In 2014, a total of 400 Koreans contracted infectious diseases while traveling overseas. Among them, 80.7 percent became ill during and after visiting countries in Asia. The largest number of patients, 93, occurred among those who visited the Philippines, followed by those who visited Indonesia  and India . Among the 400 cases, 41 percent of them were those who contracted Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical disease, although no Dengue vaccine is available in Korea. From 2011-2015 at total of eight Koreans died after contracting infectious diseases overseas. Among them, seven of them died of malaria -- a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted by infected mosquitoes which also has no available vaccine.

Meanwhile, the rate among households with breadwinners aged over 65 increased from 63.1 percent to 63.8 percent. Despite being the world’s 13th-biggest economy, South Korea has the highest senior poverty rate among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations.However, the poverty rate fell from 9.7 percent to 6.3 percent among households with breadwinners aged 35-50, and from 15.2 percent to 12.4 percent among households whose main earners were aged 50-65.Researchers pointed out that it is particularly alarming that more young Koreans are living below the poverty line -- defined as having income of less than half the respective median national income. Amid a sluggish global economy, the youth unemployment rate here peaked at 9.2 percent last year, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. The KIHASA report found that from 2006 to 2014, the market income of the poorest 10 percent of the Korean population continually declined, with an average annual decrease of 4 percent. The study also stressed that the nation’s relative poverty rate based on income before taxes and social security payments increased from 17.6 percent to 17.9 percent from 2012-2014. However, the proportion of Koreans who receive the basic living allowance -- given to households whose income is less than what the government has designated as the minimum cost of living -- which is 1.63 million won  for a four-person family -- in fact dropped from 2.79 percent to 2.64 percent in the same period. The Welfare Ministry has been making continuous efforts to combat poverty in recent years. Starting last year, impoverished people were eligible for full welfare payments if their children or spouses made 4.04 million won a month or less. Previously, all adult Koreans were legally obligated to financially support their spouses, parents and parents-in-law, and welfare recipients lost a portion or all of their allowance if they had a spouse, child, or child-in-law with an income, depending on how much they made. Last year, a report released by the World Economic Forum showed that South Korea’s tax and transfer systems -- such as unemployment benefits and social retirement benefits -- have been failing to substantially reduce inequality.

South Korea's exports account for about half of its gross domestic product.Park said new industries based on new technologies are the solution to address low growth.""We should create a condition, in which young people with good ideas can try to create startups to ensure new technologies and ideas can lead to the country's economic development,"" Park said in a meeting with several heads of startups at an innovation center in the country's central city of Daejeon.She said the government and innovation centers will provide assistance to those who are seeking to launch startups with good ideas.South Korea set up 17 innovation centers across the country to match up local startups and venture firms with conglomerates, which can provide resources to smaller companies so that they can turn creative ideas into real businesses.Park also expressed hope that innovation centers will become a ""stepping stone"" for young people in finding jobs.The innovation centers have provided support to 800 startups, which in turn attracted investments worth 150 billion won , according to Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office.South Korea has been pushing to encourage young people to create startups in a country where many people still do not want to take risks as it is not be easy to bounce back from a business failure.Many South Korean college graduates still prefer to join Samsung Electronics Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and other corporate giants over venture startups.","south koreans launch startups ,koreans launch startups ,thursday to help young ,young people create startups ,koreans launch startups as","['Park Geun', 'South Koreans', ""South Korea 's"", ""South Korea 's"", 'Park']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35171947  0.74385822

148,148,148,Study finds ‘alarming’ level of codeine consumption among children,"YonhapMore than 10 percent of all South Korean outpatients who are prescribed Codeine, an opiate used to treat pain and coughing, are young children aged 12 or under, a study revealed on Monday. 　In a number of places, including the U.S and Europe, this particular drug has been advised not to be used by adolescents under 12 due to possible adverse effects. 　The research, which was written and published by the Korea...","YonhapMore than 10 percent of all South Korean outpatients who are prescribed Codeine, an opiate used to treat pain and coughing, are young children aged 12 or under, a study revealed on Monday. In a number of places, including the U.S and Europe, this particular drug has been advised not to be used by adolescents under 12 due to possible adverse effects. The research, which was written and published by the Korea Food Forum, looked at the national health insurance records of some 1.37 million Koreans who were treated at medical institutions in 2011. Out of a total of 6,298 Codeine prescriptions issued to Korean outpatients that year, 12.3 percent of prescriptions were given to young children aged 12 or under. Throughout the year, almost all Codeine prescriptions to children were issued by small medical clinics. No general hospitals -- government-certified institutions with more than 500 patient beds -- issued Codeine prescriptions to any of their pediatric patients over the same period.“We can conclude that health care professionals at small clinics are prescribing Codeine way too often to young children, and considering the possible adverse effects of the drug, this is very alarming,” the Korea Food Forum said in a statement. Of the children prescribed with Codeine as outpatients, the largest number of them, 365, had sought medical help for acute bronchitis. The second largest number of them, 61, were prescribed the drug for asthma allergies. “Codeine is an opiate and most general hospitals are very careful when they prescribe opiates for any medical condition because it can become a problem when they are inspected or evaluated by the government,” said a physician who wanted to be anonymous. “But small clinics do not really have to care about the evaluations, as it does not affect their reputation as much. Codeine is known to be pretty effective when it comes to treating coughs, and it seems like doctors at small clinics often prescribe it to avoid having to deal with parents who complain that their children’s symptoms are not getting better.”Since 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the European Medicines Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Canadian Ministry of Health have all issued warnings to discourage Codeine use in children under age 12. The drug, which is converted into morphine in the body, can potentially trigger serious adverse effects including breathing difficulties and even death. It is believed that the process of the drug being converted into morphine happens more quickly in some patients, which can lead to high morphine levels in the blood and eventually serious breathing problems. Last year, the European Medicines Agency reiterated that Codeine should not be used to treat coughing and cold in children younger than 12. It also advised against usage of the drug among those between 12 to 19 years old who have breathing problems, such as asthma.The Korean government had also issued a warning to discourage the use of the drug in young children in 2013. “South Korea’s warning was issued much later than other countries, and we assume this is because Korea had been relying on data from developed nations for drug safety ,” the research paper said. The research paper did not mention whether or not the prescription rate of this particular drug had dropped in Korea after the warning was issued in 2013.

The tradition originates from China and was widely used in Asia.From birth, a Korean starts as a 1-year-old and grows older by a year each year as the calendar changes. A 20-year-old, therefore would be 21 years old in Korean age, even if they have had a birthday that year. It’s also the reason a newborn baby who came into the world just two short months ago could already be recognized as 2 years old.A recent survey showed that the Korean public are split in calls for abolishment of the Korean age system, which has been blamed for causing confusion. All official and public documents, for instance, need to specify whether age should be calculated based on their birthdate or by the year.Local pollster Realmeter surveyed 529 adults aged 19 and over asking whether Korean age should be maintained. Of the respondents, 46.8 percent said Korean age should be maintained, while slightly less than 44 percent said age calculation should be unified. YonhapBy age group, 50.7 percent of those in their 30s hoped to abolish the Korean age notion, while 52.8 percent in their 20s wished to keep the Korean age tradition. Most in other age groups said Korean age should be maintained.By political inclination, both conservatives and progressives narrowly preferred using Korean age with 52.7 percent and 49 percent respectively. Legally, Korea’s civil law has been counting age based on one’s birthdate since 1962. But Korean age is still widely used socially as the preceding measure in comparing each other’s ages. Age remains one of key factors defining hierarchy and relations both personally and professionally in Korea. Some say the Korean age calculation dates to agrarian society where seasonal changes and the length of a year were prioritized. Some also say it is based on an idea that the nine months spent inside a mother’s womb is counted. But as confusion persists in mixing and using two versions of one’s age, most other East Asian countries have decided to abolish the dated aging system. Japan, for instance, enacted relevant laws in 1902 to officially use the universal age count, as did China in the late 1970s. North Korea is also said to be using age based on the date of birth.In South Korea, however, there are still cases in which the “Korean age” takes precedence. The juvenile protection act, for instance, recognizes the start of adulthood based on the year the person turns 19.","korean age for expats ,from birth korean starts ,asia from birth korean ,birth korean starts ,birth korean starts as","['South Korea', 'korean', 'China', 'korean']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53786451  0.66004586

The organization calls for annual exposure levels to be maintained below 50 mSv per year.The latest report showed that while the overall average was below the ICRP recommendation mark, exposure differed by profession. The exposure level of radiographers, who have to deal with X-ray machines, reached a relatively high 0.85 mSv, while numbers for doctors and radiologist was much lower at 0.34 mSv and 0.31 mSv, respectively.""Closer attention paid by medical institutions and better monitoring systems are contributing to people being placed at less risk from excessive radiation,"" the KCDC said. It, however, stressed there is plenty of room for improvement, especially since the number of medical experts who have to deal diagnostic equipment is on the rise following greater public demand for medical checkups.In 2014, there were 71,096 people engaged in radiology-related work, up 7.8 percent from the year before.

The research found that 59.4 percent of the grandparents found child care physically demanding and exhausting, while 41 percent of them said they had to give up their social life to care for their grandchildren. Also, 73.8 percent said they would like to stop caring for their grandchildren if they were given the option to do so. The surveyed grandparents were on average caring for their grandchildren 6.69 hours daily. Those who cared for children aged 3 or under, in particular, were on average spending 10.57 hours a day. According to most, or 99.2 percent of all surveyed grandparents, the care included bathing, changing diapers, feeding and picking up the infants or children at the day care, among other tasks.  “We also found out that many of the grandparents are also cleaning the house and cooking while caring for children at the same time,” researchers said in the report. “We suggest expansion of government-certified nannies or domestic workers to ease their workload.”The proportion of double-income households increased in South Korea from 27.9 percent in 2010 to 31.2 percent in 2014, according to the latest report released by the Gender Ministry. The government report also showed that most Koreans rely on family members in the event that they suddenly need someone to care for their children such as in the case of an emergency or when they are ill or abruptly called in to work. While 79.8 percent of parents said they get help from their family, 15.5 percent said they have absolutely no child care options available in such situations. Notably, only 0.5 percent of parents said they use the babysitting services provided by the Gender Ministry.The KWDI report found that 45.4 percent of the surveyed parents said they chose to rely on their parents because they feel the safest when they leave their children with them. Also, 19.5 percent said they utilize the government’s child care services, but they need their parents to take care of the infants once the service hours are over, as their work ends late at night. In addition, another 11.4 percent said their children are too young to be left with a stranger. Participants listen to tips on taking care of babies during a class arranged by the Busan office of Korea Population, Health and Welfare Association for grandparents taking care of their grandchildren. Meanwhile, 67 percent of the grandparents said they offered to help because they wanted to support their grown-up children’s career. At the same time, 42.8 percent said they decided to help as they didn’t find any child care services reliable enough for their grandchildren.When asked about what the government should do to support double-income households, 44 percent of the grandparents said parental leave, variable work schedules and leaving as soon as their shift is up should be guaranteed. Also, 35.6 percent said there should be more child care programs provided by the government. The KWDI pointed out that a growing number of Korean double-income couples are relying on their parents for child care for at least four hours daily as most government programs, such as public day care centers, end the regular program at 4 p.m. The think tank suggested offering financial allowances for grandparents who care for their grandchildren ranging from 300,000 won  to 500,000 won monthly, depending on the child’s age. It also suggested providing child care education for grandparents and government-certified nannies to assist them when in need.  While 61.6 percent of the surveyed grandparents agreed with the idea of reinforcing government policies to encourage more grandparents to care for their grandchildren, 86.9 percent of the surveyed parents have done the same. The 38.4 percent of the grandparents who disagreed with the idea said the policies may put their health at risk and isolate the elderly population from their social lives. South Korea has one of the lowest fertility rates among developed nations, currently 1.21 children per woman. Poor work and life balance of married couples, as well as the nation’s increasing number of young Koreans who prioritize education and career over forming a family, have been reported as major causes.

The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the North’s government body that deals with inter-Korean affairs, pledged on Thursday to immediately expel all South Korean nationals from the park. It also declared the industrial area as a military zone.“The Park Geun-hye clique, who are traitors to the people, will pay the most miserable price for halting the Gaeseong complex,” the Korean Central News Agency quoted the CPRF as stating.“This provocative measure not only puts an end to North-South relations, but it is also a complete denial of the June 15 joint agreement and a dangerous war proclamation.”The CPRF also claimed that the North’s hydrogen bomb test and satellite launch, carried out in early January and last weekend respectively, were an exercise of sovereign rights.Such elevating tensions in the shaky inter-Korean ties signals a red light for other peaceful gestures such as the reunion of separated families.Since it was established by the inter-Korean summit in 2000, the factory cluster has faced frequent roadblocks, such as temporary suspension and access control, but this is the first time that South Korea has declared an all-out halt that could lead to permanent shutdown.“The  government made it clear that the reactivation of the park should be preceded by the North’s sincere measure to give up its nuclear and missile disarmament,” said Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Dongkuk University.“But North Korea is not likely to give up its weapons easily, in which case the closure will remain permanent.”Located just North of the truce line and consisting of 124 companies and some 54,000 North Korean employees, the Gaeseong industrial park has been a symbol -- and the last bastion -- of inter-Korean reconciliation.The two Koreas, since establishing their respective governments in 1948, shut each other out in enmity. Their conflict peaked in 1950 when the communist North’s then-leader Kim Il-sung invaded the South with ambitions to unify the peninsula by force, starting the three-year Korean War.It was only in 1990 that the two states finally sat down at the same table and adopted the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement and pledged nonaggression and exchange.Despite the hard-reached agreement, however, inter-Korean relations remained frigid throughout the 1990s, mostly due to the North’s withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1993.The game-changer was liberal President Kim Dae-jung who, after a series of unfruitful vice-ministerial talks, succeeded in holding the first-ever summit with his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il in 2000. Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung meets late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il at Sunan Airport in Pyongyang, North Korea for the first inter-Korean summit held in June 2000. The Korea HeraldIt was based on their Aug. 15 agreement that the Gaeseong industrial zone started production in 2004. A total of 616 billion won  has been sank into the facilities so far, in addition to 1.19 trillion won in infrastructure, operations and other administrative expenses, according to the Unification Ministry.In April 2013, shortly after the current conservative Park Geun-hye administration took office, the North suspended operation of the park in protest against the South’s joint military drills with the United States. But the two states reached a normalization agreement five months later, with the North expressing regret for the suspension and the South pledging to keep the park in operation under all political circumstances.By Bae Hyun-jung","pullout sets koreas decades ,divided koreas 42 years ,sets koreas decades back ,sets koreas decades ,koreas decades back it","['Koreas', 'South Korea ’s']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59040302  0.82458013

Her husband, who lives in another province due to work, returns home on weekends. “When we were living together, we would spend at least an hour talking to each other every night. Now, we only talk about twice a week. Most of our phone conversations don’t last 30 minutes.”Kim belongs to an increasing number of South Korean married couples who spend less than 30 minutes a day talking to one together. According to a report released by the Gender Ministry on Thursday, the proportion of couples who converse less than 30 minutes a day increased significantly from 2010 to 2015, from 16.6 percent to 29.2 percent. The proportion of those who said they never talk to one another also increased from 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent.“I don’t think I have a lot of choice,” Kim said, when asked about the amount of time she spends talking to her husband. “I’m the main caregiver for my children now, and I don’t have a lot of time on my hands. Also, now that I mostly raise the children on my own, there are fewer things to discuss with my husband.”The report, which surveyed members of 5,108 households nationwide last year, showed that more Koreans, regardless of their age, are spending less time with their immediate family members. From 2010 to 2014, the proportion of single-person households, as well as double-income households increased significantly, from 15.8 percent to 21.3 percent, and 27.9 percent to 31.2 percent, respectively. Also, the proportion of married couples who only see each other on weekends also increased dramatically from 1.7 percent to 5 percent in the same period. The survey also showed that 37 percent of elementary school children spend time alone after school, while 63.7 percent of school children live with a single parent who has no caretaker to look after their children after school. This raises concerns about the children’s safety and lack of interaction among family members. YonhapThe report also showed that more Koreans are unhappy with their marriages. While 6.4 percent of all married couples in 2010 said they were dissatisfied with their married life, 11.6 percent of them said the same in 2015. The proportion of those who said they were happy with their marriages decreased from 56.9 percent to 51.2 percent in the same time period. In particular, 31.7 percent of all married couples said they suppress their feelings and do not take any actions when they have a problem with their spouse. Only 0.2 percent said they seek professional help. To tackle the issue, the Gender Ministry announced that the government is increasing the number of support centers for double-income households and working parents, from six last year to 82 this year. The programs include tips on work and life balance, consulting on labor rights, as well as classes on parenting, marriage and family life.  “We found that married couple who spend more time talking to each other are in general happier in their marriage,” said Yoon Hyo-sik, the director general of the family policy bureau of the Gender Ministry.The report also showed that most Korean parents rely on their spouse, parents and other family members in the event that they suddenly need someone to care for their children such as in the case of an emergency, when they are ill or have suddenly been called into work. While 79.8 percent of the parents said they get help from their family members or relatives, 15.5 percent said they have absolutely no child care options available in such situations. Notably, only 0.5 percent of parents said they use the babysitting services provided by the Gender Ministry. “We have allocated more budget for this year’s babysitting program,” said Yoon from the ministry. “The budget increased from 78.7 billion won last year to 82.8 billion won. I believe only about 50,000 households benefitted from the service last year. We’ll do our best to reach out to those who are in need.”Kim Ji-eun said she is very lucky to have her parents, who have agreed to live with them to help her with child care. Still, even with their help, she said she was extremely unhappy when both of her children were younger. Both her and her husband’s jobs required long hours at work, and it was challenging for them to take care of their children after returning home. When asked to rate the quality of her life on a scale of one to five  – five being the happiest – she rated one out of five for the days when her daughters were babies. “For my life right now, I would rate four out of five. Things have gotten better as my children grew older,” she said. “But when they were young, I was constantly sleep deprived, tired, and felt inadequate at both at work and home. The babies would cry all night. It’s hard to talk when your own basic needs aren’t met.” By Claire Lee","months her husband ,returns home on weekends ,18 months her husband ,months her husband who ,more koreans interacting less","['Kim Ji - eun', 'Seoul']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47294244  0.62708527

COOP breaks away from this convention by establishing a cooperative system in which all members are considered both employees and owners. A total of 161 cooperative members invested 4 billion won  for the initial capital. As members, the drivers receive dividends based on how much funds they inject as well as profits earned. Cab drivers do not have to share their daily earnings with the company. Korean corporate taxi drivers are usually required to pay around 130,000 won of daily fees to taxi operators every working day. Such fees sometimes lead to drivers being choosy about customers based on travel distances in order to earn more money to meet the daily fees. The cooperative also has a relatively small fleet of cabs at 76. This enables it to keep a ratio of 2.4 drivers per taxi, thereby, providing more off days for drivers, said Korea COOP Taxi. Generally, taxis are run by one or two drivers, resulting in at least 12 hours of driving a day. To ensure safety and efficiency, the cooperative also limits the length of time each vehicle is used to three years. This also reduces the fatigue of drivers while improving passenger satisfaction, added Korea COOP Taxi. Other operators normally use cabs for up to five years. “I believe our cooperative has practically shown how humans can control capital not the other way around. We are attempting to expand human-oriented capitalism not a money-oriented system,” the chief of Korea COOP Taxi Park Kye-dong told The Korea Herald. Park, a former two-term lawmaker, came up with this innovative taxi system.He entered politics as a lawmaker in 1992 and served another term from 2004 to 2008. He also made a living as a taxi driver for nearly a year in 2000. Park explained that he had started to envision the cooperative system and ways to apply it on existing industries while he was serving as a National Assembly secretariat chief between 2008 and 2012. He later went on to take over a cab business and relaunched it under the new business model.COOP’s unique profit-sharing system and better welfare conditions have, consequently, contributed to higher income for drivers. As of last month, the cab operation rate by the cooperative reached 98.8 percent, which is about 30 percent higher than other taxi firms. The cab operation rate indicates how frequently each taxi is in operation over 24 hours. The extra income of drivers also nearly reached 300,000 won a month, which is 60,000 won higher than other non-COOP taxi drivers. As a result, the overall monthly income of the COOP drivers reached about 2.45 million won, including 1.3 million won of basic wage, 500,000 won of dividends and around 600,000 won of extra profits made individually. The average monthly income of corporate cab drivers is round 1.3 million won. Given the better work conditions, more drivers are seeking to become a part of COOP. The number of cooperative members has risen to 200, including 180 drivers. About 500 new drivers are also on the waitlist to become COOP members. Candidates who apply to be part of COOP are required to go through a series of tests including aptitude and physical examinations. They are also strictly screened for any past incidents of car accidents and drunk driving, said the cooperative. Although newcomers must pay 25 million won each for the initial capital, the financial burden is small due to loan programs coordinated by the company, private banks and the city government, said Park.  “Only 5 percent of drivers have paid the initial capital in cash. Most of them have been allowed to borrow the fund and pay back the principal over five years. For those with low credit or delinquent borrowers, we also provide other types of loan programs.” Despite growing interest in COOP, the cooperative cannot immediately hire more drivers in Seoul due to a lack of garage space for cabs. Currently, Korea COOP Taxi is using a 2,300-square-meter large parking lot in western Seoul. The cooperative is looking for more land so that it can expand its business, city officials said. They added that better work conditions have also improved service quality. “Most passengers welcome COOP Taxi as they think it’s safer and nicer while the fare rate is the same,” said a Seoul City official who is in charge of cab measures. He has regularly driven a COOP Taxi to monitor the system and to gather public feedback. COOP Taxi’s expansion is not limited to the capital city. It rolled out its service in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, last month. It will also be making its way to Incheon and Busan later this month. Talks are also taking place in Daegu and other cities, said Korea COOP Taxi.According to COOP officials, the cooperative is currently trying to transform itself into a social enterprise. Companies that are designated as social enterprises can benefit from social insurance services, tax cut and other benefits. By Lee Hyun-jeong","industry coop taxi launched ,taxi launched in july ,shake up taxi industry ,coop cabs shake up ,taxi industry coop taxi","['COOP Taxi', 'Korea']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41450971  0.15701456

Researchers asked the participants to rate their level of stress on a scale of 1-4, with 4 being the highest level and 1 being the lowest .  It showed that 37.9 percent of the surveyed Koreans rated levels 3 and 4, while 56.2 percent picked level 2. Altogether, 94 percent of the participants said they were experiencing stress with various levels of intensity. “The fact that almost 40 percent of adult Koreans are experiencing high levels of stress shows that many of them are experiencing conflicts and problems at home and work,” the researchers noted. “One of the stressors could be also limited job security and unemployment, among other things.”The research also found that high earners, men and those who belong to double-income households are more vulnerable to stress. While 43.8 percent of the male participants rated their stress levels as 3 and 4, only 32 percent of the surveyed women said the same. Among those who made 2 million won  monthly or less, 27.8 percent answered they tended to, or definitely, felt very stressed, compared to 37.9 percent who said the same among those who made 6 million or more. The comparative figure was 38.6 percent for those who make between 2 and 4 million won, and 41.6 percent of those who make 4 to 6 million won.Also, dual income married couples were more stressed than single-income couples, the study showed. While 46.4 percent of double-income couples rated the intensity of their stress as levels 3 or 4, 30.3 percent of single-income households rated the same. Interestingly, the study found that married couples, regardless of their income, were less stressed than Koreans who are single; while 37 percent of married Koreans rated their levels as 3 or 4, 41.7 percent of single Koreans did the same. The study also surveyed a total of 1,665 teenagers aged 14-18 who have been bullied at school. Among them, 40.9 percent said they were very stressed because of the experience, while 31.6 percent said they were extremely stressed while being bullied. Notably, 66.7 percent of them said they had no one to speak to about the experience, and no one has ever noticed their problem or volunteered to help. Although the KIHASA did not provide statistics on adult Koreans who have been bullied at work, another study by Saramin, an online recruitment website, showed in 2012 that 45 percent of 2,975 working Koreans who participated in the research said they had a coworker who was bullied. Among them, 61.3 percent said the bullying problem was very serious, and 58.3 percent said they had a colleague who quit their position after being bullied. According to the OECD data last year, 28 percent of Koreans said they have no meaningful social support at all -- not a single person they can rely on -- in times of crisis. This rate was the highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. As of last year, South Koreans worked the second-longest hours among OECD countries. The country is also notorious for its high suicide rate -- the highest in OECD -- with up to about 40 people taking their lives every day.

The research interviewed a total of 1,342 Koreans and divided them into three age groups -- 21-41, 42-56, and 57-76 -- to examine social mobility by generation. YonhapThe research found that older Koreans had more personal control over their fate than the younger generation. While those with higher education degrees had a better chance of getting quality jobs regardless of their parents’ socioeconomic status in the past, young Koreans nowadays need financial support from their parents to earn degrees that are prestigious enough to get them secure jobs and housing, the researchers said, claiming it to be a sign of increasing inequality in the country.  “South Korea’s rapid economic growth was possible because people wanted to climb the social ladder, and they believed escaping poverty was possible as long as they worked hard,” the researchers said in the report. “This also led to the country’s collective enthusiasm for education. But the increasing social immobility among the country’s younger generation may lead to slow economic growth as when one feels she or he has limited control over their own life, the person is less likely to try anything new or productive.”For all generations, the higher the father’s academic achievement was, the more likely the offspring would be similarly educated and therefore have access to more social resources. The trend was more noticeable among the youngest group of the three.In the youngest group for instance, 89.6 percent of those who received higher education also had university-educated parents. The comparative percentage was 79.7 percent for 42 to 56-year-olds, while it was 64 percent for those aged 57-76. For all generations, if the father had a middle school education level, 16.4 percent of the sons or the daughters had the same education level. If the father had graduated at least from high school, nearly 0 percent of the offspring dropped out of high school.Parents’ education levels also had an influence in the children’s academic performances in all age groups, profoundly among the youngest Koreans. In the youngest group, only 6.5 percent of those who had stellar academic performances had parents who never attended high school. The comparative figure was slightly higher at 7.4 percent for 42-to 56-year-olds, and 12 percent for those aged 57-76By occupation, if the fathers worked in an office or had professional jobs, 37.1 percent of those aged 21-41 and 56.4 percent of those aged 42-56 had the same types of jobs. Among the youngest generation, in particular, 9.4 percent of those working labor jobs had parents who did the same, which was fivefold higher than the overall average of 1.9 percent.Researchers claimed their findings show it is becoming harder for the younger generation today to climb the social ladder than for those who are older, and social immobility can create a collective sense of despair and hopelessness among young Koreans. “Many young people feel that no matter how hard they try, they cannot live a better life than their parents, or they cannot succeed unless they have parents who can financially support them,” they said in the report. “And such sense of despair, when shared by many, can eventually lead to social conflicts and economic losses.”The research also showed that only 22 percent of young Koreans in their 20s and 30s think diligence is an important asset for success, while 43 percent of those aged 50 or older thought the same. Also, only 32 percent of the young Koreans said they considered education as important in their lives. The report pointed out that one’s educational level has been one of the greatest indicators of his or her socioeconomic status in South Korea, and that it is increasingly difficult for schoolchildren to achieve high academic performances without the help of their parents because of the hypercompetitive education system, as well as high private education costs. “In South Korea, parents have two options to help their children to have more opportunities and succeed -- bequeath their wealth and properties or invest in their education,” the report said. “Those who don’t have much to bequeath would more likely invest more in their children’s education. And that’s why many Korean children’s life opportunities largely depend on their parent’s financial ability to invest in their education.”Researchers said legislation should be revised to guarantee equality of opportunity for schoolchildren and young Koreans by banning or punishing well-off parents who enroll their children in prestigious universities or have them avoid serving the mandatory military service in illicit ways. By Claire Lee","prevalent among younger koreans ,among younger koreans ,social immobility becomes harder ,younger koreans in their ,among younger koreans in","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'Koreans']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36067209  0.36536857

Only Korea and Japan scored less than 40 percent in the subjective health survey.Countries like New Zealand, the U.S. and Canada showed up in the high 80s to 90 percent on average.Despite the prevalent concern, Koreans’ life expectancy was recorded at 81.8 years, higher than the OECD average of 80.5 and among the best among member countries, the report titled “Health Status and Health Care Use of Koreans” said.“The difference in perception and life expectancy derives from social and cultural views on health,” KIHASA said. “Different views on weight played a role.”The institute said that South Koreans generally tended to equate obesity with bad health and that, compared to other OECD members, they were more likely to believe they were overweight. It also said women were more likely than men to think they were fat.Koreans also spent double the time at hospitals of the OECD average. In a year, Koreans spent an average of 16.5 days on hospital beds, compared to the OECD’s 8.3.YonhapWhile the number of beds at hospitals increased drastically in the past decade, the number of doctors per 1,000 people as of 2013 was 2.2, the lowest after Turkey  and Chile .Korean doctors, therefore, treated an average of 6,487 cases in a year as of 2011, 2.7 times the OECD average.

Failure to do so can lead to the boat and crew being detained.Chinese boats for years have favored fishing grounds near South Korea because excessive fishing has depleted stocks near their own shores. The proximity of South Korea to Chinese ports makes the country's EEZ attractive.The ministry said 911 ships that applied to fish in South Korea's exclusive region this year, accounting for 61 percent, operated in the same waters in 2015. ""If the 558 boats that were granted access last year but had their permits revoked after they engaged in illegal fishing activities are counted, almost all boats that fished in South Korea's EEZ in 2015 are back in 2016,"" an official said.He also said that while there is a slight dip so far, the actual number of Chinese boats that eventually fish in South Korean waters this year may be on par with 2015, since squid catching boats that only start operations in October have yet to apply for permission.The ministry said most boats that applied for permits said they will catch corbinas, Spanish mackerel and hairtails, with most coming from the Liaoning, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces. Effort will be made before the start of the fishing season to get Chinese fishermen to attend programs outlining the need for sustainable fishing practices, it said, adding the ministry said it will also strengthen monitoring of illegal activities and clamp down on violators that abuse their rights.","2016 chinese fishing boats ,in 2016 chinese fishing ,2016 chinese fishing ,boats also decreased percent ,chinese fishing boats requesting","['chinese', ""South Korea 's"", 'the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86400348  0.21685013

The low income bracket refers to those who earn less than 60 percent of the median income for all Koreans. The degree of depression felt by the low income bracket was 2.7 times higher than non-low income earners.The report, based on a survey of 7,188 households across the country in 2015, showed 6.22 percent of low-income earners thought about suicide compared with 1.43 percent of the people in other brackets.One percent of low-income earners made plans to kill themselves and 0.16 percent actually attempted suicide last year, higher than 0.16 percent and 0.02 percent for non-low income brackets.The degree of depression felt by people in the low-income bracket was 10.5 out of the full 60 points, much higher than 3.9 for those in higher income brackets. Less than half of low-income earners subscribed to medical insurance. The subscription ratio for those in the low income bracket was 31.79 percent compared with 87.7 percent for other income bracket people.As for smoking and drinking habits, low-income earners smoke and drink less than those in higher-income brackets. The smoking rate for low-income earners was 15.1 percent, compared with 20.14 percent for people with higher incomes. About 77 percent of those in the low-income bracket don't drink at all or drink once a month compared to 55 percent for richer people, according to the report.","income koreans more suicidal ,koreans more suicidal than ,koreans more suicidal ,suicidal than richer people ,low income koreans more","['South Koreans', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69085377  0.50026262

As a rule, temporary workers are paid less so they naturally are less likely to have money saved up vis-a-vis their full-time counterparts.Even for those who claim to have an after-retirement plan, most are totally reliant on a public pension.Nearly 78 percent of full-time workers said their retirement plan consists mainly of money they can get from the state pension program. Most added they are not pouring money into private pensions or investing in stocks, bonds or real estate to augment their incomes later on.This, the institute said, can pose problems, since the income replacement rate of public funds is actually falling as the government moves to give back less.""If people rely solely on pensions they may find themselves in difficult circumstances,"" the report stated.

They made up 14.2 percent of all schoolchildren who agreed to participate in the research.Among them, 19.2 percent survived an attempted suicide.  The research by scholar Kim Jae-in found that the teens who had suicidal thoughts after being physically abused tended to improve their condition when given support and care from those around them.However, those who suffered from suicidal thoughts and depression at the same time, and those who had already plotted or attempted suicide, did not see improvement in their conditions even after receiving emotional support.“Teen suicide survivors, and those who have already planned their suicide, need professional attention and intervention,” Kim said in her paper. Counselors work at a welfare call center in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, where counseling is offered for various health and welfare-related issues including suicidal thoughts and abuse. Yonhap“Only 0.4 percent of teenagers visit counseling centers. The authorities should make it mandatory for all schoolchildren to receive mental health check-ups regularly, and take those who are in need of help to mental health professionals.”Meanwhile, 74 percent of the suicidal teens said they were constantly stressed, and 7.7 percent were treated at medical institutions after being physically abused at home and school.Only 24.9 percent said they rely on their family when they are faced with difficult situations, while 40.4 percent said they can seek support from their friends in times of struggle. A very small proportion of them, 2.6 percent, said they can rely on their schoolteachers in such a situation.A seperate study by Yonsei University on teen suicides found that Korean teens who are addicted to smartphones are more likely to commit suicide than those who aren’t. The research also suggested that smartphone addiction is a greater indicator of teen suicides in South Korea than gender, family structure, and socioeconomic status.

Researchers showed that 43.7 percent of all surveyed adult Koreans were anxious because of financial insecurities. The biggest portion of the adult participants, 25.3 percent, said they were anxious about their postretirement expenses, while 18.4 percent said they were anxious about unemployment, possible layoffs and insufficient income.The research findings are similar to a 2012 study by the National Assembly Budget Office, which found that South Koreans in every age group -- except teenagers and children -- thought of committing suicide the most when they were faced with financial difficulties, from 2006-2012.Notably, 48.9 percent of participants in their 30s, 40s and 50s said financial stress was their biggest cause of suicidal thoughts.  The research by KIHASA found that Koreans who are older, who have low income and low-education levels and those who have limited job security tend to suffer anxiety more often. All participants in the survey were asked to rate their level of anxiety for their personal future and the future of Korean society on a scale of 1 to 10 -- 1 being the lowest anxiety level. The average anxiety rating for personal future was 5.4, while it was 5.6 for the future of the country.Most, or 36.6 percent of the adult respondents, said they worried the most about the possible slowdown in economic growth in terms of South Korea’s future. The second largest 21.7 percent, said they were anxious about infectious diseases, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome. Children and teenagers, meanwhile, were seen to be more anxious about the future of society, rather than their own lives. They gave an average of 4.7 points out of 10 in terms of anxiety felt for their own future, with the level being higher among girls  than boys .The older they got, the more anxious they felt, which researchers said could be attributed to the stress that comes from moving from middle to high school, as well as from the pressure of preparing to enter university.They gave an average of 6.6 points to the level of anxiety they felt for society, with the majority of them pointing to the country’s ever-changing school curriculum and standards for college entrance exams. They also cited politics, foreign affairs and overall security.The research found that teenagers who have been bullied, who have low self-esteem, those who feel society is unequal and unsafe and those who have a diminished sense of belonging to their families and friends had a higher chance of suffering anxiety. “This study suggests that special programs to deal with anxiety problems should be developed and implemented nationwide,” KiHASA researchers wrote in the report. “Anxiety management should be included and acknowledged as mental health treatments.”Overseas studies have shown that financial stress is linked to health problems like depression, indigestion and sleep disorders. Research by the Center for Credit Union Innovation and Filene Research Institute in Wisconsin, U.S., found in 2002 that chronic financial stress is linked to a cycle of increased workplace absenteeism, depression and poor workplace performance. According to a report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released in 2015, an average of 29.1 Koreans in 100,000 committed suicide in 2012, the highest among developed nations and about 2.5 times higher than the OECD average of 11.9. Suicide was the fourth most common form of death in the country in the same year. South Korea’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio reached 180 percent, the highest in its history, in the third quarter of last year. According to Statistics Korea, a single Korean household on average had debt of 61.81 million won  as of last year, and was spending 24.2 percent of their earnings to pay off their debt.

The report also showed that women took on much more of the household chores burden, as they spent some three hours a day on child care and housework, while men spent only 40 minutes a day. The income disparity was also apparent by gender. Men earned about 2.9 million won  a month, whereas women earned 1.8 million won a month.

171,171,171,Marriage stress may fuel Korea’s low fertility rate: study,"Marriage and financial stress, rather than child care-related struggles, may have a bigger influence on a Korean mother’s decision not to have more than one child, research by a state-run think tank suggested.　Contrary to the popular belief in Korea that child care stress can significantly reduce the mother’s desire to have a second child, the study, written and released by the Korea Institute of Child Care and Ed...","Marriage and financial stress, rather than child care-related struggles, may have a bigger influence on a Korean mother’s decision not to have more than one child, research by a state-run think tank suggested.Contrary to the popular belief in Korea that child care stress can significantly reduce the mother’s desire to have a second child, the study, written and released by the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, showed that wives with lower household income or who are unhappy with their marriage were most likely to keep their family small.Meanwhile, a mother who was happy with her marriage was more likely to have a husband who was actively involved in child care, have a first baby with good sleeping patterns, not have many marital conflicts or parenting-related stress and was more likely to decide to have a second child, the researchers said. Marriage stress may have a bigger influence on a Korean mother’s decision not to have more than one child, a research suggested. The study surveyed 416 Korean mothers with a single child on the couple’s marriage satisfaction, income levels, second pregnancy planning, the husband’s participation in child care, child care-related stress and other factors. The study suggested that the nation’s demographic policies should pay attention to the quality of marriages among young couples, which are largely affected by long work hours and sexist work environments that, among other things, do not guarantee male workers’ rights to paternity leave. The research noted that many mothers who were dissatisfied with their marriage had a spouse who was not involved with child care, although the husband‘s support, or lack thereof, with parenting was not cited as a direct influence to the wife’s decision to have a second child.“As a baby grows older, his or her needs change,” the researchers wrote in the report. “Our research findings may suggest that as mothers learn that their babies don’t need their constant attention and support as their first child gets older, they become less overwhelmed about parenting and having a second child.”The research suggested that the current policies do not address how dissatisfied marriages can also be one of the factors behind the low fertility rate. “We have also found that fathers who are satisfied with their marriages are more likely to be involved in child care,” the report said. “We need a labor system that guarantees one’s right to be with their family regardless or his or her gender. “We need more companies that value family life, and more people should be educated on how both men and women, and marriages in general can benefit from gender equality.”South Korea has been making efforts to tackle its low fertility rate, which stood at 1.21 children per woman last year. The nation’s increasing number of delayed marriages, largely resulting from a high youth unemployment rate and expensive housing and education, has been considered one of the biggest factors behind the statistic.Some demographic policies to tackle the situation have included offering free diapers and infant formula, designating priority seats for pregnant women, housing benefits for newlyweds and even matchmaking services.According to the latest data from Statistics Korea, 27.2 percent of all divorced couples in 2014 were those who had been married for four years or less. In total, nearly half -- 48.7 percent -- of all divorced couples in that year were those who had been married for nine years or less. In its effort to decrease the divorce rate among young couples, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has been offering free classes for engaged couples on how to build successful marriages, including how to plan -- and avoid unwanted -- pregnancies, how to merge finances once married and how to successfully share responsibilities on domestic affairs and parenting, since 2013.By Claire Lee","influence on korean mother ,korea low fertility rate ,korean mother decision ,marriage stress may fuel ,on korean mother decision","['korean', 'Korea', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care', 'Ed']",14,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60833842 -0.02534066
