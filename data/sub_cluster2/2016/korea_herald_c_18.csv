In their first four-way meeting since the governing Saenuri Party’s split earlier this week, the floor leaders from the ruling and opposition parties decided that the session will take place from Jan. 9-20.    They also agreed to accelerate efforts to build a parliamentary committee for Constitutional amendment. The basic law was last revised in 1987 when the nation embraced a direct presidential election, ending a decadeslong era of military dictatorship. “I understand the people‘s concerns over this new four-party system, but we will uphold the spirit of cooperation during next year’s Assembly,” said the Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun who hosted the whip meeting.But such a roadmap is likely to face challenges as opposition parties seek to overhaul key initiatives of the president, who was suspended from power upon being impeached over the corruption scandal tied to her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.Floor leaders of the four main political parties pose with National Assembly Speak Chung Se-kyun at the parliament in Yeouido, Seoul, on Friday.

Joo Seung-yong of the People‘s Party, Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party of Korea, Speaker Chung, Chung Woo-taik of the Saenuri Party and Joo Ho-young of the New Conservative Party for Reform. Topping the list are the decisions to deploy an advanced US missile battery in South Korea and adopt state-authored textbooks for secondary education. Park had pushed for these policies until she was impeached earlier this month over a corruption scandal involving herself and her close aides.To achieve the goal, the opposition camp relies on their overwhelming majority in the 300-seat National Assembly. As of Friday, they had a combined total of 201 seats, while Saenuri holds 99 seats as their dissenters launched a new party with 30 lawmakers. “We will build a forum to discuss how to enact bills to overhaul ,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, Floor Leader of the Democratic Party of Korea, asking for cooperation on the measure from his counterparts at People’s Party and New Conservative Party for Reform, Saenuri defectors’ new party. Earlier in the day, Woo said that his party would push to pass the bills in next year’s National Assembly whose first regular session is scheduled to take place this February. In the meantime, the party would launch a task force to prepare for the legislation to clear the Assembly.  The opposition parties, however, has struggled to present a united front as their stance differed over contentious policies. Their ideological spectrum ranges from Saenuri defector’s conservatives and central-liberal’s from the Democratic Party and People’s Party.For example, Saenuri defectors maintained that THAAD was crucial to countering North Korea’s growing military threat and that the measure should be implemented as planned. They vowed to inherit Saenuri’s hawkish stance on Pyeongyang. The Democratic Party and People’s Party, however, demanded the government reserve their decision until the new president takes office next year.

The country’s 300-seat unicameral parliament now has four negotiating groups, from the previous three, with the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea being the largest. Reflective of their elevated status on the floor, the Democratic Party’s 121 lawmakers moved to the center of the plenary hall, an area previously held by Saenuri members. Saenuri has been moved to the right of the hall. The remaining seats on the left side of the hall are distributed among the People’s Party, the New Conservative Party for Reform, and lawmakers who do not belong to any of the four floor-negotiating groups. The floor seats have been rearranged in order of each party’s size. The country's 300-seat unicameral parliament now has four negotiating groups, from the previous three.Saenuri, after the breakup, now has 99 seats compared to its previous 128. The runner-up People’s Party has 38 seats and the splinter group from Saenuri, tentatively named the New Conservative Party for Reform, has 30.The 30 lawmakers of the New Conservative Party left Saenuri and formed their own group Tuesday, resulting in four major political parties for the first time in Korea since 1990. During Thursday’s session, lawmakers decided to form a special committee for constitutional revision. The committee will consist of some 35 lawmakers from the four major parties and one from a minor party. When the motion passes, the new committee will be initiated Sunday and will work until June 30. The approval ratings of parties have also seen some changes. According to pollster Realmeter on Thursday, the Saenuri defectors group placed second in approval ratings, with 17.4 percent, surpassing Saenuri’s approval ratings, which stood at 15.8 percent.The Democratic Party had the highest ratings, at 33.7 percent.With the opposition holding the majority in the parliament, liberal parties are seeking for the swift passage of bills. The National Assembly Advancement Act requires the approval of more than three-fifths of lawmakers to put contentious bills to a final vote on the floor. Although the act prevents the majority party from unilaterally passing controversial legislation, it is thought to have slowed the progress of the National Assembly in the passage of bills. Saenuri’s split came after President Park Geun-hye’s impeachment by the parliament on Dec. 3 amid the political scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.  By Jo He-rim","assembly plenary session thursday ,300 seat unicameral parliament ,democratic party 121 lawmakers ,parliament now has four ,plenary session thursday officially","['the National Assembly ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'the Democratic Party ’s']",18,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.25771198  0.40204912

Critics say the discussion should be delayed until after the Constitutional Court delivers its ruling on Park's impeachment. The committee may lose steam if the court confirms the ouster of Park, as South Korea will have 60 days to hold the presidential election, giving not enough time to continue the discussion, they said.","national assembly on thursday ,first plenary session since ,the lawmakers will debate ,largest party in parliament ,assembly on thursday","[""South Korea 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party', 'Democratic Party', 'Saenuri']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56584585  0.04475104

Ban, whose term is to end Saturday, is expected to return to his home country and shape up his road map for the earlier-than-planned presidential race next year.The new party Wednesday held a forum to discuss its party platform, policies, as well as an official name.Floor Leader Rep. Joo Ho-young  and Chief Policymaker Rep. Lee Jong-gu of the New Conservative Party for Reform speak at a forum at the National Assembly in Yeouido, Seoul, Wednesday. “What we must do is to convince  that our party may achieve what conventional conservative parties have been unable to do,” said Floor Leader Rep. Joo Ho-young.“It is crucial to embrace the core values of conservatives, while pointing out clearly what they should reform and change.”The notable tone of the Saenuri defectors was that they claimed to have the authenticity of the nation’s leading conservative cluster while cutting off all ties with the Saenuri name. Though policy details are yet to be revealed, gestures have been detected from key members that the new party wishes to expand its political leverage into the centrist-reformist sector, moving a step away from the conservative.“We will definitely take a different stance from Saenuri when it comes to conglomerate reforms and welfare policies,” said the party’s chief policymaker Rep. Lee Jong-koo.Rep. Yoo Seong-min, one of the main figures of the new party, also confirmed the new party would keep a conservative stance on national security issues and a reformative one on other issues related to the people’s livelihood.“Reformative conservatism means that we will add new reformative moves in sectors such as economy, welfare, labor, education and child care so as to protect our community from collapsing under inequality and polarization,” he said.The drastic gesture at reform was seen as one of the reasons which led to Rep. Na Kyung-won taking back her earlier pledge to join the new party. Rep. Na, despite her firm position as a non-Park figure, did not join the group of 29 defectors Tuesday.But the new party was still cautious in hinting at these reformative moves in a subtle manner, so as not to distance itself from the considerable number of conservative-leaning voters who may yet be undecided on whether to support Saenuri or the splinter group.The opposition will eventually have to contend with the conservative parties at the upcoming presidential race.“The new party, in order to prove that it is indeed better than the pro-Park  clique, should actively participate in legislating reformative bills at the February parliamentary session,” said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chief of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.“I fear that their binary way of dividing national security and economic issues may be but a plot to grasp conservative votes and that it will do little to solve problems.”By Bae Hyun-jung","conservatism the new conservative ,news focus new party ,new conservative party for ,reflecting the new political ,the new conservative party","['the New Conservative Party for Reform', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51588058  0.49382785

Yoo Seong-min of the tentatively named New Conservative Party for Reform said during an interview with MBC Radio. Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the tentatively named New Conservative Party for Reform Moon, a former head of the main opposition Democratic Party, is currently running neck and neck with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in public polls among potential candidates as the next president. Yoo is also included in the list, although his approval rating hovers in the single digits.Yoo said Moon's protests against the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system in the country lead to doubts about his views on national security. While South Korea claims the battery will improve the country's defense capabilities against the North, the opposition bloc has been claiming it will only lead to unwanted diplomatic tension with Beijing.Moon also has been under fire for allegedly playing a part in contacting Pyongyang and getting feedback that was then reflected in Seoul's decision-making process on a UN vote, Yoo added.A memoir by a former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon released earlier this year claimed Seoul abstained from voting on the 2007 UN resolution on North Korea's human rights after hearing Pyongyang's views, and that Moon was involved in contacting the North.Yoo also cited Moon's remark where he said he plans to visit North Korea before flying to Washington if he becomes president.Concerning speculation he does not always see things in the same way as Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who is a major shareholder in the new party, Yoo stressed that while there are minor differences, he strongly trusts Kim.The lawmaker then said he hopes Rep. Na Kyung-won of Saenuri will join the new party. Na earlier claimed she would leave Saenuri but later said she needed more time to determine the sincerity of the new party.""Na said she will join the party in January, but I understand there are some different media reports,"" Yoo pointed out.The first group of 29 lawmakers, along with another who left Saenuri earlier, vowed to establish a new party Tuesday, expressing discontent with the loyalists of President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached earlier this month over corruption.","party concerned about moon ,security lawmaker who bolted ,leading presidential contender ,in leading presidential contender ,lawmaker who bolted from","['Saenuri Party', 'Moon Jae - in', 'North Korea', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'New Conservative Party for Reform', 'MBC Radio']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71459353 -0.12997167

They criticized the Park allies for ignoring the people's wishes and defending President Park in the corruption and influence-peddling scandal.The new party aims to win over conservative voters disenchanted with Saenuri and the Park administration.The group said it will seek to turn the latest scandal into an opportunity to reform the country and recover the true values of conservatism.The conservative party has been dogged by a factional feud even before the general election in April. This has since been fueled by the scandal that broke out in late October. The president was impeached by parliament earlier this month after being named an accomplice of her friend's wrongdoing. Park has consistently claimed that she is innocent of the charges leveled against her, and vowed to prove it in court.The Saenuri dissenter group initially expected 35 lawmakers could leave. Twenty-nine members handed in their resignations to the party, with more expected to join in early January.The preparatory committee for the new party is headed by Rep. Choung Byoung-gug and Rep. Joo Ho-young, with other key figures, including Rep. Yoo Seong-min and Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who formally served as floor leader and chief of Saenuri, respectively.Saenuri, meanwhile, focused efforts on preventing further exodus of its lawmakers.""I am disappointed. But since they are leaving, I hope they will become the party loved by the people,"" Saenuri's interim-head nominee In Myung-jin said. In, however, told party leaders to persuade the remaining lawmakers to stay.""The dissenters earlier claimed the number will reach 35. As they did not meet the goal, we can say they failed in the first round,"" said Rep. Chung Woo-taik, the floor leader of Saenuri. ""If there is energy to separate the conservative bloc, we need to focus it on reforming the party.""""I hope the separation did not come out of personal political interests,"" Chung added.","29 lawmakers formally departed ,29 lawmakers leave group ,party on tuesday declaring ,as 29 lawmakers leave ,splits as 29 lawmakers","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the New Conservative Party for Reform']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.86916047  0.09746925

It immediately suspended her from all powers and the prime minister has since been working as acting president.The final decision lies with the Constitutional Court which will have up to six months to deliberate whether to oust the president. In its views submitted to the court on Friday, the ministry said that the impeachment process ranging from the vote to relevant document filing met all legal requirements. It also mentioned core issues, related theories and similar cases in the U.S. and Germany.""As a ministry in charge of legal affairs, we provided legal opinions, core issues and procedures related to the impeachment from an objective viewpoint in a way that they can help the court's deliberation and decision,"" the ministry said. The ministry, however, did not include its opinions on allegations involving the president.The move was in response to the court's request seeking advice. In the impeachment of late president Roh Moo-hyun in 2004, the ministry also offered its opinions on the case to the court. At the time, the ministry argued against the impeachment, saying that its process and cited reasons cannot be accepted. The court later rejected the parliament's push to force Roh to step down. Meanwhile, investigation into President Park and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil accused of masterminding diverse corruptive deals has been accelerating. In a related probe, Kim Chong, a former vice culture minister, was summoned by special prosecutors early in the day to face questioning into his suspected role in aiding Choi in pressuring large conglomerates to donate money to her foundations.","vote to impeach president ,to impeach the president ,parliamentary vote to impeach ,to impeach president ,to impeach president park","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'the Constitutional Court', 'the National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3810344   0.15920125

The remaining lawmakers, meanwhile, have appointed an emergency leadership. “The new party will represent the true conservative  and set its core principles to center around citizens,” Rep. Choung Byoung-gug said after a meeting of Saenuri defectors early Friday morning. Thirty-four Saenuri lawmakers announced their intention to defect en masse on Wednesday. They plan to officially leave the conservative ruling bloc next Tuesday. Tentatively called “New Conservative Party for Reform,” the envisioned party will formally launch in the middle of next month before Lunar New Year’s Day, around Jan. 20, Rep. Choung said. The new party is open to coalition with other political parties and lawmakers, the lawmaker said. Former Saenuri Party chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung  and the former party whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min attend a meeting held to discuss a plan to establish their own political party on Friday. Two former Saenuri Party chiefs, Reps. Kim Moo-sung and Yoo Seong-min -- who are among the 34 -- have made clear their intentions to join the new group, although the exact number of founding members had not yet been revealed Tuesday, explained Rep. Hwang Yeong-cheul, who had been speaking for the group of defectors. The move came as an internal feud between two party factions -- a larger group still loyal to President Park Geun-hye and more reform-minded members critical of the scandal-ridden president -- deepened following the Dec. 9 impeachment of Park. The conservative president has been mired in an explosive political scandal, accused of having allowed her civilian confidante Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs and having colluded with her to extort funds from major conglomerates. Also on Friday, pro-president lawmakers remaining with the Saenuri Party appointed a new head for its emergency leadership committee -- a pastor named In Myeong-jin who formerly chaired the party’s ethics committee. “The party’s factions have crossed the Rubicon,” said Saenuri Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik, expressing disappointment at the dissenters’ plan to form their own party.Rep. Cho Won-jin, a pro-President Park loyalist, called it a “groundless and irresponsible act.” The Saenuri Party is currently the largest political party in South Korea by representation, controlling 128 seats of the 300-member National Assembly. After the breakup, its presence will be reduced to 94. The party has been suffering from dwindling public support since the presidential scandal erupted in October. In a poll, conducted by RealMeter between Monday and Wednesday, public support of the party stood at 20.2 percent, rising 3 percentage points from the previous week. The Saenuri Party’s main opposition rival, the Democratic Party of Korea, garnered 35 percent in the same poll. Saenuri defectors, conscious of widespread voter disillusionment with the conservatives who have been in power for two consecutive administrations, said their new party will be “totally reformed” and will open their headquarters to citizens. “We will reject any kind of hegemonies, regardless of who becomes the party chief. The headquarters would be like an open square for people to share opinions,” said Rep. Hwang.The party members would chip in the funds for the new party while it also brings in citizens’ donations. The appointment of the party chief and other leadership positions will be decided in the launch process, he added.

But it said her legal offense was not serious enough to strip her of her status as a lawmaker.When sentenced to a fine of 1 million won or more, a lawmaker loses his or her seat in the 300-member National Assembly.During a press conference in March, Choo claimed that the decision to retain the district court in Gwangjin-gu, her constituency in eastern Seoul, was made because of her request to Son Ji-yol, the then chief of the National Court Administration, before a 2004 parliamentary election.Choo also said that after her loss in the 2004 election, she failed to block the relocation of the court to Songpa-gu in southeastern Seoul. But Son has denied that he had pledged to hold onto the court in Choo's constituency. Based on this, prosecutors pressed charges of illegal electioneering earlier this month, demanding that the court sentence her to a fine of 3 million won.Choo has claimed that the prosecutors' accusations against her were wrong and politically motivated.","665 for illegal electioneering ,illegal electioneering but allowed ,won 665 for illegal ,for illegal electioneering ,court fines opposition leader","['Seoul', 'Choo Mi - ae', 'Democratic Party', 'the Seoul Eastern District Court']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43714401  0.16042484

Four more are set to follow suit, they revealed. “We decided to part from the fake conservatives and agreed to establish a new core to lead true conservative politics,” Rep. Hwang Young-cheul, representing the rebel group, said in a press meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul. Their defections, however, are not immediately effective, as they picked next Tuesday as the date for their departure.   Members of the dissenting faction of the ruling Saenuri Party pose for a photo during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday, announcing their decision to break away from the party The move came as the factional feud reached its peak in the governing bloc following the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. While the Saenuri Party’s leadership remains loyal to Park, their opponents, belonging to the “non-Park” faction, have been demanding an overhaul of the party to regain voter trust.This is the party’s first major splintering since its establishment and is likely to spark significant changes in South Korea’s political landscape ahead of the 2017 presidential election.There were similar attempts by lawmakers to quit and establish new political parties in both the liberal and conservatives wings in 1995 and 1997, but the numbers did not reach the minimum requirement of 20 needed to form a negotiation body at the National Assembly.  The leaving party members include sixth-term lawmaker and former head of the ruling Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Moo-sung and former Floor Leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, whom the defecting group tried to place as the chief of the party’s emergency planning committee before the loyalist leadership rejected the notion. Rep. Kim asked forgiveness for disappointing the citizens and fellow party members for supporting President Park in the first place. “I have always believed Korea will change if the conservative party is warm and righteous. But I have decided that such revolution is impossible in the current Saenuri Party,” said Rep. Yoo, adding that he seeks to start a new “honorable” party.The remaining lawmakers loyal to Park strongly condemned the defecting members’ decision, calling it a “groundless and cowardly move.”Pro-Park Floor Leader Chung Woo-taik also showed disappointment. “I am sorry the non-Park faction decided to leave the party, and particularly disappointed that Rep. Yoo had not talked about this with me before,” he said. “I will do my best to persuade those who announced their decision to leave before Tuesday.”Chung was elected as the floor leader last week, beating Rep. Na Kyong-won from the non-Park faction.If a new political party is formed, it would be the first time since 1988 there have been four main political parties, with the two major liberal parties -- the Democratic Party of Korea and People’s Party -- and conservative Saenuri Party. Regarding the defecting proportional representatives who would lose their Assembly seat by seceding from the party, Rep. Hwang requested the Saenuri Party leadership cancel their party membership, which would allow them to retain their positions.By Jo He-rim","35 lawmakers to quit ,their defection wednesday ,declared their defection wednesday ,lawmakers to quit saenuri ,party is finally splitting","['South Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64003766  0.29850549

The figures include Rep. Yoo Seong-min and Rep. Kim Moo-sung, the former floor leader and the chief of Saenuri, respectively.The group said at least 35 lawmakers will opt to leave, which would be enough to meet the minimum number of 20 needed to form a negotiation body at the National Assembly. ""Although we tried to seek a reform and revolution at Saenuri, we have reached a conclusion that the goal is impossible,"" Yoo said.While the non-Park faction earlier proposed that Yoo should head the party's emergency committee and be granted full authority, the plan was turned down by the loyalists, who claimed that dissenters should just leave instead of inciting further internal conflict.Last week, loyalist Rep. Chung Woo-taik was elected as the floor leader, beating his competitors from the anti-Park group, which also came as a disappointment for those critical of the running of the party.""I have always dreamed of a generous and righteous conservatism,"" Yoo said. ""To start anew, we decided to leave the party for the kind of conservatism we can proudly show to the younger generation.""Yoo said he has no plans to reconsider his choice, even if the loyalists decide to accept him as the emergency committee chair.Dissenters and Park loyalists have collided openly since the outbreak of the influence-peddling scandal surrounding the president and her confidante Choi Soon-sil.The group said it would seek to establish a new conservative power that can win the upcoming presidential race, which could take place a few months earlier than the original schedule of next December if the Constitutional Court approves the impeachment.""We agreed to take a new path to seek a true conservative political platform,"" Rep. Hwang Young-cheul said. ""Our goal is to fight against the hegemony of Park, as well as Moon Jae-in."" Moon, is a former Democratic Party leader, who is viewed as a favorite among the opposition bloc in the presidential race.The announcement marks the first major departure, since Gyeonggi Gov. Nam Kyung-pil and Rep. Kim Yong-tae left Saenuri in November following the public uproar surrounding the scandal centered on the president and her close friend. Political observers said around 40 lawmakers may bolt from Saenuri, which would be enough to make them the third-largest political body in parliament, outpacing the 38 seats held by the People's Party. Park loyalists condemned the plan, calling the dissenters ""cowards"" and ""whiners.""""After losing the vote on picking the floor leader, they have decided to leave. It is like small children whining for things they want and later deciding to run away from home ,"" a loyalist lawmaker said.""They should have left when the parliament discussed the impeachment. But they were just calculating political interests and made the decision just now without any justification,"" he added.Another loyalist said Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, who exerted influence on state affairs, should be blamed for the scandal, not the president herself. There have been growing calls by conservatives to reassess the scandal and not rely on ""biases"" generated by the local press and liberal-leaning civic groups at the core of impeachment rallies over past weeks. These groups, they argued, have opposed Park all her political career and cannot be viewed as being fair.

The court deliberation could take up to six months. The court will determine whether to remove the beleaguered leader from office or reinstate her. Should it decide to unseat her, the country is to hold a presidential election within 60 days of the decision. ""I understand that the president will send her written opinions to the court today,"" the source told Yonhap News Agency, declining to be named. ""As far as I know, her legal representatives are currently putting the finishing touches on the document.""The document is expected to include Park's rebuttals of the grounds the Assembly has cited for impeachment, observers said. The legislature has listed 13 charges-- five constitutional violations and eight legal offenses.Park is suspected of playing a role in pressuring local conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations that were controlled by her friend Choi Soon-sil. The president is also alleged to have allowed Choi, with no official post, to exert undue influence on the government, including presidential affairs and even top-level appointments.Park has denied all these accusations, calling them ""unfounded.""Upon the submission of her document to the court, the list of Park's attorneys is expected to be made public.","president over corruption scandal ,last friday to impeach ,rebut impeachment grounds president ,assembly voted last friday ,the president over corruption","['Park Geun', 'the Consitutional Court', 'the National Assembly', 'Park']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28226212  0.32824567

But his recent actions have indicated a significant degree of political ambition.Opposition parties on Thursday urged Hwang to participate in next week’s parliamentary interpellation.“The prime minister may be acting as the presidential authority but is not a properly elected leader of the people, and should fulfill his duty to the legislature,” said Rep. Yun Ho-jung, chief policymaker of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Acting President and PRime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn  presides over a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on Thursday. Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Hur Won-je had on the previous day spoken for Hwang, saying that he finds it “uncomfortable” attending the parliamentary session as acting president.Also, Hwang had paid a visit to Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun in the afternoon but made no mention of attending the interpellation.“Hwang should regard himself as a supervisor to respond to crisis and to clean up the old evils of the Park Geun-hye administration, not as a pioneer of an upcoming new era,” said Rep. Park Jie-won of the opposition People’s Party.“He should show himself at the parliament as prime minister and explain to lawmakers and the people the political road map lying ahead, should the Constitutional Court uphold Park’s impeachment.”In contrast to his passive stance toward the interpellation, Hwang has been making bold moves in state affairs.On Thursday, the acting president suggested holding individual meetings with each of the opposition parties. This was a counter proposal to the parties’ earlier suggestion for a four-party roundtable involving the three opposition party chiefs and Hwang.The prime minister argued that one-on-one meetings would be more efficient, considering the lack of time and the urgency of matters at hand. But his move was largely taken as a gesture to seize political initiative from the opposition parties.The Democratic Party of Korea, along with the progressive minority Justice Party, immediately hit back, blaming the acting president for politicking for his own interests.“Under the current acting president system, key state affairs discussion should be made in an open roundtable, not in individual close-door meetings,” said Rep. Yun Kwan-seok, chief spokesperson of the Democratic Party.“Hwang has gone overboard in pursing his political interests amid this national crisis.”Justice Party’s spokesperson Han Chang-min argued that Hwang’s effective refusal to sit with all opposition leaders was his attempt to break down the opposition unity that was formed during the weeks running up to the legislature’s impeachment of Park.The People’s Party’s emergency council chief Rep. Kim Dong-cheol, on the other hand, agreed to Hwang’s suggestion, saying there was a need for communication over key issues such as the avian influenza outbreak and the US key rate hike.Despite warnings from the opposition, the prime minister alluded that he would not tone down his actions, heralding political tension over the upcoming months.“Until recently, I followed the precedent of Goh Kun, but considering the set of unexampled situations lying ahead, I am not quite sure how to act,” he said.“When faced by unprecedented circumstances, I believe I should focus on the nation’s interests and create new precedents.”His remarks indicated that he would not remain the passive interim leader that Goh was when he acted for the impeached President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004, and that he would take control of state affairs.Hwang’s ambitious attitude rekindled public calls that he, as a loyalist to the Park administration, should be ousted along with the suspended president.The alliance of civic groups calling for Park’s ouster vowed Thursday to add Hwang’s ouster to their slogans at the Saturday rallies.“We will firmly demand for the resignation of Hwang, who has risen as the new power to represent Park in her absence,” the group said at a press conference.Prime Minister Hwang had earlier offered his resignation, following President Park’s appointment of Kim Byong-joon for the job. But facing controversies over Kim taking office, Hwang went back on his decision and retained his position.By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential election the opposition ,next presidential election ,presidential election ,next presidential election the ,the next presidential election","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Park Geun', 'Hwang']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68046319  0.29388854

Chung also vowed to bring balance to the party's ethics committee. Party leaders earlier sought to increase the number of Park loyalists in the panel.Na, however, said the party is facing its biggest crisis, adding Saenuri's fate depends on the in-house race.""The party is under a dangerous situation.

During a parliamentary hearing on the scandal, Rep. Park Young-sun of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea released minutes of a purported phone conversation between Choi and an unidentified acquaintance of hers. In the transcript, Choi ordered her acquaintance to instruct her associate Ko Young-tae on what to say to the investigators. The instructions were specifically on how to react to the testimonies of the former secretary-general of the Mir Foundation, Lee Sung-han, the whistleblower in the scandal.“Tell Ko to get a grip. We have to make it look like they stole this and that, that Lee’s actions followed a specific plan and he demanded money . If we don’t do this, we’re all done,” said Choi in the transcript. Lee pointed out that media reports on Lee blackmailing Choi for cash surfaced after the conversation, which was presumed to have taken place in late October before Choi returned to Korea. Choi is suspected of using the nonprofit Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation to siphon public funds. The foundations were established with donations from conglomerates, which investigators suspect may have been bribes based on the coercion of Choi, Park’s former aides and even the president herself.Choi had also tried to deny her close relationship with Ko. Ko, the chief of a handbag manufacturing company, served as a director at Choi’s Germany-based paper companies and is suspected to have had a close personal relationship with her. The former national team fencer testified earlier that he manufactured dozens of bags and clothing for Park and delivered them through Choi.“If they  ask how he  knows me, don’t mention the bags and say that we know each other through a mutual friend from way back. ... Just say I was interested in sports and that friend connected us and I helped him in many ways,” she was recorded as saying. The minutes also showed her emphasizing that Ko should not mention a company they jointly founded.Plastic surgeon Kim Young-jae and gynecologist Lee Im-soon -- whose hospital Park and Choi had reportedly frequently visited -- denied receiving such instructions from Choi.By Yoon Min-sik","an opposition lawmaker wednesday ,opposition lawmaker wednesday ,opposition lawmaker wednesday claimed ,investigators during parliamentary hearing ,center of corruption scandal","['Park Geun', 'Park Young', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'Choi']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43909848  0.16079888

Reps. Na Kyung-won  and Kim Se-yeon, candidates for the ruling Saenuri Party’s floor leader and chief policymaker respectively, are surrounded by journalists at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. The nonmainstreamers who did attend were at odds with the majority pro-presidential group, who denounced the remarks made by reformist nonmainstreamers, while the latter blamed the former for attempting to deter the party’s decision on to expel the president from the party.As soon as the meeting started, Reps. Jeong Woon-chun and Lee Eun-jae demanded that party chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun explain his earlier appointment of additional members to the party’s ethics committee.Despite the pretext of “promoting balance,” the leadership’s action was largely deemed an attempt to exert influence upon the committee and thus to prevent it from imposing heavy sanctions on Park.“The committee makes its decision on a majority vote, so adding eight new members to the conventional seven members is nothing other than the pro-Parks’ attempt to seize control,” said former committee chief Lee Jin-gon in a radio interview with SBS.Lee and the committee members had resigned en masse the previous day, protesting against the leadership.Current floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, who is classified as a centrist figure within the party, also backed up the non-Park members’ complaints.“The ethics committee is an organization which should absolutely maintain its neutrality,” Chung told reporters in a press briefing held shortly before the party meeting.“Don’t  have the slightest idea on how the public is assessing the Saenuri Party?

But Woo did not comply with the National Assembly’s subpoena for a parliamentary hearing on the Choi Soon-sil scandal, and remains “missing” as of Thursday afternoon. Unlike Choi and others, who refused summons and submitted their reasons for doing so, Woo did not even receive the parliament’s order in the first place.Woo Byung-woo The law states that those who refuse testimony, to submit relevant documents or to appear before the parliament without a viable reason can be punished by up to 10 million won  in fines or three years in prison. If the designated witness does not comply, the parliament can issue an “order of accompanying ,” refusal of which can be considered contempt of the parliament and punished with up to six years in prison. The hole in this is that the law also states that such order comes into effect as soon as it is presented to the person in question.Woo has been unaccounted for since the parliament issued the order on Wednesday, which technically means it has not come into effect as the order was never delivered to Woo. Another loophole is that while it can order people to appear before the lawmakers, it cannot drag them there. Both the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court have ruled that forcible summons for investigation is illegal. It is believed that Woo, a former prosecutor, is using the legal loophole to avoid being grilled by lawmakers.Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the Saenuri Party, who heads the parliamentary special investigative committee on the Choi scandal, said that “there are those who attempt to nullify the stern investigation with featherweight knowledge of law.” The remark was widely interpreted as a jab toward Woo.Opposition lawmakers on Thursday moved to revise the law for stronger punishment of those who refuse parliamentary subpoenas. Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, proposed a revision to the bill on those who refuse to testify at the National Assembly by removing the fine option and having the violators punished exclusively by prison terms.Rep. Lee Seok-hyun of the same party proposed a law to endow the judicial authorities of the police to civil workers delivering orders of accompaniment. This would allow the cited workers to apply contempt of the parliament to those who refused accompaniment and arrest them on cite.In order to eliminate cases where the summoned snubs the order by “disappearing” on purpose, Democratic Party Rep. Kim Kwang-young proposed a law to allow authorities to deliver the subpoena via public posting or email. A law revision proposal by Rep. Lee Tae-kyu, also of the Democratic Party, stated that if the person receiving parliamentary summons refuses to accept it more than once, it should be considered delivered. The Democratic Party is also mulling whether to propose another revision to allow the parliament itself to decide how to punish violators and request the cited punishment from judicial authorities.By Yoon Min-sik","opposition lawmakers on thursday ,subpoena loophole opposition lawmakers ,lawmakers on thursday proposed ,parliamentary subpoena loophole opposition ,lawmakers on thursday","['Park Geun', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Park ’s']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68295926 -0.02150228

Most of the 304 dead were high school students on a field trip.The Saenuri lawmakers, however, said the impeachment should focus only on charges leveled by state prosecutors, adding the Sewol issue should be removed from the motion altogether.The group of around 40 non-mainstream Saenuri lawmakers are expected to play a crucial role in the passage of the motion as the opposition bloc is still 28 seats short from meeting the minimum requirement of at least 200 members from the 300-seat National Assembly.""This, however, is not an official request. We are only asking the opposition bloc to consider such a move,"" said Rep. Hwang Young-cheul, the spokesman of the group.

The appointees are Park Choong-kun, Lee Yong-bok, Yang Jae-sik and Lee Kyu-chul, all of whom currently work as lawyers. The independent counsel is accelerating the process of rounding out his probe team, which will consist of 105 members including some 20 prosecutors. The team has a mandate to investigate the case for 90 days, which can be extended by a month.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae has also been forming a team of attorneys to defend Park. The team is expected to consist of four to five lawyers, including Yoo Young-ha, who was appointed last month.The embattled president faces allegations that she allowed her friend Choi Soon-sil to gain unlawful access to advance drafts of presidential speeches and documents, some of which were classified as confidential.Park is also suspected of playing a role in pressuring local conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi.Cheong Wa Dae has denied all accusations, claiming that they were politically motivated and groundless. It said that Park will establish her “innocence” through the forthcoming independent investigation.","monday appointed four assistants ,selected the four deputies ,last week the appointees ,appointed four assistants ,high profile corruption scandal","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park Young', 'Park Choong - kun', 'Lee Yong - bok', 'Yang Jae - sik', 'Lee Kyu - chul']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56179893  0.42961222

The total approved by lawmakers is 200 billion smaller than proposed by the government.  South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn  makes a speech after the 2017 budget bill was passed on Saturday. The 2 trillion won child care program for those age 3 to 5 was the key sticking point in the budget negotiations. Political parties demanded the central government fund 1 trillion won for the program, with the remainder backed by provincial education offices.The government, however, claimed it could only provide up to 700 billion won.During last-minute talks with the three main parties, the government agreed to pay 860 billion won and establish a three-year special account for that purpose.They also decided to create a new top-tier rate for income taxes to bankroll child care support. Those earning more than 500 million won per year will be subject to a 40-percent income tax rate. The opposition's demand for an increase in corporate tax was turned down. It marks the first time in 16 years for South Korea's income tax rate to reach 40 percent. The highest rate bracket, which hovered around 70 percent in the 1970s, continued to decline over the past decades to reach 36 percent in 2002 and then went up to 38 percent in 2012, which currently applies to those earning more than 150 million won per year.The latest change is expected to enable the government to collect around 600 billion won more annually.The finance ministry estimates around 46,000 people will be affected by the change.Opposition parties hailed the tax increase, expressing hope that it will help address income disparities.Political pundits, however, said the hike in the income tax contradicts with the incumbent administration's initial pledge to not increase taxes while expanding welfare services.The new budget plan also slashed funding on projects presumed to be linked with President Park Geun-hye's confidante Choi Soon-sil, who has been at the center of the influence-peddling scandal that has rocked the country over the past weeks.The budget plan, on the other hand, added 50 billion won to generate more jobs in the public sector, amid rising unemployment among youth.To strengthen South Korea's defense capabilities, the parliament and the government decided to spend 1.6 trillion won on the development of key systems, namely the ""Kill Chain"" strike system, and the Korean Air and Missile Defense  and Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation  programs.The budget plan moreover increased the amount of funds to be spent on establishing counter-earthquake systems by 140.3 billion won.","saturday approved 400 trillion ,parliament passes 2017 budget ,korea parliament on saturday ,parliament on saturday approved ,vote with 30 abstentions","[""South Korea 's"", 'the National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3232421   0.32447651

Along with the far-left Justice Party, they had earlier agreed to push for the impeachment vote as early as Friday and no later than next Friday. Without the support of the 38 lawmakers of the People’s Party, the measure can neither be proposed nor passed. “Our goal is to impeach President Park, not to propose a parliamentary motion,” said Rep. Lee Yong-ho, floor spokesperson of the People’s Party. “If we fail to impeach the president, it would be like exonerating her. We will not join such move.” More than 150 lawmakers are needed to submit the impeachment motion to the floor. The Democratic Party, minor Justice Party and independents have a combined total of 134 seats, 17 shy of the required quorum in the 300-member National Assembly. While Democratic Party lawmakers insisted that the measure should be proposed as scheduled on Thursday, The People’s Party leadership countered that the motion is unlikely to clear the legislative hurdle without support from Saenuri lawmakers. More than 28 votes from Saenuri lawmakers are needed for approval. On Thursday, the Democratic Party and minor Justice Party officially decided to push for holding a vote Friday, mounting pressure on the People’s Party to join them. The centrist party’s interim leader Rep. Park-jie-won, however, refused to do so.  Temporarily suspending the impeachment negotiation, Park’ governing Saenuri Party shifted their focus to offering Park a legal pathway to resign with a “sense of grace,” rather than be stripped of power through an impeachment. “If a student wants to leave the school voluntarily, we don’t have to kick her out,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, suggesting that allowing Park to step down by herself is better than removing her from office through impeachment. In a presidential address Tuesday, Park said she would leave everything to the National Assembly, including her presidency, and asked the legislative body to decide the time frame and legal process for her early departure from office. Her term finishes in February 2018.Competing factions of Saenuri lawmakers Thursday agreed to set up a roadmap for Park’s early resignation. The plan requires the president to step down next April and a presidential election to be held two months later. The election is scheduled to take place next December. Whether Saenuri impeachment supporters will change their mind remains unclear. Some reiterated that they would pursue an impeachment process if the lawmakers fail to come up with a bipartisan proposal, but others hinted at withdrawing their support for the measure.  Rep. Kim Moo-sung, a key member of the ruling Saenuri Party known to be critical of President Park Geun-hye, is surrounded by journalists as he walks out of a one-on-one meeting with Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the chief of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, at a hotel near the National Assembly in Seoul on Thursday. “If the president can leave the office next April, we don’t have to push for impeaching her,” Rep. Kim Moo-sung told reporters after a closed-door meeting with Democratic Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae. Kim served as a Saenuri leader and has led efforts to impeach Park. During the one-on-one meeting, Kim asked Choo to give the president some time and work on getting her to resign this April. Choo, however, rejected the offer, saying that the president must leave office no later than this January. The surprise meeting drew criticism from the People’s Party, who was neither invited nor notified of it. Interim Leader Park attacked Choo for causing a chasm within their coalition by discussing the idea of allowing Park to avoid impeachment.By Yeo Jun-suk","impeachment vote friday ,opposition coalition thursday failed ,no impeachment vote friday ,impeachment vote friday the ,motion to impeach president","['Park Geun - hye', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40563068  0.23669432

The parties also reconfirmed their commitment to impeaching the conservative president as early as this Friday, which requires at least 28 votes from Park’s former allies in the ruling Saenuri Party. The three party leaders Reps. Choo Mi-ae of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea , Park Jie-won of the People’s Party  and Sim Sang-jung of the Justice Party.“Passing the motion on Dec. 2 might be a long shot,” Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party told reporters after a close-door meeting with Reps. Choo Mi-ae of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and Sim Sang-jung of the Justice Party. Reps. Park and Choo were said to have clashed during the meeting over the voting schedule. While Choo insisted that the opposition stick to Friday, Park countered that Dec. 9 is a more viable date to gather enough votes from Saenuri Party lawmakers. Earlier in the day, Saenuri lawmakers critical of the president -- who hold the key to the required number of votes needed for the motion’s passage -- said they would vote for Park’s removal, but wanted to delay the ballot till Dec. 9 to give rival parties time to discuss the president’s suggestion. Opposition parties and independents combined have 172 votes as of Monday, 28 shy of the required 200 in the 300-member National Assembly. In a survey conducted by a local daily Wednesday, only 19 lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party said they would approve the motion, if the vote took place this Friday. In a surprise move Tuesday, Park said she was leaving everything to the National Assembly, including her own presidency, and asked the legislative body to decide the time frame and legal process of her early departure from office. Her term finishes in February 2018. The opposition coalition wants to pass the motion as soon as possible, because a delay could affect its chances of clearing the threshold at the nine-member Constitutional Court. By law, at least six judges must approve to impeach Park.  “One week is quite a long time. We don’t know what Park will plot to do during this time,” said Rep. Keum Tae-sup of the Democratic Party, a former prosecutor in charge of drafting the impeachment motion. Keum also warned that if the lawmakers pass the motion next week, the legal process at the Constitutional Court will be delayed. He noted that if the Court fails to offer their ruling before their chief justice ends his term next January, it will be forced to wait until the new justice takes office. A day earlier, opposition parties came up with the final draft of their impeachment motion, which was scheduled to be submitted to the floor no later than Thursday. More than 150 lawmakers are needed to propose the measure.The document contained allegations that the president violated the democratic values of the Constitution, abused her power as a public official and leaked classified presidential documents to her longtime friend Choi, who did not have security clearance  Some contentious charges were also added, even though they had been left out in the prosecution document in which Park was named a suspect. Among them was her involvement in a graft charge tied to Choi and her aides, as well as her mishandling of the 2012 Sewol ferry incident which left over 300 people dead.Earlier in the day, a group of Saenuri lawmakers advocating impeachment demanded the opposition reduce the scope of charges to make the case for impeachment. Opposition parties said that they would incorporate Saenuri’s suggestion, if needed. The conservative party’s lawmakers are concerned that including too many charges in the motion would undermine the prospects of getting the Constitutional Court to impeach Park. The impeachment motion will be a major point of reference for the Court in reviewing the case. “As a lawyer and a member of Saenuri Party, I can’t bring such a motion to the Constitutional Court,” said Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, chairman of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee who will represent the legislative body in a trial at the Constitutional Court. The allegations surrounding Park’s dealings during the Sewol disaster are not compelling enough to convince both the court’s judges and Saenuri lawmakers that the president committed a “grave violation” of the Constitution, the former prosecutor added. By Yeo Jun-suk","wednesday officially rejected president ,impeaching the conservative president ,short demanding she resign ,officially rejected president park ,opposition parties on wednesday","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Park ’s', 'Saenuri Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7175293   0.35478893

Chung Jin-suk, the party floor leader who is not included in the group, called on opposition parties to join discussions on Park's resignation and next year's presidential election.""If the president had announced an immediate resignation in Tuesday's speech, we would have had to hold the election in end-January,"" Chung said, adding the public does not wish for such a hasty election.Chung added Park should consider stepping down in April to time the new presidential election for June as proposed by senior politicians late last week.""If the parliament passes the impeachment motion, we would have only to wait for the Constitutional Court's decision, which will lead to further confusion in state affairs,"" Chung said.","dissenters propose park resign ,her timeline for resignation ,park resign by april ,her wednesday to clarify ,of lawmakers to pass","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'National Assem']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.21707171  0.40252623

Whether intentionally or not, she may have also effectively diminished the chances of untangling South Korea from its worst political quagmire in recent history that stemmed from a scandal involving herself and her confidante Choi Soon-sil.  Leaders of three opposition parties hold a meeting in the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday.  “I just had a phone conservation with a few of  Saenuri Party lawmakers. It seems like the prospects of Park’s impeachment have darkened,” said Rep. Park Jie-won, chief of the People’s Party, one of the three opposition parties campaigning for the presidential impeachment. The party, along with the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and the far-left Justice Party, has been pushing for a parliamentary motion -- as early as this Friday -- to remove Park from office. For its passage, the opposition needs at least 28 votes from Park’s allies in the parliament. Before the president made her nationally televised address Tuesday, Rep. Park had expressed confidence in the ballot, saying that nearly 60 lawmakers from the Seanuri side favor Park’s impeachment. Rep. Suh Chung-won, a key Saenuri figure known to be loyal to the president, also spoke of the change of mood toward impeachment. “The opposition wanted the president to resign and pushed for the impeachment because she refused to do so,” he said. “Now that the president offers to resign, there is no reason to push for her impeachment.”However, the three opposition parties Tuesday reconfirmed their unified push to remove the president from her post via impeachment. They earlier in the day agreed to put the parliamentary motion to a vote Friday. “We will make sure the impeachment motion clears the Assembly within this week,” said Democratic Party’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho. As of Tuesday, opposition parties and independents combined control 172 seats in the 300-member Assembly. Assuming they all vote in favor of the motion, at least 28 Saenuri lawmakers must join the move to meet the required 200. Polls show Park’s approval ratings have plummeted to an abysmal 4 percent and a vast majority of the public want her immediate ouster, but the ruling party lawmakers have been reluctant to join the move to unseat Park, as they are mindful of its possible negative impact on their own political fortunes. Political observers have warned that since an impeachment vote is a secret ballot, Saenuri lawmakers may not act as how they said would. The opposition-led impeachment motion calls for Park’s removal on the grounds that she undermined the core democratic value, as stated in the Constitution, by letting her friend interfere in state affairs. Other charges facing Park include that she leaked classified presidential documents to Choi. Despite having no official position and no security clearance, Choi was granted access to and edited speeches about reunification with North Korea. But the opposition parties have clashed over whether to include other allegations surrounding Park. Among them was the allegation that she was involved with the graft scandal tied to her presidential aides and local conglomerates. Democratic Party and minor far-left Justice Party have decided to add bribery charges to their own draft version of the impeachment motion. People’s Party, on the other hand, has cited the allegation as circumstantial evidence. By Lee Sun-young & Yeo Jun-suk","prospects darken whatever president ,imminent parliamentary impeachment vote ,an imminent parliamentary impeachment ,news analysis impeachment prospects ,imminent parliamentary impeachment","['Park Geun - hye', 'South Korea']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.83898646  0.21437949

Park Jie-won, floor leader of the splinter People's Party, also said the opposition parties agreed to hand in the motion to parliament by Thursday to proceed with the vote Friday.Three opposition parties, including the minor Justice Party, plan to draft a unified impeachment motion Tuesday and send it to ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers outside the pro-Park faction to get their opinions on it before coming up with a final version.Woo urged the Saenuri lawmakers to cooperate to speed up the procedures.  The motion needs at least 28 Saenuri lawmakers' approval to meet the necessary two-third majority of the 300-seat National Assembly. President Park Geun-hye Political pundits estimate around 40 Saenuri members should support the motion considering some of the opposition and independent lawmakers may unexpectedly vote against the impeachment.While several senior Park loyalists from Saenuri asked Park to step down voluntarily Monday, the opposition parties said such a move still cannot stop them from seeking the impeachment.A group of first-term lawmakers in Saenuri also said Tuesday it is more ""desirable"" to have Park step down rather than seeking the impeachment.A lawmaker of the Democratic Party, meanwhile, said Park may face a prison sentence if the existing allegations turn out to be true.""Based on our calculations, advised by legal experts, Park may face a 45-year jail term if the court decides to slap her with imprisonment for a limited term,"" Rep. Yun Ho-jung of the main opposition said, adding the president is expected to serve at least 10 years.Park may faces charges of abusing power to raise funds from conglomerates and leaking confidential state information, as well as bribery, Yun claimed.","seek impeachment vote friday ,during party meeting tuesday ,impeachment vote friday south ,impeachment vote friday ,party meeting tuesday park","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'Democratic Party', 'Park Jie - won', ""People 's Party""]",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28772646  0.21809742

Woo Sang-ho. “If we think we are prepared, we should go for Dec. 2. If not, we should choose Dec. 9.”The comments came after People’s Party interim chief Park Jie-won said they have more than enough votes from the ruling Saenuri Party to ensure the motion’s passage. Rep. Park said at least 60 Saenuri lawmakers would vote for the motion. To remove President Park from office -- she won the election on the Saenuri ticket -- the envisioned motion must clear a two-third threshold at the 300-seat Assembly and nine-member Constitutional Court. Opposition parties and independents combined control 172 lawmakers as of Monday, 28 votes shy of the required 200. On Friday, a group of 40 Saenuri lawmakers -- who are critical of Park and her loyalists who dominate the party leadership -- said they would join the campaign to unseat Park, but opposition parties are still not sure whether all of them will vote as they have said in a secret ballot. The Saenuri lawmakers who approve of the impeachment measure also said that while they would follow the timeline suggested by the opposition parties, they prefer a voting session on Dec. 9. The plenary session slated for Friday already has some key bills to pass, they said. Topping the agenda for Friday’s session is next year’s budget bill which by law must pass the parliament no later than the day. Observers said that some lawmakers may be reluctant to pass both the impeachment motion and the budget bill at the same time.  The impeachment motion, if passed, will lead to the country’s second presidential impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court. Opposition lawmakers are trying to include as many impeachable offenses as possible in the draft, in order to provide enough legal grounds for the court to approve of Park’s removal.  Floor leaders of the three opposition groups decided Monday to come up with a final draft by Tuesday. Constitutional law experts noted the parliamentary impeachment motion is the only point of reference for the top court to review the case, because the lawmakers cannot insert additional charges into the motion once it passes the legislative body. “The court cannot base their decision on something that is not described in the Assembly’s impeachment motion,” said Kim Jong-cheol, a constitutional law professor at Yonsei University. “Describing impeachable charges in detail is the Assembly’s important obligation.” But some worry that if they include too many charges in the motion, it might take longer for the court to deliberate. According to prosecutors, Park is suspected of abusing her power by helping her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil extort money from conglomerates and giving her access to classified government documents.

Hit by a demonstration Saturday that brought together more than 1.9 million people across the country, the embattled president is considering offering another apology this week, Cheong Wa Dae officials said, though its efficacy remains doubtful given the bitter public sentiment. After consultations, the opposition camp is forecast to propose Wednesday the impeachment bill, which will be sent to the plenary session the following day. The vote could take place as early as this Friday and no later than Dec. 9.  Protesters hold a candlelight rally at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Nov. 26, 2016, to call for President Park Geun-hye's resignation.The two opposition parties, along with the splinter Justice Party, will decide on the time table of the vote Wednesday, Democratic Party of Korea floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho said Sunday. The 300-strong National Assembly is likely to approve the motion, with 172 opposition and independent members and nearly 40 ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers having expressed their consent. It requires two-thirds of ballots in a floor vote. Once the motion is passed, Park’s duties are suspended and transferred to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. “The National Assembly must humbly uphold the will of the people and respond with strong and firm solidarity toward impeachment,” Democratic Party of Korea floor spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min said at a news briefing, referring to the massive candlelight vigil Saturday.  “In line with the people’s demands, not only the opposition parties, but also conscientious forces within the ruling party should join the united front to bring an end to the Park Geun-hye administration.” People’s Party interim chief and floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won provided an upbeat outlook for the bill’s passage, quoting some Saenuri lawmakers as saying more than 60 of its members would give their consent. The party’s former Chair Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo warned ruling party officials against “political calculations” that would amount to “yet again betraying the people who braved the cold to take to the streets.”“Democratic Party and conscientious Saenuri Party lawmakers,  join us in impeaching the president,” Park Jie-won said during a lecture at Chosun University in Gwangju. “Pro-Park  Saenuri legislators, too, should search their souls and come around to our cause, and we must pursue patience, concessions and compromises till the end, for the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, who is our public enemy.” While anti-Park Saenuri lawmakers gather force to back the impeachment drive, the party issued official commentaries simply saying it respects the citizens for their peaceful and orderly behavior during the rally, as well as their resolve. A group of 27 former and incumbent Saenuri members including Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Gyung-pil held a meeting later in the day, urging the party to facilitate the impeachment procedure and ultimately disband to take responsibility for acting as the president’s “accomplice.” “The impeachment motion should be done by Dec. 9. If it pointlessly drags on, the people’s patience will reach its limit,” Nam said at a news conference. “The historical life of the Saenuri Party has ended. Sticking to the party because of any lingering chance of power and vested interests run counter to the popular sentiment.” Park, meanwhile, is coming under ever-mounting pressure also from the prosecution, which has notified the presidential office she has to undergo a face-to-face questioning no later than Tuesday. But Cheong Wa Dae and her lawyer continues to keep mum, apparently being mindful of the forthcoming special investigation in which her interview would be nearly impossible. After the opposition parties unveil nominees Tuesday, the president is required to appoint the lead investigator within three days. The team, which would consist of more than 100 prosecutors and other personnel, has up to 120 days to probe the sprawling scandal.  The investigation is tasked with looking into 15 sets of allegations surrounding the president and her civilian confidante Choi. These include whether Park allowed or assisted Choi’s perceived meddling in foreign and security policies and other confidential state affairs; the creation of two culture and sports foundations that virtually served as her slush funds; Samsung and other major conglomerates’ bankrolling of the horse riding trainings of Choi’s daughter; and former top Presidential Civil Affairs Secretary Woo Byung-woo’s connivance or protection of related irregularities. In another development, a parliament-public committee in charge of examining the scandal is forecast to accelerate its work starting Wednesday, with scheduled briefings from involved agencies including the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office and the culture, justice and health ministries. Speculation is growing that Park might give another apology to defuse nationwide protests this week. Given her approval ratings, which have plunged to 4 percent, the move would do little -- if anything -- to soothe public sentiment, observers say. Signs of a lame-duck presidency are also rising, such as last week’s resignation offers from Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong and new Senior Presidential Civil Affairs Secretary Choi Jai-kyung. “We’re prudently considering delivering the president’s message ahead of the impeachment vote,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said. “Whether it would take the form of a public statement or news conference, we will make a decision after listening to various opinions.” By Shin Hyon-hee","recommend two candidates tuesday ,friday the main opposition ,candidates tuesday to steer ,two candidates tuesday ,investigation into political corruption","['Park Geun', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33352894  0.42820972

At least 28 votes from Saenuri are needed to meet requirement of 200 votes in the 300-seat Assembly.Rep. Hwang Young-cheul, spokesman of the emergency council for the dissenting group, noted the estimate is based on a survey of Saenuri lawmakers attending the group. He added the number of supporters may be higher if other Saenuri members are counted.“We are going to collect signatures from them to endorse an impeachment motion,” Hwang told reporters at the National Assembly. But the lawmaker said that the group would not reveal who had agreed to approve the motion before the voting session. The ruling Saenuri Party‘s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk speaks at a party meeting on Friday. Faced with mounting calls to impeach the president among the party’s heavyweight dissenters, Saenuri lawmakers decided not to present a united front when casting their ballots during the impeachment vote, leaving the decision up to individual lawmakers. Opposition parties are working to have the motion put to a vote in plenary sessions scheduled to take place on Dec. 2 and Dec. 9. The floor leaders of the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party agreed on Thursday to pass the motion in time for the upcoming session.  If the impeachment motion reaches the floor, the lawmakers are to cast their votes in a secret ballot between 24 and 72 hours after proposing the measure. More than 150 lawmakers are needed to submit the motion. But Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk reiterated his opposition to the timeframe, highlighting that the Assembly should finalize other legislative processes first before pushing through with impeachment motion. “I’m not saying I want to oppose or avoid the impeachment process,” Chung told reporters after meeting with rank-and-file Saenuri lawmakers on Friday. “We should think more about how to prepare for the impeachment than just passing the motion.” Chung warned that if the lawmakers pursued the impeachment motion too hastily, the nation could face a political deadlock caused by a lengthy impeachment process. He also noted that the nation could be in turmoil, if the presidential election took place earlier than scheduled without preparation.“If the Assembly passes the motion in early December and the Constitutional Court approves it within two to three months, the presidential election has to be held in March,” Chung said. “The hasty election will seriously damage the legitimacy of the next administration.”Chung noted that the upcoming plenary sessions should be devoted to passing annual budget bills of 4 trillion won . In the meantime, he urged the lawmakers to focus on parliamentary probe targeting the Choi scandal and move to have President Park testify before the lawmakers.

The three parties -- the Democratic Party of Korea, People’s Party and Justice Party -- have decided to present a parliamentary motion to remove Park from office. At least 29 votes from across the aisle are required for it to be passed. “As soon as we meet the quorum, we will present the impeachment motion,” floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho of the main opposition Democratic Party said Tuesday. Rep. Woo Sang-ho A substantial number of Saenuri Party lawmakers have been speaking out against the embattled president, but the Democratic Party is not sure how many of them would actually cast ballots for her impeachment, Rep. Woo said. President Park is a member of Saenuri and the party’s top decision-making leadership council is controlled by politicians still loyal to her. “Some say it would be at least 40 , while some say even 30 is a number that can only be imagined,” he said. To submit the motion to the National Assembly, the opposition must first obtain signatures from 150 lawmakers of the total 300. For the motion to make it pass the parliament, at least 200 lawmakers have to agree. Currently, the three opposition parties and liberal-minded independents have 171 votes. Opposition parties expect that the campaign to gather lawmakers’ signatures for the motion will provide some clarity as to how many votes will come from Saenuri. The Democratic Party announced Sunday they would form a committee to oversee the impeachment process, while the People’s Party said it would negotiate with dissenting Saenuri members to vote for an impeachment. Rep. Kim Han-jung of the Democratic Party made a proposal to hold an open vote for the impeachment citing citizens’ right to know. However, vice floor leader Rep. Park Wan-ju expressed concern and said that a secret ballot may be more helpful in getting votes from Saenuri members. Political observers say the parties may present the impeachment motion to the parliament after the mass anti-Park candlelight vigil expected to take place Saturday.Some 1 million citizens took to the streets of Seoul on Nov. 12, while slightly less than a million people protested all around the country Saturday, according to the rally organizers.By Jo He-rim","campaign to impeach president ,campaign for impeachment votes ,to impeach president ,impeachment votes begins south ,upcoming campaign to impeach","['South Korea ’s', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party', 'Justice Party']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.54881388  0.1064364

The bill was passed 196 to 10 with 14 abstentions. It is designed to enable the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and minor opposition People’s Party to recommend two candidates to lead the probe, with one among them to be chosen by the president. The vote came after a tug-of-war between the ruling and opposition camps as some Saenuri lawmakers had staged resistance, arguing the bill fails to ensure “political neutrality and the investigation’s independence” by giving the opposition lopsided authority to nominate the prospective chief prosecutors. The focal point would be whether, and if so when and how, Park would undergo questioning. Offering a public apology for a second time on Nov. 4 over the scandal, the president said she is willing to be interviewed, including by a then to-be-launched independent special investigation, but she has not yet responded to a meeting request from the prosecution. Once set up, the team will be given up to 20 days for prior preparations and another 70 days to complete its investigation and prosecute a case, though it could be extended one time by 20 days with the endorsement of the president. The team is set to be sent to next Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting for approval and will likely be initiated as late as early next month. It would consist of around 60 people, including 20 prosecutors. Aside from the prosecutors, a parliamentary committee chaired by Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party plans to carry out a separate investigation and seek accountability within 60 days. With a clause banning related persons from refusing to comply with an interview or submission of requested materials, the legislation is expected to bring in not only Park’s friend Choi Soon-sil, but also former presidential secretaries, ranking government officials and others who are suspected to have helped her set up slush funds and meddle in state affairs. Virtually all government agencies are subject to the questioning, such as Cheong Wa Dae’s secretary and security offices and the National Security Council, as well as the finance, education, future planning, unification, culture and health ministries. The list also includes two culture and sports institutes working as Choi’s de facto slush funds -- the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation -- and the Federation of Korean Industries, the country’s largest business lobby, which pushed for major member conglomerates to bankroll the funds. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, which has been looking into the scandal by forming a special investigation squad, said it will continue its work “in a strict and thorough manner” until the establishment of the independent crew, with which it would “fully cooperate.”In another development, the three opposition parties, including the splinter Justice Party, agreed to launch a campaign to collect citizens’ signatures to press for Park’s resignation in cooperation with civil society, the parties’ spokespeople said. With the president’s side seen seeking to put off the investigation’s summons, the parties urged the prosecution to change Park’s status to “suspect” from the current “reference witness” so as to conduct a questioning “in a speedier and meticulous fashion.”Cheong Wa Dae, for its part, reiterated Park’s display of her willingness to respond to the special investigation, downplaying the possibility for her veto. By Shin Hyon-hee","thursday approved bill calling ,thursday approved bill ,assembly on thursday approved ,on thursday approved bill ,national assembly on thursday","['the National Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Democratic Party of Korea', 'People ’s Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45263749  0.23698372

Woo Sang-ho in a party meeting.Woo’s remarks were a reiteration of the party’s decision on the previous day that it would demand that Park officially step down from her post. The party had previously said Park should take a back seat and avoid involvement in most state affairs, entrusting them to an opposition-backed prime minister. The opposition’s official slogan is an “orderly resignation” of the president, indicating that Park should first pledge to step down, constitute a transition Cabinet and then bid an early farewell to her presidency.A by-election is then to be held within 60 days to select a succeeding state chief who will not just take the seat for what remains of Park’s term, but for a full five-year term.This political road map is deemed a compromise between the hard-liners’ call for Park’s immediate resignation and the concerns over the resulting vacuum in state powers.This toughened stance finally placed the main opposition camp on the same line with the rest of the opposition camp -- the runner-up People’s Party and the progressive Justice Party, both of which have been calling for Park’s immediate ouster.The two minority opposition parties, who voiced complaints against the Democratic Party’s earlier move to negotiate with the president, welcomed the main opposition’s move and vowed unity.Moon Jae-in, former chief of the Democractic Party of Korea enters a press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. The Democratic Party’s renewed political determination was largely reflected in the words of Moon Jae-in, its former chief and ranking presidential hopeful.“I shall work with the people on a nationwide withdrawal movement  until the president announces an unconditional resignation,” Moon said in a press conference, citing the irrevocability of the incumbent situation.The Democratic bigshot also elaborated on why he and his party remained rather passive in calling for Park’s resignation.“Despite the utter shame and fury which I felt over the corruption and state affairs interference scandal, I have endured as much as possible, even putting up with the critical voices asking for a clearer, sterner stance,” he said.“This was out of cordiality to minimize state affairs and to open a retreat path for the president, but our efforts were discarded by the president.”Moon also referred to the massive candlelight protest held on Saturday in central Seoul and around the country, a record-breaking event said to have gathered over 1 million participants.“The people’s cries were an expression of despair, an order to step beyond the president’s resignation and to achieve a change of government,” he said, alluding to the upcoming presidential race.The nation’s 19th presidential election was slated for December 2017 but will be moved forward to earlier next year if Park resigns.But Cheong Wa Dae, though yet reluctant to speak out on the issue, continued to suggest that Park will neither resign nor hand over power to the Cabinet.“The president is considering all possible measures,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters once again.When asked whether the measures include resignation, Jung hastily added that he only meant “measures to reinstate state affairs,” apparently dismissing calls for the termination of Park’s presidency.Also, a number of Blue House officials insist that talk of Park’s resignation should come after the prosecution’s ongoing investigation, as well as the incoming independent counsel‘s investigation.Ever since a series of news reports pointed out late last month that presidential confidante Choi Soon-sil meddled in key state affairs, public calls have been mounting on the president for valid countermeasures, be it an explanation, apology or resignation.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition parties on tuesday ,for battle against president ,for park resignation opposition ,battle against president park ,battle against president","['Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Democratic Party of Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4295142   0.19746959

Choo Mi-ae of the Democratic Party of Korea proposed one-on-one talks with Park earlier in the day, seeking to “accurately deliver” public sentiment and explore ways to defuse the snowballing crisis, amid an influence-peddling scandal involving the president’s longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Yet the offer drew sharp rebuke from the minor opposition People’s Party and Justice Party -- which has forged an alliance with the Democratic Party against Park’s leadership -- as Choo had neither consulted with them, nor with many in her own party.  Rep. Choo Mi-ae “During our party’s general assembly, we had reached consensus that President Park must step down. And as the view has been made public, many people called for the Cheong Wa Dae meeting to be canceled, and I respect that,” Choo told reporters after a late-night gathering of the party. “As head of the main opposition party, I was trying to accurately deliver the public sentiment shown during a candlelight vigil, because the president failed to offer a sincere apology and is apparently struggling to grasp the sentiment,” she added, referring to last Saturday’s rally that brought together more than 1 million citizens in central Seoul. Critics called Choo’s proposal “ill-timed,” citing the prosecution’s plan to question Park as early as Wednesday, and said it “runs against” the people’s ever-growing calls for her resignation. The opposition had rejected Park’s earlier call for talks last week, demanding the president first give a clear sign she would take a back seat and hand over her state governance authority to a prime minister endorsed by the National Assembly.  The three opposition parties had also joined the street protests together. People’s Party interim chief Rep. Park Jie-won also accused Choo of inciting “division” within the opposition. The about-face is expected to deal a blow to Choo, who took helm of her party less than three months ago. Cheong Wa Dae expressed regret but said its offer remains intact and the door is still open for talks “at any time regardless of the formality.”By Shin Hyon-hee","opposition party late monday ,off meeting with president ,monday called off meeting ,opposition leader calls off ,main opposition party late","['Park Geun', 'Choo Mi', 'the Democratic Party of Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54150838 -0.03746403

For these measures to clear the legislative hurdle, the opposition bloc, despite controlling a majority of the single-chamber parliament, must steal votes from the conservative ruling Saenuri Party. Under normal circumstances this would be almost impossible to achieve, however the growing dissent within Saenuri may make it possible.  According to the Constitution, an impeachment motion requires approval by two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly. The same quorum is needed to override a potential presidential veto against the bill aiming to investigate Park.  The opposition parties and liberal-minded independents alike hold a total of 171 seats, 29 short of pushing such proposals. If at least some 30 Saenuri members cast votes across the aisle, the motion could gain the 200 quorum.  Lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party who are critical of the party's current leadership loyal to PResident Park Geun-hye hold a meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. However, it is not clear yet whether the dissenting members -- whose number some analysts said could constitute as much as half of 129 Saenuri members -- will join any opposition-led measure against the president.   “ brings a shock to the nation. It is an unfortunate event not only for the nation but for the people,” said former Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who leads a rival group to the party’s mainstream, pro-Park faction. But Kim added that the president had “violated” Constitutional values by letting her confidante, who has never held a government position, meddle in state affairs, noting that such behavior could make a case for impeachment. So far, the dissenters’ call appears to be part of an attempt to overhaul the embattled party. They have demanded the Saenuri leadership, which is dominated by the pro-Park faction, to resign and urged the president to leave the party. “I think we have to choose other options if the leadership refuses to resign,” said Rep. Choung Byoung-gug, hinting at the possibility of joining the opposition-led measures. Chung is a fifth-term Saenuri lawmaker and one of the most outspoken dissenters.

National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun convened an emergency gathering with the floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, main opposition Democratic Party of Korea and minor opposition People’s Party. The session was designed to trade views on whom to endorse as the premier and how, in line with Park’s request during earlier talks with Chung for the parliament to come up with another individual to steer the Cabinet and “normalize the government administration.” But the four-way meeting ended in 45 minutes without any progress on what would be an unprecedented parliamentary nomination, with the opposition slamming Park’s proposal as an attempt to dilute the current stalemate without coming clean about her future role. “Is it that hard to say that she will give  the authority to nominate Cabinet members and Cheong Wa Dae won’t interfere with domestic affairs?” Democratic Party floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho asked reporters after Park’s visit. “Despite the speaker’s repeated questions, she did not answer clearly and just left. ... The president and Cheong Wa Dae should address our demands themselves.” People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won also dismissed the president’s offer as aimed at “buying time” while the parliament weighs potential premier contenders. “The president kept mum about what she would do herself,” he said at a news conference following the quadripartite talks during which he said “nothing was agreed upon.”“Even though the assembly does recommend a candidate, what would he do, at a time when the enraged public calls for her resignation, impeachment and pullout from government operation?” The ruling Saenuri Party, in contrast, welcomed the request, saying Park accepted the opposition’s demand for a retraction of her nomination of Kim Byong-joon, which had been criticized for her failure to consult with lawmakers prior. Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk also sought to defend the president’s comments, saying she would grant “substantive authority” to run the Cabinet to the prime minister. Given the persistent resistance, however, Chung said he would seek to clarify the president’s position with her office, Saenuri spokesperson Rep. Min Kyung-wook said. To secure their united front, the two opposition parties plan to hold a consultation with another minority Justice Party on Wednesday, Democratic Party spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min noted. With bipartisan endorsement, the candidate would be tasked with reconstituting the Cabinet and taking over economic, social and other domestic affairs from Park, as the Choi Soon-sil scandal has paralyzed her government. Presumably, a person with morality, bipartisan values and experience in politics and public policy would be desirable. It is expected to also have an impact on the president’s other nominees -- Yim Jong-yong for deputy prime minister and finance minister and Park Seung-joo for minister of public safety and security. Yet the Assembly’s own selection process will likely entail painstaking negotiations in light of the differences in positions between the parties, such as on the prime minister candidates and how much power should be left to Park. Among the most talked-about figures are former Democratic Party chairs Sohn Hak-kyu and Kim Chong-in. Having built ties with both conservatives and progressives, their names have recently been floated by some Saenuri and Democratic Party members. Sohn was governor of Gyeonggi Province, while Kim served the late President Roh Tae-woo as his top secretary on economic affairs. But some opposition lawmakers close to former Democratic Party head Moon Jae-in could feel uncomfortable with a Kim premiership given the friction between the two. Instead they have suggested former Bank of Korea Gov. Park Seung and Seoul National University professor emeritus Ahn Kyung-hwan. Former Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik has also been brought up, especially among Saenuri lawmakers outside the pro-Park faction. A fresh revelation surfaced Tuesday that before resorting to Kim Byong-joon, Cheong Wa Dae had offered the post to the People’s Party’s Park Jie-won, a four-termer in the National Assembly who previously served as the late President Kim Dae-jung’s chief of staff. “Park would do well at the job, building on his administrative experience, but I understand he declined the proposal saying it would ‘deny his identity,’” the party’s deputy floor leader Rep. Kim Kwan-young told reporters. “At this point who on earth would resist the powerful premiership with bipartisan backing? I think Park, Kim Chong-in, Sohn and Kim Han-gil, a former chair of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy  all would do a good job.” Instead of touching on the offer, Park Jie-won lashed out at Saenuri leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun for having unilaterally sounded out another close confidant of Kim Dae-jung about the premiership. “I learned that Lee has called  and said if I recommended him as the prime minister, so would the ruling party,” Park said at a meeting with party members earlier in the day. “This shows that President Park Geun-hye and the Saenuri chair are still taking the current situation too lightly. Contacting someone one-sidedly as a prime minister candidate amounts to not only ignoring the opposition’s demand and destroying us, but also embarrassing me.”By Shin Hyon-hee","minister nomination tuesday opposition ,tuesday opposition parties resisted ,nomination tuesday opposition parties ,nomination battle awaits assembly ,nomination tuesday opposition","['Park Geun', 'National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Democratic Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34451428 -0.17931029

The boycott emerged as a major hurdle for Kim's official debut, as the appointment of a new prime minister requires approval by a majority of all lawmakers. The main and two splinter opposition parties currently control more than half of the 300 seats in the unicameral National Assembly.The nominee said he will naturally step back if the parliament and the presidential office reach an understanding on another figure.""If the ruling, opposition parties and Cheong Wa Dae agree on another suitable nominee, I will disappear,"" Kim said. ""There's no need for me to stay as a hurdle .""On Park's apology announced last week, Kim said the president should have clarified her stance on the nomination procedures.Kim is the former policy adviser to the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, who still remains a symbolic figure for the opposition bloc.On Monday, the presidential office said Kim will fully take charge of economic and social affairs as prime minister, reiterating the nominee's remark made last week.Kim earlier said he will fulfill his role as the prime minister as stipulated by the Constitution, adding previous prime ministers did not exercise such rights.","new prime minister ,new prime minister by ,monday he wishes to ,minister by president park ,step back if parliament","['Kim Byong - joon', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Park Geun - hye', ""the National Assembly 's""]",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.61525774  0.21722269

The call came amid mounting public criticism of the president, whose credibility and leadership have been critically hurt by a scandal in which she let her civilian friend, Choi Soon-sil, meddle in state affairs. Latest polls show Park’s approval ratings have plunged to an unprecedented number below 10 percent and a majority of the public want her removed from office. In what was intended as a gesture of reform, Park appointed a former opposition figure as the new prime minister to take over much of her role. “The new Cabinet  is not elected by the people and thus lacks democratic legitimacy to rule,” said Justice Party floor leader Rep. Roh Hoe-chan, the first politician to propose early elections. “We should move up the election to April of 2017.” Park’s five-year term ends in February 2018, with an election to pick her successor scheduled for December 2017. The Democratic Party of Korea’s third-term lawmaker Rep. Min Byung-doo echoed the idea. He said the National Assembly, not the scandal-ridden Park, should form an interim Cabinet, which would lead the country into an early presidential election in the first half of next year. For an early election to be realized, the current head of state must first vacate the office, either by parliamentary impeachment or voluntary resignation. The Constitution says a presidential election should be held within 60 days of the president‘s departure. The idea, however, has not yet been embraced by the leadership of the Democratic Party and centrist People’s Party. While acknowledging the underlying concern about a leadership vacuum, party leaders warned that publicly pressing Park to resign could prompt backlash from voters.  People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won “I understand why people are calling for Park to resign, but a responsible political party shouldn’t push this that far,” said People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won in a media interview Thursday. “We will wait and see whether Park will change her stance.” By Yeo Jun-suk","opposition politicians on thursday ,presidential election emerge opposition ,state affairs latest polls ,criticism of the president ,politicians on thursday","['South Korea', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park ’s']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.69726574  0.34590778

The annoucement came as a surprise, as there had been no prior communication with political parties, including her own ruling Saenuri Party. Despite the move being intended as a gesture of reform, it backfired. Park’s liberal foes responded in anger, saying the president “lacks understanding of her situation” and was pushing unilaterally for a Cabinet shake-up without offering a proper apology or explanation for the scandal.   Prime Minister nominee Kim Byong-joon speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday, after President Park Geun-hye named him to replace Hwang Kyo-ahn. “President Park Geun-hye has decided to carry out a reshuffle of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Public Safety and Security,” said presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk in an announcement. Should the appointment be confirmed by the National Assembly, the prime minister nominee is likely to exercise an expanded range of power, reflecting calls for a decentralization of presidential authority.Kim, who is currently a professor at Kookmin University, had previously been mentioned as a possible candidate for the position, along with ranking figures of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, such as Kim Chong-in and Sohn Hak-kyu. “Kim, who is also a renowned scholar of public administration, served as presidential policy director and education deputy prime minister in the Participatory  Government,” Jung explained.“Considering his value, knowledge and experience, Kim is deemed able to overcome the current challenges and securely steer the Cabinet for the sake of the nation’s future.”The Blue House also named Yim Jong-yong, the incumbent chairman of the Financial Services Commission and former chief of NH Financial Group, as deputy prime minister and finance minister. Former Gender Equality Vice Minister Park Seung-joo was named minister of public safety and security upon the recommendation of the prime minister-designate.The Cabinet reshuffle, though considered a crucial step to break through the state affairs stalemate, faces dim prospects at the National Assembly, with the opposition vowing to thwart it. The three opposition parties combined control an absolute majority of South Korea’s National Assembly. The Saenuri Party’s leadership had recommended Kim as prime minister in the first place, so they had little to complain about. However, the party’s rank-and-file members criticized the way the scandal-ridden president was dealing with her crisis of confidence.  “The shake-up is a powerful expression  to normalize the endangered state affairs,” the Saenuri Party said through a written statement. “We urge the opposition to adopt a responsible stance and fully cooperate in the reshuffle.”The opposition camp blasted the president for once again shutting out public sentiment from key decisions.“The president, by selecting a former opposition figure, is trying to make it look as if the new Cabinet is neutral and reformative,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party. “But the truth is she only wants to organize a Cabinet that suits her needs.”The announcement came three days after Park decided to send away most of her closest assistants amid plunging approval ratings and growing calls for her to resign. She named former prosecutor Choi Jai-kyeong as new senior presidential secretary for civil affairs and former parliamentary spokesperson Bae Sung-rye as chief of public relations. The presidential chief of staff position, as well as two senior presidential secretary seats, remain vacant.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition backlash president park ,reshuffle faces opposition backlash ,late liberal president roh ,faces opposition backlash president ,the new prime minister","['Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Byong - joon', 'Roh Moo - hyun', 'Saenuri Party']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59766555  0.49104902

Choo Mi-ae during a party meeting Monday. Minjoo Party leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae“Saenuri has no right to talk about . They themselves have to apologize to the people,” she said.The top priority now, the Minjoo Party leader asserted, is a thorough investigation into Choi and her aides to determine to what extent they exerted influence over Cheong Wa Dae and government agencies, and who helped them. Many Minjoo Party members are skeptical of the ongoing prosecutorial probe into the scandal, calling it “a show” to settle public anger. They demand a separate investigation by independent counsel -- not that appointed by the president. This would require a new law, because the current independent counsel act gives the president the right to compose the investigative team from candidates recommended by both ruling and opposition political parties. Choi, a 60-year-old civilian President Park has been close with for four decades, underwent questioning Monday as part of the public prosecutors’ widening probe into the scandal. She is accused of raising illegal funds and having access to confidential information with the help of Cheong Wa Dae officials. She is also suspected of rigging the Saenuri Party’s nomination process during the latest April election.Minjoo Party’s rebuff of the Saenuri proposal to form a new Cabinet raised a furor, particularly because it was Minjoo Party politicians who first floated the idea.  Critics said the decision makes the liberal party look interested only in derailing any initiative taken up by its conservative rival rather than being a cooperative partner to address the crisis of national leadership that is engulfing the country.  Some of the Minjoo Party’s presidential hopefuls, meanwhile, joined the move to attack the Saenuri-led effort to form a new Cabinet, highlighting that President Park and her governing party should stay out of the process to elect key government posts. “If Saenuri recommends a new prime minister, it is not a neutral Cabinet,” said Moon, one of the first politicians to propose the idea of a new Cabinet. “I think it is a dubious plot to trick people. The new Cabinet should not be led by prominent politicians. It should be led by the people.” Minjoo Party’s third-term lawmaker Kim Boo-kyum called the idea of Saenuri’s electing a new prime minister a “self-embarrassing decision.” “If the president and Cheong Wa Dae are the primary suspects, Saenuri is their accomplice,” said Kim via his Facebook account. “If Saenuri begins to talk about candidates for premiership, they will end up favoring Saenuri regardless of their political leaning and individual characteristic.”By Yeo Jun-suk","rejected the ruling party ,opposition party on monday ,monday officially rejected the ,officially rejected the ruling ,the president close","['Cabinet', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Cabinet']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69634211  0.33682626

Lee Jung-hyun, who previously served Park as a senior secretary. “Quitting, stepping down, and running away in hard times is taking the easy way out,” said the politician, who is the standard-bearer of the pro-Park faction within the party. After the Choi scandal erupted last week, the rift between the mainstream pro-Park lawmakers and the rest has widened over how to salvage the party and restore voters’ confidence. Floor leaders of three major political parties, including the ruling Saenuri Party and the main oppositon Minjoo Party of Korea, hold a meeting with National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun  to discuss the current political turmoil stemming from the Choi Soon-sil scandal. The meeting finished just 10 minutes after it began. The dissenting groups have called for a complete overhaul of party leadership which is dominated by those royal to the president, including Rep. Lee. Some demanded that the president leave the party. Instead of resigning en masse, the Saenuri leadership accepted resignations of some party officials, including spokeswoman Rep. Kim Hyun-ah and public relations chief Rep. Oh Shin-hwan. Earlier in the day, some 50 Saenuri lawmakers held a meeting to call for the prompt resignation of the party leadership and a gathering of rank-and-file members to discuss the agenda. Most of the attendees were dissenters of the pro-Park faction, such as former Saenuri leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. To rally more back-benchers behind their move, the lawmakers also decided to gather signatories from party members. They urged the leadership to accept opposition-led agenda, such as the establishment of a neutral Cabinet and the election of an independent prosecutor to investigate the Choi Soon-sil scandal. “The leadership should have taken steps equivalent to the recreation of a party to reassure party members,” former Saenuri leader Kim was quoted as saying by the attendees. “I don’t think the current leadership takes this seriously.” Some party officials suggested the conservative party should transform itself into a more moderate one by distancing itself from President Park, who has pushed the right-wing agenda through actions such as reinstating state-authored history textbooks. Among the discussed reform measures is renaming the party. Officials from Saenuri’s forerunner, the Grand National Party, raised the allegation that Park’s confidante Choi, the daughter of pseudo Christian cult leader Choi Tae-min, was behind the decision to change its name to Saenuri, which, critics said, has religious overtones. When serving as GNP interim leader in 2012, Park decided to adopt Saenuri as the party’s official name despite opposition from its former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seung-min, who has since become estranged from Park. In Korean, “Sae” means new and “Nuri” means world. “Nuri” is often used to name churches here.

Observers said Park developed a friendship with the Choi family after her mother and then-first lady Yook Young-soo was assassinated in 1974. Park also said earlier this week that Choi helped her when she was going through very hard times while expressing her apology for the scandal.""The Democratic Party will reconsider all negotiations in progress with the Saenuri Party,"" said Rep. Choo Mi-ae, the opposition head.""Saenuri must first express an apology to the people. There must be the resignation of Woo Byung-woo, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs,"" Choo said. ""All those who supported Choi must step down .""Choo added that if the ruling party expresses a sincere commitment to normalizing state affairs the Democratic Party will also resume the talks on implementing a special investigation.""The president has lost her ethical authority,"" Choo said.""Although the Constitution stipulates the president cannot be criminally charged, she still holds a grave administrative responsibility.""An official from Saenuri, however, criticized the opposition party for leaving the negotiation, adding that an opposition-led investigation will lack political neutrality.""The opposition party is just planning to drag the scandal out over a long period to manipulate it with political intentions,"" another Saenuri official said, adding it will be complicated to reach an agreement.An independent lawmaker, meanwhile, proposed a bill on Thursday that invalidates the passports of those who leak presidential documents, aiming to bring Park's behind-the-scenes power broker back to South Korea from Germany.Rep. Lee Chan-yeol, an independent lawmaker, said the move came as although the existing law can suspend the passports of those who committed crimes worthy of a jail term of more than three years, the regulation does not provide details, making it controversial to be applied on Choi.Choi said she came to Germany to ""protect"" her daughter, adding the two are being used as pawns in political intrigue. Choi added her poor health prevents her from traveling back to South Korea for investigation at present.","to sack presidential aides ,plan to sack presidential ,wrongdoing on thursday south ,sack presidential aides ,democratic party on friday","[""South Korea 's"", 'Democratic Party', ""South Korea 's"", 'Park']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42327344  0.20995079

Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, said his party agreed unanimously on the formation of a special prosecution on the “shadow president” scandal, following the lead taken by opposition parties. Earlier in the day, lawmakers of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea endorsed the party leadership’s plan to push for the inquiry through a coalition with the minor far-left Justice Party.“I suggest that we  immediately start a talk for the special prosecution,” Rep. Chung said after an emergency general assembly of Saenuri lawmakers. Earlier in the day, Saenuri’s top decision-making supreme council had called on the president to enact a sweeping reshuffle of the Cabinet and the presidential secretariat.The political moves came as the prosecution, which has been looking into influence-peddling allegations involving Choi, searched her home and offices Wednesday morning, apparently accelerating its probe after weeks of slow progress. Choi is believed to be hiding in Germany. Choi is an old friend of Park. She is also the daughter of Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min and the ex-wife of her former secretary Jeong Yoon-hoe. The latest revelations suggest that Choi had received regular reports on Park’s schedule, speeches, personnel arrangements and even some classified information, such as secret inter-Korea military meetings. Park on Tuesday admitted to having sought Choi’s opinions on her speeches and apologized.  An investigator takes paper boxes into the K-Sports Foundation building in Gangnam, southern Seoul, Wednesday, as the prosecution begins a search of the foundation’s office as part of an ongoing investigation. During her apology Tuesday, Park said she stopped sending Choi documents after the presidential secretaries were appointed. However, her claim was refuted within hours when local cable station TV JTBC revealed that Choi received reports until at least mid-2014, 1 1/2 years after the president took office. JTBC broke the news after finding a computer used by Choi which had over 200 files containing confidential information.According to another TV channel, TV Chosun, Choi, in 2014, received a report on the presidential office’s detailed personnel plans, including the candidates for the presidential senior secretary for civil affairs post.It also disclosed video footage of Choi in November that year supposedly giving instructions to staff on what the president should wear during official events -- outfits which Park ended up wearing.Minjoo Party chief Rep. Choo Mi referred to Choi as “the president of the night,” referring to her supposed influence over the president.“This ‘disaster’ that has shattered the state system was brought on by Park, yet she fails to recognize how grave the situation is. ... I’m curious after Park’s 90-second apology , if she knows what ‘classified’ means, if she knows the danger of leaking information, if she cannot distinguish between public and private matters, and if she indeed feels any sense of guilt or shame,” Choo said.Presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk on Wednesday refused to comment on what the president’s next action would be or whether she plans to leave the ruling Saenuri Party as demanded by some of its lawmakers.“I think she would have no choice but to do that ,” said Rep. Na Kyung-won of the Saenuri during a radio interview, adding that her staff should also resign en masse.Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil, who once during his campaign pledged to “protect Park,” called the current situation “a national crisis” and said that the president “has disappeared from the minds of people.”Rep. Kim Young-tae called Park’s apology “lie-ridden from start to end,” and reiterated his demand that the president leave Saenuri in order not to hinder the special investigation on the scandal.The prosecution Wednesday raided nine locations related to the scandal, including offices of the Mir and K-Sports foundations, the headquarters of the Federation of Korean Industries, along with Choi’s personal residence and office.A recent survey by the polling agency R&Search; showed that Park’s approval rating has fallen to an all-time low, with just 25.8 percent saying that Park is doing well and 69.6 percent showing disapproval. The agency said support for Park is likely to dip even further, as the research was conducted before she even admitted to the allegations.Student Councils of major universities across the country have declared a “state of emergency,” with more planning to follow suit. This included Ewha Womans University -- suspected of granting various favors to Choi’s daughter -- and Park’s alma mater Sogang University.By Yoon Min-sik","opposition parties agreed wednesday ,shadow president scandal following ,parties agreed wednesday ,wednesday to pursue special ,shadow president scandal","['Park Geun - hye', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Saenuri Party']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.48745412  0.07241953

The figures were based on trains assigned for service Sunday.As of Sunday, 7,326 unionized railroad and subway workers  were taking part in the strike that started 27 days earlier.  So far, 20 labor union executives have been referred to the prosecution for investigation with regard to the labor disputes, while 281 workers have been relieved from their positions. Unionized workers of South Korea's railway and subway services went on a joint strike in late September. The move marks the first time in 22 years that railroad workers went on strike. The workers are staging the strike to protest the government's push to implement a performance-based pay system.The merit pay system is part of President Park Geun-hye administration's efforts to boost labor flexibility to create more jobs, especially for the young generation. The labor sector is against the scheme, worrying that it could be used to allow companies to fire employees more easily and disrupt the working environment.This week, KORAIL is expected to keep the operation rates for its KTX bullet train, subway lines, passenger and cargo trains at 100 percent, 85 percent, 60 percent and 30 percent, respectively, almost the same levels seen a week earlier.","inconvenience protracted labor strike ,strike by railroad workers ,protracted strike by railroad ,public inconvenience protracted labor ,protracted labor strike","['the Korea Railroad Corp.', 'Seoul']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44753978 -0.06035219

Sohn Hak-kyu did not just cut all ties with the world of politics, he retreated from urban life to live in a mud-walled hut in a remote village in South Jeolla Province, spending most of his time reading books and meeting with local residents. The 68-year-old centrist came out of the wilderness Thursday and declared a return to politics, where ideological schisms are still prevalent among the established parties. “Now the mountain asks me to leave. I think it is time to leave” Sohn told reporters gathered outside his house at Gangjin County, South Jeolla Province, before leaving for the National Assembly in Seoul, where an official press conference was scheduled in the afternoon. Former Gyeonggi Gov. Sohn Hak-kyu“Here I stand today to devote myself to transforming Korea’s politic and economy,” he said at the presser, as a crowd of his supporters and some Minjoo lawmakers watched. To start anew and usher in new politics, the first thing he did was to discard his membership of the opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, which he headed in 2008 and in 2010. Back then, it was called the Democratic Party. In 2012, he vied for the party‘s presidential ticket but was defeated by Moon Jae-in. “I will abandon everything I earned as a party leader including its membership,” he said Thursday. The announcement came as a surprise to Minjoo members, who had expected their former leader to stay with the party and build ties with centrist lawmakers across the political spectrum, including former National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa. The five-term lawmaker, who left Saenuri after the latest general election in April, had a private meeting with Sohn about a month ago to discuss “state matters.” One of the strategies that Sohn, an academic-turned-politician, would use to boost his profile is revising the Constitution. “I think that the Sixth Republic’s fate reaches an end” said Sohn during the Thursday’s press conference, referring to the term that describes the government based on the current Constitution that was last changed in 1987. “Whoever is elected as president, they would not lead South Korea under the current system.” The reform of the basic law has often been at the center of political discourse, especially when the incumbent president is about to finish their five-year term. But, historically, the idea has mostly been broached by sitting a president and establishment parties’ frontrunners who want to seize the next administration.Cheong Wa Dae has reiterated that they have no plan to change the Construction, arguing that the debate would undermine the efforts to boost the economy. Opposition parties presidential hopefuls, Minjoo former leader Moon and People’s Party former leader Ahn Cheol-soo, echoed the negative view. Encouraged by Sohn’s defection from Minjooo, the People’s Party continued its effort to attract Sohn since the party emerged as the third-biggest bloc following the latest April election. Earlier last month, its former leader Rep. Ahn Choel-soo had a one-on-one meeting with Sohn to coax him into the centrist party. The fledging party, whose approval rating has been hovering at around 10 percent following an infamous bribery scandal involving its incumbent lawmakers, has vowed to grant Sohn an opportunity to join the race to elect its presidential candidate. The election is slated for December. “Now that Sohn has abandoned his party membership, we suggest he should join our party,” said People’s Party interim leader Rep. Park Jie-won on his Facebook account after hearing of Sohn’s defection. “He would give a new boost to our party.“By Yeo Jun-suk","party after humiliating defeat ,ex governor sohn returns ,minjoo party after humiliating ,politics leaves minjoo party ,the wilderness thursday","['Gyeonggi Province', 'Sohn Hak - kyu', 'South Jeolla Province']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54637998  0.11920107

We decided to consider possibly nullifying the tougher punishment plan,” a ministry official said. Participants shout slogans condemning the government’s plan to toughen punishment for illegal abortions during a rally in central Seoul on Saturday. A final decision may come as early as Wednesday, after a consultation meeting with private experts, the official said.The ministry had sought to revise a rule regarding the punishment of doctors for inappropriate medical practices, to toughen the penalty on illegal abortions -- from the current one-month suspension of business to a maximum of one year. South Korean law bans abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, severe genetic disorders or a woman’s health endangered by pregnancy. The allowed cases of abortion should be performed within 24 weeks of pregnancy. The law, however, is rarely enforced. For the past six years, only 23 cases of illegal abortions were reported to the authorities. During the period, over 1 million abortions are believed to have been carried out in South Korea. The ministry’s plan to introduce a tougher penalty sparked strong protests from women’s organizations, with over 400 people dressed in black staging a rally at the center of Seoul on Saturday. The protesters called out for their right to autonomous decisions and demanded the government to retract its plan for stricter rules on abortion.  The obstetrician association also slammed the government, arguing it is being blind to reality. “The government’s stronger measures do not reflect current society. It is only blaming doctors for increasing abortion cases,” the Korean Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said. The government had not discussed the issue with any medical organizations, it claimed. Experts also said that the government gave little consideration to the sensitivity of the issue. A clampdown on abortions requires social consensus, or at least efforts to achieve one, they said.

If the same thing had happened in western democracies, their Cabinet would have stepped down,” said Park on his Facebook account. “It reminded me of Watergate. It is the epitome of power abuse.” The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea’s former leader Moon Jae-in joined the criticism, denouncing the scandal as something that makes the government “feel ashamed” and shows “how ignorant” the Park administration has been about cultural affairs.  Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon. YonhapTheir fiery remarks came after the revelation that Cheong Wa Dae instructed government agencies, such as the Art Council Korea in charge of implementing cultural policies, to cut off financial and logistical support to entities related to artists listed in the backlist.The 100-page document, obtained exclusively by local daily Hankook Ilbo on Wednesday, includes a total of 9,473 artists, most of whom had supported Mayor Park’s 2014 run to become mayor and Minjoo Party leader Moon’s bid for the 2012 presidential election.Some artists were on the list for criticizing the government’s dealing with the sinking of Sewol in 2015, which left 295 dead and nine missing. Among them were Park Chan-wook, a renowned director who won the Grand Prix award at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival for his film “Oldboy.” Rep. Do Jong-hwan of the Minjoo Party of Korea, one of the first lawmakers to have raised the allegation, increased the pressure on the government. The poet-turned-politician had leaked the minutes of a closed-door meeting among the ACK leadership who appeared to acknowledge the existence of the black list. “We have seen so many allegations and suspicions pouring out,” said Do in an interview with local media. “We need to get to the bottom of the scandal and find out how far Cheong Wa Dae has been involved with this.” Cheong Wa Dae and the government denied the allegation. Presidential Spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk said Wednesday that he was told the scandal “was not true” by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism who oversees government agencies including the ACK. When asked Thursday by the lawmakers at the Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee during the annual parliamentary audit, Culture Minister Cho Yoon-son testified before lawmakers that “there was no such blacklist.” Outraged over the mounting censorship scandal, civic groups and art communities asserted that the scandal would constitute grave violation of freedom of speech and demanded the government promptly investigate. Cultural Action, a nonprofit organization advocating cultural diversity, said in a statement that the legislative body should hold a special hearing and that the government should dismiss officials embroiled in the scandal. It is not the first time that the Park administration has faced scrutiny over censorship. Over the past four years, the government has been accused of censoring art content depicting the president and her policies in a negative fashion over contentious issues In 2013, “Project Cheonan Ship,” a movie that challenged the government’s claim that North Korea had torpedoed South Korea’s warship Cheonan in 2010, was suspended by multiplex chain Megabox as the Defense Ministry and conservative civic groups filed an injunction to ban the film’s release. In August, South Korea’s pop artist Leeha was fined for satirizing President Park by distributing leaflets critical of President Park Geun-hye multiple times across the country. The artist depicted the president as a deranged women wearing a flower in a poster titled “Wanted. Mad Government.” “Government censorship tactics are getting sophisticated,” said Lee Youn-take, a theater director who claimed he was on the blacklist for endorsing former opposition party leader Moon jae-in during his 2012 presidential campaign. “Back in the ’70s, the authorities’ censorship mostly involved physical abuse or threats of violence. But now it is involved with everyday life. Censorship has existed throughout time. What has been changed is its method,” he said.

The activist had been in a coma ever since a water cannon knocked him down during a massive anti-government demonstration in November last year. While the ruling party and police say there is no clear link between the water cannon and Baek's death, the opposition bloc have criticized the excessive crackdown by the authorities.The investigation proposed by the opposition parties is set to focus on whether the water cannon used against the protester violated any laws, and find those responsible for the alleged excessive force.Amid the controversy, the ruling party said the proposal must be first discussed by the parliament's Legislation and Judiciary Committee.""The opposition parties are only seeking to boast their power, even as the country is facing tough challenges such as North Korean nukes, problems facing the economy, and typhoon damage,"" Rep. Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader of Saenuri said considering the proposal.""No discussion on the independent counsel can be made during the regular session of the parliament before the agreement is made by both the ruling and opposition bloc at the committee,"" Chung pointed out, adding the party also believes an independent counsel is unnecessary.Political pundits said the remark came as the judiciary committee is headed by a Saenuri lawmaker, who will also not be inclined to cooperate with the plan. Rep. Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party. The party whip added if National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun seeks to pass the proposal at the parliament directly without a nod from the committee, the situation may lead to another deadlock. South Korea's parliament was nearly paralyzed last week as Saenuri lawmakers staged a protest questioning political neutrality of the speaker, who originally came from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea.The dispute came after the parliament passed a motion to sack a Cabinet minister for alleged ethical lapses. The ruling party argued that in collusion with the opposition bloc, Chung railroaded the motion through parliament.","opposition parties on wednesday ,police water cannon last ,saenuri party said thursday ,thursday the opposition bloc ,said thursday the opposition","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', ""South Korea 's""]",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68048555  0.30171564

Kim Do-eup, Park Wan-ju and Kim Kwan-young, the respective vice floor leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, The Minjoo Party of Korea and People’s Party in a joint statement.The three held a luncheon meeting Monday, the day after Saenuri had announced an end to its five-day boycott to the state audit in protest against the Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. The ruling conservative camp’s claim was that Chung, whose former affiliation was with the Minjoo Party, accepted the floor vote on the opposition‘s call for the dismissal of a disputed agriculture minister with bias. Saenuri Party Chairman Lee Jung-hyun, admitted to a Seoul hospital after a weeklong hunger strike, looks at his cell phone at his hospital room on Oct. 3.Saenuri chief Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, with the support of his fellow party clique members standing close to President Park Geun-hye, had initiated a hunger strike, but decided to end his demonstration late Sunday.“All three parties agreed that the top priority task now is to maximize the productivity of the state audit,” said the Saenuri whip.“The party representatives of each parliamentary committee will come up with flexible schedules during the upcoming two weeks.“His Minjoo Party counterpart Rep. Park also claimed that the three-day prolongation should be enough to round off the much-delayed audit.But rival parties continued to stand at odds over the Saenuri’s pledge to pass a revision bill of the National Assembly Act to reinforce the neutrality obligation of the parliamentary speaker.”Our stance is that  is necessary to promote parliamentary democracy,“ said Saenuri floor leader Kim, claiming that the runner-up opposition People‘s Party had expressed its approval.But the Minjoo Party reiterated that the resolution for the minister’s dismissal was legitimate and that its passage could be seen as neither a procedural flaw, nor a violation of the speaker‘s neutrality obligation.By Bae Hyun-jung","political parties on monday ,party boycott last week ,parties on monday ,parties on monday agreed ,monday agreed to extend","['Kim Do - eup', 'Park Wan - ju', 'Kim Kwan - young', 'Saenuri Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73494089  0.41787174

Saenuri Party Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun has been on a hunger strike since Monday, demanding Speaker Chung Sye-kyun step down for allegedly siding with the opposition and violating parliamentary laws to have the opposition-led bill pass the plenary session last weekend.The bill recommending the president withdraw the nomination of Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo, who has been questioned on his alleged ethical lapses, was later vetoed by the president.Seats of the ruling Saenuri Party members remain vacant at the parliamentary audit session on Friday. As public criticism mounted over the extended legislative gridlock, the floor leaderships of the ruling party and an opposition party were seen seeking a way out.Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, who refused to end the boycott and instead joined Chairman Lee’s hunger strike, suggested holding a meeting among the floor leaders of the three major parties. His counterparts Rep. Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea and Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party expressed willingness.The People’s Party, which holds 38 votes in the 300-member Assembly, was seen attempting to take a mediating role in the prolonged confrontation.“I apologize for having been baffled by the hunger strike of the leader of the Saenuri Party and criticizing the move. ... I urge the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party as well as the Assembly speaker to fulfill the role to prevent the parliament from reaching breaking point,” Rep. Park said.Some observers said a compromise could come before Oct. 3, when Speaker Chung is set to leave for Australia to attend the parliamentary leaders’ conference of MIKTA, an association of Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia.Chung has so far refused to apologize or step down, saying he upheld all necessary laws in leading Assembly proceedings.Overnight, some Saenuri Party members gathered in front of Chung’s residence in Hannam-dong, central Seoul, asking for a meeting, doing so again Friday morning. They vowed to continue visiting his home until Chung agreed to resign.The Minjoo Party also remained resolute for the time being, expressing objection to the resignation calls.“It is hoped that we can announce a normalization of the audit after talking with the Saenuri Party floor leader.”Meanwhile, polls showed the approval ratings dropped for all of President Park Geun-hye, the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party in light of the legislative conflict.Gallup Korea’s survey of 1,004 adults nationwide this week showed that 30 percent approved of President Park, a 1 percentage point drop from the week before.The Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party saw 31 percent and 24 percent, respectively, marking a 2 percentage point and 1 percentage point drop from the previous week.The People’s Party, for its part, saw a slight rise by 2 percentage points.","audit debacle rival parties ,party protest against the ,debacle rival parties faced ,debacle rival parties ,party protest against","['Saenuri Party ’s', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'the National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.4303441   0.11653844

Lee Jung-hyun  and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae Tuesday urge the government for earthquake safety measures. Yonhap“Making an excuse after the people were hurt is like committing crimes against them,” said Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun during the party’s emergency meeting on the earthquake. “I think the government failed to offer guidance during the disaster.” The Saenuri Party’s chief noted that the disaster agency’s alarm system failed to send text messages about the disaster to the public. The agency has used text messages to alert the public about emergency events and climate abnormalities, like extreme hot weather. The state agency’s website was also temporarily shut down when the earthquake struck Monday evening. Telephone services in the southern region of South Korea were temporarily unavailable and KakaoTalk, the nation’s most popular mobile messenger, stopped working for a while as well. Officials attributed the shutdown to massive inflow of traffic from users inquiring about the disaster, admitting the nation’s alarm system is not as advanced and responsive as those used by countries with a record of such natural disasters, such as Japan. “There is a substantial limitation to broadcasting the disaster using text messages,” said Kim Hee-gyum, a director of Ministry of Public Safety and Security who oversees disaster response. “We need investment to provide advanced service like Japan.” Opposition parties, for their part, also denounced that the government’s disaster alert system, charging that it failed to address the nationwide disaster despite the effort to overhaul the safety system after the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014, which left 304 dead or missing,In response to a public outcry that mounted in the disaster’s aftermath, the government announced a system overhaul by disbanding the coast guard and creating the Ministry of Public Safety and Security to improve disaster prevention systems. “It seems to me there was no one to tell the people about the surprise disaster and come up with an emergency plan,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea’s leader Rep. Choo Mi-ae during the party meeting. “The only thing changed after the Sewol disaster was the people, not the government.”Cheong Wa Dae, meanwhile, said that President Park Geun-hye was notified about the earthquake promptly by the presidential secretary for disaster response and public safety.“Being notified and giving instruction is something that the president must do,” Presidential Spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters on Tuesday. Cheong Wa Dae’s reaction to the Sewol tragedy and President Park’s whereabouts were under fire during the Sewol tragedy. Some media outlets alleged she had been away from the presidential compound when the tragedy occurred.By Yeo Jun-suk","government earthquake countermeasures political ,tuesday sharply criticized the ,on tuesday sharply criticized ,tuesday sharply criticized ,parties on tuesday sharply","['Saenuri Party', 'the Ministry of Public Safety and Security']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69005352  0.39995036

Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo came under fire for engaging in dubiously lucrative land-purchasing deals and for writing down his mother’s assets o profit from the government’s social security subsidies. The move came a day after President Park Geun-hye, currently in Hangzhou, China, for a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies, used the electronic system to appoint Minister Kim and Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun despite a parliamentary report declaring the two nominees unqualified for their jobs. “We see the president’s decision as an act of belittling the National Assembly,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea after the trilateral meeting with his counterparts from the runner-up opposition People’s Party and the progressive minority Justice Party.But the three parties decided not to pursue the dismissal of Culture Minister Cho. The former presidential aide has been facing public criticism over her lack of expertise in the cultural sector, as well as alleged ethical lapses throughout her public official career.“The decision was part of our choice and concentration ,” said Rep. Ki Dong-min, the Minjoo’s floor spokesperson. “It is not that we overlooked .” Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun  and Agriculture Minister Kim Jae-soo  listen to Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun's address at the National Assembly on Monday. YonhapThe opposition camp, currently accounting for the parliamentary majority with 165 out of 300 seats, is capable of motioning -- and approving -- the removal of Cabinet members, as long as half of the floor attends and votes for the agenda.The resolution, however, would not legally bind the president, who holds the full authority on the appointment and dismissal of Cabinet members.According to Article 61 of the Constitutional Law, the Assembly can only “recommend” the dismissal of administration officials to the president. The heads of ministries can only be dismissed when the Constitution Court endorses impeachment against the ministers proposed by half of attending lawmakers. “Passing motion is no more than political pressure,” an official at the National Assembly told the Korea Herald, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “Lawmakers can only dismiss cabinet members through impeachment process.” Agriculture Minister Kim, meanwhile, pledged to push back against the opposition parties’ plan to dismiss him, accusing them of launching an “all-out smear campaign” during his hearing process and vowing to press defamation charges against media outlets who painted him as unfit for the job. “False accusations and political attacks against me were rampant during the parliamentary hearing,” said Kim in a text massage sent to his friends. “Once I take office, I will pursues legal steps against those who defamed me.”By Yeo Jun-suk","new agriculture minister lashing ,lashing out against president ,agriculture minister lashing out ,opposition parties on monday ,controversial ministers opposition parties","['Park Geun', 'Kim Jae - soo']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80132663  0.08368029

The two attended the same middle and high schools. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office opened the internal inspection earlier on Friday upon receiving a report from the Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office. The top prosecutors’ office is set to inspect the reporting process and check whether there were any attempts by the local prosecutors’ office to cover up the incumbent prosecutor’s alleged wrongdoing. The Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office had allegedly been aware of the corruption suspicions since May. The senior prosecutor is suspected of receiving the kickbacks in February and March through his acquaintances’ bank accounts. In return, the prosecutor reportedly met with investigators from his office for dinner to ask them to drop the case involving the person who gave the bribe.The businessman, who is currently on the wanted list, fled while the prosecution applied for a court-issued warrant to arrest him. He argued in interviews with local media that he had served as a “financial sponsor” for the prosecutor by providing him with meals and money on a regular basis. During questioning by the probe team over the weekend, the senior prosecutor Kim allegedly said he had borrowed the money and paid it back in about a month, dismissing the businessman’s claims as false. He also reportedly said the financial transactions were not related to the legal case. “The suspect  is an alumni of my middle and high school, but we are not at all related. Our financial transactions were over before he was sued in a fraud case,” the prosecutor told a local news agency. “It is an unilateral argument by the suspect who refuses to comply with legal procedures.”The allegation is the latest in a series of corruption scandals involving former and incumbent legal professionals, which has taken a toll on the reputation of the nation’s justice system.On Friday, the prosecution arrested an incumbent senior judge, identified by his surname Kim, on suspicion of accepting kickbacks from ex-Nature Republic CEO Jung Woon-ho. Jung allegedly asked the judge to hand down a heavy sentence to cosmetics makers who distributed fake Nature Republic products. In June, prosecutor-turned-lawyer Hong Man-pyo was arrested over suspicions that he evaded taxes and used his connections in the judiciary to seek a lenient ruling for his client Jung.The judge-turned-lawyer Choi You-jeong is also standing trial on suspicions of taking advantage of her status as a former judge to seek a favorable ruling for Jung. In return, she allegedly received 5 billion won in attorney fees. Ex-senior prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon was indicted in late July on charges of benefiting from shady stock transactions and accepting bribes worth 950 million won from Kim Jung-ju, the founder of the nation’s largest game-maker Nexon. Yang Sung-tae, chief justice of the Supreme Court, is lost in thought during an inaugural ceremony for the incoming Supreme Court Justice Kim Jae-hyung on Monday. YonhapThe Supreme Court said it will hold an emergency meeting of lower court chiefs Tuesday to discuss a solution to prevent a recurrence of such corruption scandals.

The seats of the parliamentary speaker, the ruling Saenuri Party‘s chairman and committee chiefs remain vacant. He then referred to presidential aide Woo who, despite the escalating criticism and the ongoing prosecutorial probe on his corruption allegations, has been refusing to step down.“High-ranking public servants, especially Cheong Wa Dae’s chief position on civil affairs, are subject to strict moral standards and hold significant influence over the prosecution,” Chung said, urging for Woo’s resignation.The speaker also advocated the introduction of an independent investigation organization to dig into the corruption charges of ranking government officials.He then moved on to the THAAD agenda, blaming the government’s lack of strategic judgment and communication in the process.“Regardless of whether THAAD was indeed indispensable, there has been no communication whatsoever on the issue,” Chung said.He argued that the government seems to have overlooked the negative consequences that the US armament may cause on the peninsula’s neighboring countries. Beijing has repeatedly expressed through official channels its strong resistance against the far-reaching defense system.Vexed by the parliamentary speaker’s speech, lawmakers of the ruling Saenuri Party left the general meeting hall in protest and gathered in an urgent party meeting.“Unless the speaker offers an appropriate apology and takes due follow-up measures, the Saenuri shall hereby boycott all parliamentary schedules,” said floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk.The Saenuri whip blasted upon the speaker for violating his obligation to maintain political neutrality. Chung is currently defected from The Minjoo Party of Korea, due to his parliamentary position.Rep. Cho Won-jin argued that Chung’s words were enough to call for impeachment.The plenary session, if processed as planned, was expected to pass the 11 trillion won supplementary budget bill, barely making it in time for the government to execute the extra budget within the year.The final version involved an increase in the school facility improvement funds and a decrease in foreign exchange bonds and state-run bank investments, marking an overall drop of 105.4 billion won.The compromise final draft, which made it past the special parliamentary committee on budget and accounts to reach the general meeting, was agreed in a last-minute negotiation late on Wednesday.Reps. Joo Kwang-deok, Kim Tae-nyeon and Kim Dong-cheol, respectively speaking for the ruling Saenuri Party, The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party, jointly announced on Thursday morning that they had agreed to pass the revised budget bill.Parties cut 465.4 billion won off the spending plans, including 200 billion won from foreign exchange stabilization funds and another 127.3 billion from the state-run Korea Development Bank investment funds.An extra 360 billion won was injected in other sectors, such as 200 billion won on improving school facilities, 80 billion won in medical care assistance and 27.2 billion for supporting the disabled and the elderly.But the Nuri Curriculum, the state-backed child care program which the ruling party claimed should be paid for by individual provincial governments, was excluded from the extra budget benefit.By Bae Hyun-jung","demanding the speaker resign ,session thursday but suffered ,speaker resignation the 20th ,boycotted the general meeting ,suffered an immediate roadblock","['National Assembly', 'Saenuri Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46364009  0.18561088

They slammed him for letting the opposition vote in favor of a child care budget revision bill in the absence of ruling party members. Rep. Yoo is affiliated with the runner-up opposition People’s Party.“The culture committee chairman violated the Constitution by altering the budget bill’s content without the consent of the Education Ministry and Culture Ministry,” said Rep. Kwak at the beginning of the hearing session.The committee, in the absence of the objecting ruling party members, had voted in favor of a budget bill clause to draw up 600 billion won  to cover for regional education debts Monday.Other Saenuri members of the committee backed Kwak, claiming that chairman Yoo is not qualified to lead the hearing, with some demanding for his immediate resignation.Yoo attempted to push ahead with the hearing, urging lawmakers to focus on assessing the minister nominee, but soon had to adjourn the session due to the aggravating verbal exchange. The 10 a.m. meeting, which was delayed by 55 minutes, reached a deadlock in 40 minutes.The session reopened in the afternoon but only opposition lawmakers were present, with Saenuri members boycotting it. Minister nominee Cho, known to be close to President Park Geun-hye, has been facing a number of integrity disputes, including the way in which she had increased her assets. The opposition camp has asserted that she made some 2.7 billion won through real estate speculation.The former lawyer and lawmaker reported 5.2 billion won  in total property this year.Meanwhile, tension continued among the rival parties over the 11 trillion won extra budget plan. The three parties on Tuesday had failed to lay the bill to the full parliamentary floor as earlier agreed.Their dissent was on the funds to support local governments and subsidies for South Korean firms which had to close their businesses in the Gaeseong Industrial Complex earlier this year.Exerting pressure on the opposition resistance, the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae reiterated its calls for prompt and timely passage of the budget bill.“Timing is crucial for the extra budget plan, which is to address the  for the restructuring of major industries,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters.By Bae Hyun-jung","the political parties feuding ,key parliamentary agendas wednesday ,due to verbal battle ,political parties feuding over ,political parties feuding","['Culture', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'Saenuri', 'cul']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92954469  0.51543278

But the party's adoption of the official stance would boost Park's push for the THAAD deployment.In recent weeks, the commander-in-chief has repeatedly made emphatic calls for the public and political circles to back the THAAD deployment, saying that it is an ""inevitable, self-defense"" measure to defend the nation and its people.Over the THAAD issue, the Minjoo Party of Korea has so far maintained an indecisive stance as Kim Chong-in, its former interim leader, has opposed moves by party lawmakers to resist the deployment plan.But expectations are growing that Choo Mi-ae, who was elected MPK chief in a landslide victory on Saturday, might adopt a party stance against THAAD given that she is seen favoring more progressive party tenets and may want to draw the line in relation to Saenuri.During her election campaign, Choo said that the MPK should adopt a collective position against THAAD, although following her election win she said, ""My stance remains unchanged, but I will seek party consensus.""The MPK will hold a major gathering of lawmakers to determine whether it will officially oppose the THAAD issue.The minor opposition People's Party, meanwhile, has been against the THAAD deployment from the outset, criticizing the MPK for its ambiguous stance over the security issue.","party on tuesday adopted ,the party lawmakers unanimous ,party officially backs thaad ,saenuri party on tuesday ,counter pyongyang evolving nuclear","['Saenuri Party', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Pyongyang', 'Terminal High - Altitude Area Defense']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45878929  0.16754906

Ha Tae-keung, a ruling Saenuri Party representative on the parliamentary Environment and Labor Committee. Environment Minister nominee Cho Kyeung-kyu attends the parliamentary confirmation hearing on Friday. The standing committee held a confirmation hearing on the minister nominee, who was named on Aug. 16 to replace Yoon Seong-kyu. The former minister Yoon stepped down earlier from his post amid criticisms over the toxic humidifier disinfectant tragedy and fine dust countermeasures.Cho, the deputy chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination under the Prime Minister’s Office, is considered an expert in the financial sector, having served in the Economic Planning Board, the Ministry of Planning and Budget and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.“Although many  worry about my 27 years of experience at the Finance Ministry, I have chiefly taken charge of social agenda there, such as the environment, education and public welfare,” the nominee said in answer to doubting questions.“Based on my experience of collaborating with various authorities, I will solve pending  issues through communication with other ministries.”Since 2014, Cho has participated in drawing up the government’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan during his time at the Prime Minister’s Office. He has also overseen the comprehensive government plan to fight fine dust.The minister candidate addressed the Volkswagen’s emissions-rigging scandal, vowing to reinforce the number of officials responsible for the supervision of vehicle authentication. He also promised to fully support the victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant in receiving their due treatment and compensation.Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers cited some allegations of irregularities against Cho.Rep. Han Jeoung-ae of The Minjoo Party of Korea asked Cho about the suspicion that he had received private information for his stock investment in Il-yang Pharmaceutical in 2009.In 2009 June, two months after Cho purchased Il-yang Pharmaceutical stocks, the company officially entered into a contract with a local avian influenza expert regarding swine flu vaccination technology.“I normally did stock investment during my spare time such as during lunch time, while all I did was to receive phone calls from stock firms and talk to them on stocks for about 10 seconds,” said Cho, denying the given allegations.Cho also apologized about gaining special favors for his then-middle school student son regarding his volunteer activity at the Ministry of Planning and Budget -- now integrated into the Ministry of Strategy and Finance -- in 2001-2003.“I think it was not considerate enough to allow my son to work in my office ,” said Cho.By Kim Da-sol","confirmation hearing on friday ,new environment minister nominee ,the new environment minister ,environment minister nominee questioned ,new environment minister",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41497844 -0.02319418

Earlier in the day, Saenuri chief Rep. Lee Jung-hyun urged for the swift passage of the budget bill during the trilateral meeting, saying, “I request that the opposition rise beyond partisan boundaries when it comes to the people’s livelihood.” The gathering was the first of its sort to take place since Lee was elected to his post on Aug. 9. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn , Saenuri Party leader Rep. Lee Jung-hyun and presidential chief of staff Lee Won-jong pose for photographs ahead of their trilateral meeting at the party’s headquarters in Seoul on Thursday. Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldPrime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and presidential chief of staff Lee Won-jong reciprocated, respectively speaking for the Cabinet and for Cheong Wa Dae.“I hope that the ruling party, government and presidential office all work together to bring the Park administration, which is not at the three-fifths mark , to a successful conclusion,” said Lee.Along with the budget bill, the prime minister also stressed the need to pass a series of economic revitalization bills. In the list were bills aimed at reforming the labor market and establishing regulation-free zones, all of which the president has been advocating under the slogan of a creative economy.But the issue of senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo, who is being pressured to step down over corruption scandals, was not mentioned during the meeting.“Today’s meeting was purely on policies,” the party’s chief policymaker Rep. Kim Gwang-lim told reporters at a briefing.Despite ongoing disputes concerning his integrity, the Blue House has so far refused to dismiss the senior aide or to accept his resignation.By Bae Hyun-jung","rival parties on thursday ,parties on thursday tentatively ,pass extra budget bill ,parties on thursday ,hours after the ruling","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80215615  0.16980875

He assumed the chairmanship shortly before the April 13 general election and will officially step down at the party's convention set for Saturday.""I suggest a bipartisan committee in charge of the issue be established,"" he said.Kim has been a staunch supporter of constitutional reform as he believes it can lessen the negative effects of the current system where administrative power is centered too much on the president and so little is given to the prime minister, the Cabinet or the National Assembly. By bringing up the familiar issue again at this time, he also seemed intent on setting an agenda for the presidential election next year.

Kim Chong-in rebuked the party members for causing a stir by visiting the neighbor state amid growing concerns about Beijing’s assertive attitude toward Seoul’s decision to install the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery.  The Minjoo Party’s leader Rep. Kim Chong-in speaks during the party’s general assembly on Thursday. The conservative-minded leader, who is to step down when the party elects a new leader on Aug. 27, has avoided expressing his views about the THAAD deployment publicly and had urged his party members to be cautious.“A party does not deserve its existence if it does not show determination to seize power or fails to show capacity to hold power,” Kim said in what was his last general assembly address as leader.“Only when we make a consistent set of actions through cool-headed and sharp reviews  will we be able to receive continuous support from the people.”He also went on to call for a change in the way the party has been operating, pointing specifically to radical-minded members who have been pressing Kim to officially oppose the THAAD deployment.  “The political party does not exist for the sake of your intellectual satisfaction. Even if you think that the Minjoo Party’s position may seem extremely ambiguous or does not fit your beliefs, there is no choice but to lead the party the way  as winning  is a crucial task.”But the dissenting members, particularly the six lawmakers who visited China despite Kim’s opposition, continued to tout the trip as improving the strained bilateral relationship by communicating with Chinese leaders over the THAAD. “We made a breakthrough on icy relations with China,” Rep. Kim Young-ho was quoted as saying during the meeting by the Minjoo spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min. Kim, who studied international relations at Beijing University, was one of the six first-termers visiting China. The central-left party’s official statement also praised the trip for defusing potential bilateral tension and seeking a solution to avoid standoff. In the document, the party spokesman said that the delegates from Korea and China agreed to push for a summit during the G20 meeting from Sep. 4 to 5.  The opposition lawmakers’ visit to Beijing was heavily criticized by President Park Geun-hye, the ruling Saenuri Party as well as some members of the Minjoo Party. Park has denounced the delegation for “representing the same opinion as North Korea.”Mindful of the criticism, the delegates engaged in limited activity while in Beijing, mostly devoting their time to low-key meetings with Chinese scholars and Korean residents. The lawmakers said they refrained from making comments and holding events that could be interpreted as advocating Beijing’s position.   As an example, the lawmakers cited how they refused to include a clause to oppose the missile deployment in a joint declaration adopted after the meeting with officials from the Pangoal institution, a Bejing-based research center dealing with government policies. “The public attention the trip attracted was much more than we anticipated. Sometimes, we felt overwhelmed and didn’t know what to do,” Rep. Kim Byung-wook said at a press conference on Wednesday. “But we kept in mind that we represent the legislative body and the people of South Korea,” he said.Meanwhile, the president and the Saenuri Party on Thursday vowed to address growing concern over the THAAD deployment’s impact on public health and local agriculture, reiterating their support for the missile system.“Every attendee shared the view with the president over security challenges,” the party’s new chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun told reporters after the meeting at Cheong Wa Dae between the president and the Saenuri leadership. “We talked about offering information  in an accurate and frank manner,” he said.

Last month, South Korea's central bank revised down its growth outlook to 2.7 percent from 2.8 percent three months earlier, citing sluggish consumption at home and abroad.On Monday, the three major parties including the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the People's Party agreed to open a parliamentary plenary session on Aug. 22 to handle the extra budget plan.","discuss next year budget ,government on tuesday agreed ,government agree over increase ,next year budget ,the government on tuesday","['Saenuri Party', 'North Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49214083  0.23132953

It has been led by an interim leadership since its crushing defeat in the April 13 parliamentary polls. Some 9,100 delegates are set to cast their ballots at the convention. Around 69,800 general and senior party members already voted in Sunday's advance voting that saw a low turnout of only 20.7 percent.The combined ballots by party members and delegates account for 70 percent of the election results, while public opinion polls comprise 30 percent.Four Saenuri lawmakers -- Lee Jung-hyun, Lee Ju-young, Joo Ho-young and Han Sun-kyo -- have been vying for the party's top post.These photos show four candidates vying for the ruling Saenuri Party's top post: Reps. Lee Jung-hyun, Lee Ju-young, Joo Ho-young and Han Sun-kyo . Rep. Lee Jung-hyun said that should he be elected, it would mark a ""touching"" case of overcoming regionalism. Lee is from the country's southwestern Honam region where liberal opposition parties have traditionally held greater sway."" I would turn the party into one that serves for citizens, and bring about a change in South Korea's politics as well,"" he told Yonhap News Agency over the phone.Rep. Joo stressed the importance of reforming the party in a direction that promotes unity so as to win in next year's presidential election. ""I am the one fit for  promoting party unity,"" he said.Rep. Lee Joo-young also underscored that the party should make concerted efforts to overcome factional feuds and unite as one.Han, whose constituency is in Yongin just south of Seoul, cast himself as the most suitable candidate to push for the party's personnel reform, emphasizing that he is not affiliated with any party faction.For four Supreme Council seats, eight candidates have been competing. They are Cho Won-jin, Lee Jang-woo, Ham Jin-kyu, Kang Seok-ho, Jeong Yong-gi, Chung Moon-hun. Lee Eun-jae and Choi Yeon-hye.Yoo Chang-soo and Lee Boo-hyeong are vying for one council seat allotted for a youth party member.Meanwhile, the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea is set to hold its own leadership election on Aug. 27.","convention on tuesday afternoon ,national convention on tuesday ,next year presidential election ,convention on tuesday ,afternoon to elect new","['Saenuri Party', 'Seoul', 'Supreme Council']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47573152  0.65521556

The party has been led by an interim leadership since its crushing defeat in the April 13 parliamentary polls.At the convention, some 9,100 delegates are set to cast their ballots. On Sunday, some 69,800 general and senior party members -- only some 21 percent of the designated voters for the day -- voted in advance. Ballots by party members and delegates account for 70 percent of the election results, while public opinion polls comprise 30 percent. Four Saenuri lawmakers -- Lee Jung-hyun, Lee Ju-young, Joo Ho-young and Han Sun-kyo -- have been vying for the party's top post. Lee Jung-hyun, who has been backed by a group of lawmakers loyal to President Park Geun-hye, called the ""Pro-Park"" faction, has remained slightly ahead of other candidates in public opinion surveys.Joo Ho-young, a candidate representing the group of lawmakers who are not closely affiliated with the president, also remains a formidable competitor with strong backing from former party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung.Joo is also backed by his supporters in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province -- the ruling party's traditional support base.Among those who participated in Sunday's early voting, 19,326 people were from the region.Having thrown his hat in the ring earlier than others, Rep. Lee Ju-young is seen as having a fairly strong following in his hometown of South Gyeongsang Province. He has declared himself a ""neutral figure"" not affiliated with any of the party's major factions.Rep. Han, whose support base lies in the Seoul metropolitan area, has also been emerging as a notable candidate for the party's chairmanship.For the five Supreme Council seats, 10 party members have been engaged in the heated race.The pro-President Park faction has fielded three lawmakers -- Cho Won-jin, Lee Jang-woo and Ham Jin-kyu -- and is hoping to have at least two of them clinch council seats.Also in the race are Reps. Kang Seok-ho and Jeong Yong-gi, and Chung Moon-hun. Lee Eun-jae and Choi Yeon-hye are vying for the one slot in the council designated for a woman, while Yoo Chang-soo and Lee Boo-hyeong are competing for the youth slot.","presidential vote on tuesday ,unpredictable before tuesday vote ,next year presidential vote ,leadership race remains unpredictable ,on tuesday the party","[""Saenuri Party 's"", 'Seoul', 'Supreme Council']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79915828  0.27907452

The party is expected to adopt a unified position over the issue after it holds its national convention late this month.The other two parties have been against the deployment plan, criticizing the government for failing to secure a national consensus before finalizing a plan to deploy a THAAD battery in the southern town of Seongju.The move to reform the prosecution followed a high-profile corruption scandal involving a senior prosecutor. Last month, state investigators indicted Jin Kyung-joon, the prosecutor who has been suspected of receiving over 900 million won  worth of bribes from a businessman, from 2005 to 2014.","opposition parties on wednesday ,prosecution reform the three ,parties on wednesday agreed ,parliamentary panels to address ,three opposition parties on","['U.S.', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', ""the People 's Party"", 'Justice Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44613287  0.55051076

They plan to impose higher inheritance taxes and restrict creation of corporations under false names for real estate rental purposes to avoid taxation.Changes to income and corporate taxes were not included in the government’s tax reform plan released on Jul 28. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance reiterated on Tuesday hiking up the taxes would undermine investment and consumption.The Minjoo Party of Korea‘s chief policymaker Rep. Byun Jae-ill  announces the party’s tax reform measures during a party meeting on Tuesday. The Minjoo Party’s chief policy strategist Rep. Byun Jae-ill said: “Our proposal aims to ensure fairness and transparency in the taxation system ... Raising the taxes is also a precondition for implementing aggressive expansionary fiscal policy.”The central-left party’s tax plan calls for 41 percent tax on the individuals whose annual income tops 500 million won . Currently, the government imposes 38 percent income tax on the individuals making 150 million won and more per year. The proposal includes a plan to hike tax on corporates with over 50 billion won in net profit from 22 percent to 25 percent. The Minjoo Party has already proposed a relevant bill aiming to increase corporate tax, which was the party’s pledge during the latest election.Currently, the maximum corporate tax rate of 22 percent is levied on businesses with over 20 billion won in net profit. The party expects that their proposal would incur additional tax revenue worth 3 trillion won. The party also pursues changes to the way the businesses pay for value-added tax. In order to prevent some companies from evading taxes by manipulating their business records, they suggested credit card companies directly pay for the VAT currently imposed on entities such as big supermarket and department stores.“Though the consumers pay the price of VAT when purchasing products and service, some companies end up not paying them to the National Tax Service,” said the Minjoo Party’s deputy chief policymaker Rep. Choi Woon-youl. “The actual amount of taxes collected falls nearly 10 trillion won short each year,” he said. In a move to prevent tax dodges prevalent among big conglomerates, the party seeks to raise taxes levied on stock ownership transfers for both listed and unlisted shares from 20 to 25 percent. They also plan to reduce deductibles on inheritance tax from 10 to 3 percent.The tax plan was welcomed by the second-biggest opposition People’s Party, who argues that the tax increase is needed to raise tax revenue. The centrist party plans to announce its own version of tax reform this September. But the government and the Saenuri Party dismissed the proposal, saying that the tax increase would hinder economic growth. The Saenuri Party’s chief strategist Rep. Kim Gwang-lim on Tuesday noted that most countries are slashing taxes to boost their economy. Instead, the conservative party said that it would consider holding a public debate over the tax code with opposition parties. “We should open up ourselves  and inform the public of the current system,” said the Saenuri spokesperson Rep. Min Kyung-wook.

The rules make it illegal to accept meals exceeding 30,000 won, presents in excess of 50,000 won, and money for congratulations and condolences over 100,000 won.""Although it may seem excessive by some because of the considerable influence civic groups and labor unions exert on society, it only makes sense that they are covered by the law,"" a ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker said.He pointed out that it makes no sense to include journalists and school teachers who are not public servants, while leaving out unionists and civic group members.The same survey showed lawmakers were on the whole opposed to reducing the coverage of the law.This past Thursday, the country's Constitutional Court ruled that including journalists and teachers is valid. It also upheld the law's clause that makes it mandatory to report gifts received by spouses.With the introduction of the law, Seoul aims to shows its commitment to rooting out graft and other illegal activities that hurt public cohesion and the countries' competitiveness on the international stage.Besides revising the law, lawmakers were for the most part against changing the rules to exclude agricultural and fishery goods from being classified as bribes.On the other hand some lawmakers called for raising the upper limit of what would constitute a bribe that could allow more leeway and not hurt the local economy.Local farmers and fishermen have been opposed to the implementation of the Kim Young-ran law because they fear it could hurt demand and their earnings.","lawmakers favor expanding anti ,lawmakers favor expanding ,unions civic groups lawmakers ,lawmakers favor ,lawmakers sitting on parliament",['National Policy Committee'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66134822 -0.09297611

The supplementary budget is part of the government’s 28 trillion-won stimulus package designed to prop up the sluggish economy and ease fallout from corporate restructuring in key industries such as shipbuilding. The rival parties have tentatively agreed to pass the budget bill on Aug. 12, but they remain divided over the details.  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Strategy and Finance Yoo Il-ho speaks during a press briefing on the supplementary budget in Sejong City last Friday. The ruling Saenuri Party has demanded the bill’s prompt passage to jumpstart the economy and create jobs, but opposition parties have vowed to scrutinize the budget and incorporate welfare into the plan. “I don’t think we should agree unconditionally with the extra budget,” said Rep. Park Wan-joo, a deputy floor leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea. “The purpose of the budget plan is very ambiguous. It is unclear whether they target economic growth, restructuring industries and creating jobs,” he said. The center-left party also demanded the extra budget include plans to finance a free child care program. They urged the government to either allocate part of this year’s supplementary budget to the subsidy program for children aged 3-5 or to set aside money in next year’s budget to fund the welfare scheme. The Saenuri Party said that the supplementary budget should be implemented promptly and any debate over the child care program would hinder efforts to enact the plan in time. They added that local authorities can use government subsidies to fund the program on their own. “The most important aspect of the budget plan is its timely implementation,” said Kim Jung-jae, a floor spokeswoman of the Saenuri Party. “If we miss the window of opportunity, efforts to create jobs and boost growth would be undermined,” she said. By Yeo Jun-suk","national assembly on tuesday ,tuesday as rival parties ,fallout from corporate restructuring ,government 28 trillion won ,assembly on tuesday",['the National Assembly'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68985486  0.13932264

Choi Kyung-hwan and Yoon Sang-hyun pressured another party member against running in a constituency contested by key pro-Park member Rep. Suh Chung-won during the April 13 general election. Follow-up reports have also suggested former senior presidential secretary for politics Hyun Ki-hwan made a similar phone call.Reps. Choi Kyung-hwan  and Yoon Sang-hyun attend a luncheon hosted by President Park Geun-hye on July 8. The controversy has led to non-Park members demanding legal measures. It has also laid bare loosening control in the camp that has been rallying around Park as she inches closer to her lame duck period.The pro-Parks joined criticism against the implicated lawmakers, but also warned against aggravating factional conflict. Rep. Choung Byoung-gug, a fifth-term non-Park member who intends to run for the party’s chairmanship, said in a radio interview, “One clear thing is that those at the center of power corroborated to pressure a specific person ahead of the election.”“It is incredibly shameful. The party must swiftly set up a committee to look into the case and take any legal measures if necessary.”Rep. Lee Ju-young, another runner, told reporters, “It was incredibly wrong, I feel shamed as one of the senior-ranking members. But it is not appropriate to amplify the party’s rivalry through this issue.”Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, a key pro-Park member running against Choung and Lee Ju-young, was more reserved.“There still exists backwardness in the politics of our country that is nearly 70 years old,” he said in a radio interview. The former presidential secretary, however, refrained from commenting further when prodded by the interviewer, saying, “As I was not involved, I do not know.”The party has also been roiled by a separate allegation involving the current chief presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo. News reports have accused him of engaging in dubious real estate dealings in 2011 with a company currently embroiled in a corruption case. He is also accused of covertly representing a scandal-ridden business owner during his days as an attorney. Woo flatly denied the allegations on Wednesday, saying they were “humiliating.”The non-Park members said it was time for Woo to step down from his post, regardless of the truth, as the integrity of his position has already been tarnished. The senior secretary for civil affairs is responsible for maintaining discipline among public servants and vetting high-ranking officials.“Such disarray ultimately weakens the power of the president. I do think that it would help the administration if  makes the decision himself ,” Rep. Na Kyung-won said in a radio interview.Rep. Lee Hye-hoon said in another interview that it would be difficult for the investigation to remain fair if Woo stayed in his post. The prosecution is currently looking into the case following Woo’s suit against local media for reporting on the allegation.The opposition parties, meanwhile, took full advantage of the scandals to lash out at the administration and the rival party.The Minjoo Party of Korea and the People’s Party also increased pressure on the Saenuri Party, joining the move to draw up a law to establish a special investigation bureau responsible for high-ranking officials to ensure objectivity and independence.The Minjoo Party on Thursday formed a task force to prepare the bill.“It is meaningless for Woo to resist any more even when some of the ruling party members are calling for his resignation,” said Rep. Park Wan-joo, the chief deputy floor leader of the Minjoo Party.“The allegations surrounding Woo are proof of the rampant immorality in the Park Geun-hye administration.”People’s Party’s interim chief Rep. Park Jie-won also called on Woo to step down and face thorough investigation.“His intent to undergo the probe as the senior secretary for civil affairs is equivalent to a threat ,” he said.","nomination meddling candidates running ,alleged nomination meddling candidates ,meddling candidates running for ,party on thursday slammed ,hyun pressured another party","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Kyung - hwan', 'Yoon Sang - hyun', 'Suh Chung - win']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.52878761  0.30110615

With North Korea in possession of nuclear missiles and Iran close to having them, an EMP is no longer a theoretical concern -- it is a real threat,"" it said.But the platform did not include controversial proposals by its presidential candidate, Donald Trump, such as his demand that U.S.allies, such as South Korea and Japan, pay more for American defense support or U.S. troops should be withdrawn from the countries.On trade, however, the platform embraced many of the tough positions Trump has taken on the issue under his ""America first"" foreign policy, and said the U.S. needs ""better negotiated trade agreements.""""When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports. When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. interests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected,"" the platform said.It said the U.S. should not allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing its designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology. China should not be allowed to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of U.S.products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports.""Republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it. A Republican president will insist on parity in trade and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate,"" it said.Trump has expressed deeply negative views of free trade. In an economic policy speech early this month, the billionaire real-estate tycoon claimed that the free trade deal with South Korea enlarged U.S. trade deficits and cost American jobs. He called the pact, which has been in effect since 2012 and is considered a symbol of the economic alliance between the two countries, ""a job-killing deal.""Trump also vowed to pull out of the yet-to-be-ratified, 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership if elected president. He also said he would immediately renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to get a better deal, and withdraw from the deal unless Canada and Mexico agree to a renegotiation.","convention in cleveland ohio ,change in north korea ,communist nation nuclear weapons ,platform adopted on monday ,republican party platform calls","['the U.S. Republican Party', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Cleveland', 'Ohio']",18,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.18117099 0.17101818 0.43152225],임정요,North Korea,7,2016,"countries job killing deal trump ,dismantlement of north korea nuclear ,job killing deal trump ,to thwart american imports republicans ,party national convention in cleveland","['the U.S. Republican Party', 'North Korea', 'Kim', 'North Korea', 'Cleveland', 'Ohio', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'Australia', 'Philippines', 'Thailand', 'North Korea', 'China', 'Kim', 'korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.S.', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'North Korea', 'Iran', 'EMP', 'Donald Trump', 'u.s.allie', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'american', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'american', 'China', 'chinese', 'american', 'republican', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'american', 'Trans Pacific Partnership', 'the North American Free Trade Agreement', 'Canada', 'Mexico']",2,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.18117099 0.17101818 0.43152225]

The People’s Party’s decision takes a harsher tone compared to the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea that remains split on its stance on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system.The Seoul and U.S. governments announced last week that they have reached an agreement on the controversial THAAD deployment on the peninsular against threats from North Korea. The decision that came after years of speculation is strongly lambasted by China and Russia for fears of expanding U.S. military clout in the region.The agreement after several months of closed-door negotiations was made in response to North Korea’s nuclear and long-range missile tests in January and February. The opposition parties, progressive scholars and civic groups have opposed the decision that they claim lacks long-term defense strategy and unnecessarily raises tension. They also criticized the missile defense system as having “unverified” efficacy. The government, the military and conservative groups counter that the deployment is a sovereign decision that cannot be opposed by any other state and is aimed to improve the defense posture of the South against the rising nuclear threat from the North. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  attends the People’s Party’s meeting at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldThe People’s Party has been vocal against THAAD, and it is now moving to step up its opposition.The party said it will demand withdrawal of the deployment decision, and have the government gain approval from the National Assembly first if it needs to discuss the deployment again. “I consider myself as a conservative. But I have opposed  THAAD based on my conscience,” said Rep. Kim Joong-ro, a former Army commander, during a party meeting in the morning. “The security and economic risks  are immense.”Former co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo also voiced his concern.“In return for acquiring a missile response ability against North Korea, we will  be assisting North Korea in holding onto its nukes, make reunification even harder, and place our economy in a difficult situation,” he said, referring to growing fears that China might retaliate by taking economic measures against South Korean companies.Ahn had earlier suggested putting the decision to a referendum, but he did not repeat the proposal on Tuesday.Rep. Kim Kwan-young highlighted the opposition from residents in the potential candidate locations for THAAD to be deployed, as well as the environmental and health risks from the system and its electromagnetic waves.There were, however, also different, or less staunch, voices from within the party.“Although I am not very well informed of the matter, there are talks that the decision to deploy THAAD is an excellent conclusion. Rather than opposing it for sake of opposition and demanding a withdrawal of the decision, it would be wiser to precondition  by gaining China and Russia’s clearer stance on North Korea’s nuclear problem,” Rep. Yoo Sung-yop said.","third largest opposition party ,opposition party on tuesday ,the third largest opposition ,third largest opposition ,largest opposition party","['U.S.', 'the People ’s Party ’s', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seoul', 'U.S.']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39557585  0.26030022

The attendants instead agreed to build an entity to study the issue and seek parliamentary measure to address any potential diplomatic fallout. The Minjoo Party of Korea lawmakers attend a party meeting on Tuesday. The party leadership has refrained from publicly opposing the deployment, directing its criticism toward the government’s lack of communication during the negotiation process. The third-biggest People’s Party and minor Justice Party, meanwhile, voiced their opposition toward THAAD. “We have shared the view that the  issue is a matter of national interest, not a matter of political ideology and party’s identity,” The Minjoo Party’s floor spokesperson Rep. Ki Dong-min said in a briefing after the meeting. During the meeting that lasted over an hour, some 60 lawmakers debated whether the party should publicly oppose the missile system. The spokesperson said that the majority of the attendants urged the leadership to take the opposition as a party platform.Including Rep. Shim Jae-kwon, the National Assembly’s chairperson of Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, the opposition camps argued that THAAD is not capable enough to fully prevent North Korea’s missile and nuclear threat.The opposing lawmakers stressed that the measure would incur diplomatic backlash from China and Russia. Some allegedly voiced concerns that China, Korea’s top trade partner, would take retaliatory measures on trade against Seoul. Some first-term moderate lawmakers, on the other hand, struck a different tone during the meeting. Including the first-term lawmaker Rep. Rhee Cheol-hee, they recommended the leadership to keep a neutral stance toward sensitive security issue.  “ said that the party should consider the relationship with the U.S. and the party’s attempt to become a trustworthy political force capable of steering the nation. They noted that the black-and-white approach to the issue does not serve in the interest of the people,” the spokesman said. The growing schism among the ranks-and-file lawmakers followed the division over the security issue between incumbent party chairman Rep. Kim Chong-in and his looming rivals to replace his post. The opposition party will select a new leader on Aug. 27 and Kim is expected not to run for the job. In a media interview with a local daily on Tuesday, the fifth-term lawmaker said that the THAAD debate goes beyond a “yes or no argument” and the political party should “respect” the opinions of the government officials dealing with national security. His comment was seen to indicate that the main opposition party should avoid its attempt to reverse the already agreed-upon security policy. Since taking power as an interim leader this January, the 76-year-old politician had adopted a hawkish stance on security issues. The Minjoo Party’s presumptive candidates for leadership, such as Rep. Song Young-gil, Choo Mi-ae and Kim Boo-kyum, have made clear that they oppose the THAAD deployment. They urged the government to reconsider the plan to deploy the missile system.By Yeo Jun-suk","lawmakers on tuesday failed ,korea lawmakers on tuesday ,south korea main opposition ,lawmakers on tuesday ,party of korea lawmakers","['South Korea ’s', 'U.S.', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31302789  0.56068522

""According to a review by related ministries, the issue of deploying THAAD does not need parliamentary consent,"" the prime minister said during a parliamentary budget committee session.Asked whether the government would stop the deployment of THAAD here should North Korea opt for denuclearization, Hwang said, ""That is an issue to think about after the North's denuclearization.""""As the North is continuously advancing its nuclear program, what is more crucial at this point in time is to respond to the North's nuclear provocations,"" he added.After some five months of consultations, Seoul and Washington announced last week that they had decided to install a THAAD battery here. They are expected to announce the site for the battery later this month.THAAD, a core part of America's multilayered missile defense program, is designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 kilometers during the terminal phase of flight after detecting the missiles with a land-based radar system.A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors , a fire control and communications unit, and a powerful AN/TPY-2 radar.","approval some opposition lawmakers ,tuesday reiterated the government ,south korea requires ratification ,some opposition lawmakers ,opposition lawmakers","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Terminal High - Altitude Area Defense', 'South Korea', 'the National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4676739   0.45890614

Under the plan, a special panel will carry out their investigation for 90 days, during which it will verify who is responsible and if there was any problem on the part of the government. The panel will also discuss how to compensate the victims in the case.Those subject to the panel's investigation include the Korean unit of the British firm Oxy Reckitt Benckiser and local retailers Lotte Shopping and Homeplus. They also include the ministries of environment, health and industry, and the Fair Trade Commission.  The justice ministry and the prosecution were excluded from the list, although some critics have accused them of failing to investigate the case thoroughly and promptly.The latest parliamentary move came as victims and their families have called on the legislature to open an investigation into those who manufactured or sold the deadly humidifier disinfectants and enact a special law to prevent a recurrence.Korea has confirmed 221 victims in the case. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products. Out of 90 deaths, 70 are believed to have been caused by products made by the British firm.The humidifier disinfectant case came to light after four pregnant women died of unknown lung problems in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than a hundred people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.","assembly on wednesday endorsed ,worst consumer product scandals ,on wednesday endorsed plan ,investigation for 90 days ,national assembly on wednesday","['the National Assembly', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40811989  0.12051532

Lee  clearly violated the broadcasting act,” said Rep. Park Beom-kye of The Minjoo Party of Korea.The regular two-day session, during which lawmakers question government officials over state affairs, ran from Monday to Tuesday this week, with the first day on economic issues and the second on noneconomic ones.Rep. Lee, a third-termer and former senior presidential secretary for public affairs, is accused of attempting to interfere with Sewol ferry sinking reports that had been critical of the now-defunct Korea Coast Guard’s rescue attempts. The allegation was triggered by a phone conversation between Lee and then-director of public broadcaster KBS Kim Shi-gon, which the Union of Media Workers made public last week upon Kim’s consent.“The transcript shows that Kim, though he lashed back and resisted at first, ended up succumbing to Rep. Lee’s demands,” Rep. Park said, asserting that Lee’s pressure infringed on the freedom of broadcasting.Rep. Lee Yong-ju of the runner-up opposition People’s Party joined in, slamming Cheong Wa Dae for rationalizing Lee’s action.“Not only does this  require an immediate prosecutorial probe, but also President Park Geun-hye herself should make apologies to the media and to the families of the Sewol ferry victims,” Lee said.He then criticized presidential Chief of Staff Lee Won-jong for his remarks last week. Lee Won-jong had asserted that Lee Jung-hyun’s call was within his scope of duty as the Blue House’s media chief.The Saenuri Party, on the other hand, targeted Chongseon.net, a cluster of liberal civic groups which came under fire for holding anti-campaigns against specific candidates ahead of this year’s April 13 general election.The National Election Commission earlier filed a report to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, accusing the network of conducting illegitimate public polls without making due reports to the watchdog, thus constituting a violation of the Public Official Election Act.“There should be a reinforced level of supervision on the fund-raising and management process of civic groups, lest they turn politically lopsided during election seasons,” said Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun.Rep. Lee Che-ik added that among the 35 subjects of the anti-campaigns, 33 were Saenuri candidates or conservative-leaning independent runners.Meanwhile, the questioning session was halted in the morning due to scuffles between the rivaling parties.Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jun-suk  protests to Vice Assembly Speaker Park Joo-sun about a scuffle between People’s Party Rep. Kim Dong-cheol  and Saenuri Party Rep. Lee Jang-woo during the interpellation session at the National Assembly on Tuesday. YonhapRep. Kim Dong-cheol of the People’s Party stopped in the middle of his session, enraged over the Saenuri lawmakers’ interruption to his questions to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.Rep. Kim was arguing that despite President Park’s inauguration pledge to be fair over personnel affairs, most of the ministerial level officials were from the nation’s conservative stronghold Yeongnam region. He also blasted the president for lacking a proper apology over her “failure in state affairs.”Tension surged as the prime minister countered the accusations and several Saenuri lawmakers supported Hwang, leading to Kim raising his voice and denouncing the ruling party members as “subordinates to the prime minister.” The tension soon developed into a verbal brawl between Kim and Saenuri’s Rep. Lee Jang-woo, who slammed Kim’s remarks as crossing the line.As the confrontation surged, vice parliamentary Speaker Park Joo-sun announced an adjournment.By Bae Hyun-jung","tuesday blasted the government ,opposition parties on tuesday ,sewol ferry sinking two ,parties on tuesday blasted ,ferry sinking two years",['the National Assembly ’s'],18,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.3935411   0.32177934

While no agenda or detailed schedule was announced by state media, the 13th Supreme People’s Assembly’s fourth session was likely to restore the long-defunct Central People’s Committee and name Kim as its head, some experts say.Though the presumed change bears little impact on Kim’s already solid grip, he would look to flaunt his leadership credentials, buoyed by Pyongyang’s nuclear test and long- and intermediate-range missile launches. A photo released by North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun, which reported Wednesday that leader Kim Jong-un took a photograph with officials who contributed to the successful test-firing of the Hwaseong-10, or Musudan, missile. YonhapAt the ruling Workers’ Party’s first congress in 36 years, Kim was promoted as the party’s chairman from first secretary. He became the first chairman of the formidable National Defense Commission during the assembly’s 2012 session and also holds the title of supreme commander of the Korean People’s Army. “Marking the fifth year since Kim took power, he could be crowned as the chairman of the Central People’s Committee or to similar posts during the latest assembly, after changing the party’s top position as its chairman at the congress,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute.“This is to absolutize his authority to the levels of his late grandfather and father, Kim Il-sung and Jong-il, and lay the institutional foundation for the concentration of power surrounding him.” The assembly is the communist state’s top-governing body under its constitution. It usually meets once or twice a year to review and endorse budgets, personnel shake-ups and other political, economic and administrative decisions. Last amended in 1972, the constitution paved the way for the creation of the CPC, the highest organ overseeing the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Kim Il-sung served as the CPC chief. But the panel was abolished in 1998 as Kim Jong-il sought to shore up the defense commission under his “songun ” policy.The body was also expected to approve details on the five-year economic plan Kim introduced at the congress. Early this month, Pyongyang launched what it called a “200-day battle,” a mass mobilization campaign intended to boost productivity and kick-start the new economic plan.By Shin Hyon-hee","parliament on wednesday seeking ,stamp parliament on wednesday ,parliament on wednesday ,last month party congress ,wednesday seeking to consolidate","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un ’s', 'Supreme People ’s Assembly ’s', 'Central']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49768743  0.17905739

Ahn Cheol-soo and Chun Jung-bae, the two cochiefs of the opposition People’s Party, resigned from their posts Wednesday, assuming responsibility over the widening kickback scandal involving key party members.“I resign from  leadership, taking full political responsibility over this case,” said Ahn in an urgent briefing that followed a closed-door Supreme Council meeting.Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo  and Chun Jung-bae  announce their resignations as cochiefs of the People‘s Party on Wednesday. The other cochief Chun echoed Ahn, pledging to dedicate himself to the party and for the change of government next year.The two’s decisions came in response to the ongoing prosecutorial investigation of the allegations that three party officials took illicit funds during the run-up to the April 13 general election.Prosecutors arrested the party’s deputy secretary-general Wang Joo-hyun on Tuesday on charges of taking rebates from public relations firms during election season. Two of the party’s proportional lawmakers, Reps. Kim Su-min and Park Sun-sook, also underwent questioning for their alleged involvement.The growing suspicions that party leadership had been aware of the illicit monetary transactions, as well as criticism of its inadequate crisis management, have been triggering calls for Ahn’s resignation.Adding to the mounting pressure was the symbolic status of Rep. Park, who was not only the party’s secretary-general during the campaign season, but also one of the closest aides to Ahn. Their ties trace back to 2012 when Ahn made his bid in the presidential election as an independent candidate and Park served as chief campaign strategist.“Politics is about taking responsibility, which is why I have always bore my due responsibility ever since I stepped into the political circles,” said Ahn.“ the People’s Party will stick to its original intention and carry on its  path.”Though he elaborated no more on his political plans, it was largely assumed that Ahn would now move his focus from party affairs to the forthcoming 2017 presidential race.Faced by an abrupt leadership vacuum, the party is expected to switch into an emergency committee system and move up the date for electing a new leadership, which was slated for December or later.With the two cochiefs out of the picture, attention was drawn to floor leader and fourth-termer Rep. Park Jie-won. Park joined the People’s Party after defecting from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea in January this year. The defection of Park, a symbolic figure in the progressive Jeolla provinces, was considered to have dealt a significant blow to the Minjoo Party.“Nothing has been decided, as it is the Supreme Council’s decision whether to establish an emergency committee or to elect a representative proxy,” Park told reporters after Ahn and Chun’s resignation announcement.He also added that it was against party policy for the floor leader to take the chairman’s seat, dismissing speculations that he may rise to power.Some suggested the party may choose to extend a hand to an outside figure for dramatic effect. Among potential candidates is Sohn Hak-kyu, former chairman and senior adviser of the Minjoo Party, who has recently hinted at a political comeback.On Tuesday, before deciding to step down, Ahn and the leadership had announced that they would immediately suspend the disputed lawmakers if the prosecution decided to indict them. Pressure has also been building on the two to leave the party on their own.Should the leadership remove them from their books, the two lawmakers would maintain their parliamentary seats as independent members, cutting down the party’s seats from 38 to 36.But if they leave voluntarily, they will lose their proportional representative positions, allowing the party to hand over the two seats to others behind them in line.“I delivered the message  asking that they leave voluntarily,” said floor leader Park in a radio interview Wednesday, shortly before Ahn and Chun’s announcement.By Bae Hyun-jung","resigns amid party scandal ,ahn resigns amid party ,key party members resign ,party members resign ,party members resign from","['Ahn Cheol', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'People ’s Party', 'Ahn', 'Supreme Council', 'Ahn Cheol']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69468826  0.18460368

""I would put down the co-chairmanship to take responsibility.""The scandal has dealt a serious blow to the party that has pledged to pursue a ""new type of politics"" and become an alternative to the establishment parties that critics say have been mired in factionalism and partisan politics. It was also a major setback for Ahn, a potential presidential contender.Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo  and Chun Jung-bae, the two co-chairs of the minor opposition People's Party, attend a meeting of senior party officials at the National Assembly on June 29. Following the resignation of the two leaders, the party's current leadership is likely to be replaced by an interim leadership. ""We will determine whether to form an  emergency panel to lead the party or not when we convene our Supreme Council meeting ,"" said floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won.Involved in the scandal are Reps. Park Sun-sook and Kim Su-min, and the party's Vice Secretary-General Wang Ju-hyeon, all of whom have been under investigation over the scandal.On Tuesday the party decided to suspend the membership of the trio should they be indicted in the corruption case.The National Election Commission claims that Kim and the party may have received some 238 million won  in illicit political funds from the local firms. It also alleges that Park, who served as the party's secretary-general in charge of accounting matters during the election campaign, and Wang were implicated in the case.Wang was arrested on Tuesday after being questioned over charges of violating the Political Fund Act. Kim and Park were also grilled by the prosecution over the same charges last week and this week, respectively, but they were not detained.Kim has already claimed that Wang directed her to forge bogus contracts with the two firms to receive the money. Wang and Kim have denied the charges raised.","resign over corruption scandal ,to resign over corruption ,resign on wednesday taking ,resign over corruption ,to resign on wednesday","[""the People 's Party"", 'Ahn Cheol', 'Chun Jung - bae']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25218666 -0.0217404

Senior party, military officials and parliamentary deputies visit the statues of North Korean late founder Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il on June 28, ahead of the meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly. Some analysts said that the communist country is likely to restore the state apparatus named the Central People's Committee and confer the title of the committee's chairman on him, replacing his title of the NDC head.The constitution, which was revised in 1972, created the CPC, the highest organ controlling the executive, legislative and judicial branches. At that time, the NDC served as the subcommittee of the CPC.Kim Il-sung, the country's late founder and the grandfather of the current leader, served as the head of the CPC. The committee was abolished in 1998 under the Kim Jong-il regime, which strengthened the NDC's role and advocated a military first, or ""songun,"" policy.""With a new state title, the North's current leader will likely cement one-man rule at a similar level to the absolute power enjoyed by his late father and grandfather,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.Seoul's unification ministry said that the North is likely to conduct an overhaul of Cabinet organs and reshuffle government officials in a bid to back the main decisions made at the WPK's congress.Experts also said that at the SPA meeting, Pyongyang may announce details to flesh out the five-year strategy to boost the economy, which the North's leader unveiled at the party congress.The assembly usually convenes in April, attended by hundreds of deputies, to finalize the country's budget spending and overhaul Cabinet organs. But the North held a smaller meeting in late March ahead of the party congress.The parliamentary meeting comes as the U.N. Security Council slapped tougher sanctions on North Korea in March for its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in the following month.The North's leader has made it clear that he will ""permanently"" defend his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy. Seoul and Washington have warned that the dual-track policy is a dead end.","key parliamentary meeting wednesday ,parliamentary meeting wednesday where ,parliamentary meeting wednesday ,congress held in may ,meeting after key party","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'SPA']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.94976991  0.23113358

Park Sun-sook and Kim Su-min, have been questioned over the past several days by the prosecution upon the report by the National Election Commission on June 8. Kim is a first-termer elected as proportional representative, while Park is a politician-by-profession who had played major roles in the camp for former President Kim Dae-jung.  People’s Party co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo attends a party meeting on Tuesday. Park has also been a key associate of the party’s co-chief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo since his presidential campaign in 2012. Park’s implication and the party’s first-ever corruption allegation dampened the momentum of the party that has become a powerful third force with 38 seats in the National Assembly where the ruling Saenuri Party holds 129 seats and the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea holds 123 seats. It further hurt the image of Ahn, who has been building his political career on the philosophy of clean and new politics.Kim has reportedly testified that she was acting on orders from the party’s Deputy Secretary-General Wang Joo-hyun. The prosecution arrested Wang on Monday on charges of violating the election law.The election watchdog claimed the money was handed over in the form of rebates out of the 3.2 billion won the party paid to the firms by having them pay back some of the money to another advertisement agency named Brand Hotel, which Kim had once headed, under false subcontracts.“I apologize for the case that has become  social controversy and even led to the arrest of a major party official, thereby causing concern among the people. I share the painful responsibility as the person of responsibility and representative of the party,” Ahn said during a press briefing.“I once again pledge that the party will be acting without an ounce of tolerance or hesitation to deal firmly and sternly with regard to the case based on the outcome of the judicial decision.”","party vows to suspend ,party leadership on tuesday ,upon indictment after weeks ,vows to suspend scandal ,party will immediately suspend",['the People ’s Party ’s'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70445728  0.16406684

Seo ,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea’s interim chief Kim Chong-in at the party’s Supreme Council meeting, vowing “due measures based on internal audit results.”The main opposition chief was referring to the party’s second-termer who recently came under fire for having hired her daughter as a paid intern in 2014 and her elder brother as accounting manager at her sponsor association. Pressed by public criticism, she explained the recruitment had been legitimate, not based on family ties.People’s Party’s Secretary-General Rep. Park Sun-sook appears for questioning at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday. “In reaction to social polarization and youth unemployment, the public sentiment has increasingly grown sensitive over inequality agendas,” Kim said, calling for more drastic, preemptive efforts to root out ethical issues within the camp.Earlier on Sunday, the party’s internal audit team separately announced it would launch a comprehensive inspection on Rep. Seo’s alleged influence in hiring family members.Depending on the audit result, the disputed lawmaker may face sanctions ranging from a simple warning to criminal charges. The latter may also lead to the deprivation of her elected representative seat, should the top court hand down a fine of 1 million won  or more.Behind the party’s firm stance is the rising suspicion that the party’s leadership had, in fact, been aware of Rep. Seo’s hiring irregularities before the candidate nominations for the April 13 general election, but overlooked them for political gain. Facing a similar situation is the runner-up opposition People’s Party, in which a proportional representative is facing an ongoing prosecutorial probe over corruption allegations stretching to key members of the leadership.“I pledge to take stern measures according to  investigation,” said the party’s cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in the Supreme Council meeting, offering an apology for the controversies. As part of the inquiry into Rep. Kim Su-min’s bribery allegations, the party’s secretary-general, Rep. Park Sun-sook, showed up at the Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday to be questioned for allegedly giving direction to then-proportional candidate and political novice Kim.Meanwhile, the ruling conservative Saenuri Party welcomed the opposition circles’ move to curb the irregularity scandals, but also called for integrity.“Should a similar dispute have taken place in another political party, the Minjoo Party would have asked for utmost measures, including the resignation of the disputed lawmaker,” said spokesperson Rep. Min Kyung-wook.“A stern and suitable measure is absolutely crucial, not only to prevent public distrust in the party, but also to protect the reputation of the legislature in general.”By Bae Hyun-jung","parties on monday apologized ,opposition parties on monday ,monday apologized and vowed ,hit by sleaze accusations ,two leading opposition parties","['Seo', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Chong - in']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.7403152   0.51292682

They had all protested their drop from nomination.The decision, reached through a vote by the party’s emergency committee acting as the interim leadership, had renewed the party’s festering factional competition as some of the pro-Park members protested.The party, however, was widely expected sooner or later to bring back the defectors, who won in their constituencies as independents, as it suffered a defeat to the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea with 122 seats to its 123 seats.The returned lawmakers are to keep each of their positions in the standing parliamentary committees as they were assigned as independents.","300 member assembly rep ,defectors return to party ,the party on wednesday ,party on wednesday raising ,remaining saenuri defectors return","['Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly to 129.The party', 'Assembly', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Joo Ho - young', 'Lee Chul - gyu', 'Daegu']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50557369  0.20682287

In a meeting with high-profile officials from the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Ministry of Employment and Labor, the Saenuri lawmakers belonging to a special in-house committee on employment recommended that the government increase the amount of extra budget to help create jobs and boost corporate restructuring. Rep. Choo Kyung-ho attends a meeting with the government at the National Assembly on Tuesday. “With even the central bank employing aggressive monetary policy to address the faltering economy and worsening unemployment, it is time to take more proactive fiscal policy,” said Rep. Choo Kyung-ho, the chairman of the special committee. The first-term lawmaker had served as a vice finance minister. The Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate to a historic low of 1.25 percent on June 9. The government officials did not respond to the request immediately, but reportedly said that they would consider the suggestion. Choo said that the government officials saw the need to allocate the budget and have begun analyzing the economic impact of the proposal. Regarding the size of the budget, which is expected to be from 10 trillion won  to 15 trillion won, Choo said that those who attended the meeting did not discuss specific numbers.

Kim Chong-in said that his party will seek to revise the Commercial Act in order to prevent large businesses from abusing their power and engaging in unfair business practices. “The job of a legislative body is to keep the activities of big corporations in check, not to represent their interests,” said Kim in his first parliamentary speech as party leader. “If the Assembly protects their interests, there is no future for South Korea.” The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Rep. Kim Chong-in delivers his speech at the National Assembly on Tuesday. The former economics professor is known as the architect of the economic democracy clause of Korea’s constitution, which obligates the state to maintain balanced economic growth and to prevent the abuse of economic power.During the speech, The Minjoo Party leader suggested that the nation needs to change the current single-term, five-year presidential system, echoing others on the need to revise the Constitution that was last amended in 1987. Kim urged the lawmakers to establish an independent committee to discuss the revision. Though the main parties agree on the need for an amendment, they differ on what new government structure the country should adopt. “The current president-centric Constitution has incurred many conflicts and divisions, and brought us political confusion,” Kim said. “From the aspect of economic policies, the current single-term presidency is not conducive to setting up long-term economic policies,” he said. Political parties differed over whether to accept Kim’s proposal to build such an organization. The ruling Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said that the parties need to discuss before implementing the plan.Rep. Park Jie-won, the floor leader of the third-biggest People’s Party, said that he agreed with the Minjoo Party leader’s initiative. Its party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo said in an interview that simply changing the terms of the presidency would not address the problem of the current power structure.

Chung Jin-suk in a speech as the parliamentary negotiating unit representative.His speech, “A greater Republic of Korea, built on social compromise,” largely focused on the need to achieve compromise in the labor market so as to reduce widening economic inequality.“So far, the Saenuri Party has focused on enlarging the pie, but the issue of distribution has slipped from its priority list,” the whip said.Saenuri Party whip Rep. Chung Jin-suk delivers a speech in front of National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun on Monday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldPointing out that the top 10 percent account for half of the nation’s total income, the Saenuri lawmaker said growing inequality will harm Korea’s long-term future.“We should raise the alarm on lax family-centered management practices of conglomerates,” he added.He thereby quoted the example of the feud-ridden Lotte Group, which is embroiled in a power struggle among founder Shin Kyuk-ho and his two sons Shin Dong-joo and Shin Dong-bin.“Capitalism values ownership, but it doesn‘t mean that a  owner is entitled to cast all power to family members at will.”The lawmaker also called for “grand social compromise” in the labor market, referring to the recent death of a 19-year-old maintenance worker at a Seoul subway station.“Should the labor unions in conglomerates and public sectors continue to hold on to their vested rights, youths and irregular workers will continue to suffer,” he said.He thereby called for an in-depth investigation into Seoul Metro, the state-run subway operator in charge of supervising the maintenance company, as well as the financially struggling Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, which is looking to government funds for restructuring.Chung’s reformist remarks came in the wake of the party’s recent leadership feuds between those close to President Park Geun-hye and others calling for more fundamental reform.At the center of the conflict was Rep. Yoo Seung-min, whose return was a matter of dispute between the two in-party groups. The former pro-Park party floor leader, after losing the favor of the Blue House over a disputed parliamentary bill, defected from the party to run in the April 13 general election as an independent candidate.Last week’s decision to reinstate Yoo rekindled the factional divide within the party, with floor leader Chung locking horns with pro-Park interim leader Kim Hee-ok. The two reached a breakthrough over the weekend, after which Kim ended his three-day boycott and resumed party affairs.But despite Rep. Chung’s move to shift the political agenda to labor reforms, the party’s internal strife persisted on Monday as the pro-Park members demanded for the resignation of the party’s Secretary-General Kweon Seong-dong, holding him responsible for the reinstating procedure.By Bae Hyun-jung","monday called for strengthened ,tax evading power succession ,saenuri urges more chaebol ,saenuri party on monday ,conservative party gestured at",['Saenuri Party'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74253124  0.28189719

Ted Poe  last month, passed through the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It calls for putting the North back on the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism, saying the regime ""meets the criteria for designation.""Specifically, the bill requires the president to review about 20 cases involving North Korea, including its 1987 bombing of a South Korean jetliner, and submit a report to Congress on whether they meet the requirements for terror sponsor designation or give a detailed justification as to why the cases do not meet the criteria for such a determination.North Korea was put on the U.S. terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 midair bombing of a Korean Airlines flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the U.S. administration of former President George W. Bush removed Pyongyang from the list in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks.""In 2008, North Korea's designation was rescinded following commitments it made to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. North Korea got its delisting, but kept its nuclear program -- as evidenced by its fourth nuclear test earlier this year,"" said Rep. Ed Royce , chairman of the House committee.""Since 2008, not only has North Korea’s nuclear weapons program advanced, so too has its support for terrorism. The Kim regime has reportedly continued to supply surface-to-air missiles and explosives to Hamas and Hezbollah, shelled South Korean civilians on Yeongpyeong Island, and attempted assassinations of North Korean dissidents living abroad,"" he said.Calls had spiked for putting the North back on the list after Pyongyang was found to be responsible for the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. But the State Department did not do so, saying relisting would only be symbolic without significant practical consequences.The department left off the North from its latest terror sponsor list released earlier this month, saying the regime in Pyongyang ""is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean Airlines flight in 1987.""","house committee on thursday ,thursday passed bill calling ,for relisting north korea ,terror sponsor house committee ,committee on thursday passed","['U.S. House', 'North Korea', 'H.R.5208', 'Ted Poe', 'the House Foreign Affairs Committee', ""the State Department 's""]",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12079182  0.22104593

Joo Ho-young, Lee Chul-gyu and Chang Je-won did not immediately react.With this move, the Saenuri Party has a total of 126 seats, four more than The Minjoo Party of Korea’s 122, making them the No. 1 party in the 300-member National Assembly.The Saenuri Party leadership holds a meeting at the National Assembly on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald“In order to better reflect the people’s decision in the last general election, the Saenuri leadership decided to approve the former members’ return to the party,” said Saenuri Party spokesperson Rep. Ji Sang-wuk. “We hope that the decision will become a starting point to overhaul the party.” Although the independents had consistently publicized their wish to return to the party before and after the election, the party had been split among factions on whether to take them back. The defectors had mostly left the party after having failed to win their party nomination mainly due to factional competition or personal scandals.The contentious issue was settled by a secret vote of the party’s emergency committee. The formal leadership is to be elected this August. Six of 11 committee members approved of the defectors’ return. The fate of the defectors has roiled the ruling party since its crushing election defeat in April.At the center of the debate was Yoo, who left his post after clashing with President Park, who denounced him for “betraying” her. Casting himself as a moderate conservative, the four-term lawmaker vowed to return to the party after being elected as an independent “I am deeply grateful for the party’s decision,” said the four-term lawmaker. “Now that I have returned home, I will do my utmost as a party member to fulfill the people’s call for bringing reform and unity to the party,” he said.

Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald“ should break free from their narrow visions based on power relations and create a constitution that may embrace the social changes during the past 30 years and suggest a direction for the nation’s future,” Chung said.He thereby pledged to “wrap up” the issue within the 20th parliamentary term, which is to end in May 2020.Chung’s resolution fueled the years-long suggestion that the 30-year basic law fails to establish the power division frame required in a modern democratic society.South Korea’s Constitutional Law was last revised in the wake of the June 10 Democratization Uprising to adopt a direct election system and to reinstate the authority of the parliament.Despite what it achieved back then, the basic law has also been blamed for granting excessive power to the president and limiting that of the legislature, thus intensifying the state power imbalance.Chung, whose affiliation to The Minjoo Party of Korea has been temporarily held off due to his position, is not the first parliamentary speaker to address constitutional revision.His conservative predecessors Chung Ui-hwa, Kang Chang-hee and Kim Hyung-o have also raised the issue during their respective terms, but the debate was always overshadowed by other urgent issues such as economic revitalization and elections.Changes, however, have recently been detected, not only in general public sentiment and the liberal opposition circles, but also in parts of the ruling conservative Saenuri camp.A number of influential politicians, including Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil, have been advocating the revision. Rep. Chong Jong-sup, a Saenuri lawmaker elected in Daegu and a former professor of constitutional law at Seoul National University, also urged for a consensus on the issue within this year.Their stance resonated with the recent public sentiment as shown in the public survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on Thursday, in which 69.8 percent of respondents said that they approved of constitutional revision.However, parties still stand at odds over the details of power restructuring.Saenuri members supporting the revision tend to prefer a semi-presidential system, in which the president acts as head of state and a parliament-elected prime minister steers domestic state affairs. The system, which places focus on the diplomatic capacity of the president, is expected to be to the advantage of U.N. Secretary-General and former Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon in making his bid in the 2017 presidential election.The opposition camp, led by the Minjoo Party, is divided between the semi-presidential system and a parliamentary system. The latter empowers the legislature to name a prime minister as chief of the executive branch.Woo Yoon-keun, the incoming parliamentary secretary-general and close aide to Speaker Chung, suggested a referendum during the April by-election next year, asking for the public response on the revision.While the runner-up opposition People’s Party refrained from stating its stance, floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won said that the given debate should no longer be put off, underscoring the need for Cheong Wa Dae to join the fray.“This is now or never to discuss constitutional revision,” Park said Thursday.“President Park Geun-hye should pave the way for the issue.”Cheong Wa Dae, however, continued to express dissent over the change of the state structure.“Our disposition has not changed,” said spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk when answering reporters’ questions on the Blue House’s view on the revision.President Park Geun-hye, in a meeting with local media chiefs in late April, had described constitutional revision as an “economic black hole” that diverts social attention away from urgent economic agendas.By Bae Hyun-jung","thursday while political parties ,constitutional revision talk resurfaces ,thursday while political ,on thursday while political ,the amendment on thursday","['National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62253958  0.32668471

Cory Gardner  introduced a proposal to amend the legislation to include an expression of support for the potential deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea to better defend against North Korean missile threats.But that proposal failed to make it into the bill, the source said.The proposal had said that the short-range, medium-range, and long-range ballistic missile programs of the North represent an imminent and growing threat to South Korea and the U.S. homeland, and that THAAD would effectively complement and significantly strengthen the existing missile defense capabilities of the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula. Following the North's long-range missile test in February, Seoul and Washington launched official talks about placing a THAAD battery in the South to bolster defense against missile threats from the communist nation.Sources have said that the THAAD talks have moved forward to a point where the two sides are now looking into candidate sites for deployment, including not only existing U.S. military bases, but also mountainous areas away from cities.","defense budget bill fails ,tuesday authorizing 602 billion ,vote tuesday authorizing 602 ,senate defense budget bill ,wednesday the senate passed","['Senate', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Senate', 'the National Defense Authorization Act']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32155991  0.37847558

The three mainstream parties’ floor leaders decided to give the speakership to the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. In return, the ruling Saenuri Party would chair the key standing parliamentary committees, including the house steering committee as well as the legislation and judiciary committee. Floor leaders Rep. Chung Jin-suk  of the Saenuri Party, Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party, and Rep. Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea pose before their meeting at the National Assembly on Wednesday. The whips also agreed that the Saenuri Party’s lawmakers would assume the top posts of the committees in strategy and finance; national policy; security and public administration; science, ICT, and future planning; broadcasting and communications; and national defense and intelligence. The Minjoo Party’s lawmakers, on the other hand, would become the chairpersons of committees in foreign affairs and unification; environment and labor; health and welfare; land, infrastructure and transport; agriculture, food, rural affairs, oceans and fisheries; and gender equality and family. The third biggest People’s Party would secure the chief posts of the education, culture, sports and tourism committee and trade, industry and energy Committee. The centrist party would earn the post of vice Assembly speaker alongside the Saenuri Party. The decision came after the Saenuri Party decided to forgo its bid to hold the post of the Assembly’s speaker early Wednesday. The Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said that his party has decided to “yield” on the speaker seat and offer it to the main opposition party. The Saenuri party had previously insisted that it is “customary” for the ruling party to keep the top job in the Assembly.“In order to make a breakthrough in the negotiation to form the Assembly, we decided to yield on the seat for the speaker,” Chung told reporters. “We hope that our decision will get the Assembly up and running and take care of the people’s livelihood,” he said. The Saenuri Party’s turnaround came on the heels of Rep. Suh Chung-won’s last-minute decision to quit the race for the speaker’s seat. The eighth-term lawmaker was viewed as the party’s front-runner for the seat that is usually taken by the most senior lawmaker.In a speech on Wednesday morning, Seo announced that he would leave the contest and urged his party to “give away” the speakership to the opposition party that now holds the largest number of parliamentary seats.

The opposition bloc welcomed the Saenuri’s proposal. “We celebrate the Saenuri Party’s decision to accept the people’s demand, albeit belatedly,” The Minjoo Party of Korea’s spokesperson Lee Jae-jung said in a statement, reiterating their position that the biggest party should claim the top lawmaker’s post. Echoing the announcement, the centrist and third-largest People’s Party went so far as to praise Saenuri lawmaker Suh, calling him a “politician with strong faith in the legislative branch.” The two opposition parties, however, appeared to differ over whether to accept the Saenuri Party’s demand on the chairpersons’ allocation of key parliamentary committees. While they have agreed to maintain the 18 standing committees, they have not agreed on who will head each one. Last month, the three parties’ floor leaders agreed that the Saenuri Party and the Minjoo Party should take the post of chairpersons in eight of the committees each, while the lawmaker from the People’s Party should chair the two other committees.

The Minjoo wants to chair the steering and national policy committees.""I would like to apologize to the people for failing to meet the deadline,"" Rep. Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader of the Saenuri Party said.Chung, however, said that the Minjoo's bid to take the National Assembly speaker seat is a ""grave challenge against the parliamentary system,"" adding that it has no intention of yielding the gavel to the opposition.The floor leader also ruled out speculation that the presidential office is behind Saenuri's stance on the parliamentary formation.The People's Party claimed that the Saenuri and Minjoo should each field candidates, with lawmakers allowed to pick the one they prefer through a vote that would resolve the deadlock. The major opposition said it agrees with the plan. Saenuri, however, is unlikely to accept the compromise because the People's Party will most likely back the Minjoo hopeful in a vote.""There are hurdles in negotiations due to the internal dispute in the ruling camp, and interventions by the presidential office,"" Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the Minjoo Party, claimed.

The Saenuri Party counters that the ruling party should hold the position.  The debate is likely to delay the lawmakers’ efforts to wrap up assigning key parliamentary positions before their self-imposed deadline. The Saenuri Party, the Minjoo Party and the third-biggest People’s Party agreed to elect the speaker by June 7 and select the chiefs of the parliamentary committees by June 9.The National Assembly Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldThe Saenuri Party claimed it was “customary” for the ruling party to take the speaker seat, shifting from its earlier stance of giving up the post to the main opposition party in return for other high-profile chairpersons’ seats in standing committees.“Except for one instance, ruling parties have keep the post throughout history. Opposition parties are trying to break established practice,” said Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. He also referred to the 13th Assembly elected in 1988. The then-ruling Democratic Justice Party had lost its majority, but its lawmakers served as speaker throughout the four-year term. The only exception was in the 16th Assembly that began in 2000. The Saenuri whip said that that the exception was an “isolated case” because the then-opposition party had exercised an “overwhelming majority.” The election had given then-opposition Grand National Party, a precursor to the Saenuri Party, 133 seats against 115 of the then-ruling New Millennium Democratic Party, itself a precursor to the Minjoo Party.But the two opposition parties blamed the Saenuri Party for changing its position, threatening to put the decision to a vote in a scheduled plenary session on June 7 unless the ruling party gives in. The two main opposition parties -- the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party -- have a combined majority of 160 seats. The Saenuri Party holds 122 seats.“The Saenuri Party has suddenly changed its positon and put negotiations in a deadlock,” said the Minjoo Party floor leader Rep. Park Kwang-on. “If they refuse to budge, we have no choice but to let the lawmakers themselves decide in a plenary session,” he said. Parties elect the speaker through a floor vote, but they usually reach a compromise through negotiation before the voting.

Yoo Seung-min on Tuesday urged political groups to embrace the idea of a “republic state,” a move seen to emphasize his centrist agenda amid speculation over whether he would return to the conservative Saenuri Party.The four-term lawmaker and former whip defected from the ruling party in April after clashing with President Park Geun-hye and her factional Saenuri members. After winning the general election as an independent, Yoo asked to return to the party, but the request has been denied. In a lecture for students of Sungkyunkwan University, the former economics professor said that building a true sense of the ”republic state“ is the key to address worsening economic and social disparity in South Korea.The session was the first public event attended by Yoo since the election, raising hubbub that he may be stepping up his political game backed by steady popularity. “We need political forces that can realize the value of the republic state,” said Yoo. “Whether it would be conservatives or liberals, the value of  republic is the crucial theme for our times,” he said. The remarks were in line with the centrist lawmaker’s political stance, as he casts himself as a moderate conservative, often echoing the liberal party’s agenda such as state-led welfare policy.Yoo had first underlined “republic state” during his farewell speech as a floor leader. Noting that the idea was enshrined in the South Korea’s Constitution declaring South Korea as a “democratic republic,” Yoo said he wanted to protect the value throughout his tenure.Yoo urged the conservatives to transform themselves into a moderate group that can address social injustice. “About 30 percent of Koreans regard themselves as conservatives. If they can change, Korea will change,” he said. Following the meeting, the 58-year-old politician reiterated his pledge to return to the Saenuri Party, denying speculation that he would join other centrist political groups such as the one led by former National Speaker Chung Ui-hwa. Chung had met with Yoo in a closed door meeting two weeks ago before the speaker ended his term, fueling speculation that the two centralists would create a new political group ahead of the presidential election scheduled to take place in Dec. 2017. One of the former speaker’s top aide Park Hyung-joon, the former secretary-general of the National Assembly, said in an interview that Yoo could “play a big role” in the nation’s politics and urged him to join the move.By Yeo Jun-suk","tuesday urged political groups ,after clashing with president ,on tuesday urged political ,tuesday urged political ,ruling party in april","['Yoo Seung - min', 'Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48158309  0.21854721

122,122,122,Minister appeals for labor bills,"With the launch of the 20th National Assembly on Monday, the labor minister has renewed calls for the swift passage of bills to boost the sluggish economy and create jobs.

The ruling Saenuri Party was set to resubmit four labor market reform bills aimed to improve labor conditions and provide more flexibility to the market. The bills failed to pass the 19th National Assembly amid objection from labor unions and the opposition bloc.Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon underscored the need for labor market reforms at a press briefing held in the afternoon, calling the structural market revamp an “unavoidable and historic task” for the next generation to survive. “The package of the labor market reform bills urgently need to be passed to provide job opportunities for the young and elderly,” Lee said. “The bills are also to expand unemployment benefits to help the jobless who lost their employment due to restructuring get a job again.”Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon speaks during a press conference on Monday. The proposed bills stipulate an improvement in benefits for the unemployed, reduction of working hours and expansion of sectors in which employers can hire temporary workers. It left out a contentious bill to extend the hiring of irregular workers, mindful of the fierce resistance from the nation’s labor unions. The prospects for the passage of the reform bills, however, remain bleak, as the ruling Saenuri Party lost its majority in the National Assembly and opposition parties pledged to block the “unilateral” reform drive. The opposition bloc and the nation’s trade unions have relentlessly resisted the bills that will expand sectors in which irregular workers can be dispatched through subcontractors. While the government views it as paving the way for companies to create new jobs, labor unions see it as undermining job security and giving leeway for employers to hire nonregular workers. The labor minister pointed to the nation’s chronic market duality, citing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s recent report on the Korean economy. The OECD said that low mobility from nonregular to regular jobs and wage gaps between small and large-sized enterprises are major challenges facing the nation’s economy. “The widening disparity, which stems from seniority-based wage system and market uncertainties, leads companies to rely more on hiring irregular workers,” the minister said. “If the wage gap between regular and nonregular workers increases, it will erode our growth potential.” According to government data, there were 6.27 million workers with irregular status last year, accounting for 32.5 percent of the entire labor force in the country. Regular workers at small and medium-sized companies earned 49.7 percent of regular workers’ average income in 2015, while irregular workers only took home 35 percent. Citing the election schedule to select the 20th National Assembly as a reason behind the failure to pass the “urgent” bills, the minister vowed to have sufficient dialogue on the efficacy of the labor market reforms with the public and lawmakers.

The reinforced quorum was set to deter the majority party from abusing its power and to allow the smaller parties to voice out dissent without using violence. The revision was hailed by all rivaling parties at the time.But the clause has been criticized, mainly by the majority-holding ruling Saenuri Party, as paralyzing the legislative functions of the 19th National Assembly.The Saenuri, in an attempt to pass several pending bills, called for a lowered quorum and an expanded speaker discretion to table a bill on his own authority, without bipartisan consent. In January 2015, 19 Saenuri members filed the petition, claiming that the disputed clause goes against the Constitution and the democratic rule of majority.The Minjoo Party of Korea, struggling to block the ruling camp’s push, denounced the revision move as undemocratic and self-contradictory, pointing out that the revised bill had been spearheaded by President Park Geun-hye herself back in 2012.But following the result of the April 13 general election, the Saenuri has been observed to be less enthusiastic on lowering the legislation-deterring quorum. Having moved down to the second-largest party, the Saenuri now finds a need to deter the opposition camp from abusing its newly-gained majority.“We respect the judgment of the court,” said the Saenuri’s floor spokesperson Min Kyung-wook.“But the forthcoming 20th National Assembly will have to make further efforts to solve the self-contradictory factors of the current parliamentary advancement act.“The Minjoo Party, along with the runner-up opposition People’s Party, welcomed the court’s judgment.“The parliamentary advancement act aims at creating a political environment based on compromise and agreement,” the Minjoo said through a statement.“We take today’s court ruling as recognizing such legislative purposes.”By Bae Hyun-jung","thursday dismissed petition filed ,on thursday dismissed petition ,thursday dismissed petition ,court on thursday dismissed ,incoming parliament to revise",['the Constitutional Court'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62511408  0.0429315

The fifth-term lawmaker, whose Saenuri affiliation has been held off during his two-year speaker term, is to step down from his post on Sunday, along with the outgoing 19th National Assembly.“I have been told that some accused the public hearing bill of paralyzing administrative functions, which I hope is not true,” he said, referring to the revision bill of the parliamentary act.The bill, motioned and put to floor vote by Chung himself, permits parliamentary committees to call for public hearings on key agendas. The current law limits such cases to issues related to law revisions or state audits.The Blue House and the Saenuri Party, however, have argued that the eased regulations will lead to excessively frequent hearings and thus impede administration.The speaker then announced his much-speculated plan to create a new centrist-conservative political group.“Jointly with those who seek cooperative governance, solidarity and political reforms, I will build a ‘big tent’ to embrace centrist powers and create a new political order,” he said.“The public made it clear in the April 13 general election that they want a fundamental change in politics.”Having locked horns with the presidential office and his home party over several disputed bills, Chung earlier had said that he would not return to the Saenuri Party after his term as speaker ends. It was also through such conflicts that Chung consolidated his public image as a “man of principle” and potential conservative leadership material.His political momentum grew even further after the factionally divided Saenuri Party was defeated in the April election, yielding its parliamentary majority and losing in several symbolic constituencies.The party remains in disarray despite the latest efforts by newly-elected floor leader Chung Jin-suk, who arranged a closed-door meeting with former chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and former Deputy Prime Minister for Economy Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan on Tuesday. Kim is viewed as a flag bearer for the faction disgruntled with the mainstream faction loyal to President Park Geun-hye. Choi is considered a key figure representing the latter.The three reportedly agreed to abandon the party’s “factional politics” and reinforce the authority of a chairperson by reducing the power of the Supreme Council. The purported agreement, however, was met with fierce opposition from the rank-and-file members, who said Kim and Choi did not officially represent their voices.Meanwhile, several incumbent and former Saenuri members, who voted in consent of the hearing bill, indicated they may join Chung’s new political cluster.The list mostly includes those not affiliated with the pro-Park clique, such as former Incheon Mayor Rep. Ahn Sang-soo and former party floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who left the party to run in the parliamentary election.“The  suddenly turned its back on the bill , just because Cheong Wa Dae disapproves of it,” said Rep. Cho Jae-jin.The Saenuri Party has been reluctant to accept some of the controversial defectors, namely Yoo, who has reiterated his wish to return after leaving the party prior to the election over a fallout with the president and a consequential nomination drop.If the non-Park faction joins hands with Chung’s incoming group and it officially becomes a negotiating political party, the conservative camp would halve and the number of parliamentary parties would increase from the current four to five.By Bae Hyun-jung","speaker backs hearing bill ,outgoing national assembly speaker ,veteran lawmaker also pledged ,new centrist political group ,wednesday reiterated his support","['National Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3540847   0.35785499

The current law limits such calls to cases related to law revisions or state audits.The expanded Assembly authority has been pushed by the opposition camp which, as a result of the April 13 general election, has come to account for a parliamentary majority in the incoming term.The bill was handed over to the presidential office on Monday for final approval, a process during which the president may wield the constitutional right of veto. The Blue House, citing excessive rights of the legislature, tossed it to the Ministry of Government Legislation for legitimacy review.Meanwhile, Saenuri lawmaker Rep. Kim Jin-tae, member of the parliamentary legislation and judiciary committee, claimed that the veto is not even necessary as the bill, if it does not get presidential endorsement, is to be automatically discarded.“A bill, even one approved by the Assembly, is automatically thrown away if it fails to be proclaimed within the given parliamentary term,” Kim told reporters in a text message sent out Tuesday.The current 19th National Assembly is to end on May 29, making way for the new 20th term, which is to kick off on the following day.President Park Geun-hye is set to depart Wednesday for a 12-day state visit to three African states and France, adding weight to Kim’s assertion.But the opposition pointed out that if the Saenuri lawmaker’s claim turns out to be true, it would mean all of the other bills passed last Thursday are bound to be discarded as well.The scenario further lost momentum as the Ministry of Government Legislation referred to the case of former President Lee Myung-bak who had endorsed several bills after the termination of a parliamentary term. In 2012, as the 19th National Assembly kicked off, Lee promulgated 28 bills earlier approved by the previous parliament, ministry data showed.The opposition camp, as well as parliamentary Speaker Chung Ui-hwa who put the bill to floor vote, expressed regret over the president’s dissent to the hearing bill.“It is pitiful that Cheong Wa Dae should be considering a veto on a  bill,” Chung told reporters Tuesday.The speaker, whose Saenuri affiliation is held off due to his position, earlier announced that he would not return to the party after his term ends.By Bae Hyun-jung","presidential veto the ruling ,blue house considers veto ,exercise the presidential veto ,house considers veto ,the presidential veto",['Saenuri Party'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52974445  0.04145803

Park is expected to determine whether or not to endorse the bill after she returns home from her overseas trip.The revision to the National Assembly Act, which was passed last week, was handed over to the government for final review and presidential endorsement.Earlier this week, Lee Suk-joon, the top official in charge of government policy coordination at the Prime Minister's Office, called the bill ""very worrisome,"" stressing that the revision would restrict state affairs ""very much.""""If  rejects the bill, parliament will stage a veto against the administration,"" said Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. ""The bill is not an issue that can be refused by Cheong Wa Dae.""Park Jie-won, floor leader of the minor opposition People's Party, echoed the view, adding that the implementation of the bill is an opportunity to bring orders to civil servants.""If the ruling Saenuri proposes a veto to the president on the law that comes out of agreement, the move will distort the parliamentary process,"" he added.The latest tension surrounding the bill came under the spotlight as the government has been struggling to reach a broad understanding with the opposition parties in the past several weeks.Earlier this month, the president had vowed to hold regular talks with local party leaders in a symbolic gesture to expand communications with opposition parties following the ruling party's defeat in the April 13 polls.Sources said the ruling Saenuri Party has started a study to find constitutional flaws in the latest bill.The opposition parties, meanwhile, joined forces in protesting against the government's move to promote what it calls a performance-based payment system for both public and private companies. The policy, advocated for by the government, aims to boost labor flexibility and create more jobs for youth.Woo said the government's bid to conduct checks on firms adopting the performance-based payment system can be seen as a move to force companies to accept the new policy.The People's Party also claimed that wage-related polices should be decided by workers and companies, and not via a unilateral decision by the government.","opposition parties on tuesday ,tuesday urged the presidential ,veto the controversial bill ,opposition parties urge park ,bill south korea opposition","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69603252  0.28807169

""More time will be needed for reviewing the legislation.""The presidential office said that the bill could paralyze government affairs by allowing parliament to open hearings more frequently after the new National Assembly, controlled by opposition parties, is set to set sail in late May.But opposition parties said they do not intend to excessively hold hearings, saying that the bill is being pushed as part of measures to reform the National Assembly.President Park plans to embark on her trip to three African countries -- Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya -- and France starting Wednesday for 12 days.Experts said that a final decision is likely to be made at the Cabinet meeting slated for June 7 after she returns home.The presidential office has shown a cautious stance about whether or not Park will veto the bill, saying that its position is to call for a revision of the legislation.","week cabinet meeting controversial ,cabinet meeting controversial bill ,presidential office on friday ,cabinet meeting controversial ,week cabinet meeting due","['Cabinet', 'Park Geun', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37163693  0.26211387

YonhapOn Thursday, the parliament passed the revision bill of the National Assembly Act, with 117 voting in favor, 79 against and 26 abstaining.The approved bill permits a parliamentary committee to call for a public hearing on the deliberation or investigation of key agenda items. The current law limits such occasions to cases related to law revisions or state audits.The expanded authority of the legislature is to act in favor of the opposition camp which, as result of the April 13 general election, has come to account for a parliamentary majority.The Minjoo Party of Korea and the runner-up opposition People’s Party respectively hold 123 and 38 seats, accounting for 161 out of 300 total seats and outrunning by far the ruling conservative Saenuri Party with 122 seats.“The Minjoo Party will not abuse its expanded rights ,” said the Minjoo Party’s floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho, dismissing the concerns of the presidential office and ruling party.“Also, the type and range of hearings that individual committees may summon are limited, as complex cases such as the humidifier disinfectant case involves multiple committees and large corruption cases are to be dealt in a separate task force.”The People’s Party whip Rep. Park Jie-won, too, advocated the legitimacy of the revision bill.“It is a core function of the legislature to monitor the government,” Park told reporters.“In fact, the very reason that the  19th National Assembly often came under fire is because it blindly followed Cheong Wa Dae’s instructions.”The Saenuri, reflecting the presidential office‘s disapproval, pointed finger at parliamentary Speaker Chung Ui-hwa who laid the bill to the floor.“Speaker Chung took the bill to vote arbitrarily, discarding the inter-party agreement,” said the party’s vice floor leader Rep. Kim Do-eup on Thursday, shortly after the disputed revision bill was passed by the general meeting.“ should be embarrassed by its own remarks which makes naught of the parliamentary speaker’s authority,” Chung replied through reporters Friday.“A bill, after passing the legislation and judiciary committee, is subject to a full floor vote and it is entirely up to the speaker to schedule the vote.”A number of Saenuri nonmainstream members also gave their consent for the bill, further boosting the recent speculations that Chung and the outsider group may split from the party and form a new political entity.By Bae Hyun-jung","house opposed to parliamentary ,majority demanded the presidential ,friday expressed its disapproval ,opposed to parliamentary public ,demanded the presidential office",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70646089  0.03052817

All of them were bills considered “undisputed,” leaving their successors in the next Assembly with the task of finalizing contentious agendas.The bills dealing with disputed issues, such as labor reform, business deregulation and compensation for victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant and the Sewol tragedy, are expected to be resubmitted and discussed in the next Assembly scheduled to begin on May 30.In a separate meeting on Thursday, the political parties agreed to keep the number of standing parliamentary committees to 18 for the next Assembly. The parties had considered increasing the number of committees by splitting up key committees.The final plenary session marks the end of the 19th Assembly that critics have described as the “least productive.” Out of 17,822 bills proposed over the four-year session, just about 40 percent of them ended up clearing legislature. “I hope the next 20th Assembly will serve in the interest of the people, not the ones with political power,” said the National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa. “Admittedly, we were not competent enough to play the roles that the people have given,” he said. Among the bills that passed the last session is a revision that allows victims of medical malpractice to begin legal processes without the consent of hospitals and doctors. The new law is applied to cases in which the patient either died or was seriously injured. Previously, the victims and family members were hindered from pursuing legal arbitration unless the hospitals and doctors who had treated the patients agreed to the process. The bill was introduced after popular South Korean singer Shin Hae-chul died from medical malpractice. The lawmakers also passed a bill aimed to grant lawmakers more opportunity to have parliamentary hearing. The new legislation allows lawmakers to hold the session whenever necessary, and have an extraordinary session in August and parliamentary committee review session in March and May.Lawmakers attend the last plenary session of the 19th National Assembly on Thursday. Park Hae-mook/The Korea HeraldAnother bill that was endorsed allows children subject to physical and sexual abuse to file a lawsuit against their parents. The previous criminal law had banned the victims from suing their own parents and family members. The lawmakers also passed a bill that requires the government to overhaul and improve safety regulations to prevent accidents caused by lax safety rules such as the Sewol ferry sinking. The tragedy left 304 killed or missing.The outgoing Assembly was marked by repeated legislative deadlock and partisan standoffs. In 2012, the Assembly was deadlocked over the allegation that the nation’s spy agency had interfered with the 2012 presidential election to help then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye win the contest. Near the end of their term, lawmakers were mired in confrontation over the government’s push to introduce controversial counterterrorism bills. The opposition parties launched an unprecedented filibuster that lasted more than nine days. “Throughout the 19th National Assembly, I think I have seen all the politics that I can ever imagine. It’s a bittersweet moment indeed,” said Rep. Moon Jae-in, former leader of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea.

Kim Yong-tae. Rep. Kim Yong-tae “I feel miserable beyond words that we should fail to even hold the meetings due to a lack of quorum,” said the party’s Secretary-General Hong Moon-pyo.Those who did were present at the meetings publicly denounced the pro-Park faction for putting their interests over that of the party.“This is not a party but a group of cliques,” said Rep. Chung Doo-un, a third-termer known to be a reformist, non-Park figure.“This party is defined by its loyalty toward a specific person, not by its policy directions.”Expressing disappointment and frustration over the procedural failure, Rep. Kim Yong-tae announced that he will resign from his job as innovation committee chief.“The Saenuri Party has missed out on its final chance to ask for the people’s forgiveness,” he said in a press conference, apologizing to the people and resigning from his post.Seeking to renew itself amid the results of the April 13 general election, the ruling party has been struggling to elect new leadership that may regain support from the apathetic public. The party secured 122 out of 300 seats in the April race, losing its former parliamentary majority and giving away several of its key constituencies in the metropolitan area.As a restorative measure, newly elected floor leader Chung decided to constitute the incoming interim panel mostly with reformist non-Park members, much to the disapproval of the pro-Park group which formerly held leading power within the party.By Bae Hyun-jung","party on tuesday failed ,boycotted the incoming emergency ,tuesday failed to hold ,on tuesday failed ,innovation committee denouncing its","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47308666 -0.07893075

Chung, who now doubles as chairman of the emergency committee and floor leader, will lead the party through the upcoming National Assembly regular session until a national convention selects new leadership. The party has yet to schedule the convention, but it is widely expected to take place between late July and early August. Saenuri Party’s new interim chief and floor leader Chung Jin-suk attends a party meeting on Wednesday. Ahn Hoon/The Korea Herald“The emergency committee will deal with the day-to-day party internal affairs such as preparing for the upcoming national convention. It is going to replace the role played by the Supreme Committee,” the party’s floor spokesperson Min Kyung-wook told reporters. The Supreme Committee is the party’s highest decision-making body and has been vacant since former chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung and other leaders resigned last month. They stepped down to take responsibility for their party’s heavy defeat in the general election. Separately, the Saenuri Party decided to construct a “reform committee” for the party’s overhaul. The spokesperson said that the committee will be tasked with recommending a new party leader and its nominee for the 2016 presidential election. The committee will operate until the convention and be headed by an outside figure.The decision was widely perceived as a scale-down of the party’s initial resolve to conduct a complete shake-up of the party upon its election defeat. The party had initially moved for the emergency committee chief to oversee the reform as well as party operation with matching authority. The faction close to President Park Geun-hye had reportedly opposed the idea, suggesting a reform committee be set up separately.By Yeo Jun-suk","monday appointed its whip ,until national convention selects ,convention selects new leadership ,party until new leadership ,party on monday appointed","['Saenuri Party', 'Chung Jin - suk', 'Chung', 'National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62234497  0.36912042

Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea paid his first official visit to the People’s Party counterpart Rep. Park Jie-won at 10:30 a.m. for a 10-minute encounter during which both praised each other. The Minjoo Party of Korea’s new floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho  and People’s Party’s counterpart Rep. Park Jie-won after their meeting at the National Assembly on Monday. “Having DJ as a common political teacher, we will be able to cooperate more closely than anybody else,” Woo told Park, referring to the late President Kim Dae-jung for which Park had served as key aide.“Let us find a mutually beneficial way of communication and cooperation so that the people may acknowledge the opposition’s role in politics.”He also acknowledged his party’s defeat in its longtime stronghold Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces, collectively referred to as the Honam region, where it only secured three out of the 28 regional representative seats in the April 13 general election.“ will humbly accept Honam’s public sentiment,” he said, calling the election result the “judgment of the people.”In response to Woo’s olive branch, Park lauded the Minjoo whip as eligible leadership material.“When I was in the same party, I often said that Woo would be the future leader of the party,” said the Minjoo defector and fourth-term lawmaker-elect.“Some media tend to bring him down, citing his involvement in activist groups, but everybody was to some extent an activist back then.”Park also described Woo as “radical, broad-minded and charismatic enough to be the whip of the main opposition party.”Park met his ruling conservative counterpart Chung Jin-suk last week for 30 minutes. During his meeting with his Minjoo counterpart, Park also highlighted the position of the No. 3 party.“Under all circumstances, we will strive to play a leading role in the parliament, not  a tie-breaking third party,” Park said.“It is the main opposition party that should give out more to the minority party.”While the three whips established themselves as their parties’ new political pivot, the top posts continued to remain up in the air. The Saenuri Party is undecided over its emergency chief and the Minjoo has kept Kim Chong-in as interim leader up until the party’s mid-year national convention.“President Park Geun-hye may meet with the floor leaders first, should the Saenuri’s election of its emergency chief be further delayed,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said Monday.The president had pledged, during her meeting with the chief editors of local media late last month, to meet with the leadership of the top three political parties as soon as possible after her state visit to Iran.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition parties met monday ,legislature the newly elected ,upcoming 20th national assembly ,parties met monday hinting ,the newly elected whips","['National Assembly', 'Woo Sang - ho', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Park Jie - win', 'the Minjoo Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.86223686  0.14651196

Woo Sang-ho of The Minjoo Party of Korea and Rep. Park Jie-won of the People’s Party -- vowed to achieve “coordinated governance,” claiming that their professional and personal ties would be of help.From left: The Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk, The Minjoo Party of Korea floor leader Rep. Woo Sang-ho and the People’s Party floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won The outgoing parliament, whose concluding session ends May 29, has often been held back by the unyielding confrontation of chief negotiators of the parties on key agendas. The deadlock frequently got worse due to the intervention of factional bosses and the presidential office. “In the 19th parliament, inter-party deals often turned sour due to the intervention of Cheong Wa Dae,” Woo told Chung at their meeting Thursday. “I hope that Chung, with his experience in the administration, will keep an ideal balance, to which we will respond with rational communication and cooperation.”Chung, who pledged to fix what critics view as a “hierarchical relationship” between the ruling party and President Park Geun-hye, echoed the remark. But he also hinted that there would be no significant change to the current frame.“I believe that the president will not make unreasonable demands or give impractical orders,” the ruling party whip said.Thursday’s event was the first one-on-one meeting between the two rival parties’ whips, while Woo is scheduled to meet with the No. 3 party’s Park on Monday next week.The floor leaders of the three mainstream parties are expected to gather next week after the ruling and main opposition parties elect their vice floor leaders and other senior officials. Since taking office, the floor leaders have reiterated that they would make a “good match” in the upcoming parliament where the whips would face challenges of hammering out complex deals amid a tripartite frame.“I think we can get along with each other pretty well and make the Assembly start its job on a sound note,” said Chung. His counterpart Woo expressed his hope by hailing Chung as “rational politician” who speaks the “same language” as him.  One of the features the three whips share in common is the way they stepped into politics. All three started their political career after being recruited by former President Kim Dae-jung and his political counterpart former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil.Another similarity is their previous role as party spokespersons. Having served eight terms in the post, Woo is still remembered by many as The Minjoo’s spokesman. Chung and Park, too, held the equivalent post in 1992 and 2001, respectively.In this three-party structure, it is the runner-up opposition party’s Park who is likely to play a tie-breaking role, balancing himself between the two leading parties. The 73-year-old senior politician not only has a close personal relationship with both the other whips but is also renowned for his strategic political moves.The Minjoo Party’s defector said that he would “cooperate” in tapping a Saenuri party member as the next parliamentary speaker, a move that would deal a blow to the Minjoo Party’s plan to place one of its own for the post after emerging as the biggest party in the April 13 general elections.

The temporary holiday will follow May 5, Children’s Day.The decision came after a request from the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry that cited it as a way to boost tourism and domestic consumer demand.YonhapThis is the 58th extra holiday designated by the South Korean government. The Cabinet, in a meeting presided by President Park Geun-hye, said all toll fees will be exempted on highways nationwide on May 6. Families who travel with three or more members will get a 20 percent discount on railways, while tickets for Korea Baseball League games will be 50 percent off. Entrance fees for palaces, national museums and parks will also be waivered throughout the extended weekend.Previously, the Park Geun-hye administration had designated a day before the Aug. 15 Liberation Day last year as an extra holiday. The latest decision, however, prompted criticism for being sudden.“I am not happy at all,” said Kim Min-seong, 37, a doctor at a Seoul hospital. “As my hospital does not take temporary holidays off, and the nanny for my two babies will be off, I am at a lost as to what to do,” Kim said.Lee Jong-bin, 45, said he had to scramble to change the date for his move that was originally scheduled for May 6. It involved rescheduling with a bank, a mover and a real estate agency.“It would help more to serve the purpose of propping up domestic demand if the decision is made more in advance,” he said. “Personally, it just shows how inconsistently this country is running.”Another citizen, Yoo Jeong-ho, 27, however, said she welcomed the additional day off. “I don’t care if was made at the last minute. A day off is always welcomed.” She said she plans to make a quick trip to Gangwon Province with her friends.Industry sources said distributors are also scurrying to offer more discounts to boost sales. Hyundai Department Store, for instance, said it will provide various cultural programs at its 15 stores and four outlets, and expand by 30 percent the stock of their discounted items.“It is hoped that you will make this an opportunity to boost the morale of the people and greatly contribute to revitalizing tourism and domestic demand,” Park told her Cabinet members. “I also urge you to take great care in helping to resolve problems that the extra holiday may cause to small and medium-sized businesses and working parents that use childcare centers.”","government on thursday approved ,cabinet approves may holiday ,the 58th extra holiday ,create four day weekend ,on thursday approved may","['the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'south korean', 'Cabinet']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5167582   0.0807206

The decision comes in light of an expanding probe by prosecutors into the manufacturers and distributors of the humidifier sterilizer allegedly responsible for over 200 deaths with its toxic ingredient PHMG.With a boycott against Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products continuing to spread in South Korea, a note is posted at a pharmacy in Seoul recommending customers to purchase similar items made by manufacturers other than Oxy. The ruling Saenuri Party noted that it would consider the proposal. The party’s interim leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul said that, if the opposition bloc refrains from making it a political debate, he was “willing” to embrace the legislative process dealing with peoples’ everyday life. The likelihood of finalizing the legislative process at the 19th Assembly appeared to be low as the current parliamentary session ends on May 31, but lawmakers-elect from the Minjoo Party vowed to continue their efforts in the upcoming Assembly. “I am hoping to play a role in figuring out exactly what went wrong and finding a way to compensate the victims,” Jun Hyeon-hee, who was elected from Gangnam B district, told The Korea Herald. The former dentist was the first lawmaker to raise the health hazard of the sterilizer during the parliamentary hearing in 2011. Meanwhile, prosecutors summoned more Oxy Reckitt Benckiser officials on Wednesday to question whether the company submitted only part of the toxicity report or covered up unfavorable results.Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office questioned Oxy’s current researcher surnamed Cho and a wholesaler surnamed Lee as testifiers to look into the distribution process of the products.It also summoned for the second day Oxy’s senior researcher surnamed Choi who is considered to be a key member of the team developing the product. The prosecution has questioned former Oxy head Shin Hyun-woo, who had led the company when it decided to sell the products in 2001. Shin reportedly denied that the he had known about the toxicity of the humidifier disinfectant. Investigators suspect that Oxy had known about the toxicity but did not conducted a safety test due to sales performance pressure, sources said. The prosecution has reportedly obtained emails that Oxy exchanged with a German chemicals expert in 1996 over the toxicity of a similar ingredient called Preventol R-80. The company had first considered it as the main ingredient for the product. The expert reportedly regularly advised Oxy against using the chemical.Prosecution believes that Oxy did conduct a safety test as the German expert recommended. It, however, allegedly skipped the safety test after it changed the main ingredient to PHMG. The products were on sale from October 2001. Prosecutors are considering slapping Shin with accidental manslaughter charges.By Lee Hyun-jeong      Yeo Jun-suk","opposition party on wednesday ,party on wednesday announced ,strengthen regulation on corporate ,party on wednesday ,regulation on corporate misdeeds","['“the National Assembly', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Kim Chong - in']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59082884  0.10633746

The North has been selecting representatives for the congress since mid-March. In preparation for the event, the North also conducted its “70-day battle” campaign to boost production.The last time the WPK held a congress was in October 1980, when the North’s founder, and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung was still in power. Some 3,000 delegates were selected for the 1980 event.South Korea’s National Intelligence Service chief Lee Byung-ho said during a parliamentary meeting that the congress may last for three to four days, and added that there had been no signs of the North inviting any high-profile guests from outside the country.Late North Korea founder Kim Il-sung  talks with his son and former leader Kim Jong-il during the 6th Workers’ Party of Korea convention held in North Korea in October 1980. He added that preparation for the congress had sparked complaints from North Korean citizens. Radio Free Asia reported last month the Pyongyang government had been pressing its people to put their money in banks to acquire funding for the congress.During the event, Pyongyang is widely expected to announce the direction of the Kim regime along with key policies. Kim is expected to read an evaluation of the central committee’s projects, which is likely to include economic and foreign affairs as well as policies toward South Korea. Kim’s economic reforms in the past have included the “6.28 measures” in 2012, which allowed farmers to keep excess production once they fulfill their quota. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday said the North is expected to carry out a live-fire exercise on a model of Cheong Wa Dae in time for its congress.This satellite image shows what is presumed to be a half-sized model of Cheong Wa Dae at North Korea’s Daewon-ri training near Pyongyang. / Ministry of National DefenseThe South’s satellites have picked up an image of some 30 North Korean artillery gathered at its training facility in Daewon-ri in the outskirts of Pyongyang, along with a half-sized model of the presidential office. “The intent of the exercise seems to be to raise support of its citizens  by spreading hostility toward South Korea, while sparking insecurity in our  society and raising inter-Korea tensions,” a JCS official said. He added that the model was built early this month, after the Kim regime threatened to attack Cheong Wa Dae multiple times.Experts have also predicted Kim will propose their preferred form of unification, as his grandfather did during the 1980 party congress. Pyongyang is currently under powerful economic sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council since last month in reaction to its recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch. Although the North claimed the launch was to put its own satellite into orbit, South Korean military experts said Wednesday it was likely the launch was for their ballistic missile program based on analysis of the rocket showing no signs of devices to protect a satellite.There has been widespread speculation that the North may hold its fifth nuclear test ahead of the congress. The U.S. said Tuesday that if Pyongyang pushes ahead with the tests, it will consider “other options,” without elaborating on what they may be.

An advocate of the idea of economic democratization, sharp-tongued Lee is expected to act as a strategic shield for the ruling party against the opposition camp’s economic policy map.Their likely rival from the People’s Party is expected to be economist-turned-politician Kim Song-sik.Kim Sung-shik of the People‘s PartyThe ruling party is not only determined to safeguard its stronghold national defense and intelligence committees, but is also aspiring for the chairmanship of the legislation and judiciary committee, a post typically allocated to the leading opposition.Holding the final screening authority on submitted bills before they reach the general meeting, the committee is considered a counterbalancing tool against the parliamentary speaker and the ruling party.But having slipped to being the No. 2 party as result of the April 13 general election and having thus lost the parliamentary speaker post to the Minjoo Party, the Saenuri Party now has reason to eye the legislation committee as a strategic alternative.“It would be preferable if we could chair the legislation and judiciary committee for the sake of power balance, but the opposition is unlikely to yield,” said Rep. Won Yoo-chul, floor leader and interim chief of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party on Sunday.Won also staked the party’s claim to the chairmanship of the parliamentary steering committee, while gesturing at conceding the economic and social committees to the opposition bloc.The Minjoo Party generally assents to the idea of taking the economic and social committees, while leaving the national security sector to the ruling party.“The ruling party will not give up  national defense, foreign affairs and unification, in which case we should be given control over the economy and social affairs,” said an official from the party.Its list of aspired sectors includes state affairs, health and welfare and land and transport.The party, however, argued that the legislation committee should be left for the opposition’s share, regardless of the number of parliamentary seats.The best scenario for the Minjoo Party is to chair both the steering and legislation committees -- the former to create synergy with the incoming parliamentary speaker and the latter to prevent the ruling party’s monopoly.“But we need to negotiate further with the People’s Party, so will leave the issue open for the forthcoming floor leadership,” the official said.The No. 3 party has its eye on committees that may appeal to its stronghold Gwangju and Chungcheong provinces, where it won 23 out of 25 regional parliamentary seats.“We hope to win control over the food and trade committees, both crucial in improving the livelihoods in the Honam region,” said the party’s policy chief Rep. Chang Byoung-wan.“The legislation committee is for the opposition so we will negotiate  on detailed allocations.”Amid escalating competition, some claimed the current 18-committee structure should be broken down further in order to optimize issue specialty.“Environment and labor are two disparate sectors, with no mutually beneficial relations,” said Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, Saenuri Party representative for the environment and labor committee.“Environmental issues may form a better balance and synergy when integrated with the land and transportation committee.”Similar suggestions have been made on comprehensive groups such as the education, culture, sports and tourism committee and the future planning, creative science, communications committee.By Bae Hyun-jung","upcoming 20th national assembly ,political parties are scrambling ,heavyweight parliamentary committees due ,parties vie for key ,20th national assembly leading","['National Assembly', 'People ’s Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77568382  0.01874003

Seventeen other seats went to independents and members of another minor party.The main opposition Minjoo Party aims to secure another eight chairmanships, especially of committees related to economics and social issues.""If the ruling party takes the chairmanship for national defense and foreign affairs, we need to have key positions in economic sectors,"" Lee Jong-kul, floor leader of the main opposition party, told Yonhap News Agency.The party also demands the chairmanship for the Legislation and Judiciary Committee as it has always been given to the leading opposition party.In South Korea's unicameral parliament, the judiciary committee is considered to play the role of the Upper House or Senate as it reviews bills before they are sent to the plenary session for approval. The committee can effectively block any bill from reaching the plenary session, where it will be voted on by lawmakers.The splinter People's Party, which rose as a formidable political force to be reckoned with during the latest elections, is focusing on chairing committees on rural affairs, according to its officials.""As many of our lawmakers are based in Honam -- South Korea's southwestern region -- we need committees to deal with regional issues,"" Joo Seung-yong, floor leader of the People's Party, told Yonhap News Agency.The splinter party could also try to take the chairmanship for the judiciary committee if the ruling Saenuri and the main opposition Minjoo Party take the parliamentary speaker position and the chairman position for the Steering Committee of the National Assembly, political watchers said.As the People's Party's cooperation is crucial for the Minjoo Party to become the speaker of parliament, some experts said the minor opposition party holds solid bargaining power for legislation committee chairmanship.","committee chairpersons the ruling ,divided over appointing parliamentary ,to secure eight chairmanships ,parliamentary standing committees month ,appointing parliamentary committee chairpersons","['Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56035882  0.07818402

Won Yoo-chul, floor leader and interim chief, at a party meeting.“ should show that their vows to revitalize the economy, to create jobs and to stabilize livelihoods were indeed sincere.”The tripartite forum is likely to be a six-party talk, involving the leaders and floor leaders of the top three in-house parties. The ruling Saenuri Party‘s floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul  speaks at a party meeting Friday, calling the two opposition parties to a tripartite talk on economic issues. The party’s policy committee chairman Rep. Kim Jung-hoon  and vice floor leader Rep. Cho Won-jin  cochaired the meeting. YonhapThe Saenuri Party official thereby referred to the recent remarks made by Kim Chong-in and Ahn Cheol-soo, respective chiefs of the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party.While Kim said earlier this week that the main opposition party will embrace the government-backed corporate restructuring, Ahn claimed that fundamental structural reforms are necessary in order to create new economic growth momentum.The ruling party welcomed what seemed to be a conservative and economy-driven switch of the opposition camp, but underlined that pending bills should be prioritized.“It is only reasonable that the opposition should cooperate in passing the pending economic bills first, if they are to prove the authenticity of their words,” Won said, mentioning the four labor reform bills and the service industry promotion bill.The corresponding bills failed to pass the floor late last year and earlier this year, due to the opposition‘s claim that they allow easier layoffs and widen inequality.The ruling party’s offer for the interparty talk was taken as a move to retake the upper hand over the opposition camp on the economic agenda.“The government and Saenuri have consistently advocated structural reform, but it was the opposition that held back the related bills,” Won said, urging for the passage of the pending bills within the current parliamentary term, which is to end in late May.By Bae Hyun-jung","at party meeting opposition ,party meeting opposition parties ,debate on economic bills ,party meeting opposition ,to discuss economic bills","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the People ’s Party', 'Saenuri', 'Won Yoo']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29789197 -0.15889381

Won Yoo-chul  and The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in attend a forum in Seoul on Thursday. The main opposition chief’s comment was a follow-up from the previous day, when he pledged to “fully cooperate with corporate restructuring plans,” on condition that the government devises efficient countermeasures to consequent layoffs.“Without fundamental restructuring, our nation’s long-term outlook may not improve,” Kim said during the party’s emergency council meeting Wednesday.The flexible turn toward restructuring, generally considered a policy initiative of the conservative camp, was taken as a sign that the Minjoo Party is set to expanding its leverage into the centrist zone and to reducing its former left-leaning activist tendency.It also came in line with Kim’s slogan of economic democratization, which aims at harmonizing economic growth and democratic distribution.But the corporate-friendly move triggered concerns that it may drive away the labor circles, the longtime stronghold of the opposition party.“We believe ourselves able to establish a social safety net for the layoffs  and also to solve the consequent social strife,” said the party’s floor leader Rep. Lee Jung-kul in a radio interview.The runner-up opposition People’s Party, too, advocated a “corporate structural reform,” but placed more focus on the creation of jobs for youths.“The government has wasted time, shifting the blame onto the parliament, and now has lost the opportunity for fundamental structural reforms,” said Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, coleader and lawmaker-elect of the People’s Party.“None of our pending problems can be solved unless we discard the conglomerate-centered way of thinking from society.”The former information technology guru thus underlined the importance of creating new growth businesses and of connecting them to sustainable jobs for the young generation.The ruling Saenuri Party welcomed the opposition camp’s move, taking it as a momentum for the long-pending economic revitalization and labor reform bills, which had been held back since last year due to resistance by the opposition.“Restructuring is absolutely crucial for our current economic situations,” said the Saenuri’s policy chief Rep. Kim Jung-hoon.“But effective restructuring plans should by all means be accompanied by labor reforms, too.”Kim also added that the opposition’s economic drives may only be a gesture to expand its leverage ahead of the presidential election, slated for December next year.The far-left minority opposition Justice Party, on the other hand, expressed resistance to the top two opposition parties’ stance.“I fear that Kim’s comment may signal the start of unjustified mass layoffs,” said party chief Rep.

The WPK's city and county committees have picked representatives, to be followed by a similar process to choose delegates in provincial areas.The decision in the South Pyongan Province means that other provinces will follow suit, a symbolic move to show strong loyalty to him.Last week, he was selected to represent the Korean People's Army for the party congress.The congress will likely serve as a key event that will reveal the North Korean leader's policy direction in his fifth year in power. Kim inherited power following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011.Seoul's spy agency said the event is likely to be held on May 7 though Pyongyang has yet to publicly announce the date for the event.","upcoming party congress north ,upcoming party congress symbolic ,for upcoming party congress ,province for upcoming party ,province unanimously decided monday","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54107857  0.29551002

Joo Seung-yong of the People’s Party at his office on Monday. “Each party will select a number of bills that it believes must be passed, related to citizens’ lives and revitalizing the economy. The parties’ vice floor leaders will hold working-level negotiations on the matter,” said Rep. Joo Seung-Yong, floor leader of the third-largest People’s Party.The outlook, however, remains bleak for the parties to reach a major breakthrough as the parties remain at odds over the pending bills.At the center of the tug-of-war is the bundle of reform bills pushed by the Saenuri Party to execute the administration’s economic drive, namely in the labor sector to fast-track economic revitalization.The originally five-point labor reform was revised to exclude one on temporary workers after fierce rejection by the opposition and the labor unions, but it remains a hotly disputed plan. The proponents of the bill said that it will help create jobs, but critics argue that it will lead to an increase in temporary and nonregular workers. Rival parties in particular have failed to see eye-to-eye on expanding the sector where nonregular workers will be able to work. Finance Minister and Saenuri lawmaker Yoo Il-ho told reporters that he will try to persuade both lawmakers from all parties to pass the disputed bills before the 20th National Assembly commences in June. He said that maintaining Park’s economic reform drive is critical to maintain the international community’s trust in the Korean economy.But the Minjoo, which will become the majority party in the 20th Assembly with 123 out of 300 parliamentary seats, said that the election results show people’s discontent toward the reforms. “The people’s assessment of the ‘malicious’ labor reform bills is that they will create temporary workers and to allow easy lay-offs,” said the Minjoo floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. “The opposition must step up as the people have already spoken .”Of the 17,757 bills registered at the National Assembly, 10,074 remains pending.The parties also remain at loggerheads over the Basic Act on the Development of the Service Industry, which provides basis for financial support and deregulation in the service sector but also includes medicine and education that have been provided largely at the public level.Another disputed bill is the National Assembly Advancement Act that mandates at least 60 percent of the lawmakers to agree on a contested bill for it to be passed.Assembly Speaker Chung, who presided the meeting, suggested that the lawmakers should discuss the act. In January, he proposed a revised version that requires consent of just half of the lawmakers.By Yoon Min-sik","monthlong parliamentary session will ,thursday to may 20 ,opposition parties on monday ,monthlong parliamentary session ,the monthlong parliamentary session",['Assembly'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75034004  0.44169244

This was the state leader’s first official mention of the election result, which allocated her Saenuri Party 122 seats in total, down from 152 won in the 2012 election and falling far below the parliamentary majority of 150.The Minjoo Party of Korea took the lead in the house with 123 seats, while the new opposition People’s Party claimed 38.Coinciding with the election debacle, the president’s approval ratings tumbled to a record-low.In a public survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on 1,012 respondents during the two days following the April 13 election, Park’s rating stood at 31.5 percent, down 8.1 percentage points from the previous week and the lowest during her three years and two months in office.The Saenuri stood at 27.5 percent in ratings, down 7.3 percentage points, falling behind the Minjoo’s 30.4 percent.“The government will closely cooperate with the incoming National Assembly, hoping to improve the nation’s economy and the people’s livelihoods,” Park said.Through her remarks, the president was seen to offer a reconciliatory gesture to the incoming opposition party-dominated legislature, loosening her previous hardline stance of slamming the Assembly for being negligent and unpatriotic.Up to the day before polling, Park had often pressured the parliament to “prioritize economic revitalization,” effectively holding the opposition liable for the pending economic and labor reform bills.But the president’s unwavering emphasis on economic reforms indicated that there will be little change in the government’s policy frame, despite the decreased political momentum of the ruling party.She also refrained from responding to the growing criticism that Cheong Wa Dae needs a shake-up to start afresh in step with the forthcoming parliament.Her reserved stance triggered an immediate backlash from the two main opposition parties.“The will of the people, reflected in the election result, is asking the government to stop its one-way communication and fundamentally change its policy core,” the Minjoo Party said through a statement.“But President Park, despite the obvious judgment of the people, does not wish to change her thoughts, which is greatly disappointing.”Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, the joint leader of the People’s Party, also urged Park to look back on her administration’s faults and to show responsible actions.“Our party will stand against any move to distort the people’s will as shown in the election,” Ahn said at a party meeting following the president’s comments.By Bae Hyun-jung  (tellme@heraldcorp.com","president accepts saenuri defeat ,last wednesday general election ,wednesday general election ,wednesday general election in ,the ruling conservative party","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",18,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.35332209  0.44067383

The parliamentary badge to be worn by the members of the incoming 20th National Assembly. YonhapThe list included former Incheon Mayor Song Young-gil, Hong Young-pyo and Shin Dong-keun -- all affiliated with The Minjoo Party of Korea and elected in the western metropolitan city of Incheon.It was Song’s local rival Choi Won-sik of the minority opposition People’s Party who brought the charge, citing a breach of the Public Official Election Act.“Song repeatedly called himself the ‘unified opposition candidate’ in his speeches, interviews, posters and brochures, though he had not fully achieved a candidacy unity, which clearly constitutes the announcement and spread of false information,” Choi said. Roh Hoe-chan of the far-left minority Justice Party is also facing similar charges for describing himself as the sole opposition runner in his South Gyeongsang constituency.These opposition figures are among the 98 lawmakers-elect who are currently facing probes over various alleged violation of the election law.The litigation battle between the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party was mostly due to the latter’s backlash against the former’s call for unity.The expression “sole opposition candidate” does not hold effect in the case of partial candidate unification, according to the fledgling party that won the third-largest parliamentary proportion in last week’s race.Such was the court’s ruling on Justice Party candidate Kim Sung-jin who, after forming unity with the Minjoo Party counterpart, referred to himself as the sole opposition runner.“The expression may delude voters that the No. 2 opposition People’s Party also took part in the united candidacy, which was not the case,” the Incheon District Court said earlier.Should the charge be upheld by the top court, the accused lawmakers-elect will face penalties, including possible annulment of their elected position.The Public Official Election Act states that an elected official is to be stripped of his or her position should he or she be given a fine of 1 million won  or more for breach of election law or the political fund law.By Bae Hyun-jung","election lawsuits several lawmakers ,five opposition lawmakers elect ,lawsuits several lawmakers elect ,troubled by election lawsuits ,to five opposition lawmakers",['the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53164035 -0.12430725

Won Yoo-chul vowed to elect a new leadership earlier than scheduled next month to include all voices and factions. Won, who has been the party’s floor leader, took over the seat left by former chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung, who resigned over the election defeat that left the party without majority status.Soon after the leadership’s decision, Rep. Ahn Sang-soo and Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun applied to rejoin the party Friday. They are among the seven defectors who had left in protest to being dropped from the party’s nominations and won in their constituencies as independents.“The whole Saenuri leadership should take responsibility,” Won said in a press conference. “It is not the time to pay blame games with one another. We all should blame ourselves for the defeat. ... In order to reach out to the people, we will invite outside experts to join the emergency leadership,” he said.  The Saenuri Party’s emergency committee chairman Rep. Won Yoo-chul leaves after holding a press conference at the National Assembly on Friday. YonhapBut efforts to overhaul the faltering party already appeared to be facing challenges, as its factions remained split over how to steer the party in the postelection session as well as whether to embrace defectors such as Rep. Yoo Seong-min, whom the party had vowed never to bring back.Though the lawmaker-elect in the party’s stronghold Daegu has reportedly decided to rejoin the party, the interim leader said that it was “inappropriate” to discuss whether to accept Yoo, who had been branded a “betrayer” by President Park Geun-hye for protesting her policy agenda last year. Some dissenting members, however, countered that Yoo, who won with a whopping 75.7 percent of votes, should come back and add more seats to the embattled party. The party, with 122 seats, is one seat short of its counterpart The MInjoo Party of Korea.“ coming back to the party should take place automatically,” said senior Rep. Lee Hye-hoon in a media interview. “It is something that we should not take for granted. Even a single seat is crucial to our party,’ she said. The fourth-term lawmaker added that the faction close to the President Park Geun-hye should be held accountable for the election defeat and that members of the pro-Park faction, such as leader Won, should be denied an opportunity to govern the faltering party. Unlike the three defectors who are eager to come back to the party, the other four independents, including Rep. Joo Ho-young, have yet to publicly announce that they would come back. They reportedly said their decisions would be made after “consulting” with their electorate.Meanwhile, the feud-ridden party also struggled over other legislative agenda items in the upcoming Assembly. One of them was their previous pledge to amend the law that prohibits the majority party from passing a bill without the consent of three-fifths of attending members. Before entering the campaign for the Wednesday elections, the conservative party had touted that it would secure more than 180 seats and push to change the law. Interim leader Yoo vowed to push the agenda despite their election defeat.By Yeo Jun-suk","friday to normalize party ,party after its crushing ,make desperate moves friday ,general elections the emergency ,desperate to salvage party",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85593981 -0.04998434

The seven defectors include former floor leader Yoo Seung-min who scored a landslide victory in Daegu. If they return, the party would recover its status as the largest group in the National Assembly.“I hereby take all responsibility for the election defeat and resign from party chairmanship as of today,” Kim said at the disbanding ceremony of the party’s election strategy team.“The party humbly accepts the people’s strict judgment over our infighting and division,” he added.Saenuri Party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung leaves the National Assembly building after announcing his resignation on Thursday. The general election opened a three-party political framework by downsizing the ruling party and expanding two opposition parties in the parliament.The Saenuri was not only booted from majority status but also tumbled down to second-rank party, giving way to The Minjoo Party of Korea.The 20th parliamentary race ended with the Minjoo Party taking 123 seats, followed by the Saenuri with 122, the People’s Party’s with 38, and the Justice Party with six, in addition to 11 independents.By constituencies, the Minjoo party acquired 110 out of 253 seats nationwide, followed by the Saenuri with 105 and the new opposition People’s Party with 25. The far-left minority Justice Party claimed two.The Minjoo Party of Korea chief Kim Chong-in speaks at a press conference at the National Assembly on Thursday. The opposition camp claimed a parliamentary majority for the first time in 16 years, posing tricky challenges to the Park Geun-hye administration and the ruling party in the remaining 22 months until the next presidential election.Kim, who scored an easy victory in his Busan constituency, was seen to lose ground in the party and his potential presidential bid, following the election debacle.Supreme Council member Kim Tae-ho also announced his resignation and he is expected to be followed by his colleagues, many of whom have lost in their current constituencies against opposition rivals.Another Supreme Council member Rep. Suh Chung-won, a close confidante to President Park, won his eighth term and became the top senior in the upcoming parliament. He did not show up at the party meeting.The party immediately summoned a top officials’ meeting in the afternoon to discuss the establishment of an emergency committee to take over the missing leadership. The interim leadership will face multiple whammies, including an extensive reshuffle, power struggles and blame games among factions.Cheong Wa Dae, having failed to create political synergy through Saenuri’s victory, is highly likely to carry out a large-scale reshuffle of its own so as to gain momentum during the last two years of the current Park Geun-hye administration.“We hope that the 20th National Assembly will care about people’s livelihood and work for the sake of the people,” said presidential spokesperson Jeong Yeon-guk, without commenting further on the election resultsThe main opposition party may seem to be better off but is now officially challenged by the third-largest People’s Party, which took away most of their longtime stronghold in the Gwangju-Jeolla area.Minjoo’s chief Kim Chong-in celebrated the party’s achievement, even paying tribute to former chief Moon Jae-in for rallying supporters in the metropolitan region.It was in the Seoul-Gyeonggi belt, which comprises almost half of the nation’s constituencies and the largest number of swing voters, that the opposition swept a majority, even in districts considered to be unwavering strongholds of the conservative.“The greatest significance of this election is the breakdown of the Saenuri’s parliamentary majority,” Kim said in a press conference Thursday.“The people have made their stern judgment on the economic errors of the Park Geun-hye government and of the ruling party.”But he did acknowledge the party’s obvious defeat in the Gwangju-Jeolla area, called the Honam region.“It would be shameless of us to ask for support after disappointing ,” Kim said.“We fully embrace Honam’s public sentiment which scolded us for our faults.”The rising star People’s Party, meanwhile, rejoiced in their newfound status as the third-largest parliamentary bloc with strong casting vote power.People’s Party cochairman Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  talks with lawmaker-elect Kim Sung-sik while entering the party’s office in Seoul on Thursday. Despite the skepticism that had prevailed over its identity, the party managed to secure 38 seats, over the 20-seat minimum required to constitute a parliamentary bargaining body and even exceeding its hopeful target of 35.Having successfully come between the two leading parties, neither of which grasps a decision-making majority, the People’s Party will hold the tie-breaking vote in the upcoming legislature.Key decisions including the passage of pending economic and labor reform bills as well as the selection of the next Assembly speaker through votes will also depend on the decision of the No. 3 party.The challenge for this novice party, however, is its relatively weak positioning in terms of policies.Despite its slogan to act conservatively on national security issues and progressively on economic issues, the party has so far failed to mark its presence, other than in its regional Honam identity.Observers, nevertheless, point out that it is this dovish centrist stance that attracted a large number of undecided voters who shunned the increasing bipolarization between the leading parties.By Bae Hyun-jung","resigned en masse thursday ,election rout the leaders ,reeling from election rout ,party reeling from election ,party resigned en masse","['Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun', 'party', 'Kim Moo - sing']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68246692  0.37357837

""Please help us so that we can support the Park Geun-hye government focusing on its state affairs until the end of its term.""Rep. Kim Tae-ho, a leading member of the party's decision-making Supreme Council, and the party's secretary-general Rep. Hwang Jin-ha also offered to bow out, presaging a dismantlement of the current party leadership. With the core members of the Saenuri leadership resigning, the party is expected to be led by an interim emergency panel until its leadership convention, which observers say could be held as early as June.In the parliamentary elections, the ruling party bagged just 122 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, failing to maintain its legislative majority. Independent Rep. Ahn Sang-soo applied to rejoin the Saenuri Party, which would bring the total number of its lawmakers to 123 in the new Assembly to be launched on May 30.The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea clinched 123 seats while the minority opposition People's Party won 38 seats, emerging as a new political force to be reckoned with.","presidential election will resign ,defeat in wednesday elections ,down over election debacle ,election will resign ,crushing defeat in wednesday","['Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung', 'National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67008817  0.1360428

The three-party system will be the first in 20 years.The result, in particular, gave a landmark victory for the fledgling People’s Party co-led by Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo by sweeping good portion of support from the main opposition’s traditional stronghold in Gwangju and Jeolla provinces.  People`s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo celebrates his party`s strong performance in the general elction at the party`s headquarter in Seoul on Wednesday. The People’s Party is expected to hold a casting vote in the incoming Assembly as the main parties struggle to regroup after seeing lackluster results. Without a majority party, fierce politicking is also anticipated among the parties to realign their factions and rejoin forces with party defectors who have won on different party tickets or as independents.The Minjoo Party of Korea, which narrowly managed to block the Saenuri from maintaining majority, is also expected to quicken their calls on the People’s Party to merge. “It seems to me that the voters casted referendum not just on the Saenuri Party but also toward the President Park Geun-hye,” said Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “How the People’s Party would position itself would be crucial to the upcoming political landscape,” Lee said. “ sets a stage for the People’s Party to create a storm on the political landscape. But they would end up being sandwiched between the two bigger parties unless they become a political party based on national support.”Should the opposition parties see eye-to-eye, the opposition-controlled National Assembly would grant the liberal parties power to block the Saenuri Party and President Park from pushing controversial agendas that aim to overhaul the labor market and relax regulation on the service industry. The conservative party has been seeking to amend relevant laws that prevent the economic and labor bills from passing the Assembly. The National Assembly law stipulates that pending bills cannot be put to a vote in the plenary session without the approval of three-fifths of the attending lawmakers.

YonhapThe Saenuri Party won 122 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, trailing the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, which won 123, according to the National Election Commission.  The People's Party gained 38 seats.The exit polls conducted by the nation’s three broadcasters, KBS, MBC and SBS, predicted that the ruling party could win 118-147 seats, while The Minjoo Party is likely to claim 97-128 seats. The fledgling People’s Party was said to secure 31-43 seats in total.All three polls showed the ruling camp to have fallen under the 150-seat mark needed for a majority, and way below the ambitious 180-seat line needed to pass bills without opposition consent.“The Saenuri Party will respect the people’s choice,” said the party’s election team spokesperson Ahn Hyung-hwan in response to exit pollsThe nation’s total voter turnout stood at 58 percent, up from the 54.2 percent of the 2012 election.The National Election Commission attributed this higher-than-expected turnout to the two-day early voting system that took place last week, allowing voters to cast their ballot in advance. The turnout for early voting was 12.2 percent.The ruling party mostly managed to safeguard its key strategic constituencies in Busan and the Gyeongsang provinces, but it was in Seoul and the surrounding area that it gave way to its Minjoo Party rivals.The main opposition party scored a majority in the Seoul-Gyeonggi area, which comprises almost half of the nation’s constituencies as well as the largest number of swing voters. The Minjoo Party of Korea's Kim Boo-kyum  cheers with his supporters upon exit poll results that showed him holding a lead against rivals in his constituency at the conservative stronghold in Daegu on Wednesday. YonhapOne of the most symbolic battles was the hard-won victory of the Minjoo Party candidate Kim Boo-kyum over former Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Moon-soo in the unwavering conservative stronghold of Daegu. The opposition Kim beat the conservative Kim 62 percent to 38 percent in exit polls. This is the first time for an opposition candidate to win in the constituency in 31 years.Another remarkable achievement was that of former party chief and incumbent lawmaker Rep. Chung Sye-kyun, who led former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon 51 percent to 42.4 percent in KBS exit polls.Oh, with his mayoral career and steady lead in preliminary public polls, was considered a conservative blue chip in the 2017 presidential race, but his plan is now likely to falter.The main opposition party, however, recorded an unprecedented defeat in its longtime support base Gwangju, as well as in most parts of the southwestern Jeolla provinces.The “Honam” region heavily leaned to the fledgling minority People’s Party, which had embraced a large number of the Minjoo Party defectors currently representing their constituency there.One standout winner in the region was Saenuri Party candidate Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who reaped another victory in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province.As for the People’s Party, it celebrated its anticipated victory in Honam, as well as that of its cochief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in his Nowon-C constituency in northeastern Seoul. The party’s Supreme Council member Kim Song-sik also resumed his former position in Gwanak-A, securing a second seat for the party within the capital.In many of the key districts, independent candidates -- mostly defectors from leading parties -- recorded victory against party-affiliated rivals.Of them was Rep. Yoo Seong-min in his current Daegu constituency, who won with 78.9 percent in exit polls. His landslide victory had been highly predictable due to the lack of a Saenuri Party candidate there.Former Prime Minister Rep. Lee Hae-chan, who defected from the Minjoo Party amid nomination feuds, also confirmed his victory in the administrative city of Sejong.By Bae Hyun-jung","party loses assembly majority ,months of heavy political ,in wednesday general election ,electoral maps legislative inaction ,conservative saenuri party failed",['Saenuri Party'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88536388  0.04567153

The lawmakers elected will hold office for four years.""With so many districts too close to call at present, party leaders are doing their best to boost chances for their candidates,"" a political watcher said.He said in Seoul alone, around 20 out of 49 seats are difficult to predict, especially with so many voters saying they have yet to decide.Reflecting the critical nature of the race to win as many seats as possible in Seoul, leaders of the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the splinter People's Party all converged on the capital city.Saenuri chief Kim Moo-sung visited 11 districts in Seoul on Sunday to rally support for the party's candidates. He focused on visiting tightly contested regions.The lawmaker, who left his own constituency in Busan to the care of his wife, emphasized that the opposition has made it a habit of opposing everything the Park Geun-hye administration tried to push forward.""The opposition thinks that only by causing the incumbent administration to fail can they win power,"" he said.Kim is then expected to travel to the industrial city of Ulsan,414 kilometers southeast of Seoul, later in the day to help bolster chances of Saenuri party candidates there.Kim Chong-in, the Minjoo Party's interim chairman, visited six districts in Seoul, then toured several constituencies in nearby Gyeonggi Province. The party leader is expected to wrap up the day's campaign back in the capital city where he is expected to ask people for support.In a rally in Seoul, he said people must now decide whether they will pick Saenuri or the Minjoo Party, stressing a vote for the later will bring about change. His calls are aimed at preventing the split up of opposition-leaning votes from going to the People's Party led by Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo that could result in an easy victory for Saenuri.Ahn, meanwhile, whose popularity has risen in the Jeolla region of the country, supported rallies of four candidates in Seoul. The party's co-chairman, Rep. Chun Jung-bae, who has generally stayed in Gwangju, will join Ahn in street rallies in the capital city to fuel support for the minor party.","this week parliamentary election ,political watchers said sunday ,wednesday the lawmakers elected ,week parliamentary election political ,week parliamentary election",['National Assembly'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.90531605  0.53675038

I will not be aiming for the presidential race either,” he said during his much anticipated visit to the region. Former chief of The Minjoo Party of Korea Rep. Moon Jae-in , accompanied by the late President Kim Dae-jung's son Kim Hong-gul , pays respect at the May 18 Memorial Cemetary in Gwangju on Friday. YonhapMoon’s message was considered a last-ditch plea for loyalty from the region and a full-on challenge against his dissenters who have blamed him for the party’s faltering popularity there.Gwangju and the Jeolla provinces, also referred to as “Honam,” have formed a traditional political base for the Minjoo Party and its precursors, dating back to the democratic movement. Some members representing the Honam constituencies have publicly butted heads with Moon, who was chief secretary to late President Roh Moo-hyun. They accuse the former administration of having neglected the “true Honam figures” while they were in power.Such claims appear to be true, as support ratings for the party in the region have fallen behind the third-largest People’s Party, led and joined by Moon’s dissenters.Based on these polling results, the party has been split between those who opposed Moon’s Friday visit for fear of further aggravating disgruntled voters, and those that supported the need for him to mend fences, or even prove the dissenters wrong. Moon is surrounded by supporters after his speech delivered in Gwangju, Friday. “An opposition candidate who fails to demonstrate the spirit of Homan, would be someone who does not deserve to represent ,” Moon said. “If it truly is the wish of Honam , then I will gladly accept such judgement.”He also took a shot at his dissenters, saying that it would not be the desire of the voters to pick politicians that “resort to outdated and divisive politics by isolating Honam by distorting the true sentiment of the region.”Moon is scheduled to visit the Honam constituencies until Saturday.","vows to quit politics ,quit politics in plea ,he would quit politics ,moon vows to quit ,next week general election","['the Minjoo Party', 'Korea ’s', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Honam ( Gwangju', 'Jeolla']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69645399  0.08166368

The leader noted that talks are underway between the tech giant and its former executive Yang Hyang-ja, who is running as a Minjoo Party candidate in Seo-gu B, Gwangju to compete with the People’s Party cochairman Rep. Chun Jung-bae.Kim’s ambitious pledge, however, was played down by the conglomerate. There was “no specific discussion” of an investment plan with the party, said Samsung in a public statement. “It is inappropriate to discuss a specific party’s election pledges,” the statement added. Kim’s remarks came as part of efforts to address the main opposition party’s faltering popularity in the liberal base. Progressive votes are seen in various polls to be divided between the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party, the fledgling party whose key leadership consists of high-profile Jeolla natives, including Rep. Chun. According to an opinion poll conducted by local broadcaster KBS on Tuesday, the People’s Party had the lead over the Minjoo Party in Gwangju.

The given penalty is a maximum two-year jail term or 4 million won  in fine.The suit was filed by conservative columnist Jee Man-won, who had been punished for running a newspaper advert against opposition candidates in March 2012, shortly before the 19th general election.The three judges who voted against the clause, however, claimed that it breached people’s rights to free speech and political activities.“Just because  has some negative elements, it does not mean that basic rights such as political freedom should be restricted,” they said.By Ock Hyun-ju","blanket ban on election ,constitutional court ruled sunday ,political advertising the constitutional ,ban on election campaign ,upholds ban on political",['the Constitutional Court'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35343969 -0.36258656

In a 6-to-3 ruling, the court confirmed the legality of the antiprostitution law that punishes both those who voluntarily sell and buy sex, citing the need to repress the demand for prostitution. The verdict came three years after the top court began to review the act to rule whether it violates voluntary sex workers’ freedom to choose their job and what to do with their own bodies. “Demand for the sex trade is a major cause for expansion of the sex industry, so it is all the more important to restrain demand by punishing those who pay for sex,” a judge said in the ruling. “If the demand is not regulated, adults, young people and even women from less developed countries could continue to be lured into the sex industry.” The judge said that prostitution cannot be seen as a free transaction of sex between individuals, given its violent and exploitative nature. “To root out the sex trade, women selling sex should also be punished. Otherwise, society will see more sex workers working for economic gains,” he said. “The public values for sound sex culture and morals outweigh the restriction of individuals’ right to decide what to do with their bodies.” The Seoul Northern District Court asked the Constitutional Court for a review of the antiprostitution law after Kim Jeong-mi, a 45-year-old woman accused of selling sex for 130,000 won , submitted a petition to repeal the act in 2012. The sex trafficking law, which took effect in 2004 to protect sex workers, stipulates that both purchasing and selling of sex can face a penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 3 million won. But it exempts people forced into prostitution. Only one judge fully opposed the antiprostitution law, calling it is a violation of sex traders’ rights to make decisions about their own bodies. The other two dissenting judges stated that those buying sex should be punished, but not those selling sex.“If the state intervenes in an individual’s private sex life, it would result in forcing certain morals on people,” the judge against the law said. “Punishing women who voluntarily sell sex for a living is human rights violation threatening their survival and another violence by the state.”  A member of an organization representing women working in sex trade cries while leaving the Constitutional Court after its ruling Thursday. YonhapSince its enactment, seven cases have been brought to the Constitutional Court by people who paid for sex or those who ran prostitution businesses. The court, however, either dismissed the cases or ruled the law constitutional. Thursday’s ruling was the first petition filed by a sex worker. Kang Hyun-joon, head of sex workers’ rights group Hanteo National Union, called the decision “unacceptable.”“Since the enforcement of the antiprostitution law, sex laborers have struggled ,” he told the reporters outside the Constitutional Court in central Seoul. “The decision will push the workers once again to death.” “They might have chosen to sell sex because they were uneducated and received nothing from their parents,” he said. “But they also belong to this country and should be respected as human beings for their choices.”He also vowed to submit a petition to the United Nations‘ Human Rights Council to challenge the government’s decision. In a report released in May of 2013, the U.N. body suggested legalizing prostitution as a way to create safer conditions for sex workers and to combat human trafficking as well as sex-related diseases like HIV.According to a poll of 538 adults aged 19 or over by Realmeter, the public are split over the law banning the sex trade, with 43.2 percent of respondents against the law. Thirty-seven percent said that it should be in place. By gender, opposition to the antiprostitution law was higher among men at 59.4 percent than women at 37.4 percent. In response to the ruling, the Ministry of Women and Family welcomed the decision, hailing it for “making sure that sex cannot be subject to trade for money whatsoever” and “upholding values to maintain social order and boost public morals through a ban on the sex trade.”","ban on prostitution constitutional ,country antiprostitution law thursday ,antiprostitution law thursday ,antiprostitution law thursday in ,rules ban on prostitution",['the Constitutional Court'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46566325 -0.10158927

With the third-biggest People’s Party being adamant about their rejection of nominating single opposition candidates in constituencies nationwide, the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea urged them to consider unifying candidates at least in tough battlegrounds such as Seoul.Pedestrians walk past campaign posters for candidates running in the April 13 general election in Seoul on Thursday. “I am worried about the possibility of the divided liberals losing the elections,” said Jeong Jang-sun, chief strategist for the Minjoo Party’s election campaign. He suggested that the party was willing to withdraw its candidates in some constituencies even if they are more favored to win than minor party candidates.The proposal reflected the party’s mounting concern over the coalition deal that has been caught in a stalemate despite the tight deadline. Unless the parties agree to name single candidates before April 4, those who drop out of the race will be specified as candidates on ballots. Among the 122 constituencies in Seoul and nearby metropolitan areas, 105 are being contested between a candidate from the ruling Saenuri Party and multiple opposition candidates. The region is home to about 50 percent of the 253 seats elected through direct constituency votes. But the People’s Party, comprised of Minjoo defectors, has so far refused to budge on forming a coalition. The party leadership reiterated that they would not seek to reach a deal with the main opposition over building a collation nationwide, in an apparent show of their determination to remain a “third political force.” “I think our candidates are in a better position to attract voters’ support,” said People’s Party leader Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo. “If the main opposition does not want to come down in history , they should make way for our candidates.” Yoon Hee-woong, senior researcher at the Korea Society Opinion Institute, noted that a coalition among opposition parties has the potential to appeal to liberal voters despite their election pledges and political ideology being different.“The liberal voters are likely to support single opposition candidates because they have the tendency to rally behind the anti-Saenuri sentiment,” Yoon said. “But, we could see limited impact when the voter majority proves to be supporters of the People’s Party seeking to challenge the parties’ political duopoly,” he said.

The court said acknowledging prostitution as legitimate labor is not the way to go.Judges who were opposed to the law said prostitutes, even if they became sex workers voluntarily, should be protected and guided by the society, not criminally punished. They said it is social structural factors that push prostitutes to make a living by selling sex.Since the sex trafficking law was first legislated in 2004, seven cases had been brought to the constitutional court by either people who purchased sex or those who ran prostitution businesses.The court, in all seven cases, either dismissed the petition or ruled that the existing rules are constitutional. Thursday's ruling was the first of its kind filed by a sex worker. Related to the latest ruling, a finding released by local pollster Realmeter showed 43.2 percent of South Korean adults supported the move to abolish the anti-prostitution law, slightly edging out those who opposed it, which stood at 37.4 percent.The survey was conducted on 538 people aged 19 years old or older and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.","law punishing voluntary prostitutes ,ban on voluntary prostitution ,ruled in vote thursday ,anti prostitution law before ,punishing voluntary prostitutes","['the Constitutional Court', 'the Seoul Northern District Court']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2563895   0.02897476

Seoul's spy agency said that the event is expected to be held on May 7.A source familiar with North Korean affairs said the country started the process to select candidates for delegates at counties and cities for the event in mid-March.""Given past records, a list of representatives for the party congress may come out by mid-April,"" the source said.Around 3,000 delegates are expected to join the days-long party congress to be held in Pyongyang, it said.North Korea's state media has yet to publicly comment on details over its preparation for the event. Seoul's unification ministry declined to confirm the North's move.The party congress is likely to serve as a key event that will reveal the North Korean leader's policy direction in his fifth year in power. Kim inherited power following the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011. It will mark the first party congress since October 1980, as well as the first since Kim took power.Former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il advocated a military-first, or ""songun,"" policy by operating the National Defense Commission as the main decision-making body.But the young leader has shifted his focus to the party while pursuing his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons and boosting its moribund economy in tandem, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy.Seoul and Washington have warned that the North's dual-track policy is a dead end.In the past, the North made key political decisions or unveiled policies at its party congress. Also, it had major reshuffles in the party's leadership.""North Korea may seek to carry out a shift in generations in the party's leadership at the May congress,"" said a ministry official.As the North faces tougher U.N. sanctions and unilateral punitive actions by major countries, it won't produce tangible accomplishments on the economic front, analysts said.In early March, the United Nations Security Council slapped the strongest sanctions on the North in decades over its January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February.Analysts said that the planned party congress may be held during a shorter period of time, given that there would be few countries which will send their delegates to North Korea due to its latest provocations.""The party conference is likely to proceed for three to five days, mostly with local delegates,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute.He said that the North's leader is expected to unveil his vision for governance over the next 10 years, reaffirming his dual pursuit of economic growth and nuclear weapons development.","for may party congress ,tuesday the workers party ,congress slated for may ,preparations for may party ,delegates source said tuesday","['North Korea', ""the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'North Kor']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78920186  0.24598444

Yoo Seong-min  attend an Easter Sunday event on Sunday. At the center of the discussion is Rep. Yoo Seong-min, a former close aide to President Park Geun-hye, who recently departed from the party amid a nomination feud, declaring his independent candidacy.“ has completely crushed the basic principles of a constitutional state,” Chung was quoted as telling reporters on Sunday, criticizing the party’s recent candidate nomination for the April 13 general election.“I have no intention of returning to Saenuri ,” he said. Chung had left the party upon becoming the speaker in accordance to Assembly regulations.He also hinted at creating a new political entity, be it a nonpartisan alliance or a new political party.So far, a total of 11 lawmakers have left the Saenuri Party. At least three of them from the Daegu constituencies are considered staunch dissenters of President Park and the mainstream Saenuri.The most plausible scenario is that Chung will join hands with Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who announced his defection last week after failing to receive the party’s nomination.With no Saenuri rival to run in his constituency in Daegu, Yoo has effectively secured his win. He thus set out to help other party defectors, kindling speculations that such solidarity will lead to a stronger form of alliance.So far, the pro-Yoo group, mostly consisting of junior reformists, is considered to have insufficient leverage against the ruling party leadership and the presidential house, but it is likely to gain momentum, should Chung step into the picture.The parliamentary speaker, who is also an influential fifth-termer in the southern city of Busan, gained himself the reputation of  being a “man of principles” after he deterred the ruling party’s push of disputed laws and called for democratic debates.Their alliance, should it take form, is expected to bring together reform-driven conservative voters throughout the Gyeongsang regions, ranging from Daegu to Busan.Following the nomination feuds and Yoo’s consequent defection, the Saenuri Party’s approval ratings in its stronghold Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province took a visible dip.According to a survey conducted by local pollster Realmeter on 2,522 voters nationwide from March 21-25, the party’s ratings in the corresponding regions stood at 56 percent, down 14 percent from the previous week.The party, in the meantime, said the runaway members, should they intend to return, will never be welcomed.“It is nonsense that those who defected should return to the Saenuri Party after being elected as independent candidates,” said floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul on Monday.But senior Saenuri defector Lee Jae-oh pointed out that the party’s leadership members, including Won himself, had defected and returned to the party in the past.By Bae Hyun-jung","monday day after parliamentary ,defectors move toward alliance ,alliance gained momentum monday ,recent nomination upheaval candidates ,day after parliamentary speaker","['Saenuri Party', 'Chung Ui - hwa', 'Daegu', 'Yoo Seong - min', 'Easter Sund']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57909292  0.05025336

Kim Moo-sung refused to seal a total of five nominations for the April 13 general election, pushing the party into disarray with rival members contemplating bypassing the leader’s ultimatum.Chairman Kim Moo-sung is surrounded by press as he tries to enter his office in Seoul on Friday. The pro-Park members had claimed that Kim’s refusal of nomination was equivalent to a chairmanship vacuum, which would in turn allow an emergency operation led by the floor leader instead.As Kim remained determined, his challengers agreed to not nominate any candidate for the constituencies represented by their former members Reps. Yoo Seong-min and Rep. Lee Jae-oh. In exchange, Kim agreed to endorse the nominations of three others considered loyalists to President Park Geun-hye and members of the faction rivaling chairman Kim, including former interior minister Chong Jong-sup.Lee Jae-man, whose nomination for a Daegu constituency was canceled by the Saenuri Party leadership, voices his opposition to the press Friday. On Thursday, Kim had announced in a press conference that he refused to put his stamp -- the last formal nomination procedure -- on five constituencies, including one in Daegu represented by former floor leader Yoo and one in Eunpyeong in Seoul of Rep. Lee. The move was in favor of the two, who left the party to run as independents after the nominations committee dominated by the pro-Park members refused to put up the veterans.Yoo has been specifically branded by President Park as a political traitor since last year. His defection and bid to run as an independent was considered a blow to the ruling party’s reception in the metropolitan region, which has relatively more political flexibility than other regions with strong political allegiance.Some described the chairman’s decision as a challenge against President Park, while others viewed it as a strategic move to amplify his power of command against the pro-Park members postelection. The last-minute agreement, made just hours before the official candidate registration closed, was considered a feat for Kim to have successfully flexed his political muscle by raising the stakes.Kim had said earlier Friday that his call had nothing to do with Cheong Wa Dae and that it was simply to uphold the party constitution and regulations, citing the “unilateral way” the nominations were decided by the committee chaired by Rep. Lee Hahn-koo.“ as we faced a crisis of foreseeing an election annihilation due to wrongful nominations that drove off the people,” Kim said.","party leadership on friday ,leadership on friday ,leadership on friday managed ,total of five nominations ,leaving controversial constituencies vacant","['the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Park Geun', 'Saenuri Party', 'Kim Moo - sung']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74645191  0.04182152

Yoo had until Wednesday midnight to make a decision as under the current election laws, running as an independent would require him to leave the party before the official registration of candidates began Thursday.The third-termer was once considered a close aide to President Park Geun-hye.

Reps. Yoon Sang-hyun and Joo Ho-young announced their defection from the Saenuri Party earlier in the day. A total of eight incumbent lawmakers have left the party, bringing its number of parliamentary seats to 149. It is just two seats short of losing the majority in the 292-member National Assembly. The conservative party is likely to lose its majority status as more are likely to quit the party that has been marred by the nomination battle. Among them are Reps. Yoo Seung-min and Lee Jae-oh who each lead their own faction of several Saenuri lawmakers. Both were denied the party’s nomination.  The ruling Saenuri Party`s former whip Rep. Yoo Seung-min stays at home to consider over whether to run for the April elections. YonhapObservers, however, noted that the party does not appear rattled by the development as some of those running as independents still hold political affiliation and loyalty to the party. Furthermore, the party seems confident of winning back the majority in one month’s time. Yoon, for instance, has decided to run as an independent for now to save the party from public backlash after being caught making coarse remarks about the party chairman in a nomination feud.The defection of former floor leader Yoo, however, is expected to deal a blow to the party as undecided voters and centrists may lean against the Saenuri for eventually forcing him out given his squabble with President Park Geun-hye last year.It was also reported that Yoo would announce his independent bid later in the day.

Minjoo chief Kim Chong-in “After much thought, I decided to stay,” Kim Chong-in, interim chair of The Minjoo Party of Korea, said at a press conference. He also apologized to the public for the latest flare-up.Kim had threatened to leave the party after his self-nomination as the party’s No. 2 proportional candidate invited a backlash from mainstream party members over the past week. He openly slammed his critics for “failing to treat him right” as a veteran politician who had joined the party to “save it” from an anticipated election defeat.At the press conference, Kim reiterated that the Minjoo Party has many problems to fix in order to win the election and eventually become a ruling party. Kim also reportedly accepted the party’s request that he maintain the No. 2 proportional candidacy spot. Kim’s boycott of his post prompted former chairman Moon Jae-in to visit his home to persuade him, and all members of the interim leadership committee to offer to resign to take responsibility in exchange that Kim stays. Kim said he was undecided on whether to accept the members’ resignation. He also added that Moon’s visit was not a significant factor in his decision to stay.","election three days after ,next month general election ,opposition party said wednesday ,winning next month general ,month general election three","['Minjoo', 'Kim Chong - in', 'Kim Chong - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.8185851   0.11494096

Kim Moo-sung  heads into the Supreme Council meeting Friday. The party’s Supreme Council and nomination committee meetings were canceled.The party has been dominated by a clash between the pro-Park members and their adversaries in the competition for general election candidacy. Minor opposition People’s Party cochief Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo said the Saenuri feud arose because the nomination committee was directly controlled by Park.The pro-Park faction is currently spearheaded by nomination committee chairman Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, with the rival group being represented by party chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung.“This election will serve as an opportunity to hold Lee and his committee accountable,” said Ahn Sang-soo in a press conference. Cho Hae-jin, the party’s former vice floor leader, said that the election would serve as a chance to address “unjust politics,” and vowed to win the contest as an independent. Cho is close to former whip Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who has been openly criticized by President Park over differences on key government initiatives.The defection added fuel to the intraparty feud, as chairman Kim Moo-sung reiterated Friday that he would not endorse what he viewed to be a “biased” nomination list. The committee has also yet to decide on whether to nominate Yoo, whom President Park and her faction criticized for “betraying” the conservative party’s ideology. The former floor leader is reportedly considering a run as an independent, should he be deprived of the party’s ticket. With those being excluded from the nomination weighing whether to join forces or run as independents, the main opposition party, The Minjoo Party of Korea, was seen taking its cue by floating the idea of having former health minister Chin join them for the election.Chin was once considered one of President Park’s loyalists during her presidential campaign, but became estranged from Park after his opposition to her welfare policies for the elderly.

Cheong Wa DaePark has often been observed as addressing elderly groups for support when facing key elections or pushing for controversial decisions.Late last year, during an annual luncheon with the Korean Senior Citizens Association, the president reiterated her call for a state-authored history textbook, although a nationwide protest against the government-controlled revision was ongoing. “In order for our nation to take a further leap, I believe it is crucial to properly pass on to our descendants the great history achieved by the elderly,” Park had said.Her appeal found the right audience, as the senior group immediately responded with unwavering support.“ will at all times stand by the president, who is ever devoted to the nation and the people,” said the KSCA chairman Lee Sim.The president and the ruling camp have every reason to care about the nation’s senior voters aged 60 and above as their numbers and voter participation rates are higher than any other age group.According to the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs on Wednesday, the number of citizens aged 60 and above as of February reached 9.7 million, accounting for 23.1 percent of the total voter pool. It is the single largest demographic group.The over 60 age group also happens to be the most enthusiastic group of voters, with an average participation rate that nears 80 percent.Observers added that President Park’s family background -- with the late President Park Chung-hee as her father -- tends to act in her favor when addressing senior citizens.“Elderly people generally have a sense of nostalgia for the late President Park, who they believe to be a powerful leader in times of need, and this sentiment leads to a steady base of support for President Park,” said Ahn Il-won, chief director of local pollster Research View.Among religious societies here, Christian circles have turned out to be the most supportive of conservative administrations, including the incumbent Park government, especially over national security issues.“I believe that the Korean Church will play a bigger role in building inter-Korean peace,” the state leader said earlier this month at a breakfast prayer meeting.War veterans, largely represented by the Korea Disabled Veteran’s Association By Agent-Orange in Vietnam War, are another pillar power base for the president.The association’s headquarters earlier this year had urged its members to participate in the nationwide signature-seeking campaign -- led and promoted by the president herself -- to pass the disputed pending bills on economic revitalization and labor reforms.The Minjoo Party of Korea‘s interim chief Kim Chong-in  meets with Choi Jong-jin, acting chairman of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, on March 7. YonhapResponding to the criticism on its alleged breach of political neutrality, the organization claimed that its actions did not indicate support for a specific party or figure.The Minjoo Party of Korea, on the other hand, with a smaller pool of loyal supporters, has been counting on its longtime connections with labor circles, represented by the relatively moderate Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the more radical Korean Confederation of Trade Unions.It is also due to such partnerships that the party has been resisting the government’s push for labor reform bills, including the most controversial worker dispatching bill, which expands corporations’ discretion to hire short-term employees.The party’s former chairman and potential presidential candidate Rep. Moon Jae-in called this bill “the most vicious bill ever, which deepens employment insecurity.”But over recent months under the leadership of interim chief and economist Kim Chong-in, the party has been distancing itself slightly from progressive labor groups and taking a centrist tone.“The frequent clashes  tend to stiffen social relationships and consequently hold back the nation’s economy,” Kim said earlier this month at his meeting with the KCTU.He thus suggested that labor unions pay more attention to promoting workers’ rights and refrain from overstepping into general social issues, including political agendas.In a mild backlash against what they saw as Kim’s economic-conservative turn, some labor unions gestured at shifting their support to leftist minority parties, such as the Justice Party.But Kim, whose policy direction is to draw off the activist tone from the party and expand into the centrist swing voters’ pool, shrugged off the stir.“The Minjoo Party and I will fully embrace the idea of inclusive growth and step away from old economic frames,” Kim said on Wednesday during a conference at the Kwanghun Club, an association of senior journalists.Meanwhile, the new centrist minority People’s Party has been struggling to draw support from both the conservative and progressive voter clusters, but has so far failed to elicit sturdy support from any specific group.When initiating the party in February, cochairman Rep.

The remaining 47 are proportional representation seats that will be allocated to parties according to the numbers of votes they receive overall.The relatively high percent of the dropout is apparently due to the party's move to reform itself by excluding scores of incumbent lawmakers deemed incompetent from being nominated for candidacy. The party vowed to take drastic measures to win back public support following a high-profile internal feud between former Chairman Moon Jae-in and scores of lawmakers who left the party to create the minor opposition People' Party.Moon even stepped down and handed over full authority to the party's nomination committee and to Kim Chong-in, who has been tapped as the interim leader of the party.Meanwhile Kim Han-gil, a senior member of the People's Party made up of lawmakers who bolted from Minjoo, announced Thursday that he will not run in the elections, saying he will take responsibility for failing to persuade the party's co-chairman Ahn Cheol-soo to join forces with the Minjoo Party."" have argued the need for the coalition of the opposition bloc. I decided not to run in the 20th general elections as a way of taking responsibility for failing to arrange a merger,"" Kim told reporters.Kim, however, said he will stay with the party.Earlier, Ahn declined the offer from Kim Chong-in, who stressed the need for a united coalition to tackle the ruling Saenuri Party. Following a difference in views over the possible merger, Kim Han-gil stepped down from the head of the party's election planning committee.The coalition offer was made more than two months after the People's Party was separated from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the predecessor of the Minjoo Party.Boo Jwa-hyun, who also failed to win a nomination from the Minjoo Party, joined the People's Party on Thursday, saying he could not accept the party's decision.At present, the ruling Saenuri Party controls 155 seats in the 293-member National Assembly, compared to 103 seats held by the main opposition Minjoo Party.

Lee Jae-oh, a five-term lawmaker and considered to be an opponent of the pro-Park Geun-hye faction within the party, also failed to receive the party ticket.Rep. Lee previously served as the party's floor leader and is considered one of the closest confidants of former President Lee.The ruling party still has not finalized whether to nominate the party's former floor leader Yoo Seong-min.Yoo stepped down from his post in July 2015 after President Park publicly lambasted him for leading negotiations with the main opposition party on the passage of a parliamentary revision bill.Political analysts forecast that if Lee Jae-oh creates some kind of coalition with other heavyweight dropouts, this could pose problems for the ruling camp, particularly in heavily contested districts in Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi region.Meanwhile, Rep. Chyung Ho-joon, who had failed to receive the Minjoo Party's ticket, joined the minor People's Party on Wednesday.Chyung's move allows the People's Party to form a parliamentary negotiation bloc by having 20 seats in the 300-strong National Assembly. The Minjoo Party of Korea excluded Chyung and other veteran politicians, including former Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan, who also declared his intent to run as an independent.Chyung is a son of Chyung Da-chul, a former adviser to the Minjoo Party. The senior Chyung had said he would persuade his son to join the minor People's Party and would join it as well.Rep. Jung Chung-rai, who was also excluded from the nomination last week, meanwhile, said he will respect the party nomination committee's decision.""I am willing to do anything for the party's victory,"" Jung told reporters, noting that he will not take further action.Rival parties have virtually picked most of the candidates who will run for the 253 parliamentary seats to be chosen through direct elections.

The People’s Party is mostly made up of Minjoo Party defectors who left after clashing consistently with the party leadership, which was previously led by Rep. Moon Jae-in.The Minjoo Party has been carrying out a large-scale reshuffle of its candidates, dropping veteran and prominent party members including a former prime minister, Rep. Lee Hae-chan.Chyung had held a press conference Tuesday lambasting the decision by the party leadership led by Kim Jong-in, saying the nomination process was unfair and damaging to the party’s chances of winning the April 13 parliamentary race.Rep. Chyung Ho-joon  enters a press conference with Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo to announce that he is joining the People’s Party to run in the April 13 general election. Sources said Chyung’s decision to join Ahn’s party was largely influenced by his father, former opposition heavyweight and Minjoo Party adviser Chyung Dai-chul.With Chyung Ho-joon on board, the People’s Party will receive state subsidies of up to 7.3 billion won  if its number of seats remains 20 or above by March 28, when the funds are doled out.There are talks of potential defection by Rep.

Moon hee-Sang, who had chaired the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the predecessor to the Minjoo Party of Korea, from 2013 to 2014. Kim forced him to withdraw his bid to run for the April general election. Moon accepted the decision, though reluctantly. The next target was the hard-line wing of the liberal party. Rep. Jung Chung-rae, the second-term lawmaker known for his combative rhetoric against the conservatives, and Rep. Lee Hae-chan, the former prime minister during the late Roh Moo-hyun administration, was excluded from the party’s nomination list.Shocked and angered, the pro-Roh loyalists defied the call. “I am not going to succumb to injustice,” said Lee when he announced his bid to run in the election as an independent. Jung filed a complaint against the party’s decision and his supporters have staged sit-ins in front of the party’s headquarters. Minjoo Party chief Kim Chong-in Such moves added pressure on the leadership of interim chairman, who had vowed to overhaul the feud-ridden party and bring it to a much-needed election victory.“Kim’s leadership is beginning to adopt a dictatorial tone,” Rep. Kim Yong-ik said in a media interview. The first-termer, who forwent his candidacy for the election, noted that Kim’s lack of explanation for excluding Reps. Lee and Jung was “insulting” to Minjoo Party members. Other members questioned whether Kim’s management of the party was transparent. Rep. Choi Jae-sung alleged that some key members had been involved in the nomination process, manipulating Kim into excluding Rep. Jung from the nomination. But Kim, a 75-old politician who had served as a lawmaker during liberal and conservative governments appeared aloof in the face of such criticism. Instead, he said that the party was ready to take the election battle to the next level.“I am not in a position to make a decision arbitrarily,” said Kim on Wednesday at a press conference in downtown Seoul. When asked about the dissenters’ comparison of Kim’s leadership as that of a Russian Czar, he said, “If someone calls me , then so be it. There is nothing I can do,” The former economics professor said that the party would shift the focus of the election battle toward President Park’s “flawed” economic policies, casting the upcoming election as a vote of confidence in Park’s presidency. The interim leader said that he would resign his post unless the party gains more than 107 seats in the elections, but refused to clarify about his plan when the party wins the elections. “I have not thought about it yet,"" he said. Indeed, Kim’s unyielding style of leadership appeared to catch dissenting members and rival parties off guard. Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy, noted that Kim is following the strategy that he had laid out when taking office. “Kim is doing what he has planned to do from the beginning,” said Yoon. “His first and second plan was to expand his control over the party and build a unified opposition bloc. Now he is moving toward the third and final plan, a debate over the economic policies ,” he said.

The second-term lawmaker Jung has yet to file a complaint against the decision, but the third-term lawmaker Choi and the first-termer Boo refused to accept the call.“There was a serious debate about candidates such as Jung,” said Hong Chang-sun, a former lawmaker who oversees the party’s nomination procedure. The outspoken lawmaker was disciplined last year by the party’s ethics committee for comments he made against a fellow lawmaker. Yoon has faced allegations that he had pulled strings to get his children jobs at a conglomerate. Kang was responsible for a political backlash last year after claiming the Saenuri Party had manipulated the 2012 presidential election. The announcement, which came after the party’s first shake-up on Feb. 24, drew mixed reactions from within and outside the main opposition party.Supporters of Rep. Jung Chung-rae hold protest against The Minjoo Party’s decision to exclude him from its nomination list, Thursday. Yonhap.Some Minjoo Party hard-liners and party officials opposed the decision to side with Jung, who most recently garnered positive reviews for his tearful participation at the party’s nine-day filibuster against the government’s antiterrorism act.Rep. Kim Kwang-jin said through his Facebook account that the party should embrace Jung, comparing him to “a courageous advocate” of the party. Rep. Jin Sung-joon and Son Hye-won, the party’s chief publicist, also urged the leadership to withdraw the decision.Jung’s supporters joined the fray. His online advocates temporarily shut down the Minjoo Party’s website in protest against the decision and filled social media channels with messages critical of the leadership. “Excluding Jung is a crazy thing to do,” an anonymous commenter said on the Minjoo Party website. Observers noted that the debate over Jung reflects the new leadership of the party’s interim leader Kim Jong-in -- shifting from ideological confrontations toward the debate over the Park Geun-hye administration’s economic policies.“It would serve as a litmus test,” said Yoon Tae-gon, a senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy. “I think the party concluded that keeping Jung in the party runs counter to its new leader Kim Jong-in’s steering of the party,” said Yoon. The People’s Party, meanwhile, dismissed the decision to exclude Jung as an “insincere gesture” and accused the main opposition of lacking the commitment to overhaul the party system the new party believes has been dominated by factions close to former president Roh Moo-hyun. “They have failed to remove more hawkish members inside the pro-Roh faction,” said Rep. Moon Byung-ho. The People’s Party said the main opposition’s left-wing heavyweights, such as Rep. Lee Hae-chan and Lee Mok-hee, should be excluded from the nomination list.By Yeo Jun-suk","excluded five incumbent lawmakers ,party excludes five incumbents ,april general election reps ,opposition party announced thursday ,lawmakers from its nominations","['Jung Chung - rae', 'Yoon Hu - duk', 'Kang Dong - won', 'Boo Jwa - hyun', 'Choi Kyu - sung', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40159366 -0.06466233

Lee Hahn-koo, chairman of the candidate recommendation committee, announced that the party will hold primaries in another 31 constituencies, including six in Seoul, two in Busan, and two in Daejeon.But the committee deferred its final decision on Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun, who recently caused a stir within the party for directing coarse remarks toward party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung. Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, the ruling Saenuri Party's candidate recommendation committee chairman. Yonhap“ may have to be submitted to the party’s ethics committee so we had to hold his candidacy until further decisions,” Lee said.The Incheon lawmaker has recently turned the party upside down after a phone conversation recording revealed him as saying “Kill Kim. He should totally be ruled out of nominations.”Yoon immediately explained that he had been intoxicated at the time and offered his apologies to the party chief, but Kim has remained furious over the profanity.When the party’s Supreme Council decided to summon Yoon for questioning on Thursday, Kim stormed out of the meeting room in a stern refusal to face the foulmouthed member.But the party’s ethics committee chief Rep. Yeo Sang-kyoo suggested that Kim let go of the issue.“I don‘t see this conflict as the kind that should be brought up to the ethics committee,” he said in a radio interview.“It would be best if Kim, who may be seen as the victim here, to overlook the issue.”The Yoon-Kim collision, which on the surface seemed to be a discord over election candidacy, in fact traced back to the chronic enmity between those close to President Park Geun-hye and the non-mainstreamers flocking around party chief Kim.The nomination committee, seen as a pro-Park clique, suggested to classify former government officials as election rookies and assign extra credits to them. But Kim lashed back, taking the plan as a political move to unduly favor presidential aides.The committee also put off its candidacy decision for Kim, who has been embroiled in accusations that he drafted a black list concerning the party’s candidate selection.Rep. Chung Doo-un last month asserted on the existence of the contended list, containing the names of some 40 incumbent lawmakers to be excluded from party nomination.“Chairman Kim has said that he is ready to participate in a regional primary ,” said nomination chief Lee.“But we asked for his understanding  as the disputed rumors have not yet been cleared.”Speculations also rose that the survival of incumbent lawmakers was an attempt to persuade the public that the suspected list never existed, just as Kim claimed.Meanwhile, the ruling party added momentum in recruiting new figures for the April race, including renowned Go, or baduk, player Cho Hoon-hyun who signed in on Thursday to bid for the party’s proportional representative position.By Bae Hyun-jung","april 13 general elections ,party on thursday outlined ,outlines runners sidesteps controversy ,saenuri party on thursday ,party on thursday","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Saenuri', 'Lee']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59404588  0.16976371

The ruling Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea have announced that when they choose the candidates running in the April elections, they will give more points to “political underdogs” than established politicians. The beneficiaries include women, young people and the disabled. “We decided to send young and female politicians to the party’s ‘priority’ nomination list,” said Rep. Lee Hahn-koo, the four-term lawmaker who oversees the party’s nomination process. The party designated four constituencies as its “priority” nomination list, with each two being reserved for female and young politicians.  Among the priority list are Nowon and Gwanak districts, Seoul – where 31-year-old Lee Jun-seok and 38-year-old lawyer Won Young-sup announced their bids, and Bucheon and Ansan of Gyeonggi Province, where several female party officials and professors are competing to be nominated.  Besides awarding 10 percent more points to women, the disabled and young people, the party will also increase the share of proportional representation seats reserved for female politicians from 50 to 60 percent.  The Saenuri Party leadership attends a party Supreme Council meeting on Monday. Behind them is a new election campaign placard that says “Let’s do well, really.” YonhapThe Minjoo Party has also decided to give more points to young and female lawmakers when they select candidates running for local constituencies. This group will receive 10 to 20 percent more points than average candidates during the procedure. But the ongoing nomination procedures were also seen to reflect ideological difference among the rival parties. For instance, former war veterans have a better chance of being nominated in the conservative party and immigrants are more likely to be nominated in the liberal party. The Saenuri Party will give up to 15 percent of extra points to war veterans as well as descendants of independent fighters.Those who can avail of such benefits include former Gangwon governor Kim Jin-seon, who had fought in the Vietnam War, and preliminary candidate Baek Seong-tae, a war veteran preparing to run in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province.The Minjoo Party, for its part, has announced that it will give extra points to immigrants with multicultural family backgrounds as well as political aides who have worked with incumbent and former lawmakers for at least eight years. “Given that the Saenuri Party does not give extra points to immigrants running for nomination contests, I think the measure can highlight our party’s liberal stance toward , said a Minjoo Party official who is familiar with the nomination process.  The Minjoo Party leadership makes victory gestures while wearing new election campaign jackets at a party meeting on Monday. YonhapThe trend of embracing political minorities is also apparent among smaller political groups.The People’s Party has announced a rule that it will give more points to female and disabled politicians. Female and disabled candidates can receive 10 and 25 percent more points required for winning candidacy than the average candidates. Meanwhile, those who have never run in elections will also be high on the parties’ nomination list. The Saenuri Party, the Minjoo Party and the People’s Party have decided to grant new faces 10 to 20 more points than incumbent lawmakers for securing nomination. By Yeo Jun-suk","scramble to woo political ,to woo political underdogs ,the upcoming general election ,rival parties adopting new ,political underdogs the nomination","['Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83563489  0.08497602

Ahn Cheol-soo chose to pursue his political ideals -- safeguarding his newborn centrist party’s independence and promoting diversity in the polarized field. Ahn Cheol-soo But the party’s key members lashed back at what they saw as Ahn’s stubborn attitude, claiming that the party should do whatever it takes, including an inter-party merger, to deter the ruling conservative party’s victory in the forthcoming April general elections.“One of our core tasks is to block the ruling party from taking a decision-making majority in the parliament,” said election policy committee chairman Rep. Kim Han-gil on Monday at an open party meeting.“Even if we were to constitute a parliamentary negotiating body and gain a say on the  floor, it wouldn’t mean anything, should the ruling party win 180 or more seats.”The ruling Saenuri Party is confident of securing 180 or more out of the 300 parliamentary seats in the April elections, allowing it to pass legislations without consulting minority parties. The current National Assembly Act states that an approval of three-fifth of the lawmakers present is required in order to put a pending bill to floor vote.Kim thereby took direct aim at party chairman Ahn, who had on the previous day reiterated his flat refusal to The Minjoo Party of Korea counterpart Kim Chong-in’s suggestion to “form an opposition unity for the sake of election victory.”“There will be no turning back ,” said Ahn, who had defected from the main opposition group late last year amid conflicts with the leadership.“ realize that this could mean death for all, but so be it.”  Reps. Ahn Cheol-soo  and Kim Han-gil, chairman and election policy committee chief of the People’s Party, respectively, sit at a party meeting on Monday. YonhapAhn’s position may have won sympathy from advocates of the “new politics” slogan but has unnerved the moderates, especially those who defected from the Minjoo Party, including Kim.“This is when we need to build an integrated resistance system  as Ahn had suggested,” Kim said, reminding that Ahn himself had brought up the idea of opposition unity as necessary.Rep. Chun Jung-bae, another high-profile defector from the Minjoo Party, echoed Kim’s assertion.“Deterring the ruling party’s monopoly is  crucial ,” the fifth-termer and former justice minister told reporters after the meeting.Despite the obvious internal strife, however, Ahn refused to back down from his “third way” plan.“An  unity is not the key to victory but an outdated strategy that has often led to failure,” the party chairman said, in answer to Kim’s reproach.“Only by following a new path can we increase the possibility of changing the government and the political system.""Meanwhile, recent surveys have indicated that the new party’s approval ratings, which had once neared the 20 percent mark, fell to the 5-6 percent range in late February to early March.By Bae Hyun-jung","party feuds over opposition ,rejecting the main opposition ,main opposition camp suggestion ,ahn party feuds over ,feuds over opposition unity","['the People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn Cheol - soo', 'Ahn ’s']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6270923   0.12659431

The bills cleared its biggest hurdle in the late evening when The Minjoo Party of Korea suspended its 192-hour filibuster aimed to prevent the counter-terrorism bill from coming to the floor for a vote in a plenary session. The legislature passed the counter-terrorism bill 156 to 1, with the 107- member Minjoo Party boycotting the voting session in protest of the government-backed the bill. The rival parties passed the North Korea human right bill and the election bill 212 to 0, 174 to 34, respectively. “We condemn the Saenuri Party for unilaterally passing the counter-terrorism bill,” said the Minjoo Party's interim leader Kim Jong-in. The main opposition submitted their own revised version of the anti-terrorism bill, only to have it blocked by 107 to 156 vote.Minjoo Party of Korea`s lawmakers boycott a voting session in protest agaisnt the Saenuri Party`s attempt to push through the counter-terrorism bill. YonhapThe result was widely expected after Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-haw invoked his authority to take the anti-terrorism bill to floor nine days ago. The ruling Saenuri Party holds a majority of 157 seats in the 293-member Assembly. The liberal opposition parties have long been against the security bill’s “toxic clauses.” They have claimed the measure would allow the National Intelligence Service to arbitrarily determine the scope of terror suspects and collect their phone records and financial statements without a warrant.The Minjoo Party and minor Justice Party have accused the Saenuri Party of refusing to accept their calls to revise the disputed clauses, later launching the filibuster that set the record for the world’s longest relay debate.But the marathon speeches, the country’s first since 1969, are seen to have failed to translate into wider public opposition to the controversial bill. Recent opinion polls suggest the voters are almost evenly split on the filibuster to amend the bill. “It is yet another snapshot of Korea’s politics,” said Jun Kye-Wan, a political analyst at Korea’s Knowledge Center. “The Saenuri Party knew that the Minjoo Party would back down and they have been taking advantage of the situation in their favor,” the analyst said. The Saenuri Party has rebuked the opposition-led filibuster as a political stunt to promote the liberal lawmakers’ profiles in the run-up to the general election. Conservative party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung warned that the move would backfire during the election.Acknowledging the challenge, the Minjoo Party’s leader Kim Jong-in reportedly pressured the party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul into calling an end to the filibuster. Lee, the first to propose the measure, was the last speaker, delivering a speech for more than 12 hours, now the longest filibuster in Korea’s history.The Minjoo Party`s floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul. YonhapWhile highlighting that the filibuster brought voters’ attention to the “advanced” democratic procedure, analysts said the decision to quit the move was an inevitable call to prevent political repercussions ahead of the elections. “The filibuster serves as an opportunity to tell the voters that the Assembly has a democratic rule such as the filibuster,” said anaylst Jun. “Now the opposition should move beyond the filibuster and find a way to construct another narrative against the ruling party,” he said. Yoon Pyeong-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University, agreed: “The filibuster highlighted the nature of democratic rule. Since the opposition has gained more than they had expected, they should focus on other issues, such as economic ones.” Echoing the political significance of the filibuster, which can prevent a majority from pushing through controversial bills, Jun noted that the opposition should have fought to the end at the risk of their political careers.“Once they start, they have to continue until it ends. If they believe that the bill would vastly undermine civil liberty, they have to continue their efforts to convince the people even if it costs their parliamentary seats,” said Jun.By Yeo Jun-suk","approved other stalled bills ,national assembly on wednesday ,assembly passes antiterrorism bill ,wednesday gave final approval ,assembly on wednesday","['the National Assembly', 'North Korea ’s']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48625726  0.01776966

But we fell far short of what was needed ,"" Lee, looking exhausted, told reporters following his filibuster.The party leadership initially promised to halt the delaying tactic on Tuesday on concerns that the indefinite speeches, if prolonged, could cause public backlash over the delay in the parliamentary endorsement of several important bills.Lawmakers will vote on the anti-terrorism bill during a plenary session scheduled for later on Wednesday.It is very likely that the bill will be passed, as the ruling Saenuri Party controls 157 seats in the 293-member National Assembly.President Park Geun-hye has repeatedly called on the National Assembly to pass the stalled bill to better protect the lives of South Koreans, citing a string of attacks around the world and threats from North Korea.The opposition bloc, however, raised concerns over breaches of privacy such as allowing the National Intelligence Service to collect personal data on anyone suspected of posing a threat to national security.Lawmakers will also pass a bipartisan deal on redrawing electoral districts for the upcoming general elections in April.The Saenuri Party and Minjoo Party were in agreement to hold a plenary session to deliberate the deal on remapping electoral districts for the April 13 polls.Separately, a bill aimed at improving North Korea's human rights condition will also be taken to the floor for a vote.If passed, the North Korean human rights bill will end some 11 years of partisan bickering over how best to influence Pyongyang to change.Among other things, the bill calls for a concerted effort to improve the North's human rights situation and set up a center tasked with investigating human rights abuses.","vote blocking marathon filibuster ,blocking marathon filibuster wednesday ,main opposition party ended ,vote blocking marathon ,its vote blocking marathon","['Lee Jong - kul', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the National Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61369896  0.27301043

Ahn Cheol-soo, who left the Minjoo camp late last year amid conflict with then-leader Rep. Moon Jae-in.“That  leadership, which many quoted as a key reason of their defection, is no longer in power, which should now make it easier  to come back,” Kim said.The party chief also alluded that his idea of unity involved a formal unification of the two parties and not just inter-party solidarity, implying that the People’s Party should integrate back into the Minjoo Party. Kim Jong-in, interim chief of The Minjoo Party of Korea, attends the party’s leadership meeting Wednesday. YonhapKim’s eyebrow-raising proposal for unity is taken as an attempt to overcome the multiple challenges currently faced by the party, including supporters’ spreading disappointment over the sudden suspension of the filibuster.“We have made every effort to share the details of the antiterrorism bill and to revise the inappropriate clauses,” Kim said. Kim had reportedly been the most eager to persuade party whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul on Monday to consider halting the filibuster to prevent any backlash, such as from deterring the passage of the revised public election bill to confirm the reallocation of the nation’s constituencies.“But in consideration of various political agendas, most of all the nearing April 13 elections, we have decided to adjourn the filibuster and move on to urgent pending issues,” he added.The filibuster was deemed the opposition’s last resort to block the ruling conservative Saenuri Party’s enforcement of the disputed bill, so the termination will eventually lead to the bill’s passage, Kim admitted.“But we will by all means win a parliamentary majority in the elections and then revise the law,” he suggested.The rival parties had agreed earlier last week to put the constituency bill to a floor vote, but follow-up legislative procedures were held off once the opposition kicked off the unlimited parliamentary relay talk on Feb. 23.The leadership’s decision to voluntarily end the filibuster was welcomed by the rival Saenuri, which also took time to slam Kim’s proposal for a reunion with defectors.“I do not understand why  would reunite at this point in time, after all the fuss they made about their differences in policies,” the Saenuri Party’s floor leader Rep. Won Yoo-chul told reporters Wednesday.“Such capricious actions would only trigger  distrust of politics.”Rep. Ahn, too, displayed discomfort toward Kim’s call.“I cannot but have doubts of  intentions,” he told reporters.“I believe that the top priority task  at this point in time is to reorganize itself and unite its own members.”By Bae Hyun-jung","table wednesday strategic reunion ,opposition reunion seeking to ,unilaterally terminating the parliamentary ,wednesday strategic reunion ,wednesday strategic reunion with",[],18,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.6419645  0.2776621  0.7112565],Korea Herald,Politics,3,2016,"party leadership meeting wednesday yonhapkim ,the table wednesday strategic reunion ,the party leadership meeting wednesday ,party leadership meeting wednesday ,table wednesday strategic reunion","['the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Jong - in', 'the People ’s Party', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Minjoo', 'Moon Jae - in', 'Kim', 'the People ’s Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Kim Jong - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'YonhapKim ’s', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'Lee Jong - kul', 'Saenuri Party ’s', 'Kim', 'Saenuri', 'Kim', 'the Saenuri Party ’s', 'Won Yoo', 'Kim', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",2,[ 0.         0.         0.        ... -0.6419645  0.2776621  0.7112565]

The bill on new constituencies for the April 13 general election passed the public administration committee late Sunday to be put up for a plenary vote on Monday. Feeling the pressure, The Minjoo Party of Korea asked for a brief recess in its filibuster against antiterrorism bills to vote on the delayed election bill. The party’s whip Rep. Lee Jong-kul said they are willing to temporary halt the filibuster to pass the election bill. Saenuri Party lawmakers hold up placards to protest aganist the opposition-led filibuster at the National Assembly.  “It is not appropriate to say that we face an ‘either or situation’ when we have an alternative procedure,” Lee said, arguing that political parties can hold a plenary session amid filibustering and continue the obstructive procedure afterwards. But the Saenuri Party refused to accept the call, claiming that it is “legally impossible” to hold the session unless the Minjoo Party stop filibustering. The Assembly law stipulates that a filibuster can end only when there are no filibusterers and there is three-fifths approval of the attending lawmakers, when the session ends on March 11. “In terms of law, the opposition party’s request to halt the session and pass the election law does not make sense. They have to stop filibustering and adjourn the current session,” said Rep. Kim Jung-hoon who chairs the party’s policy committee. Kim also suggested that the filibustering was “null and void” when the National Assembly Speaker Rep. Chung Ui-hwa vacated his seat on Saturday after being exhausted by the marathon speech session. Parliamentary committee chairpersons have overseen the session, alternating back and forth amongst them.The Saenuri Party also threatened to file a defamation suit against some claims made during the filibusters, claiming the opposition lawmakers have made false accusations against the National Intelligence Service, the nation’s top intelligence agency. While the lawmaker is subject to immunity, false accusations made outside the parliamentary hall can be legally disputed, the Saenuri said.“Opposition lawmakers argue that if the counterterrorism bills are passed, the NIS are able to listen in on the peoples’ telephone conversation and spy on mobile messenger. It is false rumor and undermine the NIS reputation,” said Kim. The Minjoo Party lawmakers argue that the bill would curtail civil liberties by allowing what they consider to be an unreliable intelligence agency to have unauthorized access to private information, such as phone records and financial statements.The main opposition asserts that the bill should include clauses preventing the authorities from infringing upon civil rights. They said that the law should ban the National Intelligence Service from having the authority to track down and interrogate terror suspects. Instead, the authority should belong to the counter-terrorism center built by the government.  President Park Geun-hye and the Saenuri Party have insisted that the security bill which aims to enhance the intelligence agency’s surveillance capabilities should be passed to address terror threats such as those from North Korea and international terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State group. By Yeo Jun-suk","suspend the marathon debate ,rival parties on monday ,parties on monday collided ,the marathon debate ,plenary vote on monday",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48436457  0.18251887

While the members’ political independence is confirmed by law, it has been extensively compromised by sub-rules that allowed the rival parties to recommend their quota of members.“There were structural limits to making decisions due to the rules on the member formation as well as the requirement of the two-thirds approval of attending members. ... In order for the constituency demarcation to become fair and stable, we desperately felt the need for the discussion to begin much more in advance and for the committee to become truly independent ,” the committee said. The committee admitted there were still loopholes in the new constituency maps, but that they had little choice to avoid further delays and confusion.The bill is to go through the public affairs and administrative committee before being presented for the final plenary vote. The committee, in theory, can send the bill back for changes upon review.The new constituency map allocates 122 seats for the metropolitan region that includes Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province, up from the previous 112 seats. The decision is in line with the Constitutional Court’s 2014 ruling that the disparity in representation by population between the largest and the smallest constituencies be reduced to 2-to-1 from 3-to-1. Districts to be given new constituencies include Gangseo-gu and Gangnam-gu in Seoul and Yeonsu-gu in Incheon. Gyeonggi Province will now have eight more seats up for grabs, while Chungcheong Province will have one more.While the number of seats representing Busan is to remain 18, several districts will be redistributed, drawing protest from residents and preliminary candidates. North Gyeongsang Province will have two less seats. Jeolla and Gangwon provinces will have two and one less seats, respectively.Meanwhile, the opposition party members continued their filibuster against the counterterrorism bills that they claim would undermine civil rights and bestow politically charged power over to the National Intelligence Service. The ruling Saenuri Party has been criticizing the marathon debate, slamming the opposition for holding hostage what they call crucial for national security against terror attempts from North Korea.On Saturday, the Minjoo Party Rep. Jung Cheong-rae, the 17th speaker, became the latest to crack the record by talking for 11 hours and 39 minutes.On Sunday afternoon the filibuster hit the 100-hour mark. The Assembly speaker and two vice speakers who had been taking turns presiding over the plenary session briefly asked heads of standing committees to take their place, citing their weakened strength to sit through the debate. The spectators’ benches have also been filled with citizens coming to witness the rare scene.The opposition parties are intent on continuing with the filibuster until the antiterrorism bills are revised, or until the end of this extraordinary parliamentary period that ends March 10. The ruling Saenuri Party has been pressuring them to end it, citing imminently pending bills such as that for the electoral map.While the main parties have been meeting on the sidelines for a compromise, no deal has yet come out. The Minjoo Party demands a clause confirming the investigative right of the NIS be erased and for the Assembly’s Intelligence Committee to have stronger authority to screen and control the spy agency’s activities.

The bill's passage through the parliamentary committee has raised expectations that its final passage could finally come after 11 years of partisan bickering over it.Similar bills were scrapped in recent years as liberal lawmakers have shied away from the issue of the North's human rights out of concerns that it could harm inter-Korean relations.North Korea has long been accused of human rights abuses, ranging from holding political prisoners in concentration camps to torture and carrying out public executions.Still, the North has condemned the accusations as a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.","committee on friday passed ,parliamentary committee on friday ,friday passed bill ,bill south korean parliamentary ,friday passed bill on","['south korean', ""North Korea 's""]",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28163713  0.17630585

Kim Kwang-jin initiating the arguments, after parliamentary speaker Chung Ui-hwa decided to put the disputed bill to vote on his own authority.“This bill claims to prevent terrorism, but in fact justifies  surveillance over civilians,” said the seventh relay speaker Rep. Kim Je-nam of the Justice Party, starting her speech on Thursday morning. National Assembly speaker Chung Ui-hwa sits as Justice Party Rep. Kim Je-nam delivers her relay speech at the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapAccording to the National Assembly Act, the opposition bloc can continue their filibuster until March 10, the closing date of the current parliamentary session, in which case all pending bills will be on hold.But a more plausible scenario is that it will make compromises so as to make room to vote on the public election revision bill on Friday.Rival parties had made a much-delayed decision on Tuesday to put the redrawing plan of constituencies to a floor vote. It was the ruling party that agreed to compromise and prioritize the redrawing of the electoral map.But this hard-reached deal may possibly go to naught, if the opposition’s filibuster against the counterterrorism bill continues. Other government-led pending bills, such as the labor reform bills and the service industry development bill, also face further delay. “It is possible to temporarily halt the filibuster and vote , with the consent of parties and the parliamentary speaker,” said an official of the bill screening department.But given that it was Speaker Chung, a former Saenuri Party member, who brought the terrorism prevention bill to the floor for a vote, it is unlikely that he will allow this as it works in favor of the opposition. The opposition claims that the current bill includes a “toxic clause,” bestowing an almost unlimited power on the nation’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, to surveil civilians at will.The ruling party and the presidential house, on the other hand, argued that the bill is crucial to promote national security, especially amid rising military threats from North Korea.By Bae Hyun-jung","opposition faces electoral roadblock ,electoral roadblock the opposition ,opposition camp ongoing filibuster ,filibustering opposition faces electoral ,revised public election law",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48421794 -0.18803418

The Saenuri Party members of the Intelligence Committee approved the bill to be handed over to the plenary session without the attendance of opposition members.Earlier in the day, Chung told reporters that he deemed the failure to pass the bills as a “national crisis,” a situation in which the law allows the speaker to bypass parliamentary committee approval and bring the bills to the floor. The move heightened tension at the Assembly which had been embroiled in a months-long dispute over whether the security legislation would help the government prevent terrorism threat without undermining civil rights.  Opposition lawmakers gather to listen to the Minjoo Party of Korea Rep. Kim Kwang-jin’s filibuster against a counter-terrorism bill. YonhapThe counter-terrorism bill, authorized by Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Saenuri Party and among others, includes provisions that would overhaul the government’s approach to combating conventional and cyber terrorist threats by granting the intelligence agency greater surveillance power. According to Article 9 of the Counter-terrorism Act for Public and People’s Safety, the National Intelligence Service can collect financial transaction and telecommunications records of terrorism suspects. The Park Geun-hye administration and the Saenuri Party assert that the surveillance power is necessary to reinforce the government’s capability to fend off terrorist threats such as those from North Korea and the Islamic State militant group. They also argue that the law includes measures to prevent the NIS from abusing its power, such as the Article 5, 6 and 7, which stipulate that the counter-terrorism efforts are led by the Prime Minister’s office, not the NIS. But The Minjoo Party of Korea questions whether the new bill would be crucial to counter-terrorism efforts. “I don’t agree with the government and Saenuri Party’s argument that the lack of legislation has undermined counter-terrorism efforts,” said Rep. Lee Jong-kul, the party's floor leader. Citing the laws governing the NIS duties and other security laws, he noted that the current legal system grants the government enough authority to engage in counter-terrorism efforts. Article 3 of the NIS Act stipulates that the intelligence agency can collect information about terrorism. The Minjoo Party also argues that the NIS is an unreliable agency. The NIS has faced allegations that it deliberately interfered in the 2012 presidential election to swing the voters in favor of then president candidate Park Geun-hye. It also found itself embroiled in a surveillance scandal that led a NIS official to take his own life in 2015.“The best option for us is that the government should establish an independent organization that does not have the infamous reputation that the NIS has,” said professor Lee Man-jong of Howon University, who has studied terrorism and security. “The previous laws are designed to focus on reactive measures following terrorist attacks. What the current law aims to do is to focus on proactive measures that allow us to prevent attacks before they happen,” Lee said.By Yeo Jun-suk","assembly speaker decision tuesday ,antiterrorism bill to vote ,motivated ruling party lawmakers ,ruling party lawmakers moved ,party lawmakers moved quickly","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Chung Ui - hwa']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54432458  0.31706458

Kim Kwang-jin of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea starts a filibuster against the antiterrorism bill at the afternoon parliamentary plenary session on Tuesday as National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa  watches . According to the hard-fought deal, the number of parliamentary seats through direct elections will increase from 246 to 253 and that of proportional representative seats decreased from 54 to 47.The redrawing plan will be submitted to the National Election Commission and then to the parliamentary plenary session for a final vote as early as this Friday or next Monday at the latest.“The agreement could no longer be delayed as the elections are drawing close,” Saenuri chief Kim told reporters.The two parties had earlier reached a consensus on the allocation of parliamentary seats but the ruling party was adamant that other pending bills on labor reforms, service industry development and terror prevention should be passed first.Pressed by the imminent elections and growing public criticism, however, Kim gave way and put the constituency bill on top of the list, in defiance of the party mainstream.“The party’s official stance remains that the bills concerning the people’s livelihood should come first,” said the party’s vice floor leader Rep. Cho Won-jin earlier in the morning, before Kim closed the deal with his opposition counterpart. “No one, not even the chairman, should act against the party’s official stance.”The nation’s electoral map lost its legal binding force as of Dec. 31 last year, due to the Constitutional Court ruling back in 2014 which decided that the constituencies should be reallocated due to unequal representation of voters.Meanwhile, parliamentary Speaker Chung invoked his exclusive authority to submit an antiterrorism bill to a full floor vote in the afternoon plenary session.The speaker, who had formerly refrained from using his power, recently concluded that the current diplomatic and military situations constituted an emergency situation, officials said.The Minjoo Party set out to filibuster the plan. The party claims that the bill gives the nation‘s spy agency excessive investigative power.“President Park Geun-hye’s forceful communication style has been passed on to the legislature leader,” said floor leader Kim Gi-juhn in a statement, vowing to deter its passage.“The underlying intention of the bill is to empower the National Intelligence Service to interfere in the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, at the will of the administration.”The revised National Assembly Act stipulates that a request for a filibuster supported by at least one-third of attending lawmakers can be submitted to the speaker, who is then obliged to allow it. The filibuster ends automatically when the legislative session ends. The ongoing extraordinary session is slated to close on March 11. The filibuster clause was introduced in May 2012 as part of the Assembly Advancement Act.The Democratic Party, the precursor to the Minjoo, had previously made the same request in 2013 in protest to a confirmation of an appointed audit chief but was denied by then-Speaker Kang Chang-hee who said it did not apply in cases related to personnel matters.

In the meantime, the parties agreed to make their best efforts to pass the contentious bills and finish redrawing of constituencies,” said Saenuri floor spokeswoman Rep. Moon Jeong-lim. President Park Geun-hye, meanwhile, is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Assembly on Tuesday. Kim Sung-woo, senior presidential secretary of public affairs, said Sunday that the president would call for bipartisan efforts to address security threat from the North and sign the pending bills into law.Senior presidential secretary of public affairs Kim Sung-woo told reporters at Cheong Wa Dae that President Park Geun-hye would deliver a speech at the National Assembly on Tuesday. While the parties have neared a compromise on the bills about North Korea human rights abuses, they remain at odds over legislation related to the government’s initiatives such as labor reform, business regulation on service industries and counterterrorism measures. Though the Minjoo Party accepted the president’s plan to speak, its spokesman Rep. Kim Sung-soo said the rival parties should reschedule the plan because it would clash with prearranged events, such as parliamentary speeches from each of the party’s whips.The main opposition also maintained that it would not approve the three sets of legislation unless the Saenuri Party agreed to include provisions in the bills to ensure temporary workers’ job security, address concerns about medical privatization and prevent excessive surveillance power for intelligence agencies. On the electoral rules, the parties agreed on the number of parliamentary seats between those elected from local constituencies and proportional representation. They tentatively decided to allocate 253 seats to representative from local constituencies and 47 to those chosen from proportional representation. The two-day parliamentary inquiry is expected to see all-out partisan wrangling over the government decision to shut down the Gaeseong industrial park following Pyongyang’s nuclear test and rocket launch, which Seoul and its allies view as a disguised ballistic missile test. While the Saenuri Party hailed the decision as an inevitable call to cut off a source of funds for the North’s nuclear programs, the Minjoo Party and other minor liberal parties slammed the government for undermining the two Korea’s reconciliation efforts and hurting South Korean businesses in the complex. By Yeo Jun-suk","elections kicking off monday ,parliamentary sessions this week ,april general elections kicking ,addressing the assembly monthlong ,assembly monthlong extraordinary session","['the National Assembly', 'Assembly']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65017885 -0.0408242

National security is the most important agenda related to the country’s survival,” said Saenuri Party chairman Kim Moo-sung. Calling North Korea an “unpredictable” and “rogue” regime that threatens international security, Kim urged pacifist liberals to abandon “idealist” belief in the North and join in passing pending security laws related to counterterrorism measures and human right conditions in the impoverished country. Kim’s hawkish rhetoric was echoed by other senior Saenuri lawmakers. Saenuri whip Rep. Won Yu-chul noted that the government should cut off the “vicious cycle,” blaming the cross-border project for funding the North’s nuclear programs. The complex has been a source of hard currency for the isolated nation. Members of inter-Korean cooperation associations hold a press conference opposing the shutdown of Gaeseong industrial park, at the National Assembly on Thursday. Liberal parties, however, warned that the closure of Gaeseong will worsen already strained inter-Korean relations, highlighting that the venue epitomized the two Koreas’ reconciliation efforts despite political turbulence and arm clashes in the past. They claimed Gaeseong should have remained the final card to play against the North.“We strongly oppose the closure,” said opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea whip Rep. Lee Jong-gul. “It is a miraculous place where small steps towards unification take place every day.  destroys the small steps that will eventually build up to the larger result of unification,” Lee said.Describing the decision to shut down as politically motivated, the floor leader accused the government and the Saenuri Party of appealing to conservative voters and swaying moderates into conservative camps ahead of the April general elections. Mindful of the accusations, the Saenuri Party leader reportedly warned in a closed-door meeting that the party members should stay away from politicizing the North Korean issue during their election campaign. “Never use  for the sake of your election campaign,” Kim was quoted as telling attending members. The conservative party has often been accused of using tensions with North Korea to build up sense of security among voters for sake of drumming up their support ratings. Other minor liberal parties joined the fray. Justice Party and the newly established People’s Party highlighted that the closure of Gaeseong would bring more harm than good in preventing the North’s nuclear ambitions.“North Korea will not halt nuclear weapons and missiles unless it sees external threats go away,” Justice Party’s chairwoman Rep. Shim Sang-jung said. “Though we need to take stern measure against the North, I doubt the closure is the best option we have now,” Shim said. People’s Party Unification Committee member Kim Geun-sik, a former professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said that the closure will bring more economic setbacks to the South than to the North.“ has a self-inflicting impact. North Korea can offset economic costs because it can divert workers from the joint complex to Chinese factories where North Korean workers can enjoy better compensation,” Kim said.

In a rare plenary session held during the Lunar New Year holiday, a total of 243 lawmakers voted in favor of the resolution that demands that the government imposes robust sanctions on the North for violating the United Nations’ resolution to ban Pyongyang from developing nuclear programs. “North Korea’s decision to test long-range missile is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution and a reckless provocation that poses a threat to the peace and security of the international community,” the parliamentary statement said.  It also called for efforts to renew inter-Korean talks that have been stalled in the wake of the North’s fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6. Out of 293 lawmakers, 248 attended the session to cast their ballots. Five lawmakers abstained.The text of the resolution was endorsed by the assembly’s foreign affairs and unification committee on Monday, a day after the North said that it had put a satellite into space from a rocket launched on Earth. South Korea and the United States viewed the launch as Pyongyang’s attempt to test its ballistic missile capability. Meanwhile, the leadership of the ruling Saenuri Party and opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea met on Wednesday to hammer out an agreement over a new electoral map and pending contentious bills related to labor reform, business regulation, counter-terrorism measures and North Korea’s human rights promotion.With some two months left before the April general elections, rival parties remain deadlocked over the redrawing of constituencies. Several preliminary candidates, particularly in rural areas, are expected to have their electoral district adjusted accordingly.By Yeo Jun-suk","condemns north korea rocket ,assembly condemns north korea ,condemns north korea recent ,of 243 lawmakers voted ,on wednesday endorsed resolution","['the National Assembly', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47692806  0.49376667

The National Assembly holds a vote on the corporate revitalization bill on Thursday afternoon. The ruling Saenuri Party and The Minjoo Party of Korea had agreed late last month to put the corporate bill, dubbed the “one-shot bill,” to a full plenary vote on Jan. 29.The process was canceled at the last minute as the Minjoo Party insisted the revision bill of the Public Official Election Act to redraw the nation’s electoral map be processed en bloc, if not first.“We have decided to wrap up the electoral map issue and process the pending bills in a rational order, even at the risk of delaying the general meeting,” said floor leader Rep. Lee Jong-kul.Amid growing resentment for the sluggish legislation, however, the main opposition party decided to hasten the corporate bill. “I demand that we all try  so as to prevent the public’s aversion to the parliament,” said Kim Jong-in, the Minjoo Party’s emergency committee chairman, prior to the plenary session.Floor leader Lee also said that his party would cooperate in the vote, as long as the parliamentary speaker and the ruling party agreed to finalize the electoral map by next Friday.Speaker Chung Ui-hwa, while urging parties to vote on the much-deferred bill, underlined that each lawmaker should cast a vote based on his or her own belief, not according to the party’s instruction.“Parties should refrain from setting a binding party platform, unless the issue is critical enough to decide the nation’s fate or the party’s maintenance,” Chung said.The corporate revitalization bill, dubbed the “one-shot bill,” was motioned in July last year to encourage preemptive corporate restructuring by alleviating regulations for small-sum mergers and acquisitions processes.It is to be applied, within the limitation of three years at maximum, to insolvent companies planning to reorganize themselves due to oversupply in the industry.The opposition camp had claimed until recently that conglomerates should be excluded from such benefits, citing the possible abuse for the sake of management succession.But it yielded the condition in a compromising gesture, demanding that the ruling party make equivalent concessions in other disputed bills, such as the North Korean human rights bill.The passage of the corporate bill is expected to be especially beneficial to local steelmakers and shipbuilders that have been reeling under the sluggish global economy and rising competition from China.By Bae Hyun-jung","delayed corporate revitalization bill ,assembly on thursday passed ,much delayed corporate revitalization ,national assembly on thursday ,delayed corporate revitalization",['the National Assembly'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3813355  -0.00910022

Ahn Cheol-soo was officially launched Tuesday, pledging to emerge as the third-biggest party in the April general election and break the country’s two party duopoly.  Newly elected cochairmen Ahn and Rep. Chun Jung-bae, the former chairman of the People’s Reform Party, announced that they would represent an alternative to the conservative ruling Saenuri Party and The Minjoo Party of Korea, the main opposition party. “Today the People’s Party declares an end to the old politics. We will embark on a journey of political reform that no one has ever taken. We will fight against the established two party system,” Ahn said at the party caucus. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  and Rep. Chun Jung-bae  attend the party’s caucus in Daejeon on Tuesday. YonhapVowing to prevent the Saenuri Party gaining a supermajority in the election, the former presidential candidate described the parliamentary election as an event that would make or break his five-year political career. “I will stake everything I have on the election,” he said. But the prospects of the new party as the third-biggest political bloc are uncertain, as it faces challenges in resonating with moderate voters amid its struggle to build a parliamentary body with negotiating power. As of Tuesday, the fledging party had a total of 17 incumbent lawmakers, three seats short of the number required to establish a negotiating group. If it forms a negotiating group, the party can receive government subsidies and exercise tie-breaking votes between the major parties.While other independent lawmakers and liberal heavyweights, such as former presidential candidate Chung Dong-young, hesitated to join the party, the new political group suffered faltering support, further dampened by several party members’ political blunders.  A survey by local pollster Realmeter found Tuesday that the People’s Party had a support rating of 13.1 percent, down from its peak of 20.7 percent two weeks ago. The ruling Saenuri Party and The Minjoo Party of Korea recorded support ratings of 40.6 and 26.9 percent, respectively. Experts said the new party should equip itself with more specific agenda than those previously espoused by Ahn. The businessman-turned-politician’s slogan “new politics” has been accused of lacking substance. “Although Ahn touted creating new politics, I don’t think the voters grasp what the new politics will be. The party needs to specify its political agenda and accept more renowned figures before fully beginning the election campaign in March,” said Choi Jin, the chairman of the Institute of Presidential Leadership.  Last month, the party leadership and staff found themselves at the center of controversy over a remark about the nation’s first President Seungman Rhee and the former first lady Lee Hee-ho, a wife of the late President Kim Dae-joong.Senior party member Han Sang-jin told reporters on Jan 14 that the Korean people should recognize Rhee as the nation’s founding father. Critics denounced the remark, saying that Han overlooked the first president’s ruthless suppression of the democratic movement in the 1960s. The party came under ethical scrutiny on Jan. 27, when a media report claimed the party officials had secretly recorded a conversation with the former president’s widow and intentionally exaggerated her words of encouragement.By Yeo Jun-suk","officially launched tuesday pledging ,party duopoly newly elected ,launched tuesday pledging ,launched tuesday pledging to ,was officially launched tuesday","['Ahn Cheol', 'Ahn', 'Chun Jung - bae', 'the People ’s Reform Party', 'Saenuri Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2942521   0.02013498

Ahn Cheol-soo, who is spearheading the launch of a new opposition party, also lambasted the latest move and said that the Dec. 28 deal between Seoul and Japan on the WWII sex slavery issue must be annulled.“It is not a deal that is ‘final and irreversible’,” Ahn said, referring to the two government’s phrasing of the agreement.“While  Abe and the government is continuing to release ludicrous statements, President Park Geun-hye is not saying anything back …Whose president is she, turning her back against the people’s pain. It is an embarrassing international humiliation,” Ahn said. Groups that represent the surviving victims of sex slavery have been opposing the agreement, which they say lacks prior consultation.

But now that the current administration is entering its fourth year in office, the issue appears to be adding to the dispute between the government and liberal civic groups.Their conflicts are largely related to economic strategist Kim Jong-in, who recently joined The Minjoo Party of Korea. Kim was best known for spearheading the economic democratization campaign for then-candidate Park Geun-hye in the 2012 presidential election. In 1987, Kim famously led the move to include term limits in the revised Constitution as a lawmaker, although the scope of his contribution is still debated. By having him on board, the Saenuri Party was able to quell much of voters’ skepticism of its sincerity in democratizing the economy.The president and the ruling party are now accused of returning to the conservative way, focusing on growth and neglecting what once had been its flagship campaign slogan. Last week, adding fuel to the debate was the Fair Trade Commission‘s report summing up the Park administration’s achievements in terms of economic democratization.“The current government has successfully legislated 13 out of its 20 policy targets over the past three years,” the antitrust agency said in a press release. “This was a result that no previous government had achieved before.” President Park Geun-hye cheers with participants at a meeting with business representatives to mark the New Year at Coex in southern Seoul on Jan. 6. YonhapThe key accomplishments included a ban on cross-shareholding and conglomerate monopolization, as well as a reinforced protection system for small and medium-sized businesses and suppliers.The government has also made it clear that it will deal strictly with conglomerate owners’ crimes and hand down actual sentences without a pardon, the agency added.But this favorable assessment immediately led to fierce backlash from progressive civic groups.“The Park Geun-hye administration’s economic democratization story is nothing but a fraud,” said the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy in a press conference.Among the government’s 18 election campaigns related to economic democratization, only two have been put to practice, which are the ban on cross-shareholding and the reinforced regulations on nonbanking capital involvement in banking business, it claimed.“Even the banking business deregulation has not been properly implemented as the government, while imposing the restrictions, also alleviated some other rules for large capital bases, citing the introduction of Internet-only banks,” an official of the PSPD said.The general deregulation made it easier for conglomerates to enter the banking industry and extend their monopolies, according to the civic group.Also, the release of controversial businessmen such as SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won and Hanwha Group vice chairman Kim Hyun-joong last year showed that the president has failed to abide by her previous pledge to deal strictly with conglomerates’ economic wrongdoings, the official added.The Minjoo Party, which is expected to underline the economic democratization slogan ahead of the April general election, has refrained from commenting on the FTC-PSPD conflict.“Tolerant growth will be possible only when economic democratization is implemented,” said Kim Jong-in, at the party’s election committee meeting on Monday.By Bae Hyun-jung","fourth year in office ,the ruling conservative camp ,scrap over economic democratization ,during the 2012 elections ,ruling conservative camp to",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53340501  0.3443355

Ahn Cheol-soo and People’s Reform Party’s leader Rep. Chun Jung-bae announced they would build a new opposition party that could rival the ruling Saenuri Party.Ahn and Chun have pushed to build their own liberal groups since defecting from The Minjoo Party of Korea last year. Both left in protest against the Minjoo Party leader Rep. Moon Jae-in, who has vowed to resign as early as next month. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo , co-chairman of the People‘s Party Han Sang-jin, Rep. Chun Jung-bae, co-chairman of the People’s Party Yoon Yeo-jun and Rep. Kim Han-gil hold hands for a photo session upon announcing their merge at the National Assembly on Monday. Yonhap“We agreed to merge to prevent the Saenuri Party’s overwhelming victory in the elections,” they said in a statement. While planning to officially declare the establishment of a new party at a national caucus slated for early February, they are yet to decide who will lead the coalition and how to elect the leadership. But they have agreed to use ""People’s Party"" as the name. The new party noted that they would expand efforts to merge with other minor liberal groups. Among them are those led by Rep. Park Joo-sun, who Chun had agreed to form an alliance with, and former South Jeolla Province Gov. Park Joon-yung. With the new party having secured a total of 16 incumbent lawmakers so far, it is now four seats short of the number required to form a parliamentary negotiating body. A negotiating body is entitled to government subsidies and can exercise tie-breaking votes between the major parties. The Minjoo Party and the Saenuri Party downplayed the political significance of the coalition that aims to build the third-largest political party. Of the 300 parliamentary seats, the Saenuri Party holds 156 seats with the Minjoo Party and the Justice Party having 110 and five seats, respectively.  The remaining 22 occupied seats are held by independents, including those aligned with the planned People's Party.Kim Jong-in, who has been designated to lead the Minjoo Party until the election post-Moon, was quoted as saying that the party members “should not worry too much"" because the coalition is ""unlikely to promptly create a big synergy.The Saenuri Party, which aims to win at least 180 seats in the April race, dismissed the merger as an opportunistic alliance among liberal parties in the run-up to the election. The conservative party derided Ahn for “following the same tactics former liberal parties had used” to boost popularity by merging with one another before the elections. “What Ahn has been touting as new politics is nothing but old-fashioned politics. The coalition has delivered yet another disappointment to the people who expect a new alternative role from the opposition parties,” said Saenuri Party’s spokesman Rep. Kim Young-woo.

Labor Minister Lee Ki-keon speaks at a press conference in Sejong City on Friday. YonhapTo secure a fair evaluation, the assessment will be carried out with standards set by the company and relevant labor unions or workers’ representatives. The guidelines also state that companies will be able to change employment rules without due consent from laborers in cases where changes are “deemed reasonable.” It said such cases will be determined based on whether the existing system disadvantages the employees or when there is a need to change the system to reflect the overall industry, after ample efforts to discuss the issue with labor. The ministry deemed it crucial to allow such leeway for businesses in order to introduce its flagship “peak wage” system that reduces the salaries of workers over a certain age in exchange for lifting the age of retirement.The nation’s two large umbrella unions slammed the announcement, which they said had no legal grounds.“We strongly demand the government immediately discard the guidelines that deepen employment instability and aggravate the working conditions of the laborers,” the Federation of Korean Trade Unions responded. FKTU has been vowing an all-out war against the government’s labor reform moves after withdrawing from last year’s tripartite deal citing the administration’s lack of will to compromise. Their move was stoked by the ministry’s unilateral release of the draft guidelines on Dec. 30 that they claimed was a breach of their agreement. The government, for their part, contends that the labor union has repeatedly denied their offer to follow-up talks.“No matter how much the government argues that the guidelines are not aimed at easier layoffs, enabling  to fire underperforming workers based on government guidelines alone is providing them another way to make easier layoffs,” they said.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions also held a press conference denouncing the ministry later in the day.","labor ministry on friday ,workers drawing vehement opposition ,friday released the final ,ministry on friday released ,final labor reform guidelines",['the Employment and Labor Ministry'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51415968  0.1809525

YonhapA spate of bills have been proposed since the 9/11 attacks in 2001 involving steps to preclude physical and cyberterrorist acts and trail the potential perpetrators’ money trail and network. But they have never been put to a floor vote due chiefly to the resistance of the opposition camp, which is concerned it would make way for the scandal-ridden NIS to boost its spying activities on civilians and political maneuvering in particular during election seasons. The legislation drive has been picking up momentum following the surge of the Islamic State and especially the jihadist group’s brazen attacks in Paris last November and more recently Jakarta, which incurred injuries on a South Korean tourist for the first time. “We can’t sit idly, knowing nothing about when and where a contingency would break out,” Saenuri Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, a member of the National Assembly’s intelligence committee, told reporters after the gathering, relaying the administration’s request for the opposition’s cooperation. In an apparent fresh bid to intensify pressure on the critics, the NIS unveiled during the session that the seven migrant workers deported for extremist activities were found to have joined the IS after their departure. The seven were among 51 foreigners who have since 2010 been expelled for their links with international terror organizations, the agency reported, raising its urgent need for antiterrorism eavesdropping and finance-tracking operations. “The passage of antiterrorism bills is now even more vital given the possibilities for a spread of terror threats to East Asia in the aftermath of the Indonesia case,” Vice Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said at the meeting. “Last week’s incidents were committed by terrorists who aimed for soft targets in everyday settings such as tourists and thus made it difficult to sense their acts in advance. That means our response, too, should be more detailed and sophisticated.” Despite the unabated controversy, the ruling party left little room for negotiation with the opposition, with chief policymaker Rep. Kim Jung-hoon saying it is “so natural for the NIS to take the driver’s seat, as safety and security form the basis of the antiterrorism law.” Kim Soo-min, the NIS’ second deputy director, criticized opponents for focusing on undercutting the agency while turning a blind eye to public safety. “The NIS is not interested in reinforcing its authority or status at all,” he said. “We’ve been pushing for bills with sincerity that we will fulfill our duties of protecting the people from atrocious terror threats.”By Shin Hyon-hee","party hosted meeting wednesday ,camp pushes antiterrorism bill ,review possible terror threats ,ruling camp pushes antiterrorism ,ruling party are ramping","['the Saenuri Party', 'the Foreign Ministry', 'National Intelligence Service', 'Islam']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48244402  0.31136048

Moon Jae-in said Tuesday that he would promptly step down as chairman before the April general elections, pledging to hand over power to the committee dealing with the election campaign. While reiterating that he would forgo his bid for the upcoming elections, the chairman of the Minjoo Party of Korea urged scattered opposition groups to merge into one liberal party, highlighting that a coalition could prevent the ruling Saenuri Party from seizing the legislative majority in the next elections.“Despite all the efforts to undermine my leadership, I have stuck to my principles and managed to achieve party reform. What I haven’t achieved is party unity. I believe that my resignation is necessary to pave the way for unity,” Moon said in a press conference at the National Assembly. Moon noted that he would leave his post “as soon as possible,” as the election committee gets ready to take over the leadership. Party spokesman Rep. Do Jong-hwan said Moon would resign no later than Feb. 8. Moon said he would soon work with senior members to select a new leadership. It was widely expected that the incumbent leadership would announce its resignation this week and transfer power to election committee head Kim Jong-in.The party’s dissenters have demanded Moon’s resignation amid staggering party popularity and worsening factional feuds in the wake of its crushing defeat in the 2014 by-elections. Since assuming the chairmanship last February, Moon saw a total of 19 lawmakers leave the party in protest. One of the latest was Rep. Cho Kyung-tae, who announced his defection just hours after the press conference. Cho was said to be considering joining the ruling Saenuri Party.Moon’s resignation was nonetheless expected to discourage further defections. Except for Rep. Park Jie-won, who is expected to leave this week, other dissenters such as Rep. Lee Yoon-suk have begun reconsidering their decision to quit, according to sources with knowledge on the matter. Minjoo Party of Korea chairman Rep. Moon Jae-in announces his resignation during his New Year statement at the National Assembly, Tuesday. YonhapHighlighting the party’s unity, Moon suggested a coalition plan with minority opposition parties such as Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo’s People’s Party, Rep. Chun Jung-bae’s People’s Reform Party and the minor opposition Justice Party. The merging with the latter two, Moon said, has been under discussion.“Opposition groups must join forces and stay united . Time is running out. I urge Chun’s party and the Justice Party to take the merging plan to the next level and discuss it at a public forum,” Moon said. Ahn’s party has remained against joining hands with Moon, while Chun’s party has reserved judgement. The Justice Party, on the other hand, hinted at the possibility of working with the Minjoo Party on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, Moon denounced President Park Geun-hye for mismanaging challenges on economic and security fronts. He said that Park should take the responsibility for worsening the nation’s fledging economy, failing to monitor North Korea’s nuclear tests and reaching a controversial agreement over comfort women.He also blasted Park for violating the rule of separation of powers by attempting to bypass the legislative procedure for the passage of pending labor reform bills. On Monday, Park urged the public to take part in a petition to mount pressure on the lawmakers to do their jobs.“The nation’s economy and the people’s livelihood are at their worst. Our democracy is now at stake and there is no end in sight for the two Koreas’  relations. But the president still blames the Assembly without reflecting on her own failure,” Moon said.By Yeo Jun-suk","april general elections pledging ,upcoming elections the chairman ,quit soon main opposition ,opposition groups to merge ,jae in said tuesday","['Moon Jae - in', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57095039  0.5748499

Ahn Cheol-soo’s party has suggested postponing the April general elections, which observers said was a strategy that would help his electoral chances despite its low feasibility.In the best case, he may gain some time for his forthcoming centrist party to realign itself before the political race. Otherwise, he may at least distance himself from the leading parties -- which have been under fire for failing to redraw the electoral map in time.“With the constituency redrawing up in the air, preliminary candidates, especially political rookies, don’t even know where to conduct their campaigns,” Rep. Moon Byung-ho, vice chairman of Ahn’s party preparation committee, said Thursday in a radio interview.“This is clearly discrimination, as incumbent lawmakers have a strong network in their conventional local districts.”The close aide to Ahn also claimed that the current 45-day gap between the parliamentary election and the actual inauguration leads to an unnecessary legislative vacuum.The party suggested postponing the election date from the current Apr. 13 by about a month, citing the need to guarantee the people’s right of choice and the potential candidates’ right to run for office.The greatest beneficiary of the delay, should it be realized, would be Ahn’s People’s Party, which is scheduled to kick off officially on Feb. 2, just two months before elections. Minister of Interior Hong Yun-sik  attends the opening ceremony of the fair election support center for the April parliamentary elections on Wednesday. Yonhap“This unprecedented invalidation of constituencies is largely attributable to the powerful bipartisan cartel and would never have happened had there been a vocal third party,” the party said earlier in a statement.The party took aim at the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, which have failed to narrow their differences on the electoral map, eventually letting 246 constituencies lose legal effect from January. The debate was prolonged into an extraordinary parliamentary session last week, but with little to no result.Despite their own doldrums, the major parties shrugged off the proposal.“Ahn should first elucidate his stance on the constituency redrawing, instead of asking for an election delay,” said Saenuri chief Rep. Kim Moo-sung at the Supreme Council meeting Thursday.The party’s secretary-general Hwang Jin-ha pointed out that postponing the election would violate the National Assembly act, which states that the parliamentary elections have to be held on the first Wednesday of the last 50 days of the current term.Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the Minjoo Party, too, reiterated in a radio interview that elections have always been held on the scheduled day, even in wartime.By Bae Hyun-jung","proposes delaying april polls ,delaying april polls ,delaying april polls independent ,ahn proposes delaying april ,before the political race",['Ahn Cheol'],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32265997  0.59994566

Ahn Cheol-soo’s political group Sunday convened the first major gathering of founding members and key leadership, accelerating its efforts to build a new opposition party ahead of the April general elections.   With 1,978 members and eight incumbent lawmakers attending the event in Seoul, the group forged a consensus over party platforms and key regulations. Ahn’s new “People’s Party,” its provisional name in English, is slated for launch on Feb. 2.Under the slogan of “bold change for the future,” the party vowed to prioritize the people’s livelihoods over ideological principles and pledged to emerge as an alternative to the establishment parties by reaching out to both liberal and conservative voters.  “We will bring an end to the era of ideological partisanship and regional division. We will usher in an era of new politics that can embrace reform-minded liberals and conservatives,” said the party’s founding committee in a statement.The convention elected the leadership to prepare for the party establishment. Former Health Minister Yoon Yeo-joon and Seoul National University professor Han Sang-jin would steer the party in the run-up to the official launch, while Ahn would support the endeavor without holding an official post.  Rep. Ahn-soo attends the convention for his new political group. Yonhap    Despite the party’s effort to emerge as the third-largest political group in the elections, it is appeared to face some challenges over how to recruit new faces. On Friday, the party withdrew membership of some newcomers, who were found to be embroiled in a graft scandal.Among them are former cabinet members and a prosecutor. Former Agriculture Minister Huh Sin-haeng and prosecutor Han Seung-chul were indicted on bribery charges in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Former Defense Minister Kim Dong-shin had faced similar accusation in 2004. Kim and Han were found innocent. Critics have accused Ahn of faltering on his pledge to “change old-fashioned politics.” Before he defected from the main opposition the Minjoo Party of Korea last December, Ahn demanded the party take a zero-tolerance policy against the lawmakers who were charged with graft. He urged the party to deprive the lawmakers of an opportunity to be nominated for the elections, a tough restriction than that of the Minjoo Party’s reform committee. The committee suggested that those lawmakers should be banned from nomination when they were found guilty for their charges. Ahn first entered politics in 2012 as a fresh figure to overturn the presidential election. After months of campaigning, he gave up his candidacy and united with then-Democratic United Party candidate Rep. Moon Jae-in.Even after he joined the opposition camp as an independent lawmaker and forming the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, Ahn continued to remain at odds with the party leadership and ended up announcing his defection last month.By Yeo Jun-suk","political group sunday convened ,for his new party ,soo political group sunday ,convention for his new ,his new party","['Ahn Cheol', 'Seoul', 'ahn ’s', 'People ’s Party']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4758397   0.42488509

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivers a speech during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Le Bourget, France, on Dec. 10. AFP-YonhapBut the domestic public also started viewing him differently ― with his current term set to end in December this year, his remarks were seen to be political.If he does decide to join the presidential race after his U.N. tenure, it is expected to raise the chances of the party he affiliates himself with. Unlike Ahn, who is without a specific regional foothold, Ban is a living hero in his home turf of Chungcheong Province, which usually holds sway votes in elections.In the New Year’s public survey conducted by local pollsters Media Research, Research & Research and Korea Research, Ban stood at 27.4 percent, 23.3 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively, in approval ratings among potential presidential candidates.The corresponding figures for ruling party leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung and the opposition party head Rep. Moon Jae-in, as well as independent lawmaker Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, all remained in the 10 percent range.Despite the overwhelming competition, Kim rolled out the red carpet for the former diplomat.“Ban would make an excellent  candidate and I may even reach out to scout him after the general elections,” Kim said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo.Ban, however, has different views with the ruling camp on a number of key issues, especially in inter-Korean relations.“Communication is the one and only tool to solve the Korean peninsula’s problems,” he said last May upon announcing his thwarted plan to visit Gaeseong Industrial Complex.His tone was clearly more temperate than that of President Park Geun-hye, who pledged to “deal sternly with North Korea’s provocations.”The Minjoo Party, on the other hand, was taken aback by what seemed to be a sign of Ban befriending Saenuri.Pyo Chang-won, a celebrated forensic psychologist who recently joined the party, claimed Ban was able to rise to his current status partly due to the Korea-Japan historical disputes. He also pointed out that it was the sincere election campaign run by the liberal government of Roh Moo-hyun that helped him.Minjoo Party leader Moon was gentler.“Ban has his roots in our party and we firmly believe that he will stand with us once his current term in the U.N. ends,” he said.Amid the tug-of-war between domestic parties, Ban has so far remained reticent over his political plans.Last year, Ban received good press over his role in the international forum, especially over the Paris agreement on climate change. As the U.N.’s chief official, he was praised for having pulled the right strings on the U.S. and China to elicit their active participation in the deal.His key goal during this last year in office is to make his presence in the inter-Korean relations and realize his unattained visit to North Korea.If he is to enter the presidential race in 2017 and win, Ban will become the second among former U.N. secretary-generals to become a state leader.Kofi Annan, who held two consecutive terms from 1997-2006, was suggested as a powerful candidate to Ghana’s next presidency, but largely remained in the nongovernmental field.Kurt Josef Waldheim, secretary-general from 1972-1981, was elected Austrian president in 1985, but he faced international controversy over his earlier wartime service as an intelligence officer.By Bae Hyun-jung","of new centrist political ,new centrist political party ,new centrist political ,the ruling saenuri party ,centrist political party","['Ahn Cheol', 'United Nations', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Ban']",18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79246086  0.54634333

The current electoral map became invalid by the end of 2015.For the first time in history, candidates seeking parliamentary seats in the 20th National Assembly are jockeying for position ahead of elections without exactly knowing the constituencies.The rival parties are required to redraw electoral districts as the Constitutional Court ruled in October 2014 that the electoral map was unconstitutional, citing unequal representation.The court said that the population differences between electoral districts should be reduced to two-to-one, noting the most populous electoral districts outweigh the least populous three seats to one.National Assembly Speaker Chung Ui-hwa has urged the rival parties to reach a settlement and warned that he has no other choice but to ask a committee under the nation's election watchdog to make the decision instead.Chung said he plans to exercise his authority to send a new electoral constituency bill to the floor at a parliamentary plenary session on Friday and forcibly put it to a vote.Under the National Assembly Act, a National Assembly speaker can table a bill in a plenary session in the event of a natural disaster, state emergency or agreement between rival parties.The subcommittee under the National Election Commission, however, failed last week to agree on which electoral districts should be selected for readjustment, further dimming prospects.Political analysts expect that it is very unlikely that the bill will be passed due to the differences of opinion between the ruling Saenuri Party and the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea.In an aim to come up with a breakthrough, Chung once again convened a meeting between Chairman Kim Moo-sung of the Saenuri Party and his counterpart from the Minjoo Party, Moon Jae-in, on Monday.The Minjoo Party, which changed its name from the New Politics Alliance for Democracy  last week, is also faced with a deepening factional feud.The crisis was aggravated by Kim Han-gil, a co-founder, quitting his party Sunday, dealing another blow to the embattled party.""I will dedicate myself to creating a new political order from scratch and winning the general elections ,"" Kim said in a news conference at the National Assembly.Kim's announcement comes after the high-profile departure of Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo, who announced his departure last month. Ahn, the founder of the nation's largest anti-virus software firm Ahnlab Co., co-founded the NPAD after merging Kim's main opposition Democratic Party with his supporters. Ahn jointly shared the party's top post with Kim for four months.Political analysts are keen on whether Kim will join Ahn's new party and whether the new party will threaten the Minjoo Party and take the role of the main opposition party.When asked whether he will join Ahn's new party, Kim said he will discuss the issue with him but expected a stream of similar desertions from the Minjoo Party.Reps. Chun Jung-bae and Park Joo-sun, who earlier left the party, also said that they are willing to consider partnerships with Ahn.The governing Saenuri Party, which seems confident of winning the elections, is also stuck with infighting over party nominations.Party leader Kim and the faction loyal to President Park Geun-hye have been mired in the feud over a deal on the nomination system. The deal, struck between party leader Kim and his opposition counterpart, Moon, calls for the selection of candidates by taking into account opinion polls through mobile phones.Some ruling-party lawmakers have strongly opposed the plan.","elections mired in uncertainty ,general elections in april ,general elections mired ,electoral map became invalid ,history candidates seeking parliamentary",[],18,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.84634006 -0.17590754

Ahn, along with Kim, founded the NPAD in 2014.Kim pledged to realign the embattled opposition bloc and win in both the general elections and presidential vote, which are slated for April this year and December next year, while upbraiding the party for being “obsessed with factional politics,”“Now with a clean slate, we need to draw a new political map,” Kim, who had been regarded as a leader of the party’s nonmainstream faction, told a press conference. “I will devote myself to achieving a government change and establishing a new political order.”The Minju Party`s former co-chairman Rep.

During the press conference, Kim blasted mainstreamers in the party for “pushing out” Ahn, whom he had “gone out of his way” to bring into the party in 2014.  Kim’s defection came after a months-long power struggle with Moon. Criticizing Moon for exhibiting “hegemonic leadership” that Kim said has encouraged dissenters to leave the party, Kim has stepped up pressure on Moon to resign. Undeterred by Kim’s defection, Moon expressed regret at his decision. Moon said he would take the defection as an “opportunity to reinforce the party” and vowed to recruit new faces in the run-up to the elections to fill up the constituencies vacated by defectors. It is not the first time that Kim left his party. In 2007, Kim bolted from the Minjoo Party’s forerunner, the Uri Party, alongside 22 fellow lawmakers. The defectors went on to create a new opposition United New Democratic Party, but suffered a crushing defeat in the 2007 presidential election. Given that Kim’s faction is considered to include about 10 Minjoo Party lawmakers, observers forecast that other dissenting lawmakers would follow Kim, a move that the pundits expected would eventually split up the main opposition party. Including Joo, a former member of the Minjoo Party’s Supreme Council who had hinted that he would quit the party on Jan 13, Park Jie-won and liberal heavyweights close to the late president Kim Dae-jung are reportedly considering leaving the party. Kim founded the NPAD with Ahn in 2014 and served as a cochairman until the party lost to the Saenuri Party in the 2014 July by-elections. Having worked as a novelist and a journalist, he was first elected as a lawmaker in 1996 general election.
