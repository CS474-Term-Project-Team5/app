0,0,0,South Koreans to march against president on Christmas Eve,"Large crowds of South Koreans were expected to march in the streets on Saturday, calling for the permanent removal of impeached President Park Geun-hye and extending the historically biggest protest movement in the country to Christmas Eve. The protest comes as a special prosecutor widens an investigation into a corruption scandal surrounding Park, which saw millions of people take to the streets before the country'...","Large crowds of South Koreans were expected to march in the streets on Saturday, calling for the permanent removal of impeached President Park Geun-hye and extending the historically biggest protest movement in the country to Christmas Eve. The protest comes as a special prosecutor widens an investigation into a corruption scandal surrounding Park, which saw millions of people take to the streets before the country's opposition-controlled parliament on Dec. 9 voted to impeach her. Organizers expected Saturday's rally in Seoul to be festive, but there was tension as Park's conservative supporters planned to gather in nearby streets. The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether Park should permanently step down or be reinstated. Her presidential powers are suspended until then, with the prime minister serving as the government caretaker. State prosecutors have accused Park of colluding with a longtime friend to extort money and favors from the country's largest companies and allow her confidante to manipulate government affairs from the shadows. They have now handed over their investigation to special prosecutor Park Young-soo, whose team on Saturday was planning to summon the president's arrested friend, Choi Soon-sil. Investigators earlier on Saturday summoned the country's former vice sports minister Kim Chong, who among other allegations is suspected of helping Choi wrest money and favors from Samsung, the country's largest business group.Samsung is under suspicion that it sponsored Choi to win government backing for a controversial merger deal between two affiliates last year that helped promote a father-to-son transfer of leadership and corporate wealth at the group.  Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong, son of ailing group chairman Lee Kun-hee, has apologized over the use of corporate funds to buy a horse for Choi's daughter, Yoora Chung, an equestrian athlete, but denied that Samsung sought favors from Choi or Park's administration. The National Pension Service, which was raided Wednesday, supported the merger between the two Samsung affiliates even though the fund's stake in one of the companies lost an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in value. Samsung is also one of the country's major companies that gave a combined 77.4 billion won  to two non-profit foundations Choi allegedly controlled and abused to expand her personal wealth.","christmas eve the protest ,to march against president ,against president on christmas ,president on christmas eve ,koreans to march against","['South Koreans', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",2,"[ 1.          1.          1.         ... -0.23052566  0.32452348

However, the flu is spreading quickly this time before the beginning of the vacation,"" said Jeong, adding that the H3N2 influenza virus is not deadly.The KCDC said the H3N2 virus does not cause serious complications, such as pneumonia, if treated well, urging more people to protect themselves by being vaccinated and taking anti-viral drugs, such as Tamiflu.","students with the influenza ,flu rapidly spreading among ,flu patients from elementary ,starting winter vacation ,flu rapidly spreading",[],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44593549  0.30315396

The documents are due by Friday.The court has also requested the parliament and the Justice Ministry to submit their own opinions on the case by next Monday. The process is to hear from each side before deliberating the case, with the court seeking the ministry’s views for legal matters.While the statements are not legally binding, it can be a reference for the court in deciding whether or not Park will become the first president in history to be legally pulled out of office.The nine justices of the Constitutional Court will decide whether to approve or reject the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. At least six out of nine justices must rule in favor for the parliament’s motion for Park to be impeachment.The National Assembly on Friday passed the motion in a landslide vote, buoyed by powerful public sentiment against the president for her alleged involvement in the corruption and influence-peddling scandal. The scandal is centered on her confidante and civilian friend Choi Soon-sil, who is believed to have used her relationship with Park to meddle in state affairs, embezzle public funds and coerce local entrepreneurs for her benefit.“I heard that Park was meeting those in legal circles, with whom she is discussing details related to the trial and independent counsel ,” an official from the ruling Saenuri Party told local media.The independent counsel Park Young-soo’s team on Tuesday said that it expects to finish reviewing the reports on the prosecution’s investigation this week, after which it will launch the investigation into the scandal.Park’s team is expected to investigate allegations raised by, or touched by the South Korean prosecutors. This includes proving bribery allegations against the president -- which the prosecution failed to dig deeper into -- and controversy surrounding her actions during the 2014 deadly sinking of the Sewol ferry.The investigation against President Park can also be a factor for the justices, who agreed on Monday to review all charges in the impeachment motion including abuse of authority and embezzlement. This would mean that a swift ruling would be unlikely. Judging from the 2004 impeachment trial of former President Roh Moo-hyun, it is likely other parties including civic groups would also submit their opinions on the case. Roh was accused of violating election law by publicly urging support for his party.But the move sparked a nationwide backlash, who viewed Roh’s impeachment as political retribution. At that time, groups like the Korean Bar Association and Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, opposed the impeachment. But some civic groups supported the parliament’s case.The reaction from the people took a completely different turn this year, as millions of citizens gathered in a protest to actually demand Park’s impeachment. The KBA and Minbyun had also welcomed the parliament’s decision Friday and demanded the Constitutional Court to impeach Park.“The  stresses that the Constitutional Court should speedily reach a conclusion on the impeachment trial -- preferably by late January before the court’s President Park Han-chul finishes his term -- and contribute to stabilizing the government,” the KBA said in its statement.Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the minor opposition People’s Party recently submitted about 210,000 signatures to the Constitutional Court demanding Park’s ouster.With the nation’s eyes on the Constitutional Court, its justices on Tuesday convened their second meeting on the impeachment trial and discussed procedures.Officials said they have yet to reach a definitive conclusion, and are planning to have daily meetings on the case for the time being.By Yoon Mins-sik","impeachment trial of president ,impeach her on friday ,prepares for the impeachment ,why her impeachment ,for the impeachment trial","['the Constitutional Court', 'Park Geun - hye']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.96054137  0.05397978

Wrapping up a two-month investigation into the scandal that led to Park’s impeachment last week, prosecutors also called for further investigation by the independent counsel to determine whether the president’s actions could be considered bribery. “We rendered the bribery allegation is substantial and deserves further investigation. We have handed over to the special counsel every document and material we have in order for him to proceed,” Lee Young-ryeol, the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office told a press briefing. Independent counsel Park Young-soo is to launch his investigation into the scandal this week, receiving the baton from the prosecution. Independent counsel Park Young-soo is surrounded by reporters on Sunday. One of the key charges brought against President Park is that she colluded with Choi and her former aides to force larges companies to fund two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi. The prosecution thinks the donations could be tantamount to bribes to the state head. The arrested Choi and two former aides of Park are set to stand trial for fraud and embezzlement on Dec. 19, while Park, as a sitting president, is immune to criminal liability. The National Assembly impeached the president on Friday, suspending her from office, pending a Constitutional Court decision. The prosecution on Sunday indicted two more former officials and added new charges to President Park and Choi, Lee, the head of the Seoul prosecutors’ office revealed. The official also confirmed the existence of hard evidences, aside from testimonies, to back up its claim. Among them are 17 memo books of Park’s former aide An Chong-bum which detail Park’s directives given to him and 236 files of recorded phone conservations found on the mobile phone of Park’s another former aide Jeong Ho-seong.  “An admitted that everything on the memo books was his accounts of the president’s directives given to him or minutes of meetings at the presidential office,” Lee explained.     The prosecution also confirmed that a tablet PC, which was obtained by local TV channel JTBC and opened the floodgates of the scandal, belongs to Choi. Choi has denied ownership of the device containing over 200 presidential files.    The authority also said the president’s confidante had visited the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae at least 10 times, using a presidential office staff’s vehicle.The two newly indicted are Kim Jong, former vice culture minister, and Cho Won-dong, former chief presidential aide. Kim Jong, former vice culture minister Kim faces charges of abuse of authority, coercion and leaking information to the president’s civilian friend Choi. Cho was prosecuted without physical detention for attempted coercion.The two men are among high-level officials who allegedly helped Choi exercise influence in government affairs.Cho Won-dong, former chief presidential aideAccording to prosecutors, Kim is suspected to have forced major conglomerates to donate more than $65 million to two foundations founded by Choi under threats of tax audits. It also named Park an accomplice in the case, saying they colluded in Choi’s efforts to force donations from large companies.It added that Kim helped Jang Si-ho, Choi’s niece, collect subsidies worth 670 million won , from Samsung Electronics and governmental agencies for Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, which was established by Jang in June 2015, a rare case for a new organization. Prosecutors said that Cho is under suspicion of having pressured local food and entertainment giant CJ Group to fire its vice chairwoman, following a discussion with President Park. The new independent counsel is set to probe Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi, whose admission into Ewha Woman’s University and high school graduation were canceled over revelations the school gave her special treatment in attendance and grading.By Kim Da-sol","impeachment last week prosecutors ,park impeachment last week ,last week prosecutors also ,public prosecutors said sunday ,proves now impeached president","['Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park']",2,"[ 0.          1.          1.         ... -0.75658125  0.70219505

Rally organizers said Friday that this Saturday’s candlelight vigil, the seventh against President Park since a scandal involving her confidante erupted late October, will be a festive event with lots of cultural performances, stand-up comedy and displays of satirical messages. The messages will center on demanding President Park immediately step down and calling for the Constitutional Court to make a decision rapidly. As in previous rallies, participants will completely surround the presidential office from several locations starting from 4 p.m. The main event is scheduled for 6 p.m. in its seventh massive street rally against Park. Citizens of Gwangju participate in anti-Park Geun-hye candlelight vigil on Friday. Upon the announcement of Park‘s impeachment on Friday, some protestors who have gathered in front of the National Assembly shouted “The impeachment motion was passed!” The area near the front gate of the Assembly building turned into an outdoor festival on Friday afternoon. An estimated 20,000 people erupted in cheers and stood up to share the historic moment, shouting “We won!” Some shed tears, others expressed joy by dancing to music and taking pictures with the Assembly building in the background.“I am extremely happy. It is a touching moment. We clearly showed Park Geun-hye and political elites what could happen to them if they ignore us,” Kim Kyung-ja, 50, told The Korea Herald right after the news was delivered.“We have a long fight ahead against the Park administration’s flawed policies like labor market reforms, state-issued history textbooks and agreement on comfort women,” she said, jumping up and down in joy.Among the most relieved were the bereaved families of the Sewol ferry, who have fought long to reveal truth behind the tragedy that took away the lives of more than 300 people in April in 2014. “It is a big relief. I think my daughter Soo-jin helped the motion to be passed from heaven. I thank her,” said Kim Jong-ki, who lost her 17-year-old daughter in the maritime disaster. “The Constitutional Court should rule in favor of the motion so that we can finally find the truth about the cause of the ferry disaster.” The president has come under fire for the administration’s botched rescue efforts to save the victims, with questions growing over what she did for seven hours while the ferry sank. After minutes of celebration, protestors pledged to continue their candlelight rallies to fix the political, social and economic structure to root out injustice, inequality and corruption in the society. They demand a thorough probe and stern punishment for Park, her friend Choi Soon-sil and ex-presidential aides such as Woo Byung-woo and Kim Ki-choon involved in the influence-peddling scandal.“I expected Park Geun-hye to be impeached to some extent. The impeachment is only a beginning of structural reforms ranging from dissolution of the ruling Saenuri Party to punishment of family-owned conglomerates,” said Heo Woo-jin, 25. “I will join the rally on Saturday at the Gwanghwamun Square to call for the Constitutional Court to immediately make a decision on the impeachment.” As the motion was passed with the approval of 234 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly, the fate of her presidency is left up to the Constitutional Court. It reviews the motion and should make a ruling within 180 days. “People won. We won. Following the June democratic uprising in 1987, we opened a new chapter of this country’s democracy,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon before the crowds at the front gate of the Assembly building. “Park Geun-hye should immediately resign without waiting for the Constitutional Court’s decision.”Civic groups also welcomed the passage of the impeachment motion. An association of 1,500 civic groups demanding Park’s resignation and holding candlelit protests every weekend called it a “reasonable result.” “The passage of the motion is a precious achievement of people who have taken to the streets and held up candles. We took a jab at opportunistic politicians only caring out their interests. President Park said she would not step down despite the passage of the impeachment motion, which is a declaration of war on Korean people,” they said in a statement. “So we will light more candles.”","saturday to celebrate impeachment ,this saturday candlelight vigil ,vigil saturday to celebrate ,candlelight vigil saturday ,candlelight vigil saturday to","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",2,[1.         0.         1.         ... 0.04979616 0.50553423 0.5044958 ],Ock Hyun-ju,Social affairs,12,2016,"holding candlelit protests every weekend ,park impeachment on friday ,candlelit protests every weekend ,candlelit protests every weekend called ,impeachment on friday some protestors","['South Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'the National Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Kim Kyung - ja', 'the Korea Herald', 'Kim Jong - ki', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Park', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Woo Byung - woo', 'Kim Ki - choon', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'Heo Woo - jin', 'the Constitutional Court', 'National Assembly', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon', 'Assembly', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the Constitutional Court ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Park', 'korean']",18,[1.         0.         1.         ... 0.04979616 0.50553423 0.5044958 ]

Six weeks into the Choi Soon-sil scandal, an increasing number of South Koreans are suffering from heightened mental stress and violent mood swings, satirically labeled “Soon-sil Syndrome.”   A satirical replica of President Park Geun-hye with a rope tied around her is seen at a protest against the scandal-ridden president in Seoul on Saturday. Last week, a man was arrested for setting fire to the birthplace of Park Chung-hee, the father of the incumbent president, in protest against the junior Park, who is refusing to heed the public’s overwhelming demand for her to resign. Angry voters are bombarding lawmakers still loyal to the disgraced president with angry phone calls and text messages, castigating them for not cooperating with the opposition-led move to impeach her. Last month, a man drove an excavator into the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office building in Seoul, saying he wanted to help Choi die. On her way to the prosecutors’ office to face questioning, Choi told reporters surrounding her that she had committed a “capital offense.”  On the previous day, another man had thrown dog feces at the office, criticizing the slow progress of investigation into Choi and the scandal. Experts say citizens’ level of stress seems to have reached a point where some who suffer on an emotional roller coaster vent it out in a violent way. “Citizens’ emotional stress has been accumulating since the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014. Now, the scandal involving President Park and Choi brought people’s level of frustration and shock to a peak,” said professor of psychology Ko Jae-hong from Kyungnam University. South Koreans have seen worse cases of corruption involving former presidents. But the ongoing scandal ensnaring President Park seems to have a more personal impact on them, pundits say. Former Rep. Rhyu Si-min said that South Koreans may have felt personally “insulted” by what Park and Choi did to the country. “Watching the scandal unfold, the public might have felt not just anger, but a very strong sense of insult,” Rhyu said on a TV program.  Revelations so far suggest the president has relied on Choi, the daughter of a late cult leader, in both public and private life, letting her friend decide almost everything for her, including what to wear, say to the Cabinet and the public and whom to choose for key government posts. Choi’s daughter is also found to have been illegally admitted to a prestigious university, and it seems like she was given special treatment wherever she went and in whatever she did. Kim Dae-hyun, a 28-year-old who participated in the massive anti-Park protest Saturday, also spoke of a shattered faith in justice. “Growing up, I was constantly told and encouraged by adults to study and work hard that I would succeed if I tried hard enough. But I found the reality was completely different,” he said. “I’ve already experienced extreme irregularities, and my accumulated anger exploded after seeing this corruption scandal involving President Park.” Professor Ha Ji-hyun of Konkuk University warns that citizens’ feelings of anger and dissatisfaction must be addressed in some way, or it could increase public disorder.Ever since the scandal broke out in late October, South Koreans have been staging massive rallies every Saturday to demand Park’s immediate resignation. The most recent, held Saturday, drew a record 1.7 million in Seoul and 2.32 million across the country. Despite the overwhelming display of public anger, President Park has refused to step down and the prospects for the opposition-led motion to impeach her remain unclear. “No matter how hard I try, nothing has been changed. I do not know how to deal with the situation. This is what most Koreans feel right now, while they continue to see those who are directly involved in the incident claim their innocence and say the situation is unfair,” Ha said. One way to cure the people’s stress and frustration is to punish the offenders.“While neither of the president’s apologies, the prosecutors’ investigation nor the National Assembly’s reactions to the incident were able to calm traumatized citizens, a speedy process of bringing offenders to justice may be the only way to bring the stress level of citizens down,” said sociologist Chung Min-soo.“For those angry citizens, coming together at candlelight vigils to beat the blues and express their emotions in the festive mood, as shown in recent rallies, can be a good way to survive this mind-boggling time.” For those with a more serious case of Soon-sil Syndrome, the experts’ advice is to turn off the TV for now. “Or set a certain amount of time to watch news. Negative news can impact viewer’s mental health,” Ha said.By Kim Da-sol","tv news agitated and ,scandal involving president ,watches tv news agitated ,shock over the scandal ,tv news agitated","['Shin Yang - joo', 'Agitated', 'South Korea', 'Shin']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.77923656  0.37295675

If organizers’ figures are correct, the rally is the biggest in the nation’s history, estimated at more than double the size of that in June 1987, when about a million people poured onto the streets to fight for democracy.Some 1.7 million people gathered in central Seoul to demand President Park Geun-hye step down on Saturday. The record-breaking crowds are a sign of continued public anger toward President Park, who refused to step down immediately, as well as the political parties that have so far failed to remove her from office.As of 8:30 p.m., an estimated 1.6 million protesters, according to rally organizers, packed the main boulevards connecting City Hall and Gwanghamun Square to Gyeongbok Palace in central Seoul for a candlelight vigil to ramp up pressure on Park to immediately step down.A total of 620,000 South Koreans gathered for candlelight vigils in other parts of the country, with 200,000 in the nation’s second-biggest city Busan and 100,000 in the liberal stronghold of Gwangju, according to figures from organizing groups.The protestors chanted “Park Geun-hye, step down immediately. It is the public’s order” and “Arrest Park Geun-hye” while holding up their candles. Gwanghwamun area turned into a sea of candlelights during the anti-government rally held in central seoul, Saturday. “President Park is delaying stepping down, leaving the decision on her own presidency up to the parliament,” Kim Seong-ju, 27, told The Korea Herald at Gwanghwamun Square. “That way, she is sparking infighting in the National Assembly. We  have no option but to topple the president ourselves.”On Tuesday, Park issued an apology for the third time but said she would not step down immediately, saying she would leave it up to the National Assembly to decide when and how she should leave her post.“I think Park’s third televised address was a sophisticated political ploy. Now, the public fury, which was directed at President Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil, spreads to the National Assembly,” Seo Young-soo, 23, said. Some demonstrators expressed their anger at Park by holding up torches, not candles, in front of the Gwanghwamun Gage as they march towards the presidential office.There were 416 torches to symbolize the date of the Sewol ferry disaster, which left more than 300 people missing or dead on April 16, 2014. This came amid escalating controversy over the whereabouts of President Park for seven hours at the time of the sinking of the ferry. This is the sixth week of major protests against the president, who is suspected of extorting donations from conglomerates and allowing her civilian friend Choi Soon-sil to meddle in state affairs. Choi, who holds no government post, is alleged to have meddled in state affairs, used her influence to get her daughter Chung Yoo-ra accepted into a prestigious university and pressured companies into donating to funds to foundations she controls for her personal use.Police put the tally at 320,000 as of 7:10 p.m. in Seoul and 104,000 across the nation. Before the main event began at 6 p.m., some 500,000 protesters marched toward the presidential office. “It is my first time joining the protest. I doubted that my participation in the rally can make any difference,” said a 54-year-old office worker Kim Hye-yeon. “But I gained courage after seeing so many people raising a voice in unison against President Park. I will attend the rally until she steps down.”For the first time in recent history, protestors were allowed to march up to 100 meters from the presidential office by 5:30 p.m., the closest spot from Cheong Wa Dae, upon a local court’s order. Protestors march towards the presidential office on Saturday. A local court has ruled against police trying to block protesters from marching near the presidential office, citing freedom of public assemblies. Last Saturday, the court allowed protesters to hold a rally in front of Cheongwoon-dong community center, some 200 meters away from the presidential office. “As we are only 100 meters away from President Park in her office, I hope our voices are better delivered,” said Choi Jeong-seon, 53. “The opposition parties should join forces to impeach her.” Showing the public anger directed at lawmakers opposing Park’s impeachment, protesters held a rally in front of the Saenuri Party headquarters in Yeouido, southwestern Seoul, Organizers said 20,000 people took part but police put the number at 1,000. Protestors tear apart the flag of Saenuri Party in front of its head office on Saturday. Blasting the ruling Saenuri Party for failing to support the impeachment motion against Park, they chanted “Resign, Park Geun-hye. Dissolve the Saenuri Party!” “The Saenuri Party is an accomplice to President Park’s crimes. Ignoring the public’s voices, she is clinging on to power. She should step down right now,” said Park Jae-young, 29, in front of the Saenuri Party headquarters. On Friday, the initial plan among the main opposition parties and anti-Park group within the Saenuri Party to vote for an impeachment motion against Park fell through. The opposition parties agreed to hold a vote on the impeachment next Friday.Some protestors threw eggs at the banner on the building reading “Dear Koreans, we are really sorry. We will get the state affairs back on track as soon as possible.” They tore apart part a flag of the Saenuri Party in front of its head office. On the other side of Seoul, some 15,000 loyal supporters of President Park staged a rally in front of Dongdaemun Design Plaza, denouncing anti-Park protestors as “witch-hunting” the president. The police tally of attendance was 1,500.President Park Geun-hye’s approval rating remained at a record-low 4 percent this week, a Gallup Korea poll showed Friday, while 91 percent disapproved of her. A website that helps online users file a petition to lawmakers in their neighborhoods to demand President Park Geun-hye’s resignation, emerged on Saturday. As of 9 p.m., it collected some 450,000 signatures.So far, the cumulative number of Koreans who took to the streets to demand President Park step down has exceeded 6 million, according to rally organizers. Last Saturday alone, up to 1.9 million people participated in the rally, with 1.5 million gathering in Seoul.

The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs said the H5N6 AI virus was discovered at a duck farm in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, and at another duck farm in Muan, South Jeolla Province. The veterinary authorities said some 22,000 ducks have been culled in Muan, 385 kilometers south of Seoul. They also slaughtered 8,500 ducks in Cheongju, 137 kilometers south of the capital, to prevent the possible spread of the disease.  The latest cases come about four days after the government confirmed the H5N6 AI virus at a chicken farm in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, and a duck farm in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province, noting about 40,000 chickens and 22,000 ducks have been culled. South Korea has reported H5N1 and H5N8 AI viruses in the past, but this is the first time to see the H5N6 AI virus, which has been detected in China, Vietnam, Laos and Hong Kong. Human infection by the H5N6 virus was previously reported from China in 2014. The ministry said it has dispatched a quarantine team to the sites and started to restrict the movement of animals, people and vehicles at the farms. It also pledged to keep conducting quarantines and surveillance on poultry. The authorities said they are currently verifying whether the AI virus found at the farms in Yangju and Gimje is H5N6. The result will come out on Wednesday.","poultry farms on tuesday ,confirmed h5n6 avian influenza ,farms on tuesday increasing ,h5n6 avian influenza ,h5n6 avian influenza ai","['South Korea', 'H5N6', 'AI', 'the Ministry of Food , Agriculture and Rural Affairs', 'Cheongju', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Muan', 'South Jeolla Province']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4004809   0.46599549

Kim Sang-hee of the main opposition Democratic Party claimed that Cheong Wa Dae purchased 20 million won  worth of medicines from Green Cross Corp. in March 2014 and August this year.The list of medicines includes various injections for nutrition and skin care, triggering speculation that they were purchased for the president.The presidential office said that the medicines were purchased legitimately to provide health services to all of its employees, including security officials, based on the judgment of the presidential medical staff. This graphic, provided by Yonhap News TV, shows President Park Geun-hye in front of a composite photo of the entrance and building of Chaum, an anti-aging clinic in southern Seoul. At the time of the purchases, Kim Sang-man, a doctor known to have ties to Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, worked for a hospital run by Green Cross Corp.Choi is suspected of illicitly obtaining prescriptions for the president with Kim's help at Chaum, an upscale anti-aging clinic in southern Seoul. Kim had worked at Chaum until February 2014 before joining Green Cross.After the health ministry filed a complaint late last week, the prosecution launched a probe into the allegations of illicit prescriptions, investigators said Tuesday.It is illegal to issue a medical prescription without diagnosing a patient -- except for some special cases such as at the request of an immediate family member.","presidential office denies allegations ,corruption scandal citing data ,denies allegations over medicine ,medicines from local pharmaceutical ,on tuesday denied rumors","['Cheong', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Sang - hee', 'Democratic Party']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.57622623  0.49465138

10,10,10,[News Focus] Park fights to keep power,"President Park Geun-hye may appear to be stuck in an unsolvable political fix, as she is driven into a corner by public fury, an ongoing prosecutorial probe, an imminent independent counsel investigation as well as a parliamentary inquiry -- and on top of all this, a likely impeachment trial. But contrary to what is perceived, circumstances so far show the embattled president to be taking countermeasures against all ...","President Park Geun-hye may appear to be stuck in an unsolvable political fix, as she is driven into a corner by public fury, an ongoing prosecutorial probe, an imminent independent counsel investigation as well as a parliamentary inquiry -- and on top of all this, a likely impeachment trial. But contrary to what is perceived, circumstances so far show the embattled president to be taking countermeasures against all plausible consequences, none of which involve abdication.Park on Tuesday continued to remain secluded from the public, refraining from chairing a Cabinet meeting. It had largely been anticipated that in the absence of Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the president would preside over the meeting and present her stance over the current situation, especially given the tension over the prosecution’s attempted questioning of her.What Park did, instead, was to reinforce her legal representation, in an apparent gesture to fight the attacks against her.“I understand that  will increase her number of lawyers to four or five,” Cheong Wa Dae Spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk told reporters Tuesday.But such a move was largely taken as a provision for the in-depth investigation to be led by an incoming independent counsel, or even for the impeachment proceedings, not as a response to the incumbent prosecution probe.Following the investigators’ recent decision to name her as an “accomplice” to the influence-peddling by her aides, Park effectively cut off all communication with the prosecution, referring to the ongoing probe as “politically biased.”The prosecutors’ indictment Sunday had stated Park as accomplice to her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and former Senior Secretary An Chong-bum in their coercive funding activities for the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation.Lashing out at the arraignment, the president immediately said through her lawyer and spokesperson that she would no longer “cooperate” with the prosecution, alluding that she would rather face an impeachment trial. While deterring the ongoing prosecutorial probe, Park approved a Cabinet-passed bill to empower an independent counsel to probe the Choi scandal.Based on this bill, which took effect immediately, two candidates for the counsel are to be suggested, both by the opposition parties. The president will choose one of them. Though the incoming counsel is to involve the largest-ever team and extensive investigation authority, it also has a time limit -- 20 days of preparation and 70 days of investigation. Only the president is entitled to extend the investigation period by another 30 days.The assumption is that Park, considering such restrictions, chose to skip the prosecutors’ questioning and move directly to the independent counsel investigation, as it would likely buy her a few more weeks to prepare for questioning.“President Park will prepare for a neutral probe by an independent counsel,” said her lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha.Some foes of Park predict that the president may reject the special counsel probe under the claims that it is not “neutral” and instead choose to focus on the main battle ahead -- the impreachment trial. In South Korea, the final decision of whether to remove a sitting president from office rests with the Constitutional Court. Park is seen as having a chance of avoiding the sanction, as the decision requires the consent of six of nine judges, with two justices to retire next year and their successors to be appointed by Park.As for the parliamentary inquiry, which is to take place separately from either probe, the Blue House has so far made few comments, despite the fact that several of its key former officials were included in the process as witnesses.It has been speculated nevertheless that the legislature-led inquiry is the reason why several pro-president figures within the ruling Saenuri Party, including chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, are still refusing to step down -- so that they may retain power and help Park.By Bae Hyun-jung","show the embattled president ,news focus park fights ,impeachment trial but contrary ,fury an ongoing prosecutorial ,the embattled president",['Park Geun'],2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.87888819  0.94906926

It marks the first time a sitting president has been listed as a suspect in a criminal case.  The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae expressed ""deep regret"" over the investigation results, saying any allegations against Park are ""by no means"" true. It also criticized the prosecution for ""hastily"" carrying out its probe and failing to offer the president an opportunity to explain her position, even though Park has expressed her intention to face questioning. Cheong Wa Dae, then, stressed that it will establish Park's ""innocence"" through an independent counsel probe.""The investigation team's announcement is by no means true,"" Jung Youn-kuk, presidential spokesman told reporters.Jung, moreover, argued that the investigators did not maintain political neutrality regarding the probe.Warning that the investigation outcome could further deepen political confusion and paralyze state affairs, the presidential office indicated its will to accept an impeachment process as a way to address an ongoing controversy over whether Park can continue to stay on as head of state.The investigation results further infuriated citizens, who have been calling for Park's resignation through massive street rallies across the nation, and spurred political discussions for her impeachment.Park now faces allegations that through her aide, she allowed Choi to gain access to some 180 presidential speeches and government documents, some of which included classified information. The allegations raise the possibility of Park violating the law governing the handling of official secrets. The president is also alleged to have directly or indirectly pressured major conglomerates into donating large sums of money to two nonprofit foundations, which legal experts say could constitute an abuse of authority. Through her addresses to the nation on Oct. 25 and Nov. 4, the president admitted to handing over some of her speech drafts to Choi to get her advice, and claimed that her role in raising funds for the two foundations was based on ""pure motives"" to benefit the country.Park's attorney denied all of the allegations, presaging a grueling legal battle. He, in particular, said that the foundations in question were created as part of her official duties with clear policy goals, not for any personal gain, and that if anyone sought to use them for personal interests, it was done without the president's knowledge. ""The president knew nothing about Choi private business,"" the lawyer said. He said that while Park could be blamed for not keeping close tabs on those around her, she in no way tried to help people get rich. The attorney also denied that Park directly ordered anyone to leak presidential speeches and documents.He moreover rebuked the prosecution for revealing the allegations against the president, who has a legal immunity from prosecution except in cases of insurrection or treason. Following the prosecution's announcement, opposition parties further raised pressure on Park to step down, stressing the allegations against her constitute legal conditions required for her impeachment. ""President Park has now become a suspect, creating legal conditions to table a motion for her impeachment,"" Youn Kwan-suk, spokesman for the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters. ""She should follow people's demands through a decision to resign voluntarily rather than making the worst choice that would plunge the nation into a bigger crisis,"" he added.The minor opposition People's Party also echoed the Democratic Party's view.""The country will function and move forward when the president, whom the prosecution portrays as an alleged accomplice, moves out ,"" Lee Yong-ho, the party's spokesman, said in a statement.During their ""emergency political meeting,"" eight presidential hopefuls from the opposition camp decided to request that the National Assembly and three liberal parties discuss ways to push for Park's impeachment. They also decided to call on the opposition parties to promptly come up with measures to minimize a possible government vacuum that could result from Park's resignation or impeachment, including appointing a parliament-picked premier and forming an ""interim"" Cabinet.""It is very shameful that the prosecution confirmed allegations of criminal acts against a sitting president,"" Rep. Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Democratic Party, said during a meeting with other presidential hopefuls. "" also have confirmed that reasons are sufficient for her impeachment.""Ahn Cheol-soo, former co-chair of the People's Party, claimed that the National Assembly should push for Park's resignation and impeachment at the same time.""The crux of this case is the fact that the president, who has to safeguard the Constitution, has destroyed the basic law,"" Ahn said. The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, said that it is premature to confirm the allegations of Park's complicity in the corruption case given that the president has yet to undergo a direct prosecutorial inquiry.""We hope that the facts behind the scandal will clearly be verified through the ongoing prosecutorial probe, a planned independent counsel investigation and a parliamentary inquiry,"" Yeom Dong-yeol, party spokesman, told reporters.Some ruling party members, who are not close to the president, called for an immediate process to push for Park's impeachment.They also demanded that the party refer Park to its ethics panel to discuss whether to end Park's party membership.","park attorney rejects prosecution ,sunday rejected the prosecution ,attorney rejects prosecution interim ,attorney rejects prosecution ,rejected the prosecution investigation","['Park Geun', 'Yoo Yeong - ha']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.31785345  0.34894753

High school seniors from a teen organization have registered to hold a candlelight vigil at 7 p.m. on Thursday in front of the Bosingak Bell next to Jonggak Station in Seoul. “Many high school seniors wanted to join last Saturday’s rally, but they could not because the exam was so close,” Choi Seo-hyun, secretary-general of a group called “Hope” was quoted by local media as saying. “We expect a large turnout ” she added.  Takers of Suneung, or the annual college scholastic ability test, are also likely to show up in droves at the upcoming nationwide anti-President Park Geun-hye rally Saturday. A group of students check the location for their national college entrance exam. At previous rallies, many teenagers in school uniforms were spotted holding signs lampooning the scandal-ridden president and state affairs. The rally’s organizers -- a union of over 1,500 civic and labor groups -- are trying a different tactic this Saturday. Instead of having all the participants flock to Seoul’s Gwanghwamun area, numerous smaller-scale rallies will take place all around the country. A record-breaking 1 million people gathered in central Seoul last week to demand the resignation of the beleaguered Park, who is accused of letting her friend Choi manipulate state affairs behind the scenes. Busan, the country’s second-largest city, might see as many as 100,000 protesters, according to a local rally organizer comprising some 100 civic organizations.  Across the country, rallies are planned at some 100 locations. A union of some 80 civic organizations in North Chungcheong Province expects a turnout of about 10,000 for its rally. On Jeju Island, a candlelight vigil is expected to draw up to 5,000 residents. Meanwhile, an online club that supports President Park is planning to hold a counter-rally in front of Seoul Station on Saturday.

Since August, a multi-buliding residential complex in Seongnam in Gyeonggi Province has been charging 10 households that have pets an extra 7,200 won  on top of the monthly house maintenance fee that covers electricity, heating, parking lot maintenance and etc.  It is part of a new anti-pet policy decided by the council of residents. Under existing rules, all residents that wish to have pets at home must obtain written consent from at least half of the neighbors from their respective building. But households that have pets without going through the process have grown, giving rise to the necessity of a financial penalty -- a 5 percent hike in the monthly maintenance fee, the council explained.Pet-owning households submitted a petition to Seongnam city government, arguing it is unfair to charge higher fees just because one has pets. “Issues at multi-household houses are too private for the city government to step in and difficult to mediate,” said an official from city government.Currently, there is no legal basis to ban pet ownership in the residential area.Ministry data in 2015 showed that 4.57 million families in South Korea, or 10 million individuals, live with pets.“There has been continuous complaints over noise problems between neighbors. We thought that controversies will only get worse if noise problems caused from pets are not handled well,” one of the representatives of residents said.Half of South Koreans live in apartment complexes, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Since Korean apartments are mostly separated by cement walls, sound easily transfers between them. By Kim Da-sol","monthly house maintenance fee ,neighbors spat over pet ,been charging 10 households ,impose monthly pet charge ,up controversy among neighbors","['netizen', 'Seongnam', 'Gyeonggi Province']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33330101  0.08304679

This is when an egg develops on its own without fertilization.The former Seoul National University  professor created NT-1 in 2004 and claimed that it was the world's first stem cell batch extracted from cloned human embryos. But the authenticity of his research came under fire after he was discovered to have faked some experimental data and violated ethical regulations.  Hwang Soo-suk, a former professor of Seoul National University, walks into the Seoul Central District Court on June 8, 2009. The KCDC said it will report the registration of NT-1 to the health minister and formally register the line as human embryos as early as the end of this week. In 2006, the SNU announced NT-1 was most likely to be produced by the virgin birth method, citing its genetic fingerprint and refuted Hwang's claim. A research team at the Harvard Medical School also supported the SNU's conclusion and published the result in the scientific journal Cell Stem Cell in 2007.The government has banned all research using human eggs after Hwang was convicted in 2009 for embezzlement.A series of research projects in the field have sparked calls for lowering the high regulatory barrier to allow local scientists to conduct stem cell and regenerative medicine research over the past years.In July, the government approved CHA University's embryonic stem cell research seven years after it submitted the plan, on condition that it abides by high ethical standards.Since being removed from professorship, Hwang has served as a senior researcher at Sooam Biotech Research Foundation and the head of Hbion, a bio firm specializing in animal cloning and the stem cell cosmetics business.","restart stem cell research ,authorities said tuesday move ,scientist hwang stem cell ,health authorities said tuesday ,said tuesday move","['south korean', 'Hwang Woo - suk', 'the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention', 'KCDC']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20379268  0.45753103

When refused, Cha turned ""unfriendly"" toward CJ, he said.What the source has described supports allegations that Cha, using his close ties with presidential confidante Choi Soon-sil, pressured CJ which he regarded as an impediment to his drive to monopolize state-backed cultural promotion businesses. As Cha was quickly raising his profile in the culture and entertainment community, CJ's Vice Chairman Miky Lee suddenly left for the United States, citing health issues. People who have begun to speak out recently on what had happened said that Lee was forced to leave the country on pressure from the outside to give up her responsibilities at the company. According to the source, Cha demanded that he be made the chief of the Creative Center for Convergence Culture , one of the first hubs to open to create what would form the Culture Creation and Convergence Belt, a centerpiece cultural project undertaken by the government. The CJ Group established the CCCC at its headquarters in western Seoul.  The conglomerate also decided to build K-Culture Valley, a site the size of 46 football fields that would house shopping malls, hotels, theme parks and concert halls to host an array of cultural events. The source said Cha demanded that he be given a job title to oversee all performances at the facility that is scheduled to be completed next year.""CJ rejected all of the demands. As far as I know, Cha turned unfriendly toward CJ after that,"" the source said.The Culture Creation and Convergence Belt was given a budget of some 700 billion won  until 2019 to build hubs throughout the country.""Cha probably wanted to pull all the strings in content planning and business development by taking over CJ's CCCC. There is a chance that he wanted a position at the K-Culture Valley for personal gains from arranging large performances.""Cha is already suspected of funneling lucrative state cultural projects to companies he is either directly or indirectly involved with and making profits.","in presidential confidante scandal ,presidential confidante scandal ,friday to have abused ,presidential confidante scandal was ,scandal was alleged friday","['CJ Group', 'Cha Eun - taek']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53493422  0.47135875

This quote stresses that the key to success in achieving a goal is taking efficient methods. Government Legislation Minister Je Jeong-boo Such words are also true in the process of national development today as it is in everywhere else. South Korea, once marked as the poorest nation in the world with a Gross National Income of $67 per capita in 1953, has leapt into the ranks of advanced nations, with a GNI of $28,180 as of 2014. Laws are often referred to as a bowl that contains systems and policies, whose changes in direction were effectively backed by “legislation” as part of a method to support the governmental decision. For example, legislations in the 1960s to 70s, including Machinery Industry Act, Support of Steel Industry Act and Industrial Base Development Act have contributed to foster heavy chemical industry back then, while later in 1980s to 90s, Act on the Special Measures for the Promotion of Comprehensive Development of Designated Areas, Housing Site Development Promotion Act and Act on the Promotion and Development Fund Act for Agricultural and Fishing Villages have played a key role to seek balanced regional development and land development. More recently, countries in Asia began to take notice of such legislations in Korea that have led to the national growth. More interests are being drawn especially among ASEAN member states, such as Vietnam, whose rapid growth rate of six to seven percent a year remains unchanged amid sluggish economy elsewhere. One of the primary reasons for the attention is because they can learn from our know-how of legislative process so as to reduce their own mistakes. U Win Myint, vice minister of the Ministry of Justice in Myanmar, for example, made a visit to the Ministry of Government Legislation here last August, particularly interested in modeling after land related legislations involving urban development and modernization of agricultural communities. When I visited Vietnam a while ago, I was told by Nguyen Khac Dinh, a member of the legislation committee in the Vietnam Assembly, that Korea’s Public Information Act was a “great help” to establish a similar legislation in Vietnam. He said “We are hoping to closely cooperate with South Korea to share up-to-date legislative information in various segments.”In face of such broad demands across other nations, the Ministry of Government Legislation here has signed a bilateral MOU with 19 institutions in 13 countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia and Uzbekistan. We are also actively promoting “Legislation Hallyu,” in which we distribute our unique legislative experiences and information, legislative experts and provide opportunities to attend workshops. In addition, a new project is underway to establish a law information website in Myanmar just like the Korea Law Information Center, a globally acclaimed platform that provides legislative information. From 2013, we have been hosting the Asian Legislative Experts Symposium to share our knowledge to Asian countries. The fourth forum which kick started on Nov. 1 drew 259 participants from 45 countries to discuss legislative agenda involving the promotion of public transportation. It provided insight on how to grapple with urban problems, such as traffic congestion and lack of public transits in the fast growing economies. Our plan is to further cooperate with them to share our legislative knowledge and wisdom and help them cope with challenges that they have in common. Based on a shared goal of sustainable development, we will present a framework in legislative areas to support more countries from South America and Africa and expand interchange cooperation. It is my hope that such efforts of ours in the Ministry of Government Legislation in Korea are set to encourage mutual understanding and goodwill between nations and to establish legal systems to drive national and social growth.By Je Jeong-booMinister of Government Legislation","four sharpening the axe ,six hours to chop ,lincoln america 16th president ,get freshly sharpened axe ,cut more trees while","['Abraham Lincoln', 'America', 'Je J']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49585399  0.83009869

The party chief refused to step down from the post, adding he should first focus efforts on normalizing the troubled party.Saenuri has been facing one of the biggest challenges in its history on allegations that Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil used her ties to the chief executive to influence state affairs and seek financial gains.""I would like to ask for some time to manage the crisis and help the president who is facing serious challenges,"" Lee said, adding the party must make efforts to prevent full-fledged paralysis.Lee asked the party members to give him leeway, adding he wished to keep trust with the president.Rep.

It is for such reason that some critics view the “Choi Soon-sil scandal” as nothing more than a belated revelation of what was in fact the Choi Tae-min scandal with roots that go decades back.Choi, the South Korean ‘Rasputin’The late Choi’s relationship with the incumbent president traces back to 1975, when the 23-year-old Park had just lost her mother Yuk Young-soo, wife of the late autocratic President Park Chung-hee.Park was in shock, as was a large part of the nation, over the assassination of the beloved first lady by a bullet from a North Korean spy a year earlier.This file photo dated June 21, 1975, shows President Park Geun-hye, then 23-years old and acting as the first lady after her mother’s assassination, attending an event to celebrate the foundation of a voluntary corps associated with a religion that Choi Tae-min created. Seen in the left is Choi. It was then that Choi, a self-proclaimed pastor and founder of an obscure sect called the Church of Eternal Life, made his appearance in Park’s life, according to a report by the former Korea Central Intelligence Agency, drafted in the 1970s but published later in 2007.Claiming himself to be a psychic and messenger of God, Choi asserted he was receiving messages from the late first lady and that Park, too, could reach out to her mother.“Your mother has only relocated herself so as to raise you as a true leader of the nation and of the world,” Choi wrote in a letter to Park, claiming to be quoting the “spiritual message” from the late first lady.“Whenever you wish to hear your mother’s voice, you may do so through me.”Seemingly intrigued by these assertions, the devastated Park invited the cult chief to the presidential house for an encounter that marked the start of Park’s unshakable devotion to her “mentor” and his successor.The somewhat dubious identity of the counsellor, who had transformed from police officer to Buddhist monk to Roman Catholic priest aspirant and then to cult founder, did not stop Park from bestowing her trust upon him.Empowered by the full-fledged support of the strongman’s daughter, who effectively acted as first lady in the absence of her deceased mother, Choi soon started to boost his social and economic leverage, mostly by running what looked to be patriotic organizations, with Park as the nominal leader.One such example was the Movement for a New Mind, a pro-government social group involving student volunteers that kicked off in 1978. A broadcast by KBS at the time showed Choi Soon-sil was present at the inauguration ceremony, standing next to Park as a student representative.It was this inviolable fellowship, mostly maintained by the junior Park’s blind faith in senior Choi, which put the last straw on the social sense of crisis against the dictatorial rule of Park Chung-hee.Kim Jae-gyu, the KCIA director who assassinated the president in 1979, later attributed his doing so partly to the president’s failure to keep his daughter from the inappropriate influence of the pseudo-pastor.Isolated from world, obsessed with ChoiPresident Park’s murder, though it was a setback for a series of “social movements” led by Choi, failed to deter the orphaned Park’s devotion for him. Quite on the contrary, she grew even more dependent on the man she saw as an alternative father figure.“We sent Choi away to Gangwon Province for a while so as to put an end to his corruptive acts,” said a military official who worked under the Chun Doo-hwan administration, which took power after Park’s death.Park, who left the Blue House upon her father’s death, also disappeared from public attention for several years.But her estranged siblings -- younger sister Geun-ryeong and brother Ji-man -- rekindled the perennial suggestion that Park Geun-hye was still and always had remained under the powerful influence of the cult leader.In 1990, the two younger Parks filed a 12-page petition to then-President Roh Tae-woo, pleading their sister be “rescued” from Choi’s grip.Despite Park’s denial and fury, the Roh administration seems to have taken her siblings’ complaints seriously. A report drafted by the nation’s spy agency in 1989-1990, the two years following Roh’s inauguration, showed the government was keeping a close watch on Choi and his family, according to TV Chosun.The document described in detail Choi’s personal life, including his five marriages and uncounted extramarital affairs, as well as his considerable assets and religious history. Choi Soon-sil, fifth daughter and allegedly the most beloved child, was also included in the personnel information file.The never-ending quarrel on whether Choi indeed had control over Park may be summed up in a diplomatic wire by the US Embassy in Seoul, a document made public by WikiLeaks in 2007.A screetshot of a 2007 US embassy cable, released by Wikileaks in 2011, written by then US ambassador to Korea Alexander Vershbow on Park Geun-hye.“Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,” it said.Choi’s reign continues, through her daughterWhen Choi Tae-min died in 1994, at age 78, Park’s reliance upon him had not dwindled -- it had only moved onto his daughter, Soon-sil, who has also recently been known as Seo-won.Shortly before he died, the late cult leader made more eccentric remarks than ever, according to magazine articles at the time. He reportedly said in public occasions that he was communicating directly with God and that his blood was white in color, unlike ordinary people.Upon the death of the original “Korean Rasputin,” local dailies published obituaries describing him as closest aide to Park or custodian of her properties who paid for her living expenses.An image taken from internet media outlet Newstapa-released footage showing Park Geun-hye  and Choi Soon-sil at a university campus in Seoul in June of 1979 where Park attended a public event.By the time Park made her political debut in 1997 as lawmaker of the Grand National Party and made her initial bid as the party’s presidential candidate in 2007, the junior Choi’s name was covertly mentioned in political circles as the “invisible hand” guiding Park.But for long, the names of other figures involved in the Park-Choi connection largely blurred the public’s eye.Among those was Jeong Yoon-hoe, Choi’s ex-husband and the president‘s former personal assistant, who allegedly was with the president during her unexplained seven hours of silence following the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014. The mystery led many to suspect a romantic connection to her political aide.Another was Woo Byung-woo, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, who came under fire earlier this year for his suspected involvement in a high-profile prosecutorial corruption case.Though it was first speculated the top official was the one in control behind the consecutive irregular charges, it turned out later the actual commander-in-chief was Choi Soon-sil.“Corruption scandals have been rampant in South Korea’s political history, but they mostly involved the family members or those close to the president,” said Shin Yul, a conservative-leaning professor of politics at Myongji University.“But this is about the president’s integrity and leadership capacity that matters, which is why  has few valid solutions at her hands.”By Bae Hyun-jung","serious political scandal ,political scandal to religious ,relate serious political scandal ,serious political scandal to ,president park decades long","['South Korea', 'Park', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Park ’s', 'Choi']",2,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.579377    0.52953798

Choi -- President Park Geun-hye’s old friend and daughter of her late mentor Choi Tae-min -- has no intention of evading justice and is sorry for the confusion that the incident has caused, said attorney Lee Gyeong-jae. Prosecutors continued to question individuals about the allegations that Choi had meddled in state affairs.Federation of Korean Industries President Lee Seung-cheol on Friday was also questioned on his role in raising some 80 billion won  from large conglomerates for two entities -- Mir Foundation and the K-Sports Foundations. It has been alleged that it was a cover to raise money for Choi.The investigators are expected to question Lee on whether Ahn Chong-bum, the senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, played a part in the fund-raising. Ahn has denied allegations that he demanded companies to make contributions to the foundations.Rep. Noh Woong-rae of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea recently revealed a transcript of a conglomerate official saying that Ahn ordered the FKI to have the companies raise funds.The suspicion that Choi received reports on presidential documents -- some of which carried classified military and diplomatic information -- has shaken the country, with rival parties chorusing for an independent counsel to investigate the matter.Later in the day, prosecutors summoned Lee Sung-han, a former secretary general of the Mir Foundation, for questioning. Lee had claimed that Choi received detailed reports of the presidential documents every day and made comments, which later turned into actual policies. In an interview with local media Wednesday, Choi denied the “shadow president“ allegations and claimed that she has not received any money from the foundations. She referred to Lee as a “crazy person“ and claimed that he demanded she pay him 500 million won.Ko Yeong-tae, a 40-year-old former fencer who is reportedly Choi’s close aide, came to Seoul from Bangkok Thursday to face questions over his involvement.He previously famously told local media that “the only thing Choi does well is to correct the president’s speech.“Park on Tuesday issued a public apology, in which she admitted to receiving help from Choi on some of her early speeches.Jo In-geun, the former secretary to the president for speechwriting and documentation, claimed Friday that he never suspected Park’s speeches had been tampered with by someone else. He also claimed to have never heard of Choi before the scandal.“The president is the one who completes the speech, and I never thought the speech was corrected in ‘an unusual way’ before the final draft,” he said.As part of their investigation, the prosecution on Friday raided eight locations believed to be linked to the scandal, including the home of the former president of the K-Sports Foundation Jung Dong-choon. It already raided the headquarters of the FKI and the two foundations, Choi’s home and office, and offices of the Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism.The Ministry of Education also launched a special probe into allegations that Choi’s daughter had received unlawful favors from Ewha Womans University in regards to her admission and grades.By Yoon Min-sik","lawyer told reporters friday ,with prosecutorial investigation closing ,her late mentor choi ,from germany for questioning ,prosecutorial investigation closing in","['Choi Soon - sil ’s', 'Korea', 'Germany', 'Choi', 'Park Geun - hye ’s', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Lee Gyeong']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55428892  0.45500913

A case of one such malicious rumor, according to the source, was a claim that the mass defection of China-based North Korean restaurant workers was a result of Seoul kidnapping them. These rumors also claimed that the workers have gone on a hunger strike in protest of the Seoul government.North Korea is believed to be operating around 60 propaganda websites. Pundits said these rumors are an inexpensive and effective way of spreading pro-North sentiment while undermining the South Korean government. Some call for extreme measures, such as a direct crackdown on the media and people.Lee Sang-ho, a political science professor from Daejeon University, said the North is attempting to raise doubts on South Korean policymakers through these methods. “By attacking the credibility of a country’s leader and policymakers, nullifying their leadership and dividing public opinion, they can make people distrust each other. This is enough to threaten the very existence of that country,” he said in his report titled “SNS-based cyber Psychological Attacks and Their Countermeasures.” “For this , our country may need to consider at least partial control of media and the internet, from a strategic standpoint,” he wrote.But other experts including Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said while online propaganda has increased compared to the past, the pro-North rumors and online postings are unlikely to have a huge impact on the public’s opinion.“The public has a way of acquiring various information about the North, which helps them gain a relatively objective perspective about it,” he said. “But if Pyongyang continues to up its effort  and apply a wide-range of pressure on South Koreans, it may have some effects.” The communist country is believed to be increasing its efforts in cyberattacks under orders from its leader Kim Jong-un. Kim has also ordered his people to work toward completing nuclear strike capacity against the Seoul-Washington alliance, resulting in an unprecedented double nuclear test this year and multiple test launches of ballistic missiles.Lim Jong-in, a professor at the graduate school of information security at Korea University, pointed out that cyberterrorism is appealing to poorer countries as it yields large impact at low cost.According to the Ministry of National Defense, North Korea has 6,800 specialists on cyberterrorism. But the actual number is believed to be over 10,000, while the number for Seoul is around 600.Likening the cyberattacks to “the next nuclear weapon,” Lim stressed that the government needs to work on coming up with countermeasures, human resources and regulations that can defend against cyber threats from the North.By Yoon Min-sik","conduct cyber psychological warfare ,focuses on hacking attacks ,online propaganda in korea ,team for online propaganda ,cyber psychological warfare in","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North ’s', 'South Korea', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67644072  0.60608864

In South Korea’s hyper-competitive and fast-changing society, many mid-career professionals, too, fancy a rural life. This younger group is choosing rurality not to retire, but to have a more fulfilling working life in a healthier environment away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Many are drawn by the rural way of living and being able to reconnect with nature, but one major factor is also the newfound interest in agriculture as a promising industry of the future. “The population migration from urban to rural areas started to occur in meaningful numbers in Korea in around 2006 and has since been accelerating,” says Kim Kwi-yeong, the director of the Gwinong Gwichon Support Center, a government-run center to support urbanites who are considering settling down in the countryside. The center, established in 2012, provides classes, consultation sessions and field trips to help them to prepare for the rural life. Its programs drew nearly 18,000 people last year, she said. Statistics vary on how many Koreans actually swap urban convenience for a life close to nature. But the Agriculture Ministry’s data shows that nearly 10 percent of South Korea’s 3.56 million rural population are newcomers as of last year. Some experts predict that in the next five years or so, they will account for nearly 40 percent. Retiring baby boomers -- now in their 60s -- are the main force behind the move, while those in their 30s and 40s are a significant minority, accounting for about 30 percent of the total. But it is these younger people that many agricultural experts and government officials pin high hopes on to reinvigorate waning rural economies and communities and bring innovations to the country’s farming sector. For this reason, rural governments have rolled up their sleeves to attract trendy, young and aspiring farmers. Buyeo in South Chungcheong Province earlier this year opened a “smart farming” town equipped with cutting-edge Internet of Things technologies and is wooing urbanites with various support packages to relocate there. In this race, North Gyeongsang Province is a front-runner, reporting a population growth of 3,600 annually. Yet, realistic and thorough preparations are essential for successful settlement in rural areas, experts say. “Farming is never to be looked down on, and it is actually like running a business -- only more difficult as the environment is not full of help as it is in the cities,” said Kim. A former solider and now four-year farmer, Yeom Deok-gi, says one must be ready, to some degree, to let go of the material life to be able to truly enjoy the beauty of rural living. “For me,  the quality of living has clearly improved,” he said. By Lee Sun-young","retirees dream of escaping ,professionals too fancy rural ,developed world retirees dream ,chasing rural dream ,retirees dream",['South Korea ’s'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.89918578  0.10866673

Public criticism and worries are mounting over the authority’s lax control over privately manufactured weapons, after a police officer was shot dead in what appears to be a premeditated attack using a self-made gun. The policeman was shot in the back by a criminal suspect, who was armed with homemade guns and was wearing a bulletproof vest and helmet, in northern Seoul at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to the police Thursday.  When the 45-year-old suspect, Seong Byung-dae, was apprehended, he was carrying six wooden guns, made with iron pipes attached to 30-centimeter-long wooden sticks, the police said. They later found 17 homemade guns, seven knives, a hammer and a homemade explosive device at the crime scene. Homemade guns possessed by the suspect in Wednesday night’s gunfight in Seoul A nine-time convict with a record of sexual assault and violence, Seong seemed to have carefully planned the attack, police said. They suspect he learned methods to make the weapons from the internet. The attacker seemed to hold a grudge against police, having made several posts via social media that signaled a future attack. “My purpose is to kill as many police officers as I can,” one post read. “A clash with the police is inevitable.” In the latest update, he uploaded a video on Sept. 11 showing directions from Gangbuk Police Station in Seoul to Opaesan Tunnel, where the fatal shooting took place Wednesday. He had written that he would “smash” police in two or three days. Seong has served a total of nine years and six months in prison and was last released in 2012.  The victim -- police officer Kim Chang-ho -- was dispatched to the scene after a report came in that a passerby was injured by the suspect. Many Koreans, who had believed the country to be at least free of gun crime, are shocked that detailed guides explaining how to make weapons at home are easily available online.In South Korea, only government-authorized personnel are allowed to carry guns. It also bans the act of uploading manufacturing methods for homemade guns or explosives on the internet, and doing so is punishable by up to two years in prison and a fine of 5 million won . The law has been in force since January.However, with authorities’ low level of supervision and lax restriction on the age of viewership regarding online videos and blog posts, experts say it is difficult for police to crack down on the manufacturing of homemade weapons. “Since people have easy access to online content that explains how to make homemade guns and explosives, it is difficult for police to keep an eye on controlling homemade weapons,” said Gwak Dae-kyung, professor of police administration at Dongguk University. “Considering that those videos and blog posts spread quickly online, constant monitoring of those contents will be the only way to control and prevent such crimes,” he added. Prevalent methods of manufacturing homemade weapons available online has not only led to lax control over weapons, but also allowed individuals to retrofit the crafted guns for stronger firepower.An anonymous comment on an online community read, “You can order components for an air rifle through a US online market and manipulate firepower by redesigning the gun.”Korea has seen several cases involving homemade guns over the past decade. In 2007, a 47-year-old man in South Chungcheong Province opened fire in a park after he had manufactured a gun with iron pipes and wooden sticks that he collected from a nearby construction site. In 2010, a 19-year-old high school student was caught testing out handmade guns and sharing methods to manufacture them on an online community. The student allegedly told police he gathered information from overseas websites and an encyclopedia, which helped him create a specially adapted gun with firepower three times stronger than a normal K2 rifle.

In a departure from the traditional method of learning through textbooks, students from KIS were given a chance to research, plan and design the actual bridges in their own labs as a part of KIS’ school-wide Applied Learning initiative.Through such an assignment, the school aims to encourage students to learn and apply the idea of Stanford Design Thinking Model, a vital part of the KIS curriculum in engineering courses, the school said. The Stanford Design Thinking Model requires students to first define problems, draw possible solutions and implement them. It consists of five steps: emphasize, define, ideate, prototype and test. To take the bridge-building project for KIS students as an example, the students questioned why and how human beings have built bridges over the centuries and studied bridge designs as well as various applications of technology before constructing the actual bridges. A student celebrates the success of her bridge design at Korea International School. The students for themselves laid out plans and drawings of potential bridge designs and recreated the bridges digitally through an engineering software program Computer Aided Design. Based on digital simulations, the students figured out how much stress the bridges could endure and identified areas that need to be reinforced. The students then built their actual bridges fused with their own personal flair and artistic embellishments after several attempts to make sure that angles and lengths are precise and fit perfectly. They also used a force sensor to analyze the weight applied to their bridges. Over the course of the project, the students analyzed how and why the bridges succeeded or failed in withstanding the weight, which KIS said helps them improve their future construction projects.In the coming weeks, students from KIS will design, plan, build and test interactive toys for their junior elementary school students. The children will test the prototype toys and give feedback to the students, the school said. Such projects for applied learning and hands-on activities take place not only for middle school students, but also for elementary and high school students from KIS, to help them enjoy the benefits of a “deep and lasting” education and develop abilities they need in whatever field they choose, KIS said.The Pangyo Elementary KoLABs allow students to take science, math and engineering concepts and use them to design and test real products. In the Seoul Campus Design Center, kindergarten students created solar powered cars that navigated successfully through a Lego city. The high school offers courses for students to build and program robotic devices to solve complex tasks. “We want to graduate highly educated students who shine in their universities and careers, but even more, we want to produce people with the creativity, breadth of knowledge, and global citizenship to positively change the world,” said KIS School Director Stephen Cathers. KIS, which first opened its doors to students in 2000, aims to help students gain problem-solving, decision-making and creative-thinking skills as well as academic success through curriculums with a focus on applied learning. The school has seen impressive admissions results with students admitted to such top schools such as the University of California, Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University.","eighth grade engineering students ,in class last week ,international school finally tested ,engineering students from korea ,class last week seventh","['Korea International School', 'KIS']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46997532  0.38020834

“I made more than 10 calls to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission the next morning to clarify some of the clauses in the law,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “But I failed to reach the agency because the line was always busy.”

Two weeks into the enforcement of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, commonly called the Kim Young-ran Act, confusion still persists in the daily lives of public servants, journalists and teachers. 

This week’s parliamentary audit has offered a hint at what might have gone wrong in the country’s preparation of the unprecedented law that aims to draw a line between accepted hospitality and bribery. 

Lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties criticized the law itself for being ambiguous and running counterculture. The government body in charge of preparing, promoting and enforcing the law substantially lacked preparation, which led to vast inconsistencies in the law’s interpretation and enforcement, they said.

“Is it corresponding to public common sense that students cannot even give carnations to their teachers on Teacher’s Day and offer a can of coffee to them in display of gratitude?” asked Rep. Kim Yong-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party. “On what grounds is it breach of law?”

The anti-corruption commission recently ruled that students offering cans of coffee or carnations and parents preparing picnic meals for teachers must be considered illegal. 

The law is aimed at curbing corruption and changing the long-held business culture of offering gifts to government officials in return for favors in South Korea. It bans public servants, journalists and private school teachers from giving and accepting a meal worth more than 30,000 won , gifts valued above 50,000 won or monetary payment of more than 100,000 won. 

Kim pointed out that the commission further confused the public by adding the concept of “direct conflict of interests.” According to the act, if there are “direct” conflicts of interests, any exchanges of meals, gifts and monetary payment, regardless of their monetary value, are prohibited.

Rep. Hong Il-pyo of the ruling Saenuri Party also dismissed the commission’s ruling as “excessive.”

“Why is a fresh carnation banned, but a carnation made of a piece of paper allowed on Teacher’s Day?” he queried. “The act holds tremendous power, but how it can serve as a code of conduct for the public when it is so unclear?” 

Sung Young-hoon, chief of the ACRC, confirmed the illegality of providing teachers with carnations and coffee. 

“Given the public nature of the education sector and the high expectations about integrity of the sector, even within the given criteria if the purpose of exchanging gifts is not to conduct one’s duty, the action could be seen as a violation of the law,” Sung said. “But it is not likely to be punished because it is an extremely minor case.”

“In most cases, the anti-graft act is not unclear. Solicitation is when someone asks for something impossible to be done by someone else by offering favors,” he said. 

Lawmakers also questioned the government’s willingness to enforce the anti-graft act, citing a shortage of staff members at the anti-corruption agency handling inquiries from the public. 

“I doubt the government’s willingness to root out corruption. The commission asked for 73 more staff members to handle the anti-graft act, but the Interior Ministry only added five to the team this year,” said Rep. Choi Woon-yeol of the Minjoo Party of Korea.

Choi revealed the nine officials at the ACRC had responded to some 6,800 questions from the public since the law was passed in March 2015. Through Oct. 3, the organization received an average of 358 inquiries per day, which means each member of the team handled about 40 a day.

The chief of the ACRC said during the parliamentary audit that only 1,250 out of 6,400 questions had been answered as of Tuesday.






Sung Young-hoon, chief of the Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission, attends a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. 



Until the act came into force, the government had one year and six months to prepare. But all the government did was form a task force comprising nine people and force them to respond to nearly 7,000 inquiries,” he said. 

Rep. Sim Sang-jung of the minor Justice Party urged the government to set out more clear and detailed standards and rules. 

“The anti-graft act is a stepping stone for our society to become a transparent society, but the commission should be more active in detailing sub-standards and defining what can be seen as social customs and illicit solicitation.”

The public largely remain positive on the anti-graft act, with 7 in 10 Koreans in favor of the law, a recent survey showed. 

According to the poll of 1,009 Koreans, 71 percent said it was a good thing, 15 percent said it was wrong and 14 percent remained undecided. Of those in favor of the act, 31 percent expected the law to eradicate corruption.

He is also suspected to be a key figure behind the creation of two foundations -- Mir and K-Sports -- and their “phenomenally successful” fundraising among top conglomerates. According to opposition lawmakers and local media, which made a series of allegations about him this week, the 46-year-old ad director is “the most powerful man” in Korea’s cultural scene, peddling influence behind the scenes with his connections to powerful people. “No previous administrations have offered such favors to private organizations run by the president’s inner circle,” Rep. Park Jie-won, an interim leader of the third-biggest centrist People’s Party. “Who on earth are Cha Eun-taek and Choi Soon-sil?” Choi, another figure at the center of the scandal and said to be close to Cha, is known as a friend of President Park.  While Choi, ex-wife of Park’s former aide Jeong Yun-hoe, has held no position in officialdom, Cha served in 2014 as a member of the Presidential Committee on Cultural Enrichment and then until April this year as head of a task force of government and private sector officials in charge of promoting President Park’s signature economic initiative known as the “Creative Economy.” Cha’s uncle Kim Sang-ryul served as Park’s senior secretary for education and culture in 2014, while his professor at Hongik University’s graduate school and long-time mentor Kim Jong-deok is now the culture minister.  Allegations raised against him so far have him deeply involved in the suspicious formation and management of Mir and K-Sports foundations, both allegedly run by Choi. Cha is also accused of using his connections to win ad contracts from government agencies as well as private companies like South Korea’s largest telecommunication firm KT, which was a state-run company before being privatized in 2002. In one of such claims, People’s Party Rep. Chae Yi-bae said that the regulator Financial Service Commission granted a contract to Cha’s advertisement firm Africa Pictures for its promotional campaign. Some reports suggested that Cha was granted “unusual access” to Park and allowed to have one-on-one talks with her -- privileges the director had allegedly bragged about. Cha denied the allegation in an interview with a local daily last week.  By Yeo Jun-suk","in political scandal famous ,scandal famous south korean ,political scandal famous south ,directed popular tv commercials ,political scandal famous","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Cha Eun - taek']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.91992736  0.56803089

Environmental problems will only get worse, more diverse and complicated, as long as civilization continues to develop along its current path. That’s why youths need to “bring inquisitiveness to ask questions why these problems are happening, where they come from and force answers,” the UNEP deputy director of environmental policy implementation said. Monika Macdevette, deputy director of Division of Environmental Policy Implementation at UNEP, poses for a photo during an interview with The Korea Herald. Even now, “there are a lot of different kinds of pollution that we don’t even consider to be pollution, like light pollution,” Macdevette told The Korea Herald in a recent interview. “Such pollution could lead to detrimental health effects.” Originally an environmental physiologist, the Nairobi-based officer was in Seoul last week to attend the UN Youth Conference on Environment, which wrapped up on Oct. 3 its four-day program mainly focused on recycling. Supported by Korea’s Environment Ministry and hosted by UNEP and World Federation of United Nations Associations, the event was first held in Seoul last year with the theme of water and sustainable development. “Now is the time when youths are implementing and achieving sustainable development goals,” Macdevette said. “It will become their world, their environment and their paradigm where they will grow up and live in.”There will be, and should be, more avenues and entry points for young people to take part in environment-related events and programs. But to bring about a more fundamental change, our education system must change, Macdevette continued.  “Education is a huge opportunity to influence one’s life from the early stage, so in my view, environment has to be in the education curriculum from the beginning.” She stressed that the education must incorporate the understanding of environmental connectedness, the relation between the Earth and mankind, as well as how we can be more eco-friendly in our daily life.  Many of the environmental issues come down to the question of how we, as consumers, use and throw away products, Macdevette said.“Production and consumption patterns are extremely important,” she said, adding that consumers can help bring about a swift route to a cleaner and greener economy, by using products more efficiently and disposing of them more responsibly. “The way we throw away things, whether we have used it or not, is important because it can end up being trash or otherwise. It could be a good resource for recycling,” she added.

Woo Byung-woo, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs At the center of this standoff is Woo Byung-woo, Park‘s senior secretary for civil affairs who has been embroiled in a series of bribery scandals. Historically, incumbent presidential aides have refused to take the stand. Parliamentary committees have no legal measure to enforce their attendance.  “The Saenuri Party is acting as a branch of Cheong Wa Dae,” said Rep. Ki Dong-min, spokesman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. “They are systemically undermining our efforts to hold the session as scheduled.” Last week, Saenuri lawmakers blocked their counterparts’ move to have Choi Soon-sil present at an audit session. Choi, known to be close with President Park, is accused of pulling strings to have conglomerates donate billions of won to two foundations she allegedly set up, including the Mir Foundation. To block the opposition parties from calling in Choi, Saenuri lawmakers at the Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee have invoked the authority to set up a deliberation committee and push back adopting the witness list for 90 days.  The Saenuri Party, for its part, blames the opposition bloc for hindering the legislative process to examine and scrutinize the administrative bodies, reiterating that the opposition parties’ attack over the scandal was “groundless.”“Opposition parties do not seem to care about important issues for the country,” said Rep. Kim Myung-yeon, Saenuri Party‘s floor spokesman. “I think the whole purpose of the parliamentary audit has been undermined.” The legislative deadlock is expected to dim the prospect of President Park’s aide testifying before the lawmakers as the Education and Tourism committee failed to agree on the witness list before the deadline for forcing the witness to take the stand. By law, the education committee was required to agree on who to call no later than Oct. 7 -- a week before its audit session ends this Friday. The assembly law stipulates that committees cannot force their witnesses to attend the audit unless the lawmakers inform the witness a week earlier. But the witnesses have often refused to take the stand, even if they were notified in advance, Assembly officials said. For instance, former Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo refused to attend the audit for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2015, even though he was notified a week earlier. Meanwhile, partisan fight over whether presidential aide Woo would appear for parliamentary audit is expected to escalate. The National Assembly’s House Steering Committee, dealing with inspection on presidential office, has instructed Woo to take the stand in a session set for Oct. 12.The House Steering Committee’s chairman Rep. Chung jin-suk, Saenuri whip who had acknowledged the need for summoning Woo, has vowed to block the move following a scuffle with the opposition parties over their pushing through with a motion recommending the dismissal of a cabinet member last month.By Yeo Jun-suk","with ongoing political scandals ,ongoing political scandals ,lawmakers opposition parties salivating ,rancorous week of parliamentary ,ongoing political scandals should",['Park Geun - hye'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.11100471  0.72133112

The Counstitutional Court Under the legislation, attorney hopefuls should enter professional law schools. The first enrollment began in 2009 and currently some 25 law schools operate nationwide. But the ruling, the result of a five-to-four-vote, gave legitimacy to the law’s purposes of “providing high quality legal services and effectively arranging national manpower by normalizing legal education and nurturing professional and international competitive talents.” “Though issues have been raised regarding the unfairness of some enrollment processes and slack curriculums, now is the time to join forces to help the law school scheme to take root and operate in earnest,” the verdict said. The student group issued a statement expressing regret over the decision, saying the fundamental constitutional rights were overshadowed by the “logics behind vested rights” and vowing to carry on with their campaign nonetheless. The issue has been the subject of a heated nationwide debate as critics argue that the new system would curb social mobility by abolishing the test, which is open to anyone irrespective of educational background, while only benefiting the haves who can afford to pay costly law school tuition. Advocates, in contrast, expect the decision to dilute academic elitism and expand a talent pool in a world dominated by sasi passers who studied in the very top echelons of schools.

The mother, identified by her surname Cho, had apparently drowned herself, while the sister, 26, was found hidden beneath blankets and plastic bags inside the storage cabinet of the house’s verandah. Ryu, whose age indicates he would be in elementary school, had ceased attending following the school entrance ceremony in March 2013, following his mother’s wishes to homeschool him. The school reportedly placed Ryu in a separate management file from June, as his absence continued.Ryu surfaced as a possible victim of child abuse this January after a neighbor raised suspicions.However, police, together with the children’s welfare center, found no signs of neglect or abuse on Ryu. The house was neatly kept. Ryu returned to school in February this year following the school’s repeated requests. He was placed in the fourth grade in accordance with his proper schooling age, as his test results showed high performance. But on his first day back at school, Ryu returned home early due to sickness. He alternated between leaving early and reporting absent until Sept. 9, after which he did not turn up to school at all. Ryu reportedly suffered anxiety when he was away from his mother. The school said Ryu’s mother promised to send him back from Sept. 19, after the national mid-autumn holidays, but she was unreachable since. Police discovered the body of Ryu’s mother on Sept. 20 along the Nakdong River in Seongsan-myeon, Goryeong-gun, North Gyeongsang Province. The discovery led police to search the home of the deceased, whereupon they discovered the body of Ryu’s older sister inside a verandah cabinet. The cause of the 26-year-old sister’s death has not yet been determined.Police also discovered a note written in a child’s scribble inside the house. Titled “suicide note,” it read, “Please give my cross-stitch and origami books to those who like them or are poor.”Investigation into Ryu’s whereabouts immediately began, though they yield no results for 13 days. On Wednesday at 11:10 a.m., a Goryeong Fire Department rescue worker found a body of a boy floating in vegetation near Samunjin Bridge, some 10 kilometers upstream from where mother Cho’s body had been found. Police confirmed the dead boy was Ryu and said an autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of his death.By Lim Jeong-yeo","year old found dead ,suicide was found drowned ,on wednesday yonhap police ,missing since sept 15 ,was found drowned","['Daegu', 'Ryu Jeong - min', 'Beommul - dong', 'Daegu', ""Ryu Jeong - min 's""]",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62504137  0.2871314

At a glance, her job prospects look bright. Besides a degree in business administration from a prestigious university in Seoul, she has a near perfect English score and Chinese language skills, as well as various overseas internship experiences. “I could not get a job last spring  after being rejected 10 times,” Chung told The Korea Herald after sending applications to two conglomerates. “I cannot help but apply for random recruiters now to raise my chances of landing a job.” Amid the tough job market, Chung is one of millions of job seekers struggling to find employment despite having seemingly sufficient qualifications. A shortage of quality jobs for highly educated job seekers on the back of the continued economic downturn has pushed job seekers to state more credentials in their resumes to differentiate themselves.The trend has coined a new term “spec,” which is short for “specifications,” referring to qualifications such as educational background, grades, English test score, volunteer activities and career experiences listed on a job candidate’s resume. The conventional recruiting process at major companies demands job seekers submit application forms including photos, qualifications and personal statements. Only a handful of candidates successfully advance to the final rounds of interviews after thousands of applications are screened based on their specs. “Now, everyone seems to have similar specs. I don’t know what else I can do to set myself apart from other candidates,” Chung said. “While focusing on filling my resume with all these credentials, I have less time to learn about companies and positions I apply for.” As part of last-ditch efforts, Chung is now on a diet and takes profile pictures every six months, as she believes that the appearance of female job candidates matters in the hiring process. Park Sung-joon, a 27-year-old student of engineering at a Seoul-based university, also echoed similar frustrations. “It takes at least a year to equip myself with all the specs, though I don’t think they are necessarily relevant to jobs I want,” said Park, referring to requirements that ask for certificates on one’s knowledge of Chinese characters or Korean history. With the fierce competition among job seekers, young undergraduates like Park spend much of their time and money trying to gain these specs even when they are not necessarily relevant to jobs. According to a survey on 569 job seekers by the job portal site Saramin this year, 71.7 percent of respondents thought that they lagged behind others in terms of their specs. The survey showed that respondents have worked for unreasonably low-pay only to accumulate experience , taken private education to prepare for job interviews and written tests , acquired unusual certificates such as those for baristas  and launched their own startups  to boost their resumes. Park also spent a year in the United States to study English and participate in an internship program, which cost him a huge amount of money and time. He postponed graduation to study for an upcoming test to qualify as an overseas project coordinator. “As I grow older, while spending much time polishing my resumes, I fear that I might have less chances to land a job,” he said. “Without financial help from parents, it is really difficult to build up all the specs at a relatively young age.” “Companies tell us to make our own life story, but only those who are affluent are able to accumulate enough experiences to create an appealing story, ” he said. Yang Ji-hoon, who has worked in a human resources team for a publishing company in Seoul for nearly four years, pointed out that employers are not seeking excessive efforts to collect specs only to fill application forms. “Companies cannot help but filter job candidates with quantitative measures such as an English test score  educational backgrounds,” he said. “But those with good specs are not necessarily competent employees in the field.” According to the nation’s largest job portal site Saramin, the qualifications of job seekers registered on its website improved in 2015, compared to two years ago. Nearly 22 percent of the job candidates had internship experience last year, up 3.4 percent from 2013. Their English test TOEIC score also increased to 752 from 728, the survey said. “It doesn’t matter how many specs they have. The specs should be relevant to jobs they apply for,” Yang said, citing examples of new employees leaving companies after failing to adjust to their jobs. In South Korea, nearly 1 in 3 newly hired employees  quit within a year, according to a 2016 survey on 306 firms by the Korea Employer’s Federation. The poll showed that 49.1 percent of them left work after failing to adapt to their companies, followed by those discontented with the pay and welfare  and those unhappy with their work environment  Amid mounting criticism against the economic and social costs of the spec-based recruiting system, a growing number of Korean companies have declared that they will not take into account such specs in the hiring process. According to a 2015 survey by the Federation of the Korean Industries on 21 major conglomerates, 20 companies including Samsung, Hyundai Motor, SK and LG have deleted parts of application forms requiring personal information not related to jobs. Some 10 companies -- including Lotte, Posco and GS -- conducted a screening process after concealing information of job seekers’ universities and majors in application forms. But job applicants said that such application systems put bigger pressure on them. “I don’t really believe that  no-spec policy works in reality. A no-spec application system only makes me wonder what I should do to better distinguish myself from others,” said the student Park. According to a survey by Saramin in 2015 on 439 job candidates, 79.7 percent of respondents said they felt more pressured about preparing for their applications after the “no-spec” application system surfaced. As reasons behind the excessive competition among job seekers, experts cite companies’ spec-focused hiring system as well as a severe mismatch between highly educated job candidates’ expectations and available jobs. “Without companies giving clear guidelines to evaluate job candidates, students tend to rely on collecting specs like certificates and language test scores so as not to lag behind other candidates,” said An Sang-jin, deputy director of the nonprofit group The World Without Worries About Shadow Education. “This is a huge waste of time and money for the society.”“Korean students have focused on entering prestigious universities rather than pursuing vocational training because companies have discriminated against high school graduates or graduates from lesser-known universities in the hiring process,” he said. “There should be a legal ban on such discrimination to reduce unnecessary education costs.” Despite a steady fall in the university entrance rate, 69.8 percent of high school graduates in South Korea still pursue higher education at four-year universities, according to the Education Ministry. “When students are highly educated and qualified, they expect to hold high-paying, stable jobs,” said researcher Kim Yoo-bin at the Korea Labor Institute. “School systems should offer students a chance to explore their interests and careers, which will help lower the university admission rate and resolve the mismatch.” The fundamental problem, however, lies in the structure of the country’s labor market, where there are widening gaps in the competitiveness between large and small companies and in the treatment of regular and non-regular workers. Highly educated job seekers are reluctant to find work in irregular positions due to low mobility from non-regular to regular jobs, and to be employed at small and medium-sized enterprises amid worries over poor working conditions there. The job seeker Chung also said that she would prefer to work for large companies or banks rather than SMEs. “Larger companies offer a higher salary and more stable working environment,” she said. “I want to stay in a job for a long time.”The monthly wages of irregular workers stood at an average of 1.41 million won , less than half the wages of regular workers at 3.47 million won per month as of March, according to government data. Many irregular workers are excluded from welfare benefits, overtime pay and paid holidays. According to the Small and Medium Business Administration, workers for SMEs took home 1.98 million won per month on average in the first half of this year, which was 61.6 percent that of employees at conglomerates who received an average of 5.15 million won. “The disparity between conglomerates and SMEs in terms of working hours, wage and job stability should be reduced to curb the current job mismatch,” Kim said. “It is important for the government to decrease the level of financial assistance for conglomerates and focus on offering subsidies and tax benefits to SMEs for them to improve their working conditions.”According to a survey on 11,155 SMEs released last year by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Resources, 95.3 percent of the job vacancies were concentrated in companies with less than 500 employees.Ban Ga-woon, a researcher at the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, said that the high unemployment should not be seen as a result of individuals’ lack of efforts.“The growing competition among job seekers should also not be viewed as a result of individuals’ greed,” he said. “As long as there are gaps between conglomerates and SMEs, regular workers and non-regular workers, men and women, job seekers will likely continue to compete to collect specs.”By Ock Hyun-ju","to cafe every morning ,cafe every morning ,tough job market prompts ,prestigious university in seoul ,cafe every morning to","['Chung Yu - jin', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36539882  0.96458989

Kim Jong-dae of the minor opposition Justice Party, 230 of the Army’s 550 helicopters have been in operation for 30 or more years. The standard lifespan of a helicopter for the South Korean Army is 30 years.Rep. Kim Jong-dae Kim, the floor spokesman for his party, pointed out that the aged aircraft had not undergone upgrades that could expand their lifespan. “In such a case, deterioration or erosion of helicopter parts raises the possibility of an accident. Soldiers are forced to carry out operations with this liability,” Kim said.Army data obtained by Kim showed that there have been 9 helicopter-involved accidents in the Army during the past 10 years, killing 14 soldiers.In February, a UH-1 Iroquois chopper crashed, killing three of its passengers. An Army investigation found that the helicopter’s aging hydraulic system had failed, causing a loss of control of the aircraft.The helicopter involved in the accident was brought into the country in 1973, with the model itself being developed in the 1950s.In 2008, another UH-1H helicopter crashed into a mountain and left all seven of its passengers dead. It was later revealed that the helicopter lacked critical devices such as a ground proximity warning system.All 60 of the Army’s UH-1 helicopters are over 30 years old, with the oldest being used in the field since 1966. Of the Army’s 210 MD 500 helicopters, 160 are over 30 years old.Although the Army is gradually replacing the UH-1Hs with locally developed KUH-1 Surion helicopters, this process won’t be complete until 2022. The MD 500s are to be used until 2031.Military officials say lack of budget is preventing them from immediately replacing the aircraft.“The tendency to allocate most of the budget to offensive weapons has forced the Army to retain equipment that threatens the safety of our soldiers.  must make sure that the cited equipment is either upgraded or removed,” Kim said.By Yoon Min-sik","korean army is 30 ,aging army choppers ,the army 550 helicopters ,aging army choppers pose ,half of the helicopters","['the south korean Army', 'Kim Jong - dae', 'Justice Party', 'Army', 'the south korean Army', 'Kim Jong - dae']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15378016  0.79439741

The second day of the parliamentary questioning on foreign and North Korean affairs focused on the deepening security crisis following North Korea’s latest nuclear test, along with plans to install advanced US missile defense assets here and the ongoing efforts at the UN Security Council to slap new sanctions against North Korea. Floor leaders Rep. Woo Sang-ho  of The Minjoo Party of Korea, Rep. Chung Jin-suk of the Saenuri Party and Rep. Park Jie-won of the People‘s Party talks during the interpellation session at the National Assembly on Wednesday. Many ruling and even some opposition lawmakers stressed the need to bring back the US’ tactical atomic devices for more solid deterrence, while some Saenuri Party members urged Seoul to launch its own bomb-making program.  “Even now we should consider a redeployment of the tactical nuclear weapons, development of our own nuclear weapons, strike on North Korea’s nuclear facilities and breakdown of the Kim Jong-un regime,” Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Saenuri Party said. “We ought no longer to hesitate on fears of the international community’s sanctions or a possible conflict with China or any other excuses. It’s time to resolve the North Korean nuclear issues once and for all.” Rep. Kim Jin-pyo of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea proposed a conditional stationing of the US weapons until the North Korean threats are cleared, saying the recent fifth underground explosion ushered in the emergence of a “game changer.” “As the 1991 inter-Korean denuclearization declaration has virtually become a dead letter, we could secure national consensus for the conditional redeployment, through the nuke-for-nuke principle and balance of terror,” he said. “We should deliver our clear message to China and Russia that we have no option but to bring back the tactical weapons if they keep pretending to join sanctions without actually taking substantive steps.” While dismissing the “balance of terror” concept, Saenuri Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun, an opponent to Seoul’s own nuclear program, said it is more realistic to set up a “concrete action plan” that the US weapons would be reinstalled if North Korea crosses the “red line” by carrying out another detonation or long-range missile liftoff.  “What we can do now is deploy such US assets, such as a strategic bomber or a nuclear-powered submarine,” Yoon said. Top officials, however, rejected the lawmakers’ calls, seeking to reassure them of Washington’s extended deterrence involving its nuclear umbrella, reaffirmed recently by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. “We stand by the denuclearization principle and the pursuit of a nuclear-free world together with the international community,” Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said, taking issue with the notion that a nuclear attack should be answered by another nuclear attack. “The government’s position is that we will respond through cooperation with the US.” Defense Minister Han Min-koo also emphasized the significance of the allies’ “tailored deterrence strategy” in dealing with the North Korean threats. “Deterrence is key to counter nuclear threats,” he said. “Our goal is to mobilize all our available means to prevent the North from using its nuclear weapons and to make it abandon them.” Earlier in the day, the National Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Pyongyang’s fifth atomic experiment and urging it to forgo its nuclear program. The text also calls for Seoul to craft countermeasures to the North’s nuclear weapons, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, while intensifying diplomatic efforts to bring the regime back to the stalled denuclearization talks.

The Korea Meteorological Administration said the quake took place at 8:33 p.m. with the epicenter located some 11 kilometers south of Geongju city.The KMA said the latest quake was an aftershock of the earthquakes that occured on Sept. 12. The earlier quakes registered magnitudes 5.8 and 5.1, respectively, with the former being the strongest temblor detected by the KMA around the Korean Peninsula since 1978.The Ministry of Public Safety and Security said emergency centers in Daegu, Ulsan and North Gyeongsang Province -- two major cities near Gyeongju and the province where the quake-hit city is located -- received a total of 11 reports of damage. Firefighters were sent to the sites where damage reportedly occured for on-site inspections, the ministry said. As of 9:30 p.m., there were a total of 11,381 reports of people feeling tremors from across the country, it said.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn instructed officials to determine the extent of the damage from the aftershock and provide real-time information to the general public.  Hwang also instructed officials to ""maintain an emergency readiness posture and be thoroughly prepared"" to cope with the situation surrounding the latest aftershock. There were no immediate reports of major damages caused by the aftershock, with the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., the country's nuclear power supplier, reporting that all of its reactors are operating normally.Fire stations in Busan, South Korea's largest port south of Gyeongju, received thousands of quake-related reports, while some residents in Seoul, 371 km northweest of the epicenter, said they felt the tremor.The KMA said Monday's quake was the biggest aftershock among about 300 tremors detected since Sept. 12. Unlike the quakes that occurred a week ago, when services of the nation's biggest mobile messenger app KakaoTalk were partially disrupted apparently due to heavy traffic, the service provider reported no problems this time around. Some subway lines in Busan stopped for about one minute, but resumed operation, while a number of highspeed KTX trains were operating at slower speeds as a precautionary step.Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's No. 1 carmaker said it temporarily halted some production lines in Ulsan, near Gyeongju, for inspection. TV stations showed video footage of people in Gyeongju, Daegu and Busan rushing out of their apartments scared by the tremor.","after two strong earthquakes ,said the latest quake ,the latest quake ,aftershock of the earthquakes ,gyeongju magnitude earthquake struck","['Gyeongju', 'South Korea', 'the Korea Meteorological Administration', 'Geongju city', 'KMA']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2584542   0.63507503

Shin, citing poor health, has been asking investigators to visit him to carry out their probe. State prosecutors had originally summoned Shin to undergo questioning on Wednesday.Shin is suspected of dodging some 600 billion won  in taxes in the process of donating a combined 6.2-percent stake in Lotte Holdings, held in borrowed names, to his third wife, her daughter and his eldest daughter Shin Young-ja in 2006. Lotte Holdings is Lotte's de facto holding firm based in Tokyo.During Wednesday's meeting, Shin denied the allegations, saying he had ordered his employees to reduce the tax payment, not evade it, according to Shin's spokesperson Thomas Hong.""I will pay if anything ,"" he was cited by Hong as saying.Shin also claimed that the statute of limitation on the stock transfer issue has expired, according to the spokesperson.The prosecution has been investigating Lotte Group since early June over alleged slush funds, embezzlement and other irregularities.Last week, a Seoul court designated a nonprofit subsidiary of a local law firm as legal guardian of the founder, saying he lacks the ability to make business decisions due to illness and old age.","office prosecutors said thursday ,lotte in seoul starting ,prosecutors said thursday ,year old business tycoon ,prosecutors said thursday they","['Lotte Group', 'Shin Kyuk - ho', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Shin', 'Hotel Lotte', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69400549  0.99091518

According to the Seoul Songpa Police Sunday, the boy was reported missing around 2:20 p.m. on Saturday by his mother who had accompanied him to the kids’ cafe. The mother realized the boy was missing 30 minutes after she last saw him. The last record of him, recorded on a CCTV camera in the kids’ cafe, shows the boy running barefoot out the front entrance. Despite an immediate police search that combed the premises, the boy was found drowned in the nearby lake the next day at around 9:30 a.m.  The map of Seoul Olympic Park Due to the complete lack of CCTV cameras around the lake in which the boy’s body was found, the police are unable to discern whether the boy accidentally lost his footing or if some external force killed him. A total of 447 surveillance cameras are reportedly installed in the Olympic Park, however, 90 percent are placed inside sports stadiums and within the buildings on the premises. Some 50 cameras installed around the circumference are mostly in the parking lots, prompting the public to criticize the park’s lax security. Some are claiming more CCTV could have aided in a faster discovery of the missing boy’s whereabouts.The Olympic Park in Seoul is approximately 1.45 million square-meters in size.The police are contemplating an autopsy to learn the details of the boy’s death, however, the bereaved family is said to be opposing any damage to the child’s body.By Lim Jeong-yeo","found dead in lake ,dead in olympic park ,park on saturday internet ,boy found dead in ,lake in seoul olympic","['Seoul Olympic Park', 'the Seoul Songpa Police']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85697567  0.23589909

51,51,51,Why some men choose to enlist,"PFC Park Ju-won, 31, recalls the day he suited up to serve as a private second class in the Army. His superior had just scolded him for yawning in front of him.“I thought to myself, ‘this guy’s far younger than me and he tells me off just because he enlisted a bit earlier?’ These are the moments I have conflicting feelings (about the military),” he said. He immediately then thought, he did not even have to join ...","PFC Park Ju-won, 31, recalls the day he suited up to serve as a private second class in the Army. His superior had just scolded him for yawning in front of him.“I thought to myself, ‘this guy’s far younger than me and he tells me off just because he enlisted a bit earlier?’ These are the moments I have conflicting feelings ,” he said. He immediately then thought, he did not even have to join the military.All able-bodied Korean men are mandated by law to serve in the military for about two years. But for a handful of those who don’t have to, it is a matter of choice.Park was among those who could become exempt from mandatory service but volunteered to enlist, and his story was featured among others in a book released by the Military Manpower Administrations Thursday.It is set to be distributed to university libraries and diplomatic missions outside the country to “spread the culture of voluntary enlistment and healthy military culture.”“We expect the book to be a helpful guide to those about to serve, and inspire those in the force to have pride in themselves,” said an MMA official. YonhapA role of a mandatory serviceman is not a highly-coveted job in Korea. An Army sergeant -- the highest rank among enlisted men -- is paid 197,000  won per month, while a private second class makes 148,800 won. The legal minimum monthly wage for a 40 hour-a-week job is 1.26 million won.In addition to small wages, frequent violence and abuse by colleagues is also something the military has been attempting to root out.Although roughly half of the population are former soldiers, Korean men enjoy little benefit for their mandatory service compared to former soldiers in other countries.In 1999, the Constitutional Court ruled that the law allowing state-run corporations and government agencies to give extra credit to former servicemen during the hiring process was unconstitutional.Park could have avoided it all. He was a US green card holder and a tenure-track faculty at the Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. While the US green card technically only puts off military duty, those who do not enlist by the age of 37 are automatically exempt from duty. This effectively exempts green card holders living abroad from having to enlist.“I gave up money, time, opportunities and honor to be a Korean soldier. ... So people always ask me why,” Park said. He said the military gave him time to study and think about his future. It also gave him a chance to interact, and sometimes put up, with different types of people, contributing to his people skills.“You live a ‘controlled life’ in the military, but at the same time you learn to control yourself,” Park said. Many people think of time in the military as being wasted, but it can also be used as a turning point. It’s like a ‘halftime’ of your life, when you can plan what to do with the rest of your life.”Park Hyun-woo, 21, said his life before enlistment had consisted of playing video games, eating and nothing else. Exempted from duty for never going to middle school, he said the sense of fulfillment and the physical challenges he faced as a soldier helped him gain confidence to quit video games and move on with his life.For those living in Korea, voluntary enlistment can also be a practical choice. As the overwhelming majority of Korean men have served in the military, those who dodge mandatory service are sometimes frowned upon or ostracized by the public.Political bigwig Lee Hoi-chang was considered a front-runner in both the 1997 and 2002 presidential elections, but both times saw his support fall after allegations that his sons illegally dodged military service was publicized in the media.A 30-year-old Korean-American, currently working in Seoul, said he elected to serve in the military because he believed it would help him adjust better to Korean life.“Serving in the military made me understand better what Korean men were like. It helped me fit in once I got a job, since they were impressed with me enlisting when I didn’t have to,” he said.While it may be unconstitutional to favor those who have completed mandatory military service in hiring, some surveys indicate that companies continue to prefer them.A survey last year by recruitment website Saramin showed that 85.9 percent of companies prefer hiring those who served in the military.

The Central Zoo in Pyongyang sent the animal, also known as ""half-moon bear,"" along with tigers, red foxes and silver foxes, to the South Korean park under the program aimed at conserving animals indigenous to the Korean Peninsula.This 2009 file photo shows two Asiatic black bear cubs playing in a cage in Seoul Grand Park. The two were borne to a pair of Asiatic black bears -- the female Eutteum and the male Dandani. The female bear gave birth to six cubs, two each in 2006, 2009 and 2011, even though she was malnourished and blind. Five of the six cubs have been released at Mount Jiri in southern South Korea as part of an Asiatic black bear restoration project. ""Eutteumi showed strong mothering abilities and maternal affection,"" the park said in a statement. ""It was meaningful for her to raise her offspring for herself in spite of her disability.""The male, Dandani, which also came from the North and settled at the park with her, died in December 2012. Eutteumi had been experiencing epileptic seizures since June this year.A wild Asiatic black is known to live for up to 25 years. The park is trying to find out details on what caused her death.","program dies the female ,with tigers red foxes ,years old died tuesday ,black bear from korea ,old died tuesday","['Asiatic', 'North Korea', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul Grand Park', 'Eutteumi', 'the Central Zoo', 'Pyongyang', 'south korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68975776  0.50303465

During a press conference, Kim Hang-gon cited recent poll results that found a ""vast majority"" of Seongju residents wanted the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to be stationed in a new site rather than occupy the anti-aircraft missile base operated by South Korea's military. Seoul and Washington on July 13 said the site of the existing Seongsan battery is ideal for countering growing missile and nuclear threats from North Korea. Kim Hang-gon, the administrative chief of Seongju County, North Gyeongsang Province, speaks during a press conference in his county's office building on Aug. 22. ""I hope that the defense ministry picks a proper alternate site  that excludes the Seongsan  base,"" he said, noting that he felt that opposing the THAAD deployment without suggesting an alternative would not lead to a fundamental resolution of the issue.""Security is the cornerstone that props up the nation, and citizens cannot exist without a nation,"" he added.An area near the Lotte Skyhill Golf Course in northern Seongju has been emerging as a likely alternate site, especially since military officials view other sites suggested by residents in the past as being unsuitable due to the mountainous terrain and lack of roads that can make deployment difficult by the end of 2017.Before the press conference, some Seongju residents scuffled with the police while expressing their vehement opposition to any decision to station a THAAD battery in any part of the county.The opponents have been concerned that THAAD's powerful radar could pose health risks and hurt their crops. They also argue that the military asset could undermine the county's peaceful ambiance, and that the county could turn into a military target in case of an armed conflict on the peninsula.Meanwhile, Defense Minister Han Min-koo plans to brief ruling Saenuri Party leader Lee Jung-hyun on the THAAD deployment issue during a closed-door meeting at the National Assembly in the afternoon, a party official told Yonhap News Agency, declining to be identified.","of seongju on monday ,seongju on monday formally ,month during press conference ,seongju on monday ,defense ministry to pick","['Seongju', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Kim Hang - gon', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61698544  0.82002747

The app comes as a challenge to Snapchat, the vanishing message service that became a hit with teenagers and which lets members share pictures and video clips.Lifestage was seen by some as an effort by Facebook to stay connected to young internet users disinclined to take part in the leading social network.Facebook did not return an AFP request for comment.Earlier this month, Instagram put its own spin on a key Snapchat feature by letting users post ""Stories"" that eventually vanish from the Facebook-owned photo-and video-sharing app.Instagram Stories encourages people to share ephemeral collages of everyday moments on the app which has built a reputation for allowing people to post highlights from their lives or artistic works.","teenagers with new app ,release of new iphone ,afp facebook on friday ,of new iphone app ,new iphone app","['AFP', 'iPhone', 'Lifestage', 'iPhone']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70185089  0.3633965

Its morning low was 29 degrees Celsius.The KMA said Sunday that Seoul saw a total of 16 days stricken by the heat wave since June 1, the highest number since 29 days were observed in 1994.Heat wave days as classified as when the daytime high reaches over 33 degrees Celsius. People walk past a pedestrian crossing while the air simmers over a road amid the heat wave that has swept across South Korea. YonhapThe KMA added that heat wave warnings were announced for 11 consecutive days this year. The warning is announced when the temperature hits 35 degrees Celsius and continues for at least two consecutive days. The tropical night phenomena also continued for almost every day during the past month, with the nighttime low at over 25 degrees Celsius, it added.The KMA said earlier this month that the record-breaking hot summer weather had been influenced by weather in northern China.It explained that heated air that was created in northern China had risen to a high altitude and moved across southern Russia and the Korean Peninsula, before descending on South Korea. The migration happened at the same time as a high pressure system formed over South Korea, preventing the formation of clouds and exposing the country to more sunlight.The KMA said that it was eyeing typhoon Chanthu, which was moving northward from near Tokyo as of Monday afternoon. Although typhoon Chanthu would not have a direct influence on the peninsula, the KMA said that it expects to see changes in atmosphere that could bring the temperature down.Meanwhile, the government said Friday the country’s total electricity use has set a new record.The maximum electricity usage soared to 85.18 million kilowatts on Friday, surpassing the previous record of 84.97 million kilowatts set Thursday.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the electric power reserve ratio also went down to 7.22 million kilowatts.If the figure falls below 5 million kilowatts, a state alarm is automatically issued.Local retailers also said they saw record-high sales of air conditioners and fans, as consumers tried to cope with the hot weather. According to local electronic goods retailer Lotte Hi-Mart, this summer saw the highest number of air conditioners sold since 2012. The sales volume of fans also increased by 60 percent on-year.Industry workers said that the number of fans sold over the first 11 days in August already surpassed the total amount sold in August last year. It added that most consumers purchased energy-saving models amid continued public concern regarding electricity bills and the progressive electricity rating system. Responding to such concerns, the government and ruling party announced Thursday they would slash electricity bills for households from July to September this year.Of the 40 models of air conditioners sold at Lotte Hi-Mart, the top 10 best-selling models were marked as first grade energy-saving devices. Industry sources predicted the total sales of cooling devices would reach a new record as the sweltering heat is to continue for several more weeks. “We are trying to push manufacturers to produce more electronic devices following customer demand, but it is not easy since factories have a fixed capacity to manufacture goods,” an official from Lotte Hi-Mart was quoted as saying.By Kim Da-sol","most heat wave days ,over the weekend seoul ,abnormal heat wave seoul ,wave days this summer ,the weekend seoul continued","['Seoul', 'Busan', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Meteorological Agency']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.96523875  0.74482781

58,58,58,[FEATURE] DNA test reunites Korean adoptee with birth mother,"Kyung Eun Davidson’s earliest memories are of missing her birth mother. Born in 1983 in South Korea, she grew up in Oregon after being adopted by a couple in the U.S. in 1986. Ever since she was 3, Davidson would constantly daydream about her birth mother throughout her childhood.“I remember wishing every night she would come back,” the 33-year-old, who currently lives in Everett, Washington, told The Korea Herald...","Kyung Eun Davidson’s earliest memories are of missing her birth mother. Born in 1983 in South Korea, she grew up in Oregon after being adopted by a couple in the U.S. in 1986. Ever since she was 3, Davidson would constantly daydream about her birth mother throughout her childhood.“I remember wishing every night she would come back,” the 33-year-old, who currently lives in Everett, Washington, told The Korea Herald. “I’ve never remembered a time that I did not miss her and want to be with her. My adoptive mother told me that when I was 4 years old I was crying because I could not remember what my mother’s face looked like anymore.”About 30 years after she left Korea, Davidson was surprised to learn earlier this month that she had finally located her birth mother.  On Aug. 3, on a whim, she transferred her DNA information to a free third-party website called GEDmatch where DNA information collected from Korean birth families is shared by a group of Korean adoptees. She had obtained her DNA information two years ago and kept it in a different database. “By the next morning I saw that I had a very close match and within 48 hours I was talking to my mother on KakaoTalk,” she said.Davidson was adopted by her adoptive parents in the U.S. at the age of 3 and grew up in Oregon. Davidson is the first Korean adoptee to have found her birth mother through the DNA matching service provided by 325Kamra, a nonprofit group comprised mainly of mixed-race Korean adoptees in the U.S. The testing was launched earlier this year to help Korean adoptees learn more about their heritage as well as to help those with positive DNA matches to potentially reunite.In April, the organization brought 300 DNA kits to Korea, one of which was given to Davidson’s birth mother. After just about three months since her mother’s DNA was collected and uploaded on GEDmatch, they were able to find each other.“It’s been an amazing, crazy and wonderful experience,” she said. “The fact that Kyung Eun didn’t have to do anything other than provide her sample, as did her mom, shows how effective our methodology is,” said Bella L. Siegel-Dalton, a representative of 325Kamra. “Had Kyung Eun transferred her results to GEDmatch sooner, she would’ve known sooner. Her mother’s DNA was sitting in the database waiting for her. Right now there are over 100  families’ DNA samples also waiting.”The game changer South Korea remains one of the largest sources of overseas adoptees in the world, having sent about 200,000 children abroad over the past six decades. Ever since the nation’s adoption law was revised in 2012, guaranteeing an adoptee’s right to request his or her birth records, those asking for their personal files to find their birth families have increased dramatically. While 258 adoptees asked to see their information in 2012, 1,324 did so last year. However, only 14.7 percent of some 4,790 adoptees who requested their files between 2012 and 2015 were able to reunite with their families, according to data released by Rep. Lee Jong-kul of the Minjoo Party of Korea. One of the biggest reasons behind this is the mass forgery of documents in the 1970s and ’80s in Korea -- children’s identities were falsified before they were sent overseas for adoption. Many adoptees acquire their birth records only to find out information in them is incorrect. A lot of them are also told lies or turned away when they ask for information at adoption agencies, although the Korean law currently guarantees their right to access their files. For adoptees born in the ’50s and ’60s whose birth parents have reached old age, their time is running out. Since 2012, the South Korean government has been offering assistance to adoptees in their search for their birth family. But Siegel-Dalton from 325Kamra said the service has been extremely ineffective. “The program is understaffed and relies on paperwork and files that are often incorrect,” she told The Korea Herald. “DNA is the only foolproof way of ensuring a true match. Even if the birth parents are deceased, a close family member can test and reunite the adoptees with their birth family, such as cousins, uncles and grandparents.”Davidson in fact stayed in Korea from 2005-2007 to find her birth mother. But when she visited her adoption agency, Holt, the staff said they couldn't give her information about her mother without her birth father’s consent. Davidson did reunite with her birth father, who gave her up for adoption when she was 3, but after their first meeting in 2007 he soon disappeared without telling her anything about her mother’s whereabouts. Devastated, Davidson returned to the U.S. that year, feeling like there was nothing left for her in Korea. “I grew up wondering what was so wrong with me that my own parents didn’t want me. It felt like confirmation that there was something about me that was unlovable,” she said, when asked about how she felt about her father walking away. “It wasn’t just my father I lost, but also any hope of finding my mother,” she said. Earlier this month Davidson realized once again that Holt had lied to her about how she was given up for adoption. In 2006, the agency had told Davidson by email that her birth mother had made a “huge scene at her father’s workplace and then abandoned her on his door step.” But in 2007 her father told her a different account. This month, Davidson learned her birth mother never agreed to put her up for adoption. “My mother told me she did not know I had been given up for adoption until eight years ago,” she said.‘I would’ve never let her go’Lee Eun-soo , Davidson’s birth mother, thought for more than 20 years that her daughter was being raised by her father or his family. She raised Davidson alone for the first three years of her daughter’s life, and decided to have her raised by her father whom she thought was more financially capable of supporting her. “I breastfed her until she was 3,” she told The Korea Herald. “She was all I had. It was just me and her in our little room.”Every year, she would call him on Davidson’s birthday to ask him to wish her “Happy Birthday.” “He would always say something like, ‘Don’t worry, she’s doing fine,’” Lee said. “I would’ve never let her go if I knew he was going to put her up for adoption. I never gave him my consent.”It was in 2008 that Lee found out her daughter was never registered in the father’s family registry. When she asked for an explanation and demanded to see her daughter, Davidson’s father confessed that he had given her up for adoption in the ’80s.Shocked, Lee visited Holt that year, but the agency did not tell her that Davidson had lived in Korea from 2005-2007, and that she had visited the agency to search for her too.  Kyung Eun Davidson, the first Korean adoptee to have found her birth mother through the DNA matching service provided by 325Kamra. “I was really surprised to learn  that my daughter was living in Korea in the 2000s,” she said. “No one, including her father who apparently met her in 2007, ever told me anything.”Lawyer So Ra-mi from Gonggam Public Interest Lawyers said all birth parents should be able to access their children’s records, especially if they were put up for adoption without their consent. The current Special Adoption Law does not state anything on birth parents’ right to request to see their children’s adoption files as well as to get in touch with them. While this does not mean birth parents have no legal grounds to access the records, So said a revised version of the law could specifically guarantee birth parents’ right to information on their children’s adoption. The bill is to be submitted for review to the National Assembly by the end of this year.Katherine Kim Bradtke, another representative of 325Kamra, said DNA testing is what bypasses the dependency on adoption agencies for information.“It completely circumvents the nonsense that agencies give to birth families and adoptees,” she said. ‘Government’s responsibility’The South Korean government -- not a nongovernmental organization -- should set up a central DNA bank and take full responsibility for having “endorsed, institutionalized and legitimized the adoption of 200,000 Koreans to the West,” said Tobias Hubinette, a Korean adoptee and associate professor of intercultural studies at Karlstad University in Sweden.The Korean government should also encourage adoptees as well as their birth parents and relatives to register and take DNA tests, he added. “If any country has an experience with broken and separated families, it is South Korea after decades of national division, mass overseas emigration and mass internal migration with hundreds of thousands of people searching for missing relatives,” said Hubinette, who is also a member of Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea.Hosu Kim, an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, as well as lawyer So Ra-mi, said the DNA information of Korean adoptees and their birth families should be archived and protected by a state-run agency. “Of course it’s something that the government should be doing, but they didn’t even start on it for such a long time,” said Professor Kim. “If the government can’t  because they lack experience, one way is to support those who can and who have the experience.”The state-run Korean Adoption Services currently has a pop-up page on their website that offers information on 325Kamra’s free DNA testing service for Korean birth families. Still, 325Kamra has only managed to collect some 100 DNA test kits from Korea. They brought 300 kits from the U.S. in April, but there are still many left unused at KoRoot, a guesthouse in Seoul where birth families can take the tests for free. Bradtke said more promotion is needed to get birth families tested. “We are aware that some suggestions have been made on DNA testing for adoptees and birth families and that the government should be doing more or even be in charge of the matching service,” said Kim Moon-jeong from the KAS, the Korean government agency that is in charge of adoption policies and birth family searches. “At this point we can’t make any statements on the matter.”Regardless, Bradtke encouraged all Korean adoptees who have already tested their DNA to upload their information on GEDmatch. She stressed anyone can use the site regardless of what DNA kit they used -- such as 23andme, FTDNA and ancestry.com -- and this can help them reunite with their birth families. Davidson and her mother also used different kits -- she used a 23andme kit two years ago, while her mother used a FTDNA kit provided by 325Kamra -- but the site still managed to notice they were a match, she said. “We know our system works. We just need to collect DNA from more birth families in Korea as well as from Korean adoptees worldwide.”‘Life’s dream come true’ Davidson said the constant upheaval in her childhood made it difficult for her to form lasting attachments with people. When she arrived in the U.S., she had scabies, lice and chickenpox which she developed during her days in an orphanage while waiting for her adoption. “My adoptive mother was furious about the condition I arrived in,” she said. “It has taken me a very long time to trust people, because I always feel like they are going to leave me. … It made relationships very difficult.”Even as a 3-year-old, losing her family and leaving her home country at the same time was a painful experience, she said. Davidson said she had Korean mannerisms and habits that were ingrained in her even from that short period in her life. When she arrived in the U.S., she refused to sleep on her bed for a while and insisted she wanted to sleep on the floor -- the way she used to in Korea. “I used to always cover my mouth when I laughed ,” she said. “I consciously made myself stop doing that in high school when my classmates told me they didn’t like it.”She said finding her birth mother lessened the impact of her birth father walking away. Davidson and her mother are currently planning to meet in person.“Rationally, I knew that my father didn’t disappear because I was unlovable. However, it was hard not to feel that it was my fault,” she said. “Since my birth mother found me, I finally feel like she did love and has always loved me. … I was so happy. It was a life’s dream come true.”Davidson said adoption agencies in Korea do not seem to know that their responsibility is to children and adoptees first and foremost. “They don’t know what is best for us. We do,” she said, recalling her experience during her search at Holt. “We are not commodities or products and their responsibility is not to their business or biological parents, but to us.”After 30 years of separation, the first thing Davidson told her mother, over KakaoTalk, was: “I miss you. I’ve always missed you.” By Claire Lee","missing her birth mother ,mother born in 1983 ,her birth mother born ,test reunites korean adoptee ,about her birth mother","['Kyung Eun Davidson ’s', 'South Korea', 'Oregon', 'U.S.', 'Davidson', 'Everett', 'Washington', 'the Korea Herald']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88704515  0.01577726

""Since I arrived here, I have always dreamed of wearing a white wedding gown.""Before fleeing to Seoul in 2011, she saw South Korean dramas with actresses wearing white dresses on their wedding day, which she thought was a fantasy that only happens in movies and dramas. It was quite a surprise for her, she recalled, to realize that wearing such a dress at weddings is a custom here.Seven North Korean defector couples walk down the aisle in a joint wedding ceremony at the Hoam Faculty House of Seoul National University on Aug. 6. ""Some North Koreans do wear the dress too, but it is only the very exceptional people,"" Lee said.In North Korea, most weddings are held in the traditional way, inviting over relatives and friends to the house of the bride and groom, Lee said. The bride's family first hosts a party before the newlyweds move to the house of the groom for another party. The couples usually wear hanbok, Korean traditional garments, she added. The 39-year-old Lee's mother, who also defected to the South, did not miss out on the chance when a local civic group posted an announcement, saying that South Korea's top university is looking for married defector couples who could not afford to hold a wedding ceremony on their own.As one of its social contribution projects, Seoul National University selected seven couples, ranging from their 30s to 60s, to host a group wedding at the Hoam Faculty House, funding all expenses.Some, like Lee and her husband, had fled the North with their spouses, while others met their partners in South Korea or China after fleeing.""Many defectors who suffer from financial difficulties dream of having a wedding ceremony like ordinary South Koreans,"" said Cho Kyoung-hee of the civic group Mulmangcho who was in charge of selecting the couples.""I am so happy that my dream came true in the most extraordinary way at this prestigious university,"" Lee said.The wedding was officiated by university president Sung Nak-in, with a dozen of its professors singing to congratulate the couples at the end of the ceremony. About 815 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the first seven months of this year. The accumulated number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea is expected to surpass the 30,000 mark by late this year.","other south korean bride ,couple holds second wedding ,south korean bride ,second wedding in south ,korean bride on her","['Lee Jin - young', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9981817   0.48774225

The North said that if all goes as planned the event can contribute to the eventual unification of the two Koreas.

They also said that Pyongyang could attack the South with its intermediate Musudan ballistic missiles.Musudan, launched for the first time this year, was assessed to have been fired successfully last month by pundits here. North Korea has been increasing its efforts to equip itself with ballistic missile capacities under orders from its leader Kim Jong-un.Bags of North Korea’s propaganda leaflets found along the Hangang River near Gimpo The leaflets were packed in plastic bags that were about 11 by 24 centimeters in size, with each bag carrying around 20 leaflets. They were recovered in the Gimpo area around the Hangang River estuary.“The analysis  showed that the bags carried just the leaflets. But there were possibilities that the bags could carry hazardous objects, which was why we felt the need to alert the press,” the JCS said in a media briefing.Officials said the leaflets were recovered by the Marine Corp. on a reconnaissance mission.Military officials said it is “plausible” that the spreading of the leaflets was aimed to test distribution routes via the Hangang River, which might be a prelude to sending other materials, such as hazardous materials, via river routes.

The 39-year-old man, surnamed Shin, died after falling off scaffold at 2:20 p.m. He was taken to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead two hours later. He sustained injuries to his face and neck as well as fractures in his arms and both legs. A 39-year-old worker, surnamed Shin, died after falling off scaffold at Hyundai Heavy Industries’ shipyard in Ulsan, Tuesday.This year alone, eight workers have lost their lives in occupational accidents while working at Hyundai Heavy Industries and its subsidiaries’ shipyard allegedly due to poor safety conditions there. Five of them were working for subcontracted firms. On May 11, a 30-year-old worker, surnamed Wi, who was working on a shipbuilding project for Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries, an affiliate of Hyundai Heavy Industries, died after falling off storage inside a crude oil carrier while working without safety fences. On May 10, a 41-year-old man, surnamed Kim, belonging to another Hyundai Heavy Industries’ subsidiary Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, died after falling from the ladder with a paint pot in one hand. Hyundai Heavy Industries has come under fire for outsourcing dangerous jobs to subcontracted workers and failing to improve unsafe working environments as well as dodging responsibility for safety-related work accidents. Park Hye-young, a labor attorney for the Solidarity for Worker’s Health, argued that his death was a preventable accident. “It is appalling that workers still have to die due to dangerous working conditions despite a series of similar kinds of deaths at Hyundai Heavy Industries’ shipyards,” she said. “This just shows the company’s indifference to workers’ deaths.”Over three years, 24 workers died while working for the shipbuilders. “Workers for subcontracting firms are exposed to bigger dangers because they have no labor unions to represent them,” she said. “Hyundai Heavy Industries should meet with its irregular employees to discuss safety measures to improve its working environment.” Meanwhile, the unions of Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Heavy Industries on Tuesday launched a partial strike in protest against the company’s plan to expand the peak wage system and freeze their wages for this year. The company has suffered massive losses in the wake of diminishing global demand and competition from Chinese rivals, with the government pressuring it to sell assets, cut its workforce and streamline businesses in return for financial aid.

The decision was reached in the absence of all nine labor representatives and two representatives from small businesses, who boycotted the vote. The small business representatives demanded a freeze in the wage hike and to categorize the wage increase per type and size of businesses.Upon the agreement, the ruling Saenuri Party asserted that the increase was modest enough to avoid job losses from businesses burdened with higher costs.“Considering the nation’s economic status and negative repercussions brought on by a dramatic increase in the minimum wage, we appreciate them having made a difficult decision. We should set aside unnecessary debate and join forces to reinvigorate the economy,” said the Saenuri Party’s spokeswoman Rep. Kim Hyun-ah. The conservative party also shared the concern among businesses that a higher minimum wage would harm the nation’s economy. The party’s chief policymaker Rep. Kim Gwang-lim urged high-income earners to avoid demanding pay increases and help with creating jobs. The Korea Employer Federation said Saturday that the 7.3 percent increase would add more uncertainty to the nation, which is already suffering from business restructuring and the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union. Small and medium business also voiced concern about the decision. The Korea Federation of Small and Medium Entrepreneurs warned Saturday that some SMEs might be unable to apply the rule as the new wage might be beyond their ability to pay. The opposition parties expressed concerns that the hike is too meager to address the widening gap between the rich and poor, and to help those below the poverty line make ends meet. They urged the government to seek at least a two-digit increase in the minimum wage.“The purpose of setting the minimum wage is to build a safety system to offer a basic livelihood,” said the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s spokesman Rep. Ki Dong-min. “But it is a shame that the increase rate is even below that of last year,” he said.The opposition party said that a two-digit increase would help bring the 10,000-won minimum wage to the nation by 2020 and that the government should come up with separate measures to lift the burden off self-employed workers and small businesses.The Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of the nation’s two largest labor unions, criticized the move, saying that the 7.3 percent increase was lower than expected and blaming the government for neglecting the worsening living conditions of low-income workers.

Lidia Tallone, as a missionary, came to the village in Gochang, 296 kilometers south of Seoul, which was a colony for lepers at that time. She was just 25 then.  Since then, she has treated people with leprosy, ...","""I'd like to live a life helping leprosy patients and getting along with other locals at Hoam Village for the rest of my days,"" an Italian nun, who settled here 48 years ago, said in fluent Korean on Friday. Lidia Tallone, as a missionary, came to the village in Gochang, 296 kilometers south of Seoul, which was a colony for lepers at that time. She was just 25 then.  Since then, she has treated people with leprosy, also called Hansen's disease, and has been of great help to the mobility impaired.During an interview with Yonhap News Agency at the village, she looked back on herself at 19, when she first entered a nunnery in Italy. The nun, who is now 73 years old, soon joined a missionary called Movimento Contemplativo Missionario Padre De Foucauld and started her sacred profession by caring for some 120 children orphaned by the war. ""I thought I have to live a life for many children rather than having a family and only caring for my own child,"" she recalled. ""Moreover, I had made up my mind to become a nun to realize, on behalf of my brother, a dream to enter priesthood, which he had but couldn't fulfill as he went to heaven."" Later, she heard that there were many war orphans and leprosy patients in South Korea, and so she decided to go there. She came to the country as a member of a mission and settled in Hoam Village, where she poured her heart into caring for lepers, who were in terrible shape because there was no proper treatment, and whose appearances were hard to recognize. To better understand and communicate with the villagers, she soon studied at the Korean language school of Yonsei University in Seoul.        Albeit busy with her missionary life, she studied Korean day and night, and became able to write in Korean and speak it two years later. Tallone then went to Fontilles Hospital in Spain and learned more about Hansen's disease for three months to better understand the disease and better treat lepers in the Korean village.  ""There was no remedy drug  at that time, and I barely cured the patients with a small amount of a drug that I had obtained from German relief agencies,"" she said. ""I also had children take as many vitamins as possible as I knew that they could get over the disease if they only had sufficient nutrition."" The most pitiful aspect of the disease was the widespread prejudice that it was highly contagious and that people could get infected only if they brushed against lepers, she reminisced. ""Because of that, schools didn't even accept children of leprosy patients,"" she said. Her life in Korea was not easy as the country in the 1960s was still in economic difficulties, and she acquired a thrift habit, although she vowed frugality, obedience and chastity to be a nun. When staying at a convent in Seoul to study Korean, she had to share a one-person room with her sister nun and cope with economic hardships.Despite the difficulties, she cared for some 80 children living in the slums at that time. ""As I acquired a frugal habit, I've never carelessly spent a penny or used a sheet of paper,"" she said. She is still looking after some 10 leprosy patients at Hoam Village, in which they now mingle with ordinary people. ""Even though the patients have gotten better, I'd like to spend the rest of my life in this place because a nun is also obliged to help neighborhoods through difficulties."" Hoam villagers have recently recommended her as a recipient of a merit of state order in recognition of her decadeslong sacrifices.","italian nun spends decades ,korean on friday lidia ,korea to help lepers ,spends decades in korea ,nun spends decades in","['italian', 'Korean', 'Lidia Tallone', 'Gochang', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33515632  0.54339951

Mostly municipalities, police stations and state-run organizations across the country are seen joining the campaign to boost spending at nearby restaurants once a week or twice a month. Among them is Seoul’s Seocho District Office, which decided to close its in-house cafeteria every Friday. The office estimates that about 700 million won  a year will be spent at nearby restaurants instead, given that it has some 1,500 employees. The practice had initially began when the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak took a toll on the local economy last year. It decided to expand its “Eating-Out Day” program at the request of local restaurant owners. Lawmakers eat their lunch at the National Assembly’s cafeteria. “We decided to enforce the rule to help revitalize the local economy. Restaurant owners are happy about it, saying they see a growing number of customers,” said Kim In-ha, a government official at Seocho District Office. “It is true that staff members have some trouble going out, finding restaurants outside and coming back in this hot weather.”Other municipalities including Ansan’s Danwon-gu Office, Incheon’s Dong-gu Office, Wonju City Hall, Tongyeong City Hall, Busan City Hall and South Gyeongsang Provincial Office also joined the drive to encourage their employees to venture out and spend money during lunch.Small restaurant owners welcomed the idea, but also called for wider implementation of the campaign. “We cannot dramatically benefit from the shutdown of in-house cafeterias at Cheongju City Hall as it is a relatively small-sized office, but we can receive more customers at least once a week,” said Son Yeon-ju, a director of an association of Cheongju-based restaurant owners. Cheongju City Hall also closes its cafeteria every Wednesday. “In order to really help the local economy, all the state-funded companies as well as district offices should join the campaign. Otherwise, it would only have limited impact.”  A local restaurant owner in southern Seoul, who wanted to be identified only by his surname Kim, echoed hope that the public firms’ adoption of “Eating-Out Day” will encourage private companies to do the same. “When Seocho District Office’s cafeteria closes, not only public servants but also citizens who visit the office go to nearby restaurants for meals,” said one of the local restaurant owners in southern Seoul. “As the local economy is slowing, many restaurants in the area benefit from such measures.” “It would be even better if big private companies join the move.” The move, however, is also opposed by some Korean workers, who cite their right to cut down on food costs, maximize productivity and choose healthier options. “It is good to use the in-house cafeteria because I can save money and I don’t have to think about what to eat every day. I save about 3,000 won per meal now compared to in the past when our company did not have a cafeteria,” said Song Ji-hee, a 27-year-old office worker in Seoul. “Also, food from the cafeteria is a lot healthier with lower levels of salt and calories,” said Song, who usually eats at her workplace restaurant and eats out about twice a week. “Offering the in-house dining options is a crucial part to improving the health and welfare of employees.” According to a survey of 1,115 office workers by the job portal site Job Korea, South Koreans on average spend 6,370 won on lunch in 2016, down from 6,566 won. However, 46.3 percent of the respondents said they think they pay more for lunch this year. The poll found that Korean workers spend on average 7,816 won on a meal when they eat out at a nearby restaurant and 5,431 won when they dine at their companies’ cafeterias. They pay on average 4,882 won for a meal from a convenience store. “I would be happy to have a cafeteria at my workplace. That way, I can save time and a lot of money,” said Seo In-ki, 29, who often goes to convenience stores for a simple and quick meal. “I would still go out and have lunch outside when I want to, but I wish I could have a cheaper, quicker dining option at my workplace.” By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com","nearby restaurants once week ,public firms close cafeterias ,economic downturn mostly municipalities ,cafeterias to help boost ,restaurants once week","['South Korea ’s', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63716507  0.3775349

He reportedly said that the government should just make sure the public are fed and alive and there should be a stricter class system in Korea.“We reached a conclusion that the strongest level of disciplinary action is needed for him who committed wrongdoing and seriously violated a public servant’s legal duty to maintain dignity,” Lee said. “The ministry apologizes once again for disappointing the public with an officer’s disgraceful action.” The Education Ministry will wrap up an internal probe into the case and request the disciplinary committee to expel him. In the meantime, Na will be removed from his post. The final decision will be made by the disciplinary committee under the Ministry of Personnel Management within 60 days. Public servants dismissed for misconduct are not allowed to apply for government jobs for the next five years and are only entitled to half of the severance pay.  On Monday during a parliamentary meeting, Na made a tearful apology for “making inappropriate remarks as a public servant, distressing the Korean people and causing a stir.” “I have realized how wrong I was. It happened all because of my carelessness. I am really sorry,” he said. “It took place under the influence of alcohol and I did not intend to say such things.”Na was initially absent from the parliamentary meeting held in the morning citing “frail health,” which prompted angry responses and calls for his attendance among lawmakers. The meeting resumed upon his arrival in the afternoon.The Education Minister Lee Joon-sik also apologized and vowed strong punishment over his remarks. Na, who passed his civil service examination in 1993, previously served as the secretary for the minister and an administrative officer at Cheong Wa Dae under former President Lee Myung-bak. He was promoted to the head of policy planning at the Education Ministry in March.

Cheong Wa Dae“South Korea is Mongolia’s fourth-largest partner in trade, yet the bilateral trade volume has remained relatively low, considering the full economic potential,” the senior official said.“Now that Mongolia is seeking to lessen its dependency on its top trade partner China and No. 1 energy provider Russia, and to diversity its external cooperation, it is crucial that we make the most of the given situation.”The total trade volume of the two states as of the end of last year stood at $292 million, of which 84 percent was made up of South Korea’s exports to Mongolia.The greatest synergy is expected in the infrastructure sector, due to the Mongolian government’s blueprint to back the nation’s economic growth by expanding power production capacities and transmission network.“Despite the recent economic setbacks, Mongolia is one of the world’s top 10 resource-rich countries, ranking second in copper and fourth in coal,” Kang explained.Its economic growth, which averaged 13.8 percent in 2011-2013, is expected to take an upturn in 2017 and to soar up to 5.7 percent in the following year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Other potential fields are health and medical care, as well as culture, according to the Blue House official.“Because of its vast area of land and limited access to medical services, Mongolia has high demands on our advanced telemedicine system,” he said.Citing the popularity of K-pop culture among the Mongolian public, Kang claimed that South Korean firms have a forte over other market competitors.The two states will also promote cooperation in the new renewable energy sector, seeking to curb Mongolia’s desertification and to make use of its abundant solar and wind energy, according to the economic chief.Accompanying the president’s visit this time will be the largest-ever economic delegation, consisting of 109 companies, among which 85 percent are small and medium-sized firms.“We consider this  a success of past business delegations,” he said.The participating companies will be attending a business forum with Mongolian counterparts and individual consulting sessions next Monday, following the presidential summit slated for this Friday.By Bae Hyun-jung","tuesday mongolia with population ,mongolia to open new ,dae on tuesday mongolia ,to mongolia this week ,on tuesday mongolia with","['Park Geun - hye', 'south korean', 'South Korea']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79055679  0.93467319

South Chungcheong Police said Thursday that the police emergency hotline received two calls on Monday from a group of elementary school children who claimed they had found a dead man.  The children, aged between 7 and 9, told the police where they had discovered the body -- at a defunct supermarket in the region’s Nonsan city – however, they had apparently lacked confidence in delivering the report. According to the police the group of children had passed the cell phone around to one another as they felt shy about addressing the authorities. The two policemen who took the calls dismissed the report. They did not relay the information to the regional police office, nor dispatched anyone to inspect the area. The body was discovered on Wednesday when a local bank employee reported the same information. Based on a note that was found at the scene and the absence of marks of struggle, the police have tentatively concluded that the deceased had committed suicide. The police admitted that their initial lack of response was due to the children’s young age.

But he noted that the government was ""well aware"" of the concerns over the potential negative impact of the act on some local businesses. "" is well aware of the concerns, but the act is designed to address the irregularities deeply rooted in our society,"" Hwang told lawmakers at the National Assembly.The anti-corruption act subjects public officials, journalists and private school faculty to a maximum penalty of three years in jail or five times the amount accepted in money or valuables if it exceeds a set amount, regardless of whether it was in exchange for favors. It puts a cap on the price of meals and presents that can be accepted.Local businesses -- particularly high-end restaurants, golf clubs and department stores -- argue that the act would seriously hurt their sales and dampen overall domestic consumption.","on tuesday dismissed call ,to exempt agricultural fishery ,tuesday dismissed call to ,tuesday dismissed call ,ahn on tuesday dismissed",['Hwang Kyo - ahn'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04152557  0.24742872

He will be the first Swiss president to visit the Asian country since the two countries opened diplomatic ties in 1963. Park had invited the Swiss leader to Korea during her visit to Switzerland in January 2014.During their summit slated for Wednesday, the two leaders plan to exchange views on ways to bolster bilateral cooperation in health care, medicine, information technology and other sectors, Park's office said in a press release.They are also expected to discuss security threats from North Korea, which has continued to heighten military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and beyond through its saber-rattling moves, including the recent launch of two intermediate-range ballistic missiles.During his stay here, Schneider-Ammann will also attend a session of the South Korea-Switzerland committee on science and technology and a separate bilateral forum on biotechnology. ""We hope that President Schneider-Ammann's  visit will help deepen and broaden the partnership over the 'creative economy,' which was built through a 2014  summit,"" the press release said.The creative economy refers to Park's policy initiative that aims to capitalize on innovative ideas and technologies, such as information and communications technologies, to generate more business opportunities and foster growth.The Cheong Wa Dae also anticipated that the summit between the two leaders will serve to enhance bilateral cooperation in securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.Switzerland has been Korea's crucial security partner as its troops have served as part of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, an institution to oversee the implementation of the armistice agreement as an impartial observer. Last year, two-way trade reached $3.94 billion, with Korea exporting $1.48 billion worth of ships, cars and petrochemical products to Switzerland and importing $2.45 billion worth of watches, gold and medicine from the European state.","korea next week swiss ,next week swiss president ,president to visit korea ,visit korea next week ,seoul on wednesday next","['swiss', 'Johann Schneider - Ammann', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', 'Schneider - Ammann', 'Seoul', 'Singapore']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -1.11612952  0.93006253

Quite the contrary,"" Beun said in an interview with a group of reporters in central Seoul. ""The fact that I am a person of Korean descent has not been a curse at all but a huge boon in Argentina.""""That is probably because Korea has such a high global standing... Besides, you can see Korean dramas and K-pop on popular TV shows on many occasions, which has helped let the name of Korea be known to many locals and reduce any possible prejudice against people like me,"" he added. Beun is in Seoul to attend a forum of Latin American countries organized by the foreign ministry here. He was tapped as an assistant vice culture minister earlier this year, the highest ever government position that a second generation Korean-Argentine has assumed there. His parents immigrated to Argentina in 1980 with just US$10 in their pockets. Decades of hard work and success in a clothing business have made their life much better off. But they have always taught their three sons where they came from.""I never forgot how to speak Korean since I learned it from my mother, who hit my palms whenever I made mistakes. My Korean has a unique accent since I also lived with my grandmother,"" Beun jokingly said in fluent Korean. Beun said that he strongly prides himself in his roots and he prefers to be called by his Korean name -- Beun Kyore -- over his Argentine name, which is why he always uses his Korean name when signing government documents.""Since such documents will remain forever, I really like to leave my  name so that people later on will know there was a Korean-Argentine who served as a high-ranking official.""As much as he is proud of his Korean heritage and his different looks for leaving a strong impression on those he meets, he said that sometimes the difference comes around as a heavy burden.""People remember my face very easily since it is different from theirs. I have to be extra careful and modest in my behavior. I feel like I am representing not just myself, but Korea as well. A mistake can ruin the impression,"" he said.Asked how he managed to be so successful in his career at such a young age, Beun said that he has always tried to make the most of the strong points of Korea and Argentina. ""Unlike South Korea, Argentina has no strong hierarchy. Creativity is encouraged and you can say whatever you want to with your boss. Also, you can make friends with anybody no matter how old they might be,"" he said.""What I learned from Korea is hard work ethics. I was taught since my childhood that I had to work really hard. Now I make sure to get things done all the time,"" he added.A law major at University of Buenos Aires, Beun has worked his way toward the current position by engaging in diverse political activities even during his school days. He was first interested in politics as he saw it as a means to help people.Now that he has become a policymaker, he no longer has the desire to rise higher. His long-term goal is to contribute to the government's push to eradicate poverty and give everyone a fair chance.As for any cooperation between Argentina and South Korea in cultural areas, Beun said that he is working on launching an artistic residence program in which artists visit each other for three months to experience local culture and share their creativity. He is to meet culture ministry officials here before leaving the country.","proud of his korean ,young promising argentine policymaker ,job south korea impressive ,korea impressive economic advance ,south korea impressive economic","['Antonio Kyore Beun', 'Argentina', 'South Korea', ""South Korea 's""]",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78522366  0.62236249

Defying many who predicted otherwise, the husband survived the crash, following numerous surgeries from the PMC where he remained hospitalized for three months for recuperation. Kang did not have enough money to pay for the medical service then, as the couple had not long before failed in a grocery store business they jointly ran. The hospital head surgeon, showing compassion for the couple, took payment of only 700,000 won from the total 7.8 million won bill.The aftereffects of the accident prevented Kang’s husband from working, and Kang spent the next 34 years as the breadwinner of the family, raising their children through seamstress jobs.Kang said she always lived with a debt in her heart for the hospital, which eventually led to her payment after all these years. The pastor of the church Kang attends had supported her decision, saying that although the currency value had jumped over the years, it would be meaningful for her to repay the principal. The PMC said it will use Kang’s money to help other patients in financial difficulties.

The 31-year-old had thought her parents were a happy couple, although she had rarely spent time with them since she moved out about five years prior. “My mother said after my brother and I moved out, she and my father had not much to share in life,” she told The Korea Herald. “She said raising us was pretty much their only ‘joint mission.’ Now that it was over, she said she wanted be on her own and explore what else is out there.”123rfLee’s parents are among the growing number of South Korea’s married couples getting divorced after spending more than 20 years together. According to Statistics Korea, the proportion of such couples accounted for 30 percent of all divorced Korean couples last year. In 2012, such couples made up just 26.4 percent. The same trend was noticed by the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations. While only 26 Koreans in their 70s visited the center in hopes to get divorced in 2004, the number of such elderly individuals increased dramatically to 325 in 2014.Kim Young-ran, a researcher at the Korean Women’s Development Institute, said the statistics is a result of many different cultural and social changes in Korean society.  “Koreans in the age range of their 50s and 60s tend to feel they deserve personal happiness more than those who are younger ,” she told The Korea Herald. “It definitely has to do with raising their children. Once their grown children get married, they feel their responsibility as a parent is over. And they no longer feel they have to stay with their spouses, as they feel their children no longer need their parents to be together.”Kim pointed out that Korean marriages tend to focus on children’s needs rather than on marital happiness. “We are so used to fathers earning money for children’s education while mothers are taking care of them and making sure they go to the right school, get a decent job and marry the right person,” she said. “Once those jobs are over, they are left with their spouses -- whom they hardly spent time with while raising their children. Most men spend most of their time at work, while mothers spend time with their children at home.”Lee So-yeon said she was shocked at first, but now wants to support her mother’s decision. Growing up, she spent most of her time with her mother, as her father was busy at work, even on weekends. Lee said she never thought of it as something unusual, as most of her friends didn’t get to spend much time with their fathers, either. “I guess I never really thought of my mother as a wife, and my father as a husband,” she said. “They were wonderful as parents. But I wouldn’t really fully understand what they were like as someone’s spouse, and I’m learning to accept that. Right now I just want both of them to be happy.”The reasons for the rise in elderly divorce rate also stem from a deeper issue of distorted gender roles and abuse, according to Cho Kyung-ae, a legal counsellor at the KLACFR. Citing a closed court document, she said more women in their 60s and 70s file for divorce than their male counterparts.The legal expert in family law said many women in the age group have said they endured long-term abuse for the sake of their children, as it was more difficult for single mothers to raise children in the 1970s and 80s. As of 2012, 83 percent of all single parents here never received any child support from the non-custodial parents. Failure to pay child support has not been considered a crime in Korea.“Things were different in their times,” she said. “It was very difficult for divorced women to get jobs, and the stigma against divorcees and their children were severe. So they needed to stay with their husbands to finance their children’s needs, especially the cost of education and weddings. Their husbands were their only source of income for themselves and their children.”She said on top of physical abuse, many elderly women she spoke to experienced financial and emotional abuse from their husbands for a long time. One of the women Cho spoke to said her husband would control how all of the money in the house is spent, and would not give her any “allowance” whenever he did not like the meals she prepared for him. Another woman had a husband who would check the refrigerator every night once returning home. “He’d check to make sure the fridge is clean and filed with the right food,” Cho said. “If he did not like what he saw, he’d yell and say things like, ‘You are not even making any money. And you can’t even keep a single fridge clean’?” Other women who visited the center also told Cho that they were body shamed by their husbands for a period of long time, often being called “fat and ugly.”Cho said she also witnessed many men in their 60s and 70s who were clueless why their wives wanted a divorce. “Many would say ‘all I did was work hard to support my family,’” she said. “Many don’t realize what they’d been doing for a long time can be in fact considered as abusive behavior.”The legal expert said more elderly women are filing for divorce because for some of them, it’s the only way to be financially independent. “They just want a court order that asks for division of assets and property,” she said. “This way they can avoid having to ask their husbands for money all the time. One of the women I spoke to said now that she doesn’t need her husband’s money for her children, she wants to live with dignity.” By Claire Lee","she was considering divorce ,divorces lee so yeon ,year when her mother ,senior divorces lee so ,her mother told her","['Lee So - yeon', 'the Korea Herald']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32346496  0.3953073

The North Korean flight normally conducts a transit and re-fueling stop in Islamabad on the Pyongyang-Kuwait route. The North's Air Koryo is known to be operating the Pyongyang-Kuwait route to mainly transport North Korean workers to and from the Middle East country.North Korea is reportedly experiencing hardships as it has been under strict international sanctions for its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year.

The artists will be able to perform and show off their skills on the last Wednesday of every month. Photo provided by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Pyo Jae-soon, chairman of the Presidential Committee for Cultural Enrichment, speaks during the launch ceremony for the 'Youth Mike' program at Jeongdong Theater in Seoul on June 27, 2016. The ministry is the co-organizer of the ""Culture Day"" campaign along with the Presidential Committee for Cultural Enrichment.A total of 242 young artists on 88 teams were chosen through auditions for the program out of 978 applicants on 288 teams, the ministry said. They represent various genres of performing arts ranging from traditional Korean music to jazz, hip-hop and B-boy dance.This Wednesday, 42 of the selected teams will perform at 15 different venues, including streets, public squares, conventional markets and outdoor performance halls across the country.The chosen teams will receive 2-2.5 million won  in subsidies from the government every time they perform, according to ministry officials.The ""Culture Day"" initiative kicked off in January 2014 with an aim of helping South Koreans more easily enjoy cultural events by offering various benefits including discounts for entrance fees at museums, sports games, movies, theaters and exhibitions. For example, moviegoers can enjoy a movie at a local cinema for 5,000 won, a 45-percent discount from the usual 9,000 won. The campaign is in line with the government's efforts to create a virtuous cycle of increasing people's consumption of cultural products which, in turn, can boost the growth of the industry and eventually help improve the overall quality of life. The measures can also help the local job market.Meanwhile, about 2,150 events are scheduled to take place around the country on the last Wednesday of this month.A discount will be offered to visitors to an exhibition of paintings by renowned Korean artist Lee Jung-seop at the Deoksu Palace branch in central Seoul. An exhibition of successive South Korean presidents' dinnerware is available free of charge at the Korean Craft Museum in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province.At the Gyeongju Arts Center, there will be no admission charged for an exhibition of Sohn Il-bong, a Korean painter known for pine tree-themed works.In addition, tickets to the baseball game between the Samsung Lions and Lotte Giants at Busan's Sajik Stadium will be available at 50-percent the original price.Residents of Jeju will be given a 50-percent discount for tickets to the football match between Jeju United and Suwon FC to be held at the Jeju World Cup Stadium.","government on monday launched ,providing young aspiring artists ,monday launched program aimed ,culture ministry launches program ,youth mike program aims","['the "" Youth Mike', 'the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59291989  0.36526191

Busan Mayor Suh Byung-soo bows during a press conference at the city hall in Busan on June 27, 2016, as he apologizes for his failure to host a new airport on Gadeok Island. ""I will accept the government's decision for the new  Gimhae airport to help address the conflict among regions and strive for national unity,"" he said during a press conference. He added that he ""fully"" understands that the government had to consider various factors in its decision-making process such as potential backlash and the ""big scars and sense of frustration"" the candidate cities might experience if they lost.The mayor's latest remarks reflects a softening of his earlier stance. He originally denounced the government's decision to nullify the airport project as a ""quick-fix"" solution. Stressing that what matters for now is to prevent the foregone issue from further dividing the nation, he pledged to create a new Gimhae airport that would maximize convenience for citizens in the country's southeastern region.""I and other provincial leaders in the region will put our heads together to maximize the convenience for citizens in the region by ensuring the linkage to the airport through infrastructure such as roads and railways,"" he said.""Let's move beyond the wasteful competition over the new airport and work together to make the airport the center for the region's win-win cooperation and co-prosperity for the next 100 years to come,"" he added.As part of an effort to allow the airport to operate around the clock, the mayor also pledged to consider a set of measures including relocating some residents near the airport who have complained of aircraft noise.Lawmakers in the ruling party that represent Busan had largely advocated for Gadeok Island, while those from Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province supported Miryang. The division was a major setback to the efforts to forge unity in the ruling party gripped by persistent factional feuds.","busan mayor accepts plan ,mayor accepts plan ,mayor accepts plan to ,to host new airport ,busan mayor accepts","['Busan Mayor', 'Suh Byung', ""Saenuri Party 's"", 'Suh', 'Busan']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31118792  0.66786444

The picked greens are being prepared as side dishes for troops.Anyone who fails to meet the allotted amount for the greens are being forced to make cash contributions to the authorities, according to the source in the country's North Hamgyong Province. North Korean Leader Kim Jung-un The source told the media outlet the mobilization campaign ended on June 20 after it began on May 10, adding that during the period some medicinal herbs were accepted in the place of wild greens.Another source from the country's Ryanggang Province said the North Korean residents cannot hide their dismay and indignation over the mobilization of the people after Kim Jong-un took power at the end of 2011. The incumbent leader assumed control after the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il.Recently, North Korea has called on the nation to secure self-sufficiency in food as the international community moves to impose stiffer sanctions on the country for its nuclear provocations.","gather wild edible greens ,korean students mobilized to ,wild greens for soldiers ,korean students mobilized ,pick wild greens for","['North Korea', 'the u.s.-based Radio Free Asia', 'north korean', 'RFA']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25852248  0.4939563

When fine dust enters the bloodstream via the lungs, it can cause infection in the human brain and influence how neurotransmitters work, SMC data said. This could also worsen symptoms of those suffering chronic diseases such as heart disease and respiratory disease, thereby exposing them to depression.Fine dust particles are not only considered dangerous to chronically ill patients but also young children and the elderly, especially to their respiratory system.Experts say that fine dust that enters the human body tends to cause different symptoms depending on the aerodynamic diameter of the particles. The smaller the diameter, the deeper the particle can infiltrate into organ systems and the higher the potential toxicity. Since the amount of airborne particles that enter the body is directly proportional to the amount of time spent outside, it is best to stay indoors when the fine dust concentrations are high. When heading out, it is also important to wear a long-sleeved shirt and a mask to minimize skin exposure to pollutants.Upon returning home, showering can help remove the dust. Washing your face, brushing your teeth and using eye drops will help keep your mucous membranes clean.Wearing glasses instead of contact lenses can also help. When you are dehydrated, the mucous membranes in your respiratory system become less effective, allowing dust particles to enter the body more easily. So drinking enough water helps prevent dust from entering your body. At the same time, it also helps the body remove the toxic substances through sweat or urine.Consuming a lot of fruit and vegetables can also help the body deal with the negative effects of fine dust. Using an air purifier can also prevent respiratory disease and exposure to fine dust particles, however, such an option should not be depended on too heavily. Without proper ventilation and cleaning of your home, it would not be effective in reducing exposure to dust particles. It is also necessary to change the filter on your air purifier frequently.By Kim Da-sol","health fine dust particles ,diseases they also increase ,korean public is more ,asthmatic diseases they also ,dust does to human",['south korean'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5999949   0.13064662

Another key figure in the scandal, judge-turned-lawyer Choi You-jeong, is currently standing trial over similar allegations.Meanwhile, the cosmetics brand said Jung stepped down from the CEO post and one of its executive members, Kim Chang-ho, was named the new chief Tuesday.

According to the informant, due to these advantages, taxi drivers are receiving as much envy from the people as the dictatorial regime’s Party members. Because taxi drivers are hired arbitrarily without an official notice through the nation’s labor department, abuse of personal connections and bribery abounds in acquiring the job, he said.By Lim Jeong-yeo","taxi driving most coveted ,koreans are paying bribes ,bribes to become taxi ,driving most coveted job ,become taxi drivers washington","['North Koreans', 'Washington', 'Radio Free Asia', 'north korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38270944  0.37750834

The Education Ministry said it would conduct an overall safety check of the residences of female teachers working in isolated regions by Friday and draw up measures to boost their safety. This includes checking surveillance cameras, emergency bells, protective windows and other security systems Education Minister Lee Jun-sik  attends a Cabinet meeting in Sejong on Tuesday. YonhapThe move comes after a teacher in her 20s was allegedly raped by three men, including two fathers of her students, in an island in South Jeolla Province late last month. The men were all arrested Saturday. The police said two of them admitted their charges after their DNA was detected, while one of them denied the allegation. The police are currently looking into whether the suspects plotted the crime beforehand. It was found that there were no surveillance cameras in a radius of 1 kilometer from the teacher’s residence. Based on the results of the overall safety check, the ministry said it would make sure to install surveillance cameras in all teachers’ residences in remote regions and come up with new measures to improve safety, the authorities said. “The ministry will draw up safety measures for teachers in remote regions with municipal education offices by this month and provide its full support. It will also make sure to reduce teachers’ anxiety by strengthening the safety system against sexual crimes around schools and residences upon cooperation with the police and the Interior Ministry,” said Kim Dong-won, the deputy minister of the school policy office at the Education Ministry. As of last year, about 6,500 teachers work in 706 public schools in remote areas, with Gangwon Province having the largest number, followed by South Jeolla Province. Of this number, 46 percent are women, it added. Increasing the number of surveillance cameras, however is not the fundamental solution to ensuring the safety of female teachers, experts said. “In the case of remote areas, public sensitivity to sexual crimes can be relatively low. There should be efforts to carry out antisexual crime education in the community and to curb the excessive drinking culture,” said forensic psychology professor Lee Soo-jung from Kyonggi University.By Lee Hyun-jeong","after gang rape case ,measures for female teachers ,government on tuesday vowed ,after gang rape ,rape case of teacher",['the Education Ministry'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42890367  0.12864913

The North has rejected the validity of the Northern Limit Line that is the de facto sea border between the two countries.The two Koreas have clashed several times along the NLL.South Korean sources said that the North's media seems to be referring to an incident involving local fishermen capturing two small Chinese boats operating illegally in South Korean territorial waters.During the incident that took place near Yeonpyeong Island just south of the demarcation line, the Navy mobilized seven missile and gun-armed ships to the region to guard against possible provocations by the North targeting South Korean fishing boats.Local fishermen had taken the initiative to capture the Chinese boats without getting permission from the authorities.South Korea's Coast Guard, meanwhile, said that it will seek arrest warrants for the Chinese captains of the two boats over illegal fishing operations.","korea pushed 19 fishing ,korean navy of violating ,pushed 19 fishing boats ,its sea border monday ,19 fishing boats into","[""North Korea 's"", 'the south korean Navy', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30157036 -0.22586694

The Ministry of Employment and Labor said they are preparing to propose a revision to the current Industrial Safety and Health Act to better protect subcontract workers from safety accidents. Members of a union group for part-time workers protest near Guui Station in Seoul on Saturday, calling for workers’ rights to a safe environment. YonhapThe revised bill will be submitted to the National Assembly through a “fast-track” process, which aims to shorten the legislation process to within 10 days, according to officials. The original process takes at least three months. A bill with the same content was proposed during the 19th National Assembly, but was automatically discarded after the former 19th assembly failed to endorse it.The current law designates specific places at construction sites with the risk of falling, collapsing, falling objects or natural disasters as areas with danger of accidents that should be supervised by main contractors with due safety measures. When a business owner violates the regulation, he or she is subject to imprisonment of less than a year or a fine of up to 10 million won .The revised bill will expand the safety obligations to all business operating sites. The penalty will be fortified with a sentencing of up to five years in jail and a fine of up to 50 million won.The move came after a spate of fatal industrial accidents last week. A 19-year-old employee of Eunsung PSD, a company that had been subcontracted by subway operator Seoul Metro for screen door maintenance, died on May 28 after being hit by an incoming subway train. Another four workers died on June 1 after a gas explosion at a subway construction site in the northeastern city of Namyangju. A dozen of the victims were hired by subcontractor Maeil ENC to construct subway rails for POSCO Engineering & Construction.Amid ongoing discussion to amend the poor working environments of subcontract workers, Seoul Metro said Sunday that about 180 executive officials at a company have turned in their resignations, to claim due responsibility regarding the subway platform accident.“The company will accept  resignations if they do not come up with fundamental measures to strengthen safety,” said Jeong Su-young, head of Seoul Metro’s Infrastructure Management department during a press conference on Sunday.The company will go through an organizational reshuffle to increase workforce efficiency and strengthen safety regulations, following the preventive measures announced last week, the operator said. On Sunday, a lawmaker claimed that the screen door maintenance company Eunsung PSD told Seoul Metro that the company does not have “enough money” to compensate for the death of Kim. According to the opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s Rep. Woo Hyung-chan, Seoul Metro is considering providing compensation to Kim’s family and asking for indemnity to Eunsung PSD.“But there is no legal boundary that Seoul Metro can pay the compensation directly to bereaved Kim, nor can they claim indemnity to Eunsung PSD,” added rep. Woo, urging for a speedy compensation process for the bereaved. The contract for Eunsung PSD with Seoul Metro is set to expire at the end of this month.By Kim Da-sol","korean government will propose ,accidents ministry said monday ,government will propose revision ,measures for industrial accidents ,south korean government will","['south korean', 'the Ministry of Employment and Labor', 'Industrial Safety and Health Act']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40836921  0.77966356

He goes there to get his lunch, packed in a box. Out of some 30 choices, the popular options include rice with chicken breast, deep-fried pork cutlet or fried kimchi rice. His favorite is bulgogi stir-fried with gochujang, the Korean red pepper paste. He returns to his office, microwaves his food and eats it alone at his desk. Sometimes he also has cup noodles to go with it. A convenience store boxed lunch costs about 4,000 won . It takes him 15 minutes to finish his lunch. And all this is when he eats lunch at all -- the busy man that he is, he often skips the meal just to concentrate on his work. “I don’t really feel like spending more than 5,000 won on lunch, because I’m eating it alone anyway,” he told The Korea Herald.“It makes more sense to have quality food when you have someone to share it with.”  Jang is one of the growing number of South Koreans who eat alone at work and home. From 2010-2015, the proportion of single-person households increased significantly from 15.8 percent to 27.1 percent. According to a report by the Health Ministry, 55 percent of all Koreans aged 19-64 did not have dinner with their families as of 2014. One of the reasons behind the statistics is the nation’s notoriously long work hours -- one of the longest among the developed nations. A recent study by the Korea Health Promotion Foundation found that a large number of working Koreans aged 30-59 who eat alone do so because they want to save time or simply do not have anyone to eat with. Among the surveyed Koreans in their 30s, 38.7 percent of them said they eat alone because they do not have company during meal times. Meanwhile, 21.5 percent said they just did not have enough time to eat with someone else. Another 16.1 percent said they ate alone to save time. In Jang’s case, it is a combination of both. His office only has two people, including himself, and his coworker often skips lunch because he wants to lose weight. Jang said, “Since I’m usually too busy with work before and after lunch, I don’t really want to make lunch plans – I don’t want to rush while eating with someone else,” he said.There is a reason why Jang prefers boxed meals over dining alone at restaurants. He said he gets self-conscious when he eats alone in public, thinking others may judge him or think he is a “social outcast.” He often plays with his smartphone while eating at restaurants, in an attempt to “look very busy” rather than to appear as someone with no close friends or colleagues. “I think there still this public notion that if you are eating alone, there must be something wrong with your social life,” he said.The unwelcoming attitude shown by servers or restaurant owners is also a factor. There were a number of times where he felt unwelcome during busy hours as he was occupying a table which was for three or four people, he said. “By taking a lone-diner like me, they are losing two or three more customers,” Jang said. “I understand where they are coming from, so I don’t feel upset or anything. But it does definitely make me feel hesitant about dining alone at restaurants.”Besides lunch, Jang also eats breakfast alone. His breakfast usually consists of steamed rice and one or two Korean side dishes that can “last a long time in the fridge,” such as pickled vegetables with little nutritional value. It is rare for him to eat dinner by himself as he usually makes plans to socialize. However, when he does, the meal usually consists of simple take-out snacks from small restaurants, such as dumplings and gimbap. “I don’t think my diet is necessarily healthy,” he said. Overseas studies have shown that dining alone can be either good and bad for one’s health. A 2014 study by the Journal of Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in the U.S. found that eating behaviors can be “easily transmitted socially.” The study claimed that individuals who are surrounded by people who prefer high-calorie food are more likely to consume such food than solo eaters with healthy eating habits.  Meanwhile, a 2013 study by the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer found that the “lonely nature” of solo dining can negatively affect individuals aged 40 or older. Researchers also found that elderly solo diners tend to consume fewer vegetables than those who eat as a couple, making them vulnerable to chronic health conditions such as diabetes.Among the Koreans who participated in the survey by the KHPF, 45.8 percent said they do not eat properly when eating alone, while 19.1 percent said they opt for fast food, such as hamburgers, when they have no one to eat with. At the same time, 15.3 percent said they tended to eat fast when eating by themselves, and 7.8 percent said they did not enjoy the food when eating without a companion, as they have no one to talk to. “It’s no fun to eat by yourself,” Jang said. “Having lunch or dinner is not just about finishing your food. It’s a social activity – it’s all about sharing your food as well as your ideas and stories with others.”Yet South Korea has welcomed a number of restaurants that specifically cater to solo diners in recent years, some of which offer cubicle seats so guests don’t have to worry about the empty seat on the other side of the table.Shim Kwon-ho, a 31-year-old office worker in Seoul, said there is nothing wrong with doing activities alone – such as dining and going to concerts – and those who do it should be able to do so without having to worry about being judged.A frequent solo diner who also enjoys going to movies by himself, Shim said the biggest implication of the solo dining culture -- “honbap culture” in Korean -- is the word itself. “Why do we even need a separate, special word such as ‘honbap’ for those eating alone, while there isn’t a specific term for those who dine with others?” he said. “The very fact that people often think less of someone just because he or she is seen eating alone indicates the shared prejudice against those without the necessities defined by society, such as a girlfriend and friends.”By Claire Lee Names of the sources have been changed upon request. – Ed.","more koreans are eating ,koreans are eating alone ,his office during lunch ,koreans are eating ,office during lunch hour","['Jang Hee - seok', 'Seoulite', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35445744  0.75528103

""I will fully cooperate with the investigation,"" he told reporters before entering the prosecutors' office. Still, the 56-year-old denied allegations he unlawfully contacted his former colleagues to advocate his clients.Hong is suspected of peddling his influence for Jung Woon-ho, the chief of the South Korean cosmetics brand Nature Republic over his overseas gambling charges.Before the businessmen was indicted in October, two separate investigations were launched on his gambling charges, but both ended without an indictment.Last month, the Seoul High court handed down an eight-month jail term to Jung, reduced from the original one-year sentence meted out by a lower court.The summons was made a few weeks after lawyer Choi You-jeong was formally arrested over allegations she took money from Jung in return for a promise to use her status as a former judge to advocate for him.The prosecutor-turned-lawyer is also suspected of working for local business tycoons without filing a report, in violation of the attorneys-at-law act and dodging taxes in the process.He partially admitted to the tax evasion charges, saying he could have made some mistakes because he has to work very long hours as a lawyer.Hong was a prominent prosecutor until he stepped down from office in 2011, investigating major corruption cases that involved the country's former presidents.","summoned over lobbying scandal ,snowballing corruption scandal ,lawyer was summoned friday ,snowballing corruption scandal that ,scandal prosecutor turned lawyer","['Hong Man - pyo', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75918192  0.31142804

The man, identified only by his surname Kim, was arrested by police later in the day.Kim waited for about 40 minutes for a woman to show up at the building, according to the police. When the victim, whose identity was withheld, came into the unisex restroom, Kim attacked her with a knife he had brought.During the police investigation, Kim said he had always been ""ignored"" by women.As he was escorted to the prosecutors' office, Kim told reporters he feels sorry about the victim who lost her life at a young age. Police earlier concluded that the murder was based on Kim's mental disease.Kim has a record of being hospitalized for schizophrenia a total of four times since 2008. Since he left the hospital for the last time in January, he has not taken his medication properly, according to police.Kim has been living on the streets since March.The case has sparked a nationwide debate over violence against women in the country. Police, however, declined to define it as a hate crime against women.""We are not at a position to declare our stance regarding whether it was a hate crime against women,"" said Han Jeung-sub, the police officer in charge of the investigation.Kim Soo-nam, the country's top prosecutor, ordered officials to thoroughly investigate the motive and details of the incident and prepare measures to prevent any similar cases from occurring, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office said.Police, meanwhile, said they will continue providing psychological therapy and financial support to the bereaved family.","police send gangnam murder ,the recent stabbing death ,recent stabbing death ,recent stabbing death of ,stabbing death of 23","['Seoul', 'Gangnam Station', 'Kim', 'Kim']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63975298  0.47251901

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in South Korea on Wednesday for a six-day visit that has spurred speculation of a possible bid for the presidency in his native country.Ban, who flew in to the southern resort island of Jeju from a humanitarian summit in Istanbul, will attend the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, which brings together thousands of political and business leaders from around the world to discuss issues of peace and security. Drawing more attention, however, is his meetings with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and ruling party lawmakers, which are expected to take place on the forum's sidelines.Ban has long been talked about as a potential contender in the December 2017 presidential election, and in the wake of its crushing defeat in April's parliamentary elections, the ruling Saenuri Party has appeared especially eager to woo the U.N. chief.Ban has sought to distance himself from domestic politics, saying he wants to focus on his current job. But he has stopped short of saying he won't run for president.With the U.N. chief's second five-year term ending in December, opinion polls have consistently ranked him high among potential presidential contenders from both the ruling and opposition camps. On his first trip home in a year, Ban is scheduled to visit various cities across the country. After delivering a keynote address in Jeju on Thursday, he will leave for Japan to attend a G7 summit, but then return home Friday to attend the Rotary International Convention in Goyang, just outside of Seoul; visit a UNESCO-listed folk village in Andong in the ruling party's stronghold region of Gyeongsang; and open a U.N. conference in the southeastern city of Gyeongju.","korea as presidential speculation ,south korea on wednesday ,chief arrives in korea ,presidential speculation grows secretary ,korea on wednesday for","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'Ban', 'Jeju', 'Istanbul', 'the Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.82989091  0.59852576

These companies produce the 15 types of household products under the ministry’s supervision. A ministry official told The Korea Herald the names of these companies will be released early next week.Under the MOUs, companies will be required to submit a list of the chemicals used inside their products, and the amount and purpose of those chemicals. After the ministry assesses the products’ safety, the results will be made public.The Environment Ministry’s Chemical Policy Division director Hong Jeong-seop briefs on the plan to conduct a full-fledged survey on household biocide goods on Wednesday. Yonhap“We will firstly look into the companies that make and sell frequently used household products such as deodorant or spray-type items, as they have high market share and can pose more health risks for users,” the ministry said.Companies that attended the briefing included LG Household & Health Care, AmorePacific, ELand, Aekyung, Pigeon and Procter & Gamble. Companies which do not wish to sign an MOU with the ministry can still be asked to hand in the list of the substances based on the Chemicals Registration and Assessment Act enacted last year, the ministry said. The survey will expand into biocide-containing industrial and electronic goods, which come under the Industry Ministry’s control, from next year. The Environment Ministry said it would cooperate with the Industry Ministry to collect data from online and offline malls and low price distributers, which sell products that are labeled “sterilizer,” “antibacterial” or “antiseptic.”On Tuesday, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced it will begin its own process of surveying for any unreported harm from toxic humidifier disinfectants at public welfare facilities.The survey will be conducted at some 1,003 national and public day care centers, 353 nursing homes, 269 residential facilities for the disabled.The city will look into the facilities’ past records of using six types of humidifier disinfectants, which include Oxy Ssak Ssak, Cefu Humidifier Disinfectant, Wiselect Humidifier Disinfectant, Homeplus Humidifier Cleaner, Ato Organic Humidifier Disinfectant and Humidifier Clean Up. These products were banned from sale after being linked to at least 146 deaths by users.“Although the government banned manufacturing and sales of disputed products in August 2011, we think there may be more potential victims from the use of toxic humidifier disinfectants,” said a Seoul City official.It also vowed to support victims by operating psychological care programs and helping them to report their problems to the Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute under the Environment Ministry. According to KEITI, at least 40 Seoul citizens have been confirmed as victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants.Meanwhile, the prosecution sped up its probe into Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s alleged manipulation of evidence that was presented by a Seoul National University professor surnamed Cho when the case broke out in 2011. Cho was indicted Tuesday for manipulating the toxicity test results of PHMG in return for money from Oxy.  The prosecution is also seeking to question former Oxy Reckitt Benckiser CEO Gaurav Jain soon on whether the U.K. headquarters was aware of the situation and the alleged fabrication. Jain reportedly said he would respond to the summons after appointing his lawyer. Cho’s attorney reportedly told the prosecution that the headquarters’ officials had attended a meeting in November 2011 when his research team reported the results of the reproduction-toxicity test. On Wednesday, the prosecution called in three officials of Lotte Mart and Homeplus to expand the probe to the local companies.As the probe continued to spread, the group of victims and their families visited the Delegation of the European Union and called for action against Oxy, Tesco and Danish company Ketox.The group urged the delegation to check the three companies’ involvement in the disinfectant deaths and to adopt a resolution to stress the accountability of the European companies. It also visited the Norwegian Embassy to call for action against Oxy. The Government Pension Fund of Norway is the third-largest shareholder of the U.K.-based company Reckitt Benckiser. The group said it would visit the British Embassy on Thursday and Danish Embassy on Friday.

It marked the first time in eight years for a Korean prime minister to visit the Central Asian country. He also visited Saudi Arabia in an apparent bid to maintain a balance in Seoul's diplomacy position in the Middle East following the president's visit to Iran earlier this month. The trip is the first undertaken by a Korean premier since 2005. Hwang met Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to discuss ways to expand ties in the energy, construction and plant industries. The two countries also decided to sign a treaty to allow South Koreans with a Saudi Arabian visa to enter the Middle Eastern country multiple times within a five-year period. As his last destination, Hwang also visited Turkey to participate in the World Humanitarian Summit. There, he met U.N.Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and agreed to increase the Seoul government's humanitarian donation to the U.N. relief fund.","tuesday after expanding seoul ,after expanding seoul diplomatic ,on tuesday after expanding ,tuesday after expanding ,turkey on tuesday after","['Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'Uzbekistan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Turkey', 'Seoul', 'Hwang', 'Uzbekistan', 'Shavkat Mirziyoyev', 'Seoul', 'Tashkent', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57392836  0.96856368

The National Forensic Service reported to police on Monday that tests on the bones had proved unsuccessful after they found no DNA matches on the existing database. The skeleton was discovered on April 28, buried 40 centimeters below the concrete floor of a toilet on factory premises in Cheoncheon-dong, Incheon.  This is a stock image. It was impossible to tell the age or gender of the bones, which showed no signs of fracture or poisoning. Police were unable to tell the time or method of death. The three-story building and the separately standing toilet were all built 26 years ago and had been unoccupied from December 2015. The police said they will continue to look for a DNA match between the skeleton and the genetics database they hold. The police keep a database of unidentified DNA found at crime scenes, such as those of murder, arson, rape, robbery and sexual crimes involving a minor. Police have said they are not ruling out the possibility of the victim being a foreign laborer, as the foreign population is relatively denser around the neighborhood compared to elsewhere.

The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said in a press briefing that the killing by the 34-year-old man, only identified by his surname Kim, was a typical crime committed by the mentally disturbed.Kim was arrested last week on suspicion of stabbing the woman to death at a public bathroom near Gangnam Subway Station on May 17. He allegedly waited until other six men left the toilet and killed the first woman who entered, according to CCTV footage.Sergeant Lee Sang-gyeong of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency speaks during a press briefing at Seocho Police Station in Seoul on Sunday. The suspect, who had no prior contact with the victim, told police that he had committed the crime because he had been “belittled” by women many times in the past. Police pointed out that killing the first woman Kim saw in the toilet meant that his crime was neither planned in advance nor systematic.“There is a need to distinguish between hate crimes and crimes driven by mental illness. The latest case falls in the latter category,” the police said in a press briefing. “Hate crime arises from prejudice on a certain group, while mental illness-driven crimes are usually committed due to symptoms such as delusional thoughts and auditory hallucination.” After police profilers had hours-long interviews with Kim on two occasions, they concluded that the crime was “accidental” as the suspect had no direct cause to murder the victim and his symptom of schizophrenia had deteriorated at the time of the crime.According to the police, Kim, who was an only child, has lived alone without interacting with his family. He used to work with women at a restaurant as a waiter, but had to move to the kitchen for his personal hygiene problems, which Kim claimed was due to his female colleagues badmouthing him.He allegedly told the police that he could not stand mistreatment by women anymore and had to kill them before he got killed. Since 2008, he has shown abnormal behavior such as not having a shower for over a year, sleeping on the streets or smashing the front door of his house without being aware of his mental illness, police said. Kim was hospitalized for schizophrenia six times since 2008. But he never took medication since he was discharged from the hospital in January, which police claimed might have prompted him to commit the crime. In Korea, there are an estimated 500,000 patients suffering from schizophrenia, but only 104,000 visited hospitals for treatment. According to prosecutors’ data, 36 percent of impulsive crimes between 2012 and 2015 were committed by those with mental illness, followed by alcohol and drug addiction at 36 percent and dissatisfaction with reality at 24 percent. As part of efforts to prevent crimes by the mentally ill, the police has been granted more authority to order the mentally disturbed to be admitted to hospitals when they detect any abnormal behavior. The revision to the mental health act passed at the National Assembly last week despite lingering concerns over possible human rights violations by authorities on the mentally ill. The police conclusion on the nature of the crime, however, sparked further public outcry and concerns among experts and Koreans who continued to mourn the death of the young woman at a makeshift shrine outside exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Sunday afternoon. Participants attend a tribute march for the victim of the Gangnam murder on Saturday. “It is impossible to define the cause of crime as either mental problem or hatred against women. Many experts should come together to study his mental problem more in-depth,” a lawyer Go Ji-woon from Gamdong law firm told The Korea Herald. “Despite his mental illness, he might have unconsciously developed hatred against women. Without considering the social atmosphere, defining his crime as stemming from solely mental problem can cast doubts on the probe.” “I cannot trust the police anymore. I don’t think police can solve violence against women any longer. It seems that the police are trying to cover up the case to make it not look like a hate crime,” Kim Eun-ji, 25, said. “Not to mention, the police labelling the case as ‘crime by the mentally ill’ might create prejudice for those suffering from mental problems.” Tensions were running high around the subway station as male protestors wearing a mask and holding up placards reading “Not all men are potential murderers” and “The crime was not misogynist” clashed with mourners and activists at the scene. Park Byung-hak, 36, who was browsing post-it memos on the wall, slammed the police for seemingly denying the misogynist nature of the crime. “I guess that police analysis on the criminal motive is an obvious error,” said Park, who came to the scene for the first time since the incident took place. “I think that Korean society is just too used to gender-based discrimination and violence against women.”By Ock Hyun-ju","korean police concluded sunday ,recent murder of 23 ,the recent murder ,the recent murder of ,recent murder","['south korean', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'Kim', 'Kim']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56441826  0.73685646

The 34-year-old suspect told the police earlier this week that he committed the crime because he had been “belittled by women” many times in the past. The victim and the suspect had no prior contact with each other prior to the incident that occurred Tuesday.While police announced Thursday that the case should not be perceived as a hate crime against women, as the suspect suffers from a serious level of mental illness, many online commenters have argued otherwise.Visitors pay tribute to a 23-year-old woman in an alleged hate crime, near exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Wednesday. Of the dissenting public is popular psychiatrist Suh Cheon-seok, who claimed that mental illness is often a result of social and political environment that each of the afflicted belongs to. For instance, many sufferers of mental disorders had paranoid thoughts of being shadowed by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s when the nation was governed by an authoritarian regime, he said. “Even if his misogynist remarks were triggered by his delusional thoughts, we have to make a note that his delusional thoughts were affected by the social climate that is hostile against women,” Suh wrote through his Facebook account. “We can’t conclude that this case is not a misogynistic crime because the suspect is mentally ill. Rather, we have to take it seriously that misogynist behavior is becoming one of the symptoms of mental illness. If the suspect did not live in a society where misogyny prevails, he would have had other kinds of delusions, rather than the one of being belittled by women.”Mental illness has been largely taboo in South Korea, where social stigma against people with mental illnesses still prevails.According to a report released by the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency last year, about 5.6 percent of the Korean population -- over 2 million people -- have suffered depression at least once in their lives. However, only 290,000 people had sought medical help for the condition as of last year, and an even smaller number of them, 150,000 chose to receive treatment regularly. Regardless of the collective avoidance of psychiatric treatment among Koreans, studies overseas have shown that mental illness is not usually linked to violent crime. In an American study of crimes committed by 143 offenders with serious mental disorders, only 7.5 percent were directly related to symptoms of mental illness, according to a 2014 study published by the American Psychological Association. Suh also mentioned that the number of mentally ill individuals who commit crimes is much lower worldwide than those who don’t have any mental conditions.  Suh’s claim came in rebuttal to politicians including crime psychologist-turned-lawmaker Pyo Chang-won, who claimed the recent Gangnam murder could not be classified as a misogynistic crime due to the suspect’s mental condition. Another lawmaker, Kim Kwang-jin, said Korea should make efforts to prevent hate crimes against “all minorities,” not just women.Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee, who visited the tribute site in Gangnam on Friday, also said it is “inappropriate” to call the specific case as a hate crime against women at this point. More investigation by the police, as well as a thorough examination of the suspect’s mental condition, will be needed to decide whether the case should be considered as a misogynist crime or not, she said. Women pay tribute to a 23-year-old woman in an alleged hate crime, near exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Wednesday. The opinion split has also sparked backlash among foreign nationals here, who claim to have witnessed many cases of gender-based violence and discrimination while living here. Last year, 87 percent of all victims of violent crimes, including rape and murder, reported from January until August were women, according to data from the National Police Agency.“As someone with friends who have been treated for various mental health issues, I find it rather disgusting that the police say ‘well, a mental illness caused him to feel this way,’” a 29-year-old American English teacher in Seoul said. “It’s all so easy to blame mental illness, but mental illness doesn’t make a person a misogynist.”The teacher also said there is a parallel between the Gangnam murder case and mass shooting sprees in the U.S., in which she thinks the connection between violence and severe mental illness is often exaggerated to ignore other important factors that may have caused the crimes.“People don’t want to talk about societal and cultural issues that contribute to crimes like the one in Gangnam, and shooting sprees in America,” she said. “Instead, they take the easy way out -- ‘Oh well, he had a mental health issue’ -- and choose to disregard the serious problem. In this murder case in Gangnam, it was the massive gender disparity issue in Korea.”By Claire Lee","korea the recent murder ,recent murder of 23 ,the recent murder ,gangnam murder case triggers ,the recent murder of","['Seoul', 'Gangnam']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64075303  0.47082981

Currently, 1.68 million professions are under such legal obligations.Parenting education is to be enhanced so that all those applying for state subsidies for day care and child-rearing will be required to take online lectures on parenting starting from July. Education Minister Lee Jun-sik announces a set of reinforced child abuse protection measures in a policy meeting on Friday. YonhapThese reinforced measures follow the child abuse prevention plan released in March, reflecting the growing public anxiety over a series of violent crimes committed by parents against their children.In March, the government unveiled a set of plans including home visits to long-term absentees from schools and a supervising network for children suspected to be at high risk of being exploited. “The number of reports on suspected child abuses and the consequent rate of stern punishment for the offenders has soared since the government plan was announced,” said Education Minister Lee Jun-sik, touting it as a “progress.” The number of reported child abuse cases stood at 2,152 in April, up 45.5 percent from the same period a year earlier. Of the total number of child abuse suspects, 7.4 percent were reported to prosecutors, up 21.5 percent from the same period in 2015.

The routine is followed by laundry, toilet cleaning, changing moisture absorbers inside closets and a shower. Before stepping outside, she wears sunscreen on her face and neck and sprays deodorant on her jacket.On an ordinary morning, Shin uses at least eight household chemical products -- detergent, bleach, toilet cleaner, dehumidifier, shampoo, toothpaste, sunscreen and deodorant -- most of them containing biocide.A biocide is a substance formulated to destroy organisms harmful for humans and is often included in household products for antibiotic or sterilizing purposes.These products, however, can exert negative influence on people if used in excessive doses, experts point out.  Under the current law, it is the Environment Ministry that assumes general responsibility over substance toxicity, but only 15 types of household products come under the supervision of the ministry as according to the to the Chemicals Registration and Assessment Act. Of them, just three are classified as biocide product to be directly handled by the ministry -- antiseptic, repellent and preservative.The management of other biocide-containing products is broken down to four different departments. Sterilizers are managed by the Health Ministry, pesticides by the Agriculture Ministry, antifoulants by the Maritime Ministry and dehumidifiers by the Industry Ministry.Such dispersive system comes in contrast to that of the European Union which since 1998 has adopted an integrated management system over all biocide products.Experts argue that the overlapping roles of ministries and the consequently loose control system may lead to another humidifier sterilizer tragedy. “With several supervising ministries involved, the responsibility issue is likely to occur in case of accidents,” said an official from the Korea Environment Institute. Amid outbreak of toxic humidifier sterilizer tragedy which reportedly led to at least 260 deaths as of April, environmental organizations and researchers argue that current chemicals law should be revised so that more biocide products come under regulation.“You can basically view all chemicals -- including biocides -- as potentially harmful,” a researcher from the National Forensics Service told The Korea Herald.“The current law only defines the management manual of chemical products based on their toxicity, excluding the detailed use and exposure.”By Kim Da-sol","housewife begins her day ,laundry toilet cleaning changing ,closets and shower before ,old housewife begins her ,washing piles of dishes","['Shin Hyang - gi', 'Shin']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68809229  0.20608199

There were also people -- many of them young women -- looking visibly shocked and grief-stricken, with their eyes glued to the pastel-colored post-its filled with heartbreaking messages.“No one should die just because she is a woman,” read one of the messages. “I know I could’ve been you, you could’ve been me,” said another. The flowers and messages were left as tributes for the 23-year-old woman who had been stabbed to death the night before in the public bathroom of a four-story building near Gangnam Station. Visitors pay tribute to a 23-year-old woman in an alleged hate crime, near exit 10 of Gangnam Station on Wednesday. The 34-year-old murder suspect, with whom the victim allegedly had no prior contact, told the police he committed the crime because he had been “belittled by women” many times in the past. Security footage showed the man wandering around the building and entering the bathroom a few minutes before the victim. Police said Thursday that the man is believed to be schizophrenic, having been hospitalized multiple times before.The idea to leave tributes to the late victim at the nearby subway station was initiated by two online communities for women, who created a Twitter account on Wednesday morning. The account handle is @0517am1, in reference to the day and time the victim lost her life. “A young woman who was just having drinks with her friends was stabbed to death only because she went to the public bathroom  in the middle of the gathering,” one of the tweets said, asking the public to support the cause. “If we don’t do anything about this case, then the next victim could be any one of us.”Cho Su-min, a 23-year-old woman, said she came to the site after learning about the case via Twitter. “I feel scared and powerless,” she told The Korea Herald. “But I feel this is the least I can do. It’s especially devastating because I’ve been thinking that among all areas in Seoul, Gangnam is one of the safer areas.”With shock over the case growing, the police on Thursday said that it should not be perceived as a misogynist crime.“As the suspect is suffering from a serious level of schizophrenia, it is difficult to view the motive as hatred toward women,” the Seocho Police Station said. They said a profiler was interviewing the man.But shadows of discrimination and misogyny have lingered over the case. Some of those who left tributes at the subway station also attached to their messages printed-out responses that others had had toward news reports on the murder. “Ugly Korean women can relax,” said one of them. “No one’s going to touch you so stop worrying and use the public bathrooms as much as you need.”Some said the motive of the murder is no longer the main point.Kim Ha-ram and Kang Min-kyung, both 30, said they had come to see the tributes after being enraged by several media reports on the case. For instance, one of the major dailies here published a report with the headline: “Theology student who dreamed of becoming pastor commits impulsive murder.” It also reported that the suspect was often “mistreated” by a number of women while working at a church. “I thought  was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Kim. “Why do we even need to know that about the suspect? Why does it even matter that he studied theology? What about the late victim and the dreams and goals she may have had? The report almost sounded as if the suspect’s future was ruined because of the victim.”Kang added that the news reports were problematic because they seemed to indirectly blame women for the suspect’s crime. “Instead of saying he did it because he was ‘mistreated’ by women, the reports should have said that he had issues with his confidence. Being mistreated by the opposite gender does not justify murder.”Most of those who left flowers for the victim purchased them from Songrim Flowers, a flower shop minutes away from exit 10 of Gangnam Station.“People have been coming in since 8 a.m. to pay tribute. I think we’ve received more than 100 people so far,” said Kim Song-rim, a 70-year-old florist who has run the shop for 30 years. “I’ve been working in this district for a long time, and Gangnam has always been filled with young people. It’s heartbreaking to learn that something so terrible has happened in this area.”Statistics show that violence against women, especially in the context of dating or courtship, is prevalent in South Korea. According to a 2014 study by Lee Hwa-young from Korea Women’s Hot Line, up to 50 percent of Korean women have been physically abused by their romantic partners at least once in their lives. The study also showed that almost 90 percent of the surveyed women said they had either been physically or emotionally abused by their partners or boyfriends. Last year, a man in his 20s was criminally charged after it was revealed that he murdered his girlfriend shortly after she tried to break up with him, then secretly buried her body. Voyeuristic sexual crimes against women, such as taking pictures of body parts in public spaces, also increased dramatically here from 2005-14.A survey released in March by the Korean Women’s Development Institute had shown that more than half of South Korean men do not object to expressions such as “Kimchinyeo” and “Doenjangnyeo,” which describe “materialistic Korean women.” Such terms, which are considered derogatory to women, are widely used on social media and other platforms. A 28-year-old woman, who only wanted to be identified by her surname Lee, learned about the murder case on Wednesday morning -- shortly after being sexually harassed by a man at Gangnam Station. The man ran away when Lee tried to confront him. “I was really angry so I called my friend to talk about it,” she told The Korea Herald. “I told her that I wish I had at least had the chance to curse at him. That’s when my friend told me about the murder case and said, ‘I think it’s good that you didn’t. Who knows what could’ve happened to you if you did ?’”Lee said that her friend’s advice reflects the reality of Korean society in that many female victims of violence are blamed for what happened to them. Common examples of shaming victims include blaming them for “being too drunk” or “hanging out late at night,” or even saying “they should have known better.” Even the Gender Ministry’s campaign ad against sexual harassment last year encouraged women not to wear miniskirts when riding the subway.“I’ve never felt that being a woman in Korea is so hard until today,” she said.Lee left a tribute to the recent victim on two post-it notes.

Also, the test operations of self-driving cars will be expanded across the nation and 3-D printers to produce medical devices will be introduced.“But when it comes to the big data sector, more is to be done,” the president said, asking for eased rules in the protection of personal information.The state-affiliated panel on investment in new industries has so far received 151 calls for deregulation and decided to abolish 141 or 93 percent of them, according to Cheong Wa Dae.Reflecting the day’s discussions and complaints from local firms, the government will also draft guidelines on the range of information that wearable devices can gather by next month.“It is also crucial that public servants grow out of their passiveness and step out actively in promoting industrial development,” Park added. She cited the example of Yeosu which recently induced foreign investment amounting to 100 billion won  by persuading opposing environmental groups.By Bae Hyun-jung","wednesday demanded drastic deregulations ,drones biotech ,on wednesday demanded drastic ,new growth industrial sectors ,wednesday demanded drastic","['Park Geun - hye', 'Park Geun']",2,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.82904744  0.82404792

But an annual average of around 28,000 people are able to serve in alternative fields. The main beneficiaries are students from natural science or engineering majors who are allowed to continue research or work at institutes each year, but there are others allowed to assist in the jobs of police, the coast guard, firemen and other workers in public sectors.The official explained that by requiring these men to serve in the military instead, the military will be able to resolve the shortage in soldiers.The ministry stressed that the plan was not yet set in stone, and that it is still holding consultations with the public organizations that employ the conscripted.The plan immediately sparked backlash from science and engineering majors here.Student councils of technology schools including the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology said they plan to hold a signature-collecting campaign and press conferences in protest of the plan. KAIST’s student council said that most of the school’s students will be affected by the change that they said would disrupt the continuity of their education and research, and negatively impact the entire field of science and engineering. Past administrations have suggested abolishment of the alternative military service system, but such plans were thwarted mainly by financial restraints. Wages for the mandatory servicemen -- regardless of their field of work -- is around 178,000 won  per month. The legal minimum monthly wage for a 40-hour-a-week job is 1.26 million won.By Yoon Min-sik","gradually abolish the military ,000 soldiers by 2023 ,annual shortage of 20 ,dwindling population the military ,korea to abolish alternative","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.80839914  0.49890393

He later stole two other ID cards.The government said the new system, slated to be adopted later this year, works by granting access to areas by comparing physical characteristics already stored in a computer or memory device with that of the person wanting to enter a facility.Currently, one or two security guards check the people's ID cards with their naked eyes.The new system has been evaluated to be appropriate for government office buildings where there is a large number of visitors, according to the ministry. On average some 32,000 regular employees and around 6,000 visitors enter the four government complexes in the country every day. The interior ministry said it will also revise regulations to punish public officials who do not promptly report their missing ID cards or those who lend their cards to others. Employees in charge of security will conduct a monthly mock training to raise the security consciousness.""Among other things, we will do our best to establish a security consciousness in public officials to prevent any similar events from happening again,"" Interior Minister Hong Yun-sik said.","korea government said thursday ,man broke into government ,central seoul to tamper ,following high profile illegal ,thursday it will beef","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Ministry of the Interior', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55985326  0.38437086

The country's overall unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in March, down from 4.9 percent the previous month.The government has often blamed rigidity in the labor market for the high jobless rate, claiming automatic annual pay raises have long prevented the voluntary departure of under-performing employees, and also citing labor market rigidity as a cause of the ongoing slump for Asia's fourth-largest economy.In its latest quarterly revision announced last month, the Bank of Korea projected the local economy will expand 2.8 percent this year, down from a 3 percent on-year expansion forecast three months earlier.Previous government efforts to boost labor flexibility included a wage peak system, under which workers, often regardless of their performance, will have their salary permanently reduced once they reach a certain age. The system too has faced and continues to face strong resistance from the two labor organizations -- the Federation of Korean Trade Unions  and the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions .The two labor organizations promised an even stronger fight against the performance-linked wage system, insisting that the evaluation of so-called performance cannot but be subjective, which in turn will force laborers to be nothing but obedient.""A wage system that will grade laborers based on how close they are to the management and pay different wages based on such evaluation will only weaken or remove public service of public firms and threaten the lives and safety of the people,"" they said in a joint press conference in Seoul.The two labor organizations said they will hold a protest rally in Seoul on June 18, with some 50,000 people expected to take part.They will stage an all-out walkout of their 200,000-strong members in September if the government continues to push for the introduction of the new wage system, they added. The labor organizations agree the new wage system will help reduce the jobless rate, but only by creating what they call temporary and poor-quality jobs.On Monday, the government said it will freeze the wages of workers at all public enterprises that fail to introduce or expand the performance-based wage system before the year's end.On the other hand, those that voluntarily introduce the new wage system before the deadline will be given an incentive of up to 30 percent of their workers' monthly salary, according to the finance ministry, which aims to introduce the new pay system to 120 public companies and institutions in the first phase by the year's end.Already, more than 40 percent of the 120 entities had introduced or completed a process to introduce the new wage system as of Monday.Resistance is particularly strong among financial public companies.Kim Jae-chun, CEO of Korea Housing Finance Corp., offered to resign last week after over 85 percent of its unionized employees voted down the performance-based salary system. The Korea Development Bank, the Industrial Bank of Korea, the Export-Import Bank of Korea and almost all other state-run banks have yet to shift to the new pay system.Yim Jong-yong, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, convened a meeting of financial public company CEOs on Tuesday and warned that institutions failing to comply with the performance-based pay will be given various disadvantages in compensation, budget allowance and payrolls.""A culture of performance-based salary should be introduced to financial public companies as soon as possible, in order to shake off their easy-going image,"" said Yim.","sagging economy the government ,be crippling battle ,labor deepen conflict over ,crippling battle for both ,could be crippling battle",[],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64943665  0.16492228

Records showed Wong had arrived in Gumi on April 20. He had no in-town acquaintances.A number of residents testified to having seen the man loitering in underpants scavenging through trash cans. The police said that murder was unlikely as Wong’s body showed no signs of violence and as the water tank is structured in a way that would make it difficult to dump a body in. An autopsy will be performed on Wednesday to determine the cause of death, and hopefully inform the investigation into how Wong’s body came to be in the tank.Wong’s body was found at around 1:30 p.m. on Monday by a member of the apartment management team inspecting the water tank after residents raised complaints. The police said that Wong is likely to have been dead for more than 10 days based on the degree of decomposition.By Lim Jeong-yeo","chinese man found dead ,man found dead in ,man found dead ,water tank mystery corpse ,found dead in water","['Gumi', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Chinese', 'Wong', 'Pohang', 'Gumi']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71345747 -0.02947226

Security Council's fresh sanctions resolution against North Korea that was adopted in March in response to Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test in January.The North was also penalized for carrying out a banned long-range ballistic missile launch in February. The sanctions aim to starve the Pyongyang regime of the resources it needs to develop its nuclear and missile programs, and the effective boycott of the Air Koryo flight could be the latest step in that campaign.Despite the Security Council's additional resolution against North Korea, however, Thailand has maintained political and economic relations with North Korea since 1975 when the two countries formed diplomatic ties.","terminates flights between pyongyang ,flag carrier terminates flights ,news media reported wednesday ,carrier terminates flights ,carrier terminates flights between","[""North Korea 's"", 'Air Koryo', 'Pyongyang', 'Bangkok', 'Washington', 'Voice of America', 'Bangkok', 'Suvarnabhumi']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.12041345  1.06358802

The Ansan Danwon police, which is in charge of the case, said the victim’s face was badly decomposed, making it impossible to identify him by his face. His bloated fingers meant that it would take at least five hours to scan his fingerprints. As soon as they are certain of his identity, the police will search for suspects.

Illegal residents who are caught during clampdowns, or while committing crimes, are sent to designated shelters until their deportation. The period of such detention is usually prolonged due to administrative reasons. The shelters also house a number of refugee seekers who wait through their application process that takes up to several years. Deportees sit and sleep on a makeshift platform at the deportation room inside Incheon International Airport. The constitutional appeal was filed by an Iranian whose personal information was withheld. The Iranian, who had illegally lived here since 2007, requested for refugee status in 2012. Until the government gave the person asylum status in 2014, the Iranian was held in the protection facility. The person contended that it was a violation of human rights to have asylum seekers confined in the facility, taking issue with how the detention period does not have a maximum limit.Noting that the Iranian was eventually granted the refugee status, five of the judges dismissed the case. They, however, released their views that the immigration control regulation is constitutional. “The protection and monitoring is necessary for foreigners who are ordered to be deported for doing illegal activities, as it cannot be assured that there will be no cases of runaways,” they said. They also mentioned the possibility of the deportees using the refugee application process to evade deportation.“But there is also a need to adopt a rule that limits the time of protection to prevent unfair detention,” they added.The four other judges said protecting the foreigner before deportation breached basic rights.“There exists unconstitutionality in that the regulation does not have an upper limit on its ‘protection’ that is more relevant to ‘detention,’ and that it treats asylum seekers the same way as other persons subject to deportation,” they said.“There should a system that allows a review by a third party organization over the validity of the confinement,” they said. By Lee Hyun-jeong","court on tuesday dismissed ,their repatriation illegal residents ,repatriation illegal residents who ,tuesday dismissed the request ,until their repatriation illegal","['the Constitutional Court', 'south korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44222444 -0.06470545

""We listen closely to the South Korean concerns and take them seriously, without canceling or postponing the visit."" ""To change the visit only out of fear that it could be misused by the DPRK government is not reason enough to cancel or postpone the visit which has been prepared extensively for more than 2 years,"" Uwe said. ""Fear can never be a justification for our actions or inactions, and force does not sustain peace. Fear can keep us apart; building bridges through dialogues can bring us closer together,"" he said. Uwe said he hoped the visit could be used as a ""tool for silent diplomacy to bring about positive change and further mutual understanding.""The foundation's Asian office is based in Bangkok and the South Korean Embassy in Thailand expressed concerns about the trip, according to Uwe. Uwe said the trip focuses on academic and educational activities and ""will not involve any political activities."" ""We want to give the young generation in the DPRK a voice, a voice seldom heard of and listened to, a voice that could provide hope for peaceful changes, an opportunity not to be missed, because we change nothing by not going, we change nothing by not engaging,"" Uwe said.The three Nobel laureates from Norway, Israel and Britain -- Finn E.

He sped away without stopping or slowing down. Due to the collision, the front of the motorcycle was badly crushed and the rider, aged 55, suffered bruises on the buttocks and elbows.  The man drove on for about 300 meters before turning around and returning to a spot 50 meters away from the accident. There he called his father, 58, who arrived 1 1/2 hours later to help collect the broken shards of the car’s front bumper from the streets in an attempt to eliminate evidence. The two also replaced the shattered bumper.The police arrested the duo based on surveillance camera footage. According to the police, the father had initially denied charges but later confessed that he had “turned into a bad example of a father out of fear that his son would be punished.”The police said the son’s driver’s license has been canceled and that he will not be able to reapply for one for the next four years. As for the father, although his actions appear socially condemnable, the police said he was released as article 115 of Korean criminal law states that crimes committed out of responsibility to family members are not punishable by man-made law.In the investigation, the police found out that the son, three months after the hit-and-run accident, was involved in another accident while drunk driving. The police are currently questioning whether the man was also drunk on the night of the hit-and-run accident.

If the motion is passed, public workers will have a four-day holiday weekend, running until May 8. Employees from private companies, however, are able to enjoy the extra holiday only if their employers decide to follow suit.YonhapThe move came a day after the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the nation’s largest business association, made the proposal. The pro-business organization said the measure would create additional domestic demand amid the sluggish economy. “The economic effect would be bigger than the government’s 2015 decision to declare Aug. 14 as a holiday,” it said. The date last year was designated as a temporary holiday as the Aug. 15 Liberation Day fell on a weekend.Hyundai Research Institute had assessed that last year’s temporary holiday would create some 1.31 trillion won . The KCCI said the economic benefits will be larger this year because most public schools have already designated May 6 as a day off, with the government urging its workers to take leave.Since temporary holidays are not obligatory by law, designating them has also been criticized for neglecting workers at small and medium-sized companies and considered a shortcut to briefly prop up approval ratings of the government.“I am afraid the measure would be only limited to public workers and those working at big companies,” said a 32-year-old worker at small public relations firm in Seoul. “If the government wants to give us a holiday, they should make it mandatory,” the worker said. According to the survey by the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, more than a third of its member did not benefit from the 2015 temporary holiday because they were either not informed in advance or were not entitled to take extra holidays under the contract. There are currently nine bills pending at the National Assembly to make extra holidays mandatory. But the legislations are expected to be abandoned, as the outgoing parliament only has one month left of its term.In 2013, the government implemented the system allowing workers to take an extra day off when a national holiday overlaps with the weekend, but the measure faced resistance from the business groups. At the time, most business associations countered that if the government granted more holidays to workers, they would be discouraged from being motivated to work and give the company the burden of paying extra salary for those working those days.“It should be a temporary measure because we have to consider fluctuation between supply and demand. If we make it a permanent and mandatory measure, it would be hard for us to be flexible according to economic climate,” Park Chae-woong, a spokesperson for the KCCI told The Korea Herald.By Yeo Jun-suk","thursday cabinet meeting and ,have four day holiday ,at thursday cabinet meeting ,thursday cabinet meeting ,government is considering granting",['Cheong'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67318916  0.47724018

""The only thing left was to respond to nukes with nukes.""Ri also said that sanctions on the North are a challenge to sustainable development, but the country won't give in to such measures. He also said that U.S. attempts to topple the North through an economic blockade are an expression of ignorance.Ri also said the North will make sure to get compensation for the U.S. hampering the North's sustainable development, and urged Washington to immediately end its ""hostile policy"" toward Pyongyang.The top North Korean diplomat arrived in New York for the signing of a historic U.N. climate agreement set for Friday.The trip has drawn keen media attention as it marks Ri's first since tensions spiked following the North's fourth nuclear test in January, its long-range rocket launch in February and the adoption of a new U.N. sanctions resolution last month.Ri last visited New York in September to attend the U.N. General Assembly.Speculation had arisen that the trip could provide opportunities for Ri to hold talks with U.S. officials, such as Secretary of State John Kerry amid growing concern that the North could conduct yet another nuclear test.

The man had been a prime suspect as he had been a frequent visitor to the bar where the victim had worked. His cellphone showed records of text messages exchanged with the victim. He had also privately met with her at nighttime prior to her disappearance.However, further police inquisition revealed the man lacked motive and had specific alibis for the presumed time of her death. He was freed within forty hours of arrest.“Still there were progress to the investigation as we could confirm the victim’s whereabouts before death and other pertinent leads,” the police said.  The 22-year-old victim had arrived in Korea in October, 2015 and overstayed her tourist visa to work at a bar in Jejudo Island. She was found dead with six wounds from a sharp object in a field near Seogwipo on April 13.DNA test results from National Forensics Service indicated the victim was not sexually assaulted before her death. The NFS also confirmed the victim’s identity using a fingerprint taken from the index finger of the body.Police are in the process of delivering the news to the victim’s family, who live in Southern China, through the Chinese Embassy. Based on the extent of the body’s decomposition and the statements made by the bar owner where the victim had worked in December that she disappeared before completing the first month’s work, the police estimate that she died around the end of last year when she suddenly became unreachable. The bar owner said that “everyone thought she just went away without saying anything” and that no one had tried to report the case as they feared her illegal employment would adversely affect their business. An additional 10 police officers have been assigned to the investigation team working on the case. The police think the murder took place somewhere other than where the victim’s body was discovered, as the owner of a nearby barley field stated that he had not noticed anything out of the ordinary in December and January, when he had worked on the fields.By Lim Jeong-yeo","murder suspect freed investigation ,murdering chinese woman whose ,jeju murder suspect freed ,of murdering chinese woman ,freed late tuesday due",['chinese'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.34989542  0.3815161

One of them is a shitzu, presumably 6 years old, that he found on the beach while traveling in Jebudo Island four years ago. Another is a black poodle, found abandoned near his apartment before being adopted by him last year.“My family started to have more conversations and bonding time thanks to these two that we vowed to love and take good care of,” Kim said. As the shitzu -- named Casso after the pension that he was staying at when he found the dog -- only pees outside, his parents get to exercise every day by taking him for a walk, he said. His mother also started making organic snacks for the dogs and joined a pet club.“I have always had a soft corner for stray dogs as they are completely deprived of a safe environment where they can eat or sleep. It made me decide to adopt these two and give them love as I felt even closer to them,” he added.South Korea has been seeing a steady rise in the number of pet owners who decide to adopt rather than buy. According to latest statistics available, over 2,700 animals at some 400 animal shelters nationwide were adopted in 2014, up from just 790 in 2003.Seoul City is holding a pet adoption service every second and fourth Saturday, from this month to October, in conjunction with civic groups. The threefold jump in pets adopted through animal care centers can be attributed to the improved hygiene of pets at such places, said Lim Young-gi, the head of Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth. Animal care centers maintain sanitation standards and actively check vaccinations for animals so they can be ready to go to a new home anytime, said Lim.“People who visit here actually feel a high level of satisfaction when they see dogs and cats kept in a better condition than they expected.”Some 343 animal care centers, or 93 per cent of them, are funded by local governments, which also conduct regular medical checkups and education on the protection and sanitation of pets.Ministry data in 2015 showed that 4.57 million families in South Korea, or 10 million individuals, live with pets.Of them, slightly above 71 percent have dogs, while 13 percent live with cats. Those in their 20s and 30s made up the bulk of pet owners -- 74 percent -- followed by those in their 40s at 13 percent. There were 880,000 pet dogs registered with the authorities as of 2014, following the compulsory registration law which took effect in January 2014. A decade ago, most pet purchases were done at Chungmuro Pet Street where a group of pet stores, animal hospitals, groomers, and veterinarian offices are located near subway line No. 3 Chungmuro Station in central Seoul.But now, more pet breeders are opting to offer animals for adoption through different avenues such as pet care centers, animal hospitals and online pet shops. Luxe services have also grown popular at animal hospitals, and the number of animal hospitals reached 4,000 last year, with about half of them equipped with pet adoption services. In line with the rising interest in pet adoption, experts expect the size of pet-related market to swell to 6 trillion won  by 2020. “The booming pet adoption trend is mainly due to an increased number of single households and individuals with high stress levels, who tend to look to their pets to relax,” said Kim Sun-hee from the Korea Consumer Agency in a report.“Koreans’ changing perception toward pets by accepting them as human companions and friends is another reason,” she added. With the booming pet culture, there are also more services that cater to them these days. The number of pet food and product companies was 4,900 in 2014, with an over 17,000-strong workforce and total sales of 680 billion won. There were also a total of 3,640 veterinary business, with 10,500 workers, recording total sales of 780 billion won.According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, jobs and government-authorized certificates that specialize in pets are also gaining popularity.Pet funeral directors, who carry out roughly the same services for pets as for humans that pass away, take care of the funeral process and counseling. Statistics in 2015 showed that the pet funeral service market is worth 90 billion won, triple in size compared to the year before. This year in January, a new regulation came into effect to stop disposing corpses of pets as garbage, making it easier for pet funeral homes to provide their services.There are also pet emotion therapists, who can apparently help communication between pets and owners through telepathy and conversation. Pet welfare social workers can also help build up a constructive relationship between owners and their pets. “There will be more jobs related to pets, just like in the United States where pets are also used as a medium of therapy for elders and depression patients,” professor Chung Hoon of the department of animal resource from Sahmyook University told The Korea Herald.“We are seeing a growing number of students enrolling for pet-related majors in our university. Nearly 20 percent of students wished to continue their career in the pet business last year, but the number is now well above 40 percent,” Chung added.By Kim Da-sol This is the third installment in a series of articles that look at South Korea’s pet culture and industry.-Ed.","black poodle found abandoned ,korea pet culture evolves ,poodle found abandoned near ,last year my family ,another is black poodle","['Daniel Kim', 'Incheon', 'Jebudo Island']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88807511  0.62283313

She said she wanted her child to have an opportunity to mingle with the nondisabled. But the mere task of going to school and spending a day there has become a challenge, as the son needs help moving due to paralysis of both legs. “My son needs support to move and to study and even to go the restroom just as all other disabled students need. But as only one assistant teacher takes care of all five disabled students at the school, there are sometimes conflicts between parents over having the assistant teacher,” she said.Members of civic group Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities urge the city government to draw up support measures for children with developmental disabilities at Seoul City Hall, Monday. YonhapAs much as the family was determined at the beginning, Doh said she is now considering moving him to a special education school, as attending a general public one is just turning out not to be realistic.Despite the Korean government’s efforts to integrate the disabled and nondisabled in class, the lack of practical support for disabled students in general schools is pushing the disabled to look for alternatives. Lackluster progress in “inclusive” educationMarking the 36th annual Disabled Persons Day on Wednesday, Korea has strived to integrate the classes of the disabled with those of the nondisabled for years. The concept of “inclusive class” was first introduced in Korea under the special education promotion act in 1994. The law aimed to protect the educational rights of special needs students and ensure that they learn together with nondisabled students. The regulation requires schools to provide full support for disabled students to be part of the class.As of last year, the local disabled population reached about 2.4 million. Of them around 88,000 are underage students and about 70 percent go to general schools for inclusive classes. “The environment of general schools is very helpful for the disabled as it educationally stimulates them. They not only have chances to study knowledge, but also learn how to interact with the nondisabled,” said special education professor Cho Hong-joong from Chonnam National University in Gwangju. Despite the high participation rate in inclusive classes, the ideal, however, has not been practically implemented due mainly to lack of manpower and measures that are needed to embrace the various types of disability. About 18,000 special education teachers take care of the 88,000 disabled students, which is one faculty member for every 4.8 disabled students. Under the special education law, the ratio was stipulated to be at least four students per one teacher. Unlike the initial goal of inclusive education, many schools have also tended to separately run special education classrooms for the disabled. About 9,900 special education classrooms were operating at general schools in the country last year, up by 42 percent compared to 2007.They have all the disabled students in one separate classroom regardless of the disability types, and special education teachers teach them with the support of a few assistant teachers. Of the 70 percent of students going to general schools, only about 18 percent of the disabled students study together with the nondisabled in general classrooms, the ministry said. This has led to the parents and educators of the disabled pointing out that the current system does not achieve the true goal of the inclusive class. “It’s critical to evaluate whether there is an actual educational effect of the inclusive education. Going to general school does not necessarily mean actual inclusion. Is it a true inclusive class when students with different disabilities are unilaterally taught by one or two special education teachers in a separate classroom?” said Lee Moon-hi, the president of disabled rights group Korea Differently Abled Federation. The Education Ministry defended that expanding the special education classrooms is part of efforts to reflect the reality.“The government fundamentally seeks for the inclusive class. In reality, however, not all disabled children can follow the regular curriculum. Depending on the disability level under certain criteria, students are sent to the special education classrooms or special education schools,” said an official from the Education Ministry. Many disabled rights activists do recognize that practical inclusive education is challenging for those with severe disabilities and the need for special education for them.They, however, also point out that efforts to make classrooms more inclusive will only come hand-in-hand with the overall improvement of the current education system in the country.“The inclusive class is not difficult in the preschool stage as the learning level is elementary. Starting from middle school, however, nondisabled students prepare for the college entrance exam under the grade-oriented education system. As the curriculum gets harder, many disabled students face hurdles in following the courses,” said Kim Chi-hun, the disability policy and research director of Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities.  Under the current education rule, all students are mandated to take certain hours of a number of subjects to go onto the next level of education. These compulsory subjects are unilaterally determined by the ministry, posing more challenges to those with disabilities. “Unless the whole education system that focuses on exams and grades is changed, there is no way for the disabled to be part of the class. The ultimate goal of inclusive education is to embrace and respect the diversity of students, ranging from race, gender to disability.""Special education schools not welcomed by neighbors Facing barriers in general middle and high schools, many parents of disabled students tend to give up on the schools with inclusive classes and inevitably choose special education schools. “The transfer rate of the disabled from general schools to special education during the middle and high school period is three times that of the rate during the preschool and elementary school period. This shows that the actual inclusive class failed,” said professor Cho. For parents, however, deciding to transfer their children to a special education school still poses hurdles, as there are not enough of such institutions nationwide. According to the Education Ministry, a total of 167 special education schools were running in the country as of last year. Only one new school was established in the year. About 26,100 disabled students attend special education schools, which accounts for about 30 percent of the total number of disabled students. While the ministry vowed to build 21 new special education schools across the country by 2019, the outcome remains uncertain, as many residents oppose building them in their neighborhoods. In the case of Seoul, which currently runs 29 special education schools, no new schools have been built since 2003. Two special education schools for children with developmental disorders were initially planned to be built in Seoul by 2018 and 2019, but neither has broken ground for construction yet. “It is true that the number of special education schools is insufficient in the country.  has put efforts to establish more schools. But such plans often face fierce opposition from residents who are concerned with the image of their communities or their land value,” the ministry official added. While the government attempts to boost measures to improve the educational rights of disabled students, what parents consider most essential is raising public awareness over the disabilities. “Many nondisabled students and their parents think that they are yielding their space and time to the disabled students. But that’s not true. They overlook that the disabled also have educational rights,” said Doh, the mother of the son with brain lesions. Some stress that understanding is most helpful than anything else to true integration. “When a student with a developmental disorder suddenly screams in class or gets out of the classroom, there’s a need for a certain level of awareness toward nondisabled students so that they can understand and accept the behavior. The idea of inclusive class is not merely for underage students but for the whole community. What many parents hope for is the true integration of their disabled children into society after graduation,” said Choi Seong-bun, a mother of a 13-year-old girl with autism.

Since 1997, the North has celebrated the April 15 anniversary with lavish festivals to show its respect to the leader who died in 1994.On the anniversary, North Korea attempted to fire off what appeared to be the Musudan medium-range ballistic missile, but the launch ended in failure, according to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff.If confirmed, it was the North's first test-launch of the Musudan missile which is believed to be capable of flying as far as Guam with a range of 3,000-4,000 kilometers.The launch came amid high speculation that North Korea may carry out its fifth nuclear test or fire off a long-range missile ahead of the Day of the Sun or the upcoming party congress slated for May.The U.N. Security Council slapped its toughest sanctions yet on the North in March over its nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year. The North is banned from launching ballistic missiles under a series of relevant U.N. resolutions.""The North seems to be trying to show that it will strongly defy international sanctions,"" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing. "" also appears to have been conducted as part of the North's attempt to show its exploits ahead of the party event.""The Seoul government said that it is closely monitoring a possibility of further provocations by the North and is ready to sternly respond to them.North Korea is ramping up efforts to prepare for the ruling party's first congress in over three decades in early May.The party congress will likely serve as a key event that will reveal the North Korean leader's policy direction in his fifth year in power.

No challenges faced in the fields of energy, environment, safety or health can be solved by a single technique,” Jacques Biot, the president of Ecole Polytechnique said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Ecole Polytechnique, established in 1794, is dedicated to educating students in science and technology at the highest level. The school raised two Nobel Prize laureates in economics in 1988 and 2014, and one in physics in 1903. The former CEO of a strategic consulting firm specializing in life sciences has taken the post of school president since 2013. Biot participated as a plenary speaker in the annual forum of the 2016 International Presidential Forum on Global Research Universities for two days.  While Biot stressed the importance of training students with science and technology courses, he said he does not overlook the necessity of teaching social sciences. One of the traditions of Ecole Polytechnique has been to provide mandatory courses on economics and humanities courses such as philosophy. “No matter how much the technology is developed, it is crucial to make sure that such technology is socially accepted and applied. Therefore, it is not only important to help students understand the techniques, but also to make sure that they have moral consciousness. They need to realize the relationship of sciences and society,” he said.By Lee Hyun-jeong","france most prestigious science ,global challenges said president ,president of ecole polytechnique ,multidisciplinary institutes to better ,most prestigious science oriented","['France', 'Jacques Biot', 'Ecole']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.05694759  0.9064818

According to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, a typical false patient stayed in the hospital for over 144 days for noncommittal illnesses such as gonarthritis within six months of signing 10 different insurance contracts.   The number of false hospitalization and over-the-top treatments were found to have cost the insurance companies 99 billion won  in 2015, up 35.6 percent from 2014’s 73 billion won. The figure from 2014 was up 64.3 percent compared to the year before. The most common punitive measure for those caught fiddling with insurance money was fine, with prison sentence with probation and actual imprisonment following in trail.In an attempt to curb the trend of people taking advantage of loose regulations, a special act on insurance fraud prevention will go into effect starting Sept. 30. The act will punish fraudsters with maximum 10 years’ imprisonment or 50 million won fine.

He is one of some 3 million men in South Korea’s reserve forces. Every man who finishes his mandatory service is classified as a member of the reserve forces and required to serve as a reservist for another eight years. The eight-year service is divided into two categories: “mobilized” and “non-mobilized” training. The former requires the reserve forces to undergo a three-day training session, such as marksmanship training, at the unit that they had served with during active duty. They stay in the barracks throughout the training period. The latter does not require the reservists to return to their previous units. Instead, they must undergo a six-hour reconnaissance drill in their local area and an eight-hour drill for three days at a nearby training ground. They can go home after the exercise. Often, the two types of training have one thing in common: the constant tension between the trainee, who are former enlisted soldiers who had served in the military as part of mandatory duty, and the trainers, mostly former company or field grade officers who have made a career out of the military.  Reservists head for their training. The Korea Herald“It was like training the least motivated unit,” said a 47-year-old battalion commander for a reserve unit in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. “What I expected of them is a little sense of discipline and soldierly attitude, but maybe I am being too naive or old-fashioned,” he said. When the former major arranged a recent training program with his two subordinates, he almost got into a clash with a reservist who refused to turn his cellphone off and listened to the music throughout. While such incidents were common in the past, the situation has gradually improved, according to insiders.With military tension rising high following North Korea’s cross-border provocations and nuclear and long-range rocket tests this year, an increasing number of reservists are publicizing their commitment to the service. Strings of posts were uploaded on popular social media with incumbent and former reservists vowing to fight for the country.“I am so ready to fight,” said one of the posting under a picture of his reserve force uniform.One of the others read, “I just completed my reserve forces training. I wish I wasn’t done with it just yet so that I could fight against the North.”Buoyed by the latest trend, the Defense Ministry said last Friday that it would beef up the reserve training. The plan includes establishing a command dedicated to managing mobilization of the reservists and expanding reserve duties to female soldiers.By Yeo Jun-suk","office worker is nervous ,worried that my boss ,year old office worker ,korea reluctant reservists ,old office worker","['Kim Jung - wook', 'Army', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald ""']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53643656  0.23036553

The director has so far denied the allegations. He refuted the Union’s claims, by saying, “I have never told her to leave because she’s pregnant. She came to ask me to look after her as she is pregnant with her second child, so I merely wished her luck.”The union is arguing that the comments showed the director lacked qualities for his position and that he should resign with a public apology. A dancer in the company who wished to remain anonymous, however, said the director clearly abused his authority many times. “Crossing the director led to adverse placements or pressure to leave the company.

Among all surveyed women, 9.6 percent had been harassed, while 1.8 percent of all male participants had experienced the same.The percentage of victims was the highest among those who are female, in their 20s and in contract positions. 123rfThe study showed that 78.4 percent of all victims did not take any follow-up actions after being harassed, while only 0.9 percent reported their cases to government agencies or authorities at work. Only 6.8 percent asked for an apology from the attackers. Also, almost 40 percent of the victims said they were harassed by their superiors at work. At the same time, 88 percent of all victims said their abusers were male. Many of them were in their 40s and 50s. More than 20 percent of the victims also left their workplace after being harassed, as they felt unsafe and uncomfortable. The biggest portion of the victims said the harassment involved verbal comments about their physical appearance along with sexual innuendo. “I think it is necessary for Koreans to stop commenting on each other’s appearance so often at work, even if they genuinely think they mean well,” said Song In-ja, an official at the Korean Institute for Gender Equality Promotion and Education. “Especially at the workplace, one’s appearance should not be something that one should be judged on, especially by those in superior positions.”Male and female victims had different reasons for not reporting their cases. While 72 percent of the male victims said they took no actions because they didn’t think it was a serious problem, the biggest proportion of the female victims, 50.6 percent, said they didn’t follow up as they believed nothing would change even if they filed a complaint.Even among the victims who reported their cases, more than 50 percent said they were unhappy with the way the authorities handled their cases. The biggest number of them said they were unsatisfied because they never received a formal apology from the abusers, many of whom were their superiors at work. The highest proportion of the victims said they wanted their attackers to receive disciplinary measures from the employer, while 26.4 percent of them wished to work where she or he can be physically away from the perpetrators. While almost half of all surveyed Koreans said sexual harassment was a serious social problem, just 3.2 percent said the abuse was prevalent or serious at their own workplace. “The chances are, many cases at your workplace are kept secret,” said Song. “Most victims don’t want their colleagues to know and just remain silent. It is necessary for all workers in the country to be more informed and conscious of the issue, as well as potential victims in their own workplaces.”By Claire Lee","most korean victims stay ,and 200 private firms ,most korean victims ,korean victims stay silent ,government study showed tuesday",['South Koreans'],2,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.34676537  0.68186921

A post on an online community went viral recently: “Is eating samgyeopsal  at home a problem?”It was written by an apartment resident in Seoul, who said that he had felt insulted when his neighbor who lives upstairs made a fuss because he had cooked samgyeopsal. “He came downstairs to say that cooking samgyeopsal that emanates smell is a public nuisance. But I cannot really agree,” wrote the man.YonhapThere is a growing number of complaints over the smells produced by Korean dishes that are notorious for their distinct and strong odors produced by fermented ingredients. However, there are few ways to settle them. Besides the smell of food, there are also complaints that arise from neighbors smoking at home. Many apartment complexes have regulations that ban smoking within shared spaces in the complex, but it is not illegal to smoke in one’s home.“We have enough restrictions on places to smoke. If we cannot smoke at home, isn’t that a violation of our rights too?” said Park Jeong-hyun, a 42-year-old office worker who said he has often been confronted by people who live above his apartment.On the other hand, a mother of a newborn baby, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “Odors of food can be considered fine, as people have to eat. But smoking is lethal and it should be a crime to let the smoke spread to other homes.”Meanwhile, municipalities are faced with a dilemma on how to solve the growing number of complaints about neighbors. “There is not enough legal background to consider smell between floors as a  problem that needs mediation by the government,” said Kim Woo-cheol from Korea Environment Corp.’s living environment division.“We hear complaints regarding the smell of cooking, cigarette smoke or dogs barking from time to time, but they are not part of our responsibility and are mostly mediated by police or at court which takes a longer time to be resolved,” he added.Korea Environment Corp., which is under the Environment Ministry, launched the National Noise Information System in 2012 to listen, via phone counseling, to complaints from residents about noise between floors. However, it does not cover complaints related to smell. The program helped resolve 49,060 of the 70,200 reported cases, as of February 2016.According to the Korea Environment Corp., the number of complaints over noise in apartments has grown threefold to 15,619 cases in 2015, compared to 7,021 cases in 2012.Social experts said disputes among neighbors may reflect the modern-day Korean’s stress level and poor anger management. “We see cases in which neighbors between floors commit crimes out of rage, as they easily vent anger on small things such as noise or smell,” said Gwak Geum-ju, a professor of psychology at Seoul National University.“As privacy concerns in shared spaces like apartment compounds are inevitable, an official organization or public center to help mediate various conflicts among apartment residents should be established within residents’ community to hear both sides,” she added.

He wanted to exchange a purchase,” Kim said.“When my colleague said she could not help him unless he told her his name, he all of a sudden started screaming and cursing. He eventually said, ‘I know where you are right now, and I’m going to kill you.’ We ended up calling the police.” According to Kim, customer calls that involve cursing, screaming and threats have increased by about three times at his company in the last two years. He did not give his real name as talking to the media about work is prohibited by his employer. 123rf.Such rise in aggressive behavior against strangers can also be seen in the prevalent cases of violent crimes committed out of impulse. Between 2011 and 2014, impulsive crimes made up more than 40 percent of all violent crimes in the country, raising concerns about public mental health and safety. According to research last year by the Korean Association of Psychiatric Practitioners, about 50 percent of Korean adults have experienced symptoms of impulse control disorder at least once, and about 10 percent of them needed treatment. In 2011, a man in his 40s, whose wife had left him after having an extra-marital affair, murdered a female pedestrian. The man told the police that he had killed her because it made him angry that the victim’s appearance resembled that of his wife who had run away from home years ago. Detective Kwon Il-yong from the National Police Agency said the case belongs to the kind of violence that is caused by accumulated despair, social isolation or helplessness. Such cases mostly target random individuals -- such as strangers on the street or those working in customer service -- and are therefore more dangerous and unpredictable. Such anger-related crimes can take the form of violent attacks against neighbors over noise complaints and accidents involving road rage.“We also found that many offenders of impulsive violent crimes tend to have obsessive behaviors as well as anxiety disorders. Some of them also have narcissistic tendencies,” the detective said. A 27-year-old hotelier, who declined to be named, said she has witnessed countless narcissistic individuals among customers who complain violently and make “absurd” demands. For instance, a hotel guest, a woman in her 20s, once asked her to let three of her friends use the hotel’s swimming pool for free. When the hotelier told her that this was not allowed, the guest started crying hysterically and screaming loudly. The woman shouted at her in the lobby, saying, “Why are you trying to ruin my birthday? Who do you think you are?” An Hui-jean, a professional counselor and psychologist, said impulse control disorder and addiction share a lot of similarities. “Both of the conditions occur when you lose your ability to control,” she said. “When you fail to control your urge to go shopping all the time, you become a shopaholic. When you lose your ability to control your anger, you end up with an anger disorder.”The psychologist said those with impulse control disorder are likely to have been raised by parents who did not allow them to freely voice their objections and negative feelings at home. “When a child’s negative emotions are not accepted and acknowledged by the parents, he or she starts to believe that in order to make it clear that they are unhappy with something, they have to be vocal and loud about it. The kid doesn’t learn how to complain or disagree with someone without getting angry. And this is something many adult Koreans don’t know how to do.”Culture critic Lee Moon-won said the high prevalence rate of impulse control disorder is partly linked to the nation’s hierarchal culture in which people engage in relationships at work and in families in strict accordance to one’s age, power and position.“Since you can’t directly complain to your boss or someone who is older in your family, you vent your anger on someone you don’t know, or someone who you think can’t fight back,” Moon said. “That’s why those in the service sector are the most vulnerable to verbal abuse, because many Koreans think customers are the boss-equivalent of those who greet them at shops, restaurants and other businesses.”Psychiatrist Ahn Yong-min from Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul said one’s failure to resist an urge to express anger should be understood as more than just a selfish and violent act. “The person with the condition is more likely feeling a lot of negative emotions, such as sadness and anxiety,” he said. “Expressing anger is their way of escaping such negative feelings inside. The key is to tackle such negative feelings, and encourage those who have anger issues to seek professional help, as the mental condition can easily turn into violent behaviors.”South Korea has a special term for the symptoms of suppressed anger that can eventually lead to physical discomfort or illness: “hwabyeong.” The condition is known to arise when people are unable to confront anger stemming from situations which they perceive to be unjust. Symptoms including tightness in the chest, insomnia and chest pains.Urban Dictionary, an American satirical crowdsourced online dictionary of slang words, describes such traits among Koreans as “kimchi rage.” The website defines this as “a mental state typically exhibited by a Korean who is extremely displeased. This condition is signified by gratuitous violence accompanied by psychotic shrieking. Surrounding people and or objects are usually left injured or damaged.”Culture critic Lee said hwabyeong has its roots in the feudal Korean kingdom that lasted from 1392 to 1897, as its strict class hierarchy and patriarchy offered no social mobility. “For those who belonged to the lower caste, there really was no way for them to fight injustice if they were abused by those who belonged to the higher class,” he said. “The only way was to just endure it. And we also have to remind ourselves that the slavery system from the Joseon kingdom did not completely disappear in Korea until the 1940s.”It seems as if present-day Korea is beginning to resemble the feudal kingdom when it comes to social mobility. According to data by Statistics Korea, only 20 percent of the Korean population feels that achieving a higher socioeconomic status is possible by one’s own efforts.The 27-year-old hotelier said dealing with angry guests often gets her riled. “I feel like it’s an injustice to myself,” she said. “I always have to say sorry even when it’s the guest who is making an unreasonable request or complaint. But I’ve been told to be thankful because at least I have a job when there are so many young people who can’t even pay the bills.” By Claire Lee","female colleague was threatened ,korea biggest home shopping ,the customer was drunk ,shopping channels was stunned ,was stunned last month","['Kim Myung - hun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Kim']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.93564266  0.13433053

Police said that picking up unattended money can be punished by law on charges of theft. But in this case, the women had intended to give up her rights to the money, so there was no legal basis to punish those who gathered the bills. During the questioning at a nearby police box, she allegedly said that she was afraid of her ex-husband and son trying to take her money and would rather donate the money to anyone on the street. The police probe found that she had withdrawn 42 million won in cash from a local bank in Seoul a few days earlier. She arrived in the Seoul Square by taxi and hired a private guard to escort her with a paper bag full of the banknotes. She was neither under threat from her family nor in need of police protection, according to police.","korean woman threw cash ,downtown seoul on monday ,koreans ignore scattered cash ,10 000 won banknotes ,square korean woman threw","['korean', 'Seoul']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49036059  0.00693967

Edward H. Forney helped evacuate about 98,000 Koreans during the Korean War. Now, one of his great-grandsons is here to continue that family history as a researcher studying the two Koreas and their relationship with the United States.Ben Forney, 29, recently began working at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a private security think tank in Seoul, to assist in research mainly on North Korea and regional issues.Speaking in an interview with Yonhap News Agency Friday, it was clear he intended to keep the family connection strong.""I think of it almost as a personal quest or a personal mission to continue my great-grandfather's connection with Korea,"" he said.""I'm very happy to be working at a place like Asan because now I feel like I can contribute my own story, my own part of the story to my family's history with Korea.""The late Forney led the famous Heungnam evacuation in December 1950 to bring 98,000 Korean refugees from the North Korean port of the same name to the South.""I think with the Heungnam evacuation, the thing that inspires me now and when I first heard it is that it's a story that's not really a war story and it's not really a story about politics,"" the Marine's great-grandson said. ""And it's not really a story about soldiers, it's a story about saving people. It's a story about Koreans and Americans working together to do something that seemed impossible.""It was an unlikely operation involving too few ships. One of them -- the SS Meredith Victory, designed to hold 60 people --transported 14,000 refugees to safety in the largest evacuation from land by a single ship.""I think it's a symbol of maybe the peak of Korea-American cooperation,"" Forney said. ""I think it represents the shared values that we have and I think it represents everything we can accomplish if we work together.""He stressed, however, that the story is not over yet as long as the Koreas remain divided.""I think the choices we make today will one day hopefully bring a happy ending to this story,"" he said. ""By that, I mean I hope that the people that my great-grandfather evacuated, I hope one day they can go back to their hometown.""Forney said he believes working at Asan will be one way to help make the decisions that will shape the future of the people who are still alive.""And also just for the situation on the Korean Peninsula. It's not going to get better unless we make it better,"" he said. ""The fact that it's still an ongoing story, to me, is what makes this connection so powerful.""Forney first came to South Korea in 2009 as a Fulbright scholar teaching English in the southwestern port city of Mokpo. Since then, he has studied Korean at Seoul's Yonsei University and studied for a Master's degree in International Area Studies at Seoul National University.He is currently writing his graduate thesis on the intricate links between the North Korean military and economy.Despite his interest in North Korea, Forney said he has no immediate plans to visit the country. Not only would that generate tourism money for the North Korean regime, he said, but it could be dangerous given that he's done many interviews in the past.""If it's useful and helpful, then yeah, I'd love to go, but not in the near future,"" he said. ""They do kind of randomly arrest people. Obviously, in the future, I would love to have a beer in Heungnam.""Asked about his long-term plans, Forney was cautious, but hinted at a career in the U.S. government as a diplomat or policymaker.""But for now, I think a few more years at least, I like living in Seoul and keep getting my Korean to a very professional level.

150,150,150,More South Korean single women freeze their eggs,"Lee Soo-jin (not her real-name), a single woman in her mid-30s in Seoul, recently decided to freeze her eggs, should she later want to have a child. She’s not currently dating anyone and doesn’t have any plans to get married in the near future. 　“I have high professional ambitions, and I’m passionate about my work,” she said through a representative at the Cha Fertility Center, where she underwent the procedure...","Lee Soo-jin , a single woman in her mid-30s in Seoul, recently decided to freeze her eggs, should she later want to have a child. She’s not currently dating anyone and doesn’t have any plans to get married in the near future. “I have high professional ambitions, and I’m passionate about my work,” she said through a representative at the Cha Fertility Center, where she underwent the procedure. “Right now I’m not sure if I ever want to get married or have children. The procedure is more like insurance in case I change my mind later in life. I wanted to leave this option open for myself.”Lee is among a growing number of South Korean women who choose to freeze their eggs in case they want to become pregnant later on in life.  In order to retrieve eggs for freezing, a patient must undergo the same hormone-injection process as in-vitro fertilization which can cause side effects such as hot flushes and headaches. 123RFAccording to the Cha Fertility Center, which is one of the few medical institutions that run an egg bank in South Korea, the number of single women who froze eggs at the hospital increased dramatically from 2014-2015, from 56 to 128. In 2013, only 30 single women underwent the same procedure at the center.Among the 128 women, the largest proportion of them, 36 percent, were those aged 35-40 who had high-paying professional jobs. Those in their 40s accounted for 35 percent. Notably, single women in their 20s also accounted for 14 percent of all women who opted to freeze their eggs at the medical institution.As more women are postponing having a family as they focus on their careers, the number of pregnancies after age 35 has been increasing here, which is considered one of the biggest contributing factors to the rise of preterm births in the country. Last year, women aged 35 and older accounted for 24 percent of all women who gave birth. On average, Korean women gave birth to their first child at the age of 31.2 last year, a 0.24 year increase from the 2014. In 2013, Korean babies born before the 37th week of pregnancy which died from premature birth complications accounted for 59.6 percent of infant mortality in the country.“I definitely want to consider the option of freezing my eggs when I turn 35 and have no prospects for marriage,” said Han Ji-yeon , a single 31-year-old woman in Seoul. “I think it may be a better option than going through a high-risk pregnancy when I’m in my 40s. Right now, I guess I’m just not that desperate.”Egg freezing has been traditionally used by women diagnosed with cancer who want to preserve their fertility before undergoing potentially sterilizing chemotherapy. In order to retrieve eggs for freezing, a patient must undergo the same hormone-injection process as in-vitro fertilization. The only difference is that the retrieved eggs are frozen for a period of time, instead of being fertilized and transferred to the uterus as embryos. The Health Ministry currently does not have a list of all egg and sperm banks in the country, as South Korea does not have any legislation that is specific to freezing one’s own eggs or sperm for later use, according to Sohn Tae-won from the ministry’s Division of Bioethics and Safety. However, there are a total of 144 medical institutions in Korea that are capable of storing artificially fertilized embryos for up to five years, he said. The egg bank at the Cha Fertility Center said it can store an egg up to 10 years. The procedure is currently not covered by the National Insurance Service. While the numbers were not formally confirmed, it generally costs about 500,000 won  for a woman without any preexisting health conditions to undergo the hormone-injection process as well as the egg retrieval. “It can cost a lot more for cancer patients and those with a medical history of infertility,” a source said.Kim Ja-yeon, a gynecologist at the Cha Fertility Center, said egg freezing can be a great option for future parents who would like to avoid problems resulting from infertility from advancing age. The number of Koreans who sought medical help for infertility has increased significantly in recent years, from 178,000 in 2007 to 215,000 in 2013. “As long as a woman has her healthy egg frozen before reaching age 37, it’s still possible to get pregnant without a lot of problems,” she said in a statement.However, Choi Doo-seok, a gynecologist at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, said egg freezing is not always safe. The use of a needle to collect the eggs can possibly cause infection, bleeding and damage to the bladder and bowel.  “Eggs are not as easy to freeze as it is to freeze sperm and embryos, and it may result in decrease in quality after they are thawed,” he said. “Just as IVF has side effects, so does egg-freezing. The two procedures are virtually the same. Women should pursue natural pregnancies before considering this option.” By Claire Lee","women freeze their eggs ,korean single women freeze ,freeze her eggs ,to freeze her eggs ,freeze her eggs should","['Lee Soo - jin', 'Seoul', 'the Cha Fertility Center']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37111244  0.3852258

Still South Korea, the U.S. and other regional powers view it as a cover for testing its ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.The new sanctions would require mandatory inspections of all cargo going in and out of North Korea, ban exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources -- a key source of hard currency for Pyongyang - and prohibit all small arms and other conventional weapons from being sold to the North.The resolution, which is expected to be formally adopted as early as Saturday, also calls for banning jet and rocket fuel supplies to the North, and grounding North Korean flights suspected of carrying contraband, and denying suspicious vessels carrying illicit items access to ports.","rocket has the longest ,tank laser guided rocket ,laser guided rocket ,new anti tank guided ,accurate as sniper rifle","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'north‘s', 'Kim']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62980306  0.22151852

Baffled and afraid, the asylum seeker residing in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, went to Jeonbuk Police Agency for the interview without knowing why he was being questioned. “Police asked me why I came to Korea, why I applied for refugee status here and what my profession was back in my country,” the Bangladeshi man told The Korea Herald. “They even complained about their doubled workload due to the terrorist attack in Paris.”“I felt that they saw me as a potential terrorist,” said the man, who traveled to Korea on a legitimate E-9 visa and claimed refugee status for political reasons in March last year. He is now awaiting the result of the application from the lowest court. A police official from Jeonbuk Police Agency said the interrogation was merely to screen “fraudulent” asylum seekers who they suspected of filing for refugee status only to extend their stay here. The number of asylum seekers being question has increased, the police said, in tandem with the surge in the number of asylum applications in recent months. In 2015, 5,711 foreign nationals applied for asylum in Korea, nearly twice the number of 2014. Among them, 105 were granted refugee status, putting the nation’s refugee acceptance rate at 3.77 percent. An Ethiopian asylum seeker also said that he was stopped and asked questions by police on the street shortly after the terrorist attack in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. “I was at the time wearing a Muslim scarf. Police asked me what my religion was and told me I looked like a terrorist.”“There have been some dubious cases in recent months. Police burst into prayer rooms and asked questions. They stepped up monitoring on unregistered migrant workers,” said Shekh al-Mamun, a Bangladeshi official at the nation’s first migrant workers’ union. “So far, we could accuse the police of unlawfully cracking down on us without warrants, but the antiterrorism bill could make the practice justifiable and reinforce discrimination against Muslims.” According to government data, the number of foreign Muslims residing in Korea stands at around 100,000.The cases came amid heightened security risks and worries following North Korea’s recent nuclear test and arrests of foreign nationals suspected to be terrorist sympathizers. In December, the National Intelligence Service announced a series of deportations and arrests of foreign terrorist suspects. The spy agency said it had arrested or deported 48 foreigners in Korea suspected of being linked to international terrorist groups or viewed as security risks since 2010. An Indonesian man, who entered Korea on a fake passport in 2007, was brought to the court on suspicion of supporting a terror organization the Nusra Front, after he posted a video clip of himself waving the group’s flag atop a local mountain on social media. In light of widening terrorism threats worldwide, the government and the ruling Saenuri Party are pushing for the passage of the long-held antiterrorism bill to enable monitoring of private communications and collect information about terrorist suspects. The bill is being stalled at the National Assembly by the opposition parties, while a recent poll by Realmeter suggests that 64.8 percent of Koreans back the new security bill. But human rights activists and critics say the bill could make it easier for police to “legally” crack down on migrant workers based on their religion and race, linking Muslims to potential terrorists.  Activists hold up placards Tuesday to oppose the passage of the antiterrorism bill in front of the National Assembly building in Seoul. “Police are already abusing their authority by calling in asylum seekers without a warrant and established criminal suspicions,” said human rights lawyer Hwang Pill-kyu.Kim Hyung-jin, head of the Gimhae Korean Migrants’ Human Rights Center, pointed out that migrant workers and asylum seekers, who cannot speak Korean, can become vulnerable.“I don’t think that the new security bill is entirely intended to combat terrorist threats,” he said. “The government is using foreigners, who cannot speak up, to achieve their own political goals.”By Ock Hyun-ju","antiterrorism bill last month ,muslims activists fear passage ,police asking him without ,afraid the asylum seeker ,of antiterrorism bill last","['Muslim', 'Bangladesh', 'Jeonju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Jeonbuk Police Agency', 'Korea']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62479669  0.51640308

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said that the free high-speed Wi-Fi will be accessible in all public places, including public institutions, parks, plazas and roads. So far, the free Wi-Fi has been limited to public transportation, such as subway lines and buses. This is part of the city’s five-year initiative to transform the capital into a “digital city.”  “This year will be the crucial time for the city to be become a global digital city. And the new initiative will serve as the blueprint. The city will put in efforts to solve various city problems by carrying out citizen-driven digital measures and boosting the new digital industry, thereby making Seoul the world’s digital capital by 2020,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in a press conference Tuesday.  Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon speaks at a press conference Tuesday. Along with the free high-speed Wi-Fi service, the city will allow drivers to check vacancies in 550 of the 1,500 city parking lots, in real time via a smartphone app from 2020. This aims to improve the parking situation in the city, officials said.  The existing parking app only offers information about the location, opening hours and parking fees.  As part of its efforts to boost the financial technology industry, Seoul City will cultivate 30 start-ups by 2020 and support the training of some 330,000 human resources in “G-Valley,” a digital industry cluster set to open in Gaepo, Gangnam-gu in September this year.  G-Valley will foster 1,240 digital experts through an Internet of Things academy, Hackathon and various conferences. The city will also expand Internet of Things -- Internet-connected everyday devices -- projects to 100 regions by 2010, making the city a “living lab,” the authorities said.Last year, the city government initiated an Internet of Things trial project in Bukchon, Jongno, where Internet of Things technology is utilized to support daily life, such as curbing illegal parking problems with automatic alerts and reporting when public trash cans are full.  To better share the city’s “digital experiences” and know-how, Seoul City will also host the Seoul Digital Summit every year with global digital companies, officials added.The city will inject about 460 billion won  into the five-year digital plan, officials said. By Lee Hyun-jeong","construct free wi fi ,free wi fi internet ,all public places seoul ,the free wi fi ,seoul city will construct","['Seoul City', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6206857   0.3304171

This is the first time for the district court to exclusively operate benches for child abuse crimes.All municipal police stations will also start having forces dedicated to tackling child abuse cases nationwide this year in light of several high-profile murder cases involving children with parents being the offenders.Police said Sunday 350 such forces will be assigned to the job this month and the number will be increased to around 1,000 next year.This year alone, three children were found to have been beaten to death by one or both of their parents, who also hid their bodies. The government has since been fortifying searches for students that have been reported absent for a long period of time.Municipal governments have also been joining the campaign against child abuse.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Sunday it will start providing parental education against child abuse. Parents that have completed the course will be given priority to send their children to public childcare centers. State-supervised child care centers are popular but short in supply with the waiting list usually extending to hundreds of people. “While priority will still be given to single-parent or dual-income households, those that have the same overall qualifications will be able to benefit from the new system,” the city said, saying they hoped this would push more parents to attend the classes.The number of reported child abuse cases has been rising. In Seoul, 720 cases were reported in 2012 and this increased to 815 in 2013, 954 in 2014 and 532 in just the first half of 2015.Most of the offenders are parents. According to the Welfare Ministry, 45.2 percent of all reported child abuse cases in 2014 were committed by biological fathers and 32.0 percent by biological mothers.Laws on punishing child abuse crimes have been revised over the past year to obligate teachers, public servants dealing with child care and welfare policies, medical staff and employees at child care facilities to report any suspicious case of child abuse. Failure to make a report will mean they can be fined up to 5 million won. However, so far no such penalties have been meted out yet.","sunday that three criminal ,crimes all municipal police ,child abuse cases nationwide ,several high profile murder ,three criminal departments will",['the Seoul Central District Court'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85656625  0.85738462

Earlier in the day, Jongno Police Station seized documents and data from a telecommunications company working with the Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union, the nation’s biggest progressive teachers union that was recently outlawed by the high court.The raid came after some 100 unionized members left a series of posts on Cheong Wa Dae’s website condemning President Park Geun-hye’s push to reinstate state-authored textbooks and urging the government to salvage the Sewol ferry that sank in 2014, leaving 304 dead or missing, many of whom were students on a school trip. Officials from the Korea Teachers and Education Workers’ Union on Thursday hold a press conference at its headquarters to protest against the police investigation. The police said the teachers are suspected of violating relevant laws because public workers are banned from publicly expressing political opinions. According to the State Public Official Act, government officials are also prohibited from collective actions such as a labor movement. The authorities also plan to investigate a case where the Ministry of Education and conservative civic groups filed lawsuits against the teachers union. They asserted that the public workers violated the law by issuing an antigovernment statement and staging sit-ins in public space.Some 20,000 unionized teachers issued a public statement last November, comparing President Park’s decision to adopt state textbooks to a “coup” against the nation’s modern history. A total of 84 key organizers and participants were charged by the Education Ministry.Since being outlawed by the Seoul High Court for a violation of labor laws last month, the beleaguered organization has undergone similar investigations they claim are politically motivated. The police seized the group’s Internet server and record in July 2014 amid allegations that the teachers had violated the law by expressing political opinions.  By Yeo Jun-suk","police on thursday raided ,thursday raided the office ,police raid teachers union ,police station seized documents ,web hosting company police","['Seoul', 'Jongno Police Station', 'the Korea Teachers and Education Workers ’ Union']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72262102  0.4855009

Last week, South Korea suspended the operation of the industrial complex in Gaeseong, just 50 kilometers north of Seoul, mostly in response to the North's recent nuclear test followed by the a satellite launch that many believe was a disguise for a long-range missile test.Two days after Seoul announced its decision to at least temporarily shut down the industrial complex, Pyongyang expelled all the firms from the park and froze their assets there on Thursday, not allowing them to bring back any processed goods or equipment to Seoul.   The complete shutdown of the Gaeseong Industrial Complex is unprecedented as South Korea had previously maintained operations, even through periods of heightened strains.This time, Seoul's decision to shut down the factory park was largely based on the notion that the North was using a large part of the wages paid to North Korean workers to upgrade its long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.The South Korean firms, stung by the abrupt decision, are calling on their government to provide full-scale support.""We strongly urge the government to compensate us for the damage that will be inflicted,"" the association of the 124 South Korean businesses operating in the factory park said last week in a statement. ""We are making it clear that the government should shoulder all the damage for us.""In a meeting with lawmakers, Chung Ki-sup, who leads the business association, also has said the closure is tantamount to a death sentence for the Gaeseong-based firms.""Without prior consultations and notices, the closure  is causing great damage to us,"" he said.Some estimate that the South Korean firms operating there may shoulder massive losses following the factory shutdown.   When the industrial park was closed for 160 days in 2013 in North Korea's protest against a joint military exercise between South Korean and U.S. forces here, the South Korean firms reported a combined loss of 1.05 trillion won .The firms claim their damage will only be greater this time considering the sheer growth of their business operations over the years.The Seoul government promised all-out support for the Gaeseong-based firms with measures including an extension of maturity on outstanding loans, as well as emergency relief funds to both companies and their South Korean employees.But government measures alone will not be enough to make up for the heavy losses they are expected to face.Seoul's chief economic policymaker urged the entire business circle to help the Gaeseong-based firms. ""Now is the time for all members of the business circle to exercise their spirit of friendship and mutual help so the Gaeseong firms can stand on their own feet again at the earliest date possible,"" Yoo Il-ho said last week in a hastily arranged meeting to draw up support measures for the firms.The joint industrial park in Gaeseong, just north of the inter-Korean border in the communist North, opened in 2004 under an agreement reached at the first-ever inter-Korean summit between then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang in 2000.With some 54,000 North Korean workers on payroll before the shutdown, the once symbol of reconciliation between the divided Koreas has often been considered a cash cow for the impoverished North.The Seoul government had provided a set of incentives to companies operating there, including providing insurance to cover potential losses in their investment, which means it is obliged to give the firms payouts.","but seoul recent shutdown ,seoul recent shutdown ,seoul recent shutdown of ,bracing for massive losses ,korean firms in fix","['south korean', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51829278  0.81442589

People in vibrant tracksuits throw curious glances at him. He strolls past and opens a door to his left -- where his crew awaits. When he greets them, they immediately stop and bow -- he is their boss.This is not a scene from a gangster flick. They belong to a financial company in Seoul, and they gather every weekend for a month each year to learn to dance, all in the name of team spirit. More Koreans have begun to learn entertainment skills such as singing, dancing, and even making jokes, to use them as part of social skills at workplaces, according to industry sources.A 26-year-old consulting agent, surnamed Kim, has recently been recruited at a top-tier firm. He was asked to perform at the firm’s end-of-year gathering, alongside his colleagues. The firm’s annual “talent show” offers 1 million won  to the best-performing team, and covers the preparation costs for each one. Beneath the fun, therefore, was a note of competition. “It’s one of those things that are considered unofficially mandatory,” said Kim, saying he even considered taking vocal classes to prepare.“It can be fun to spend time with colleagues, but also very grueling. It’s difficult to devote so much personal time for a company event.” Employees from a South Korean company perform a dance routine at the firm’s year-end party. These “talent shows” held during corporate workshops have existed for decades. Many resent the time-consuming celebration, but the tradition remains deeply embedded within corporate culture. According to a survey conducted by a local employment search engine Mediatong, the top reason behind company workshop stress is when “superiors propose to make toasts or dance and sing” cited by the majority 47.6 percent. Shunning such pressure and remaining a bystander is not an easy option, as acquiring the “appropriate finesse” in areas of entertainment and humor has often gained an equal power to being simply good at work.“I often come across cases where a colleague would get brownie points from the boss for their ability to entertain and mingle,” said Chae Song-hwa, a 38-year-old manager at a company in Seoul.“But I don’t necessary feel that it is unfair as social skills are also part of one’s capacity. While work accomplishments are easier to evaluate as they come in figures, social skills definitely help in deeming their overall aptitude,” she said.But this extra yardstick, which in most cases is subjective, is definitely a source of stress, as shown in the survey by Career, an employment portal, last month. Of the 448 respondents, 90.2 percent said they have suffered from extreme anger at work. Majority of them, or 63.8 percent, said it came from maintaining relations with the boss or colleagues. Another portal Job Korea’s similar report showed that of the 604 surveyed workers in Korea, 48.7 percent viewed the Korean work culture negatively, due mainly to an atmosphere where working overtime is considered the norm , and “groupism,” where they are forced to do “everything together” .Private institutes have taken note of this culture and are capitalizing on it, expanding their courses to cover these new “business” skills. One dance studio in Gangnam that specializes in training would-be K-pop stars has an entire page on its website dedicated to office workers who want to learn how to groove. The page is a mural of pictures of different teams from Korea’s most prestigious companies, singing and dancing together. The detailed descriptions below weave tales of comradeship between a superior and his team. The photos are of at least 30 different teams from various companies, with comments below explaining all had come for the single purpose of outshining others in company events. The dance course offers personal training for monthly fee of approximately 150,000 won; the fee for vocal training runs higher.Speech academies have also established separate humor communication classes to keep-up with demands. A speech academy in Jongno, central Seoul, has courses to help its students build confidence by teaching them how to use “humor” in business conversations. The academy’s faculties are all former TV news anchorwomen or hold degrees related to recreation. A faculty member at the academy explained, “I believe people are interested in learning how to talk with humor, regardless of age to improve their workplace performance.”“The key to using humor in conversations is ‘confidence’ and that takes time and professional help to build -- that is why we’re here for them” she added. Another academy in Mapo, specializing in humor communications, even teaches its students how to make effective toasts. The head of the academy expressed his passion for humor. “Humor lights us up even in the darkest times,” he said. “We teach our students how to use acrostic poems in their speech during corporate gatherings.” Both speech academies accept average number of 15 to 20 students per class -- there are more attending regular business communication courses, where it also recognizes “humor communication” as a vital ingredient to their agenda. According to a faculty member, the average time students stay in class is three months. Several extend their stay.By Jung Min-kyung, Intern reporter","gangster flick they belong ,financial company in seoul ,they gather every weekend ,man enters hall full ,gangster flick they",['Seoul'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.01362062  0.65913707

In particular, all lumber imports will be required to be sterilized as soon as they arrive in Korea, to prevent foreign mosquito larvae in trees from entering the country, they said. Also, all medical facilities will be required to report to the authorities should they receive patients suspected of having Zika infection. All clinical specimans from patients suspected to have Zika must be submitted to the National Research Institute of Health for diagnosis. A special guideline will be published for doctors to help them deal with pregnant patients who have been infected with the virus.A total of seven Koreans asked to be tested for possible Zika virus infection as of Wednesday. All their test results turned out negative. The Health Ministry also announced that the presence of Aedes albopictus, better known as the tiger mosquito, an important carrier of the Zika virus, is minimal. From 2013 to 2015, a total of 910 of them -- an annual average of 303.5 mosquitoes -- were reported, accounting for 1.8 percent of all mosquitos in the country. However, the number of tiger mosquitoes have increased significantly from 71.5 mosquitoes in 2013 to 482.7 mosquitoes in 2015. Lee Wook-gyo from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cause of this increase is not known. “We currently have surveillance centers in 10 provinces nationwide,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “In 2010, when we first established such centers for mosquito control, only three provinces had such agencies. In 2013, centers were established in six provinces, and 10 provinces in 2015. We need to accumulate more data in the next five years or so, to find out why the number of this specific mosquito is increasing.” The World Health Organization on Monday issued a worldwide warning that the Zika virus -- transmitted through an infected mosquito -- is a global public health emergency that requires a unified response. The organization claimed the infection has been linked to cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. The new chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Jung Ki-suck talks with Jeong Eun-kyung, head of the emergency team during a government meeting on Zika virus spread in Seoul on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a case of Zika virus infection transmitted by sex -- not by a mosquito's bite -- was reported in Texas, U.S., on Tuesday. The South Korean government said it currently has no detailed plans to tackle the sexual transmission of the virus.The WHO has cautioned governments about the possibility of sexual transmission of the virus, although this form of transmission has not been confirmed yet, according to the KCDC.“All we can say for now is to avoid having sex with someone who has recently returned from the affected countries,” Hwang Young-soon from the KCDC told The Korea Herald. “Travelers who have returned from the affected regions should use protection for at least 30 days.”By Claire Lee","korean government on wednesday ,research all mosquito species ,on tuesday including plan ,government on wednesday released ,to research all mosquito","['south korean', 'Zika', 'korean']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30230343  0.39182043

She even advocated a national petition campaign urging for passage of the bills. The Minjoo Party said that it had tried to send the flowers to Cheong Wa Dae at around 9 a.m., but received a call some 50 minutes later from the presidential office informing them that she would “respectfully decline.” Two more attempts to send the orchids also failed. “Politics aside, we felt it was only fair to show manners. We felt the need to show  that we the opposition are willing to cooperate in talks and state affairs, and also to show a small but heartfelt gesture for the people of Korea ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays,” said party spokesman Kim Sung-soo. “It is regretful that such a gesture was rejected, in a somewhat ridiculous way.”Later in the day, ruling Saenuri Party launched attacks against the man once credited for leading the economic democratization campaign for Park in the 2012 presidential election.

The North last conducted a rocket launch from there in 2012, successfully putting a satellite into orbit aboard the Unha-3 rocket.""North Korea might launch another Unha-3 or a similarly sized rocket, but there is a more interesting possibility,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert and director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. ""North Korea has increased the height of the original gantry at Sohae and displayed models of something much larger called the Unha-9 in strange places like flower exhibitions and Moranbong Band concerts,"" he said in an article at the Arms Control Wonk blog.Lewis also noted a now Treasury Department-confirmed report that North Korea and Iran have been cooperating on the development of a new 80-ton rocket booster, raising the possibility of the Unha-9 rocket using the booster as its first stage.While announcing fresh sanctions on Iran last month, the Treasury confirmed that Tehran and Pyongyang have cooperated to develop a 80-ton rocket booster, with Iranian missile technicians visiting the North for the project in the past several years.The expert also noted a Iranian news agency report that Iran would launch a Simorgh rocket during the festivities to mark Iran's revolution, which should run from today through Feb. 11. He said Iran's Simorgh has some obvious similarities to the North's Unha rocket.Gordon Chang, an East Asia security expert, also raised the possibility that Iranians could attend the North's upcoming launch as they have founded the development of the new rocket booster. He also voiced concern that the North's new rocket could end up in Iran.""All signs point to a long-range missile launcher test in the coming days and not only could this one possibly reach the United States, but it will also likely end up in Tehran's hands,"" he said in an article to the online news outlet Daily Beast.Gordon also said the North could conduct its first test of the KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile.He cited Joseph DeTrani, a former U.S. intelligence official and negotiator with North Korea, as saying that the communist nation is ""close to launching a long-range, solid-fuel, mobile missile capable of reaching the United States.""""There is only one missile in Pyongyang's inventory that could possibly fit that description: the fearsome KN-08,"" Gordon said.U.S. military officials have expressed serious concern about KN-08, saying it is harder to keep an eye on as it can be launched from mobile platforms.In April last year, Adm. William Gortney, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, said the North is believed to be capable of miniaturizing nuclear warheads to put on the KN-08 missile and fire it at the U.S. mainland.","korea could test rocket ,next long range rocket ,range rocket launch feared ,could test rocket booster ,rocket launch feared to","['North Korea', 'Iran', 'kn-08', 'U.S.', ""the North 's Sohae"", 'Dongchang - ri']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.97794265  0.52774382

171,171,171,Not safe to let traditional doctors use modern medical tech: WMA,"Otmar Kloiber, the secretary general of the World Medical Association, claimed the South Korean government is exposing its patients to danger should it allow traditional doctors to use modern medical equipment and devices, during his visit to Seoul on Monday.  “We are very much concerned that your government wants to do a business approach to health care by supporting the producers of medical equipment so they can ...","Otmar Kloiber, the secretary general of the World Medical Association, claimed the South Korean government is exposing its patients to danger should it allow traditional doctors to use modern medical equipment and devices, during his visit to Seoul on Monday.  “We are very much concerned that your government wants to do a business approach to health care by supporting the producers of medical equipment so they can be able to sell it to OMDs ,” he told reporters during a press meeting held at the Korea Medical Association building. “That means quite obviously your government is willing to trade the questionable economic benefits against the safety of Korean patients.”Kloiber’s visit to Korea took place about two weeks after the Association of Korean Medicine, the largest body of traditional doctors here, announced that they would file a lawsuit against the Health Ministry if the government does not guarantee their right to use nontraditional medical equipment, such as ultrasound, by the end of January. Otmar Kloiber, the secretary general of the World Medical Association, speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Monday. As the government did not respond to the doctors’ request, the AKM plans to file a suit in the next two weeks.During the press conference, Kloiber stressed it takes rigorous training in modern, science-based medicine to make the right diagnosis using medical equipment. The AKM has been claiming that 70 percent of the traditional medical school curriculum is equivalent to that taught at nontraditional medical schools nationwide in Korea, and that they are qualified to diagnose patients using modern technologies.“You say it’s 70 percent. Maybe the curriculum has the 70 percent,” Kloiber said when one of the reporters asked about his thoughts on the SKM’s stance.“But if you want to use the tools of the modern medicine, it should be no less than 100 percent. And by the way, it is only 70 percent of the basic medical education. As I told you before, doctors have six years of basic medical education, plus another six years of additional education. And that’s not by accident. It’s not to torture them. That is because it is necessary.”As a part of its deregulation agenda, the Office of Government Policy Coordination and the Health Ministry together announced in January last year that they were considering a law that lets traditional doctors use nontraditional medical devices without having to worry about being sued by regular physicians. The ministry had promised to come up with the system by the end of 2015, but it failed to materialize, as there was fierce opposition from the Korean Medical Association, which represents 100,000 mainstream physicians.“It is extremely worrying that the regulatory authorities in this country do not act against ,” Kloiber said. “Again, this gives me an impression that your government is not that much interested in the safety of the patients in this country. Obviously their economic interests are prevailing.”Following the press conference, the AKM told The Korea Herald that it would send the World Medical Association a letter containing a set of questions. “What Kloiber said during the conference is nothing new. We’ve heard the same arguments from the nontraditional doctors many times in the past,” said Kim Ji-ho from the AKM. “In South Korea, we  are recognized as doctors by the law. The letter will explain how we are acknowledged by the legislation, and how our education curriculum is similar to those taught at nontraditional medical schools. We would like to hear about their thoughts after reading those materials carefully.”Kloiber, on the other hand, seemed to be firm on his stance. “I can simply say if you  believe you can do the same in the diagnosis and therapy, just take the modern medicine exam,” he said. “Get the right license.”According to the latest government data, Koreans’ medical bills related to traditional medical treatment increased from 2010-2014. Overall expenditure on traditional medical treatments, such as acupuncture, was 2.4 trillion won  in 2014. The spending has increased significantly since 2010, with an average annual growth rate of 7.7 percent per year according to the state-run Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.One of the biggest factors behind this growth is the country’s growing elderly population, many of whom prefer traditional treatments over Western medicine, according to the government. Traditional medicine is especially popular here for conditions including dementia, infertility, spinal stenosis, failed back surgery syndrome and chronic pain. In order to boost the traditional medicine industry, the Health Ministry last month announced its plans to standardize traditional herbal medicine and invest in clinical research projects to come up with possible collaborations between modern and traditional medical professionals. There have been a number of cases where the condition of those who suffered spinal cord injuries improved significantly after receiving both modern and Korean traditional treatments at the National Rehabilitation Center, according to the Health Ministry.

The Korean office of Amnesty International will hold a hologram rally, which it has called a “ghost rally,” in Gwanghwamun Square on Feb. 24, a day before the third anniversary of President Park Geun-hye’s inauguration in 2013. “Police have prohibited public assemblies or marches near the presidential office since the Sewol ferry tragedy in 2014,” said a statement from the Korean office of Amnesty International. “Police are quelling the freedom of assembly and demonstrations by unconditionally using water cannons mixed with tear gas on protestors and punishing the protest organizers.”The hologram rally does not feature real-life demonstrators, but uses a projector to show ghost-like figures marching, chanting and holding placards in a hologram video. The participants were asked in advance to send in their own photos, text messages and recordings of slogans in their own voices through messaging app KakaoTalk, which will be synchronized with the holograms on the big screen. The nation’s first hologram rally comes after police refused to grant a permit for the Korean office of Amnesty International to stage a rally calling for greater freedom of speech on Feb. 24 in front of the Cheongwoon Community Center near the presidential office. A promotional poster issued by the Korean office of Amnesty International to encourage Koreans to participate in an upcoming hologram rally to be held on Feb. 24 at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul.The human rights group, instead, received a permit to use Gwanghwamun Square from the Seoul Metropolitan Government. A police official told The Korea Herald that the rejection was a result of serious concerns over traffic disruption. “Amnesty International applied for a permit to occupy two lanes on the road near the presidential office, but the road is classified as one of the main roads in Seoul,” the official said. “We issued the ban according to the Assembly and Demonstration Act, as the rally is expected to cause serious traffic disruption.” Cheong Wa Dae was not at all a factor in prohibiting the Amnesty-led rally, the official said. ”Around Cheong Wa Dae is a residential area. We rejected the applications for the rallies expected to disturb the neighborhood and the traffic, not because they were planned near Cheong Wa Dae.""Police data shows that authorities have banned most of the planned rallies or attempted marches near Cheong Wa Dae, citing possible disturbance to the neighborhood and traffic disruption as major reasons. According to data obtained by Rep. Jin Sun-mi of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea from the National Police Agency, 98 percent of the rallies prohibited from taking place in Seoul from January to July in 2014 were proposed to be held near Cheong Wa Dae -- in an area loosely stretching from Gyeongbokgung Palace through Gwanghwamun Square and across from Anguk Station. A promotional poster issued by the Korean office of Amnesty International to encourage Koreans to participate in an upcoming hologram rally to be held on Feb. 24 at Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul.South Korea has faced mounting concerns over freedom of expression, with human rights activists blaming the Park administration for abusing its authority to forbid and clamp down on antigovernment demonstrations.  In South Korea, rally organizers should apply for a permit to the police 48 hours prior to the rally in accordance with the Assembly and Demonstration Act. All assemblies are supposed to be allowed upon declaration unless they pose a serious threat to public security, disrupt traffic or disturb residents’ private lives. According to the National Police Agency, 281 assemblies and demonstrations were not allowed to be held in 2014. The United Nations Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai on the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association ALSO criticized restrictions on freedom of speech during his recent visit to Korea on Jan. 21-29.  The world’s first political protest by hologram took place in Madrid, Spain last April against the newly enforced “gag law."" The law allows protests only with a government-issued permit and imposes penalties on protests held in front of public places, including the congressional building.

Previously soldiers in military barracks were only allowed to use public telephones established at booths in the military camp when they made phone calls to their parents or friends. Otherwise, they had to borrow cell phones from the post exchanges.The new system was adopted after a test-run of the phone service in frontline units first before expanding it to other barracks nationwide.

A team of about 10 to 20 students spend the night across the street from the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, taking turns watching over the statue.“It is really cold to spend the night here. We use sleeping bags and put several disposable heat packs inside,” said a 27-year-old student, who asked to be identified only by his surname Lee. He spent a total of three nights next to the statue in the past month. “At first, we couldn’t sleep and stayed up all night. But we gradually adapted to the situation and now are good at it.” Demonstrators against the Dec. 28 deal between Seoul and Tokyo try to stay warm and take cover while holding a sit-in protest next to the “comfort woman” statue. YonhapThe sit-in comes as Japan has pressured South Korea to remove the statue as part of the Dec. 28 settlement over the “comfort women” issue, or Japan’s sexual enslavement of Korean women. The Seoul government has insisted the relocation of the comfort women statue was beyond their authority, as it was built by civic groups. In the diplomatic deal defined as “final and irreversible” by both countries, Japan agreed to provide 1 billion yen  to a Korean-run foundation for the 46 surviving victims. In return, Seoul promised not to raise the issue again in international forums and consult with civic groups to relocate the statue if Tokyo fulfills its commitments. The statue has since become a rallying point for the victims and their supporters who have refused to accept the deal, prompting the students to hold a sit-in to protect it from being taken down. Undeterred by the subzero temperatures, the students who spent the night on the pavement exchanged jokes and laughter, with some of them heading to a nearby restaurant to grab breakfast.Bundling himself up in thick jacket, Lee asked his friends to join him on the electronic heating pad. “Come join me under the blankets!” he called out.According to the students, at least 30 to 40 people come and offer such things as energy drinks, warm food, heat packs and blankets every day to display their support. The opposition lawmakers including Seoul Mayor Park Won-son and The Minjoo Party of Korea's floor leader Lee Jong-Kul also visited the site.""The lawmakers come and take pictures with us, asking us whether we need anything,"" Lee said. ""But what we really need is not food or tents. We want the politicians to pass a bill invalidating the deal.” “I hope that adults know that we are risking our lives and take action, rather than just say ‘sorry’ to us.” Lee Yang-sun, a 21-year-old student at Choongang University, traveled for hours from Ulsan to join the sit-in during the day. “My parents would not be happy with me being here in the cold. I didn’t tell them I was coming here,” Lee said. “But I came because I would forever feel ashamed if I did nothing to properly solve the issue.”“The tarnished honor and human rights of the grandmothers cannot be restored by money,” she said. “I am angrier at my government . Shouldn’t the government take the side of the victims?”The students plan to continue the sit-in for now and hold a large-scale demonstration at Seoul Plaza on Saturday, expecting to draw about 1,000 citizens and students. Kim Seong-soo, 40-something man who was walking past the statue, stopped at the scene to pay respect to the statue and signed a petition calling for the deal’s annulment. “What can one say other than ‘sorry?’ Our generation should have solved the issue, but we are passing the burden onto the next generation. I feel bad.” The students’ sit-in has attracted more attention in recent weeks as police barred them from setting up tents near the statue, citing the Road Traffic Act. The law prohibits putting items on the sidewalk without a permit from the government. Six of the students have been brought in for questioning by police on charges of violating the Public Assembly Act, as they held a sit-in in front of a foreign embassy, used a microphone and collectively chanted slogans. The victims have denounced the “comfort women” settlement as a political collusion between Seoul and Tokyo, vowing not to take the money from the Japanese government unless it admits to its state-led war crimes and offers legal compensation. Their advocacy groups have instead set up their own foundation called “Justice and Memory” to collect donations. Criticism against the settlement mounted Tuesday as a Japanese media outlet reported that Japan’s ruling party lawmakers wrote a resolution to urge the Korean government to take down the statue as soon as possible. According to a survey of 1,000 Japanese by Sankei Shimbum, 64 percent of them believed that the removal of the statue was a precondition for Japan to pay 1 billion yen into the fund.  In response, the Foreign Ministry renewed its stance in a news briefing that the government cannot decide on the relocation of the statue. It said it will continue to visit victims to consult them. The weekly rally against the deal continued Wednesday as an estimated 1,000 people flocked to the narrow street across from the Japanese Embassy to participate in the 1,215th demonstration led by the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery.Lee Yong-soo, an 88-year-old former comfort woman, slammed President Park Geun-hye for ignoring the victims’ voices. Sex slavery victim Lee Yong-su embraces the hand of a student participating in a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Wednesday. Yonhap“Many young people were sacrificed to make Korea what it is now. But what is President Park Geun-hye doing now?” Lee posed. “She is like a vicious stepmother, no? She is selling us out to Japan. She should be kicked out of Korea.” Meanwhile, two other victims are currently on a visit to Japan to offer their testimonies about past experiences as sex slaves. “Imagine serving 40 to 50 men a day. One would rather wish to die. It is not a comfort station. It is a place of execution,” former comfort woman Lee Ok-seon, 90, told some 200 Japanese spectators at the parliament in Tokyo on Tuesday.“If we voluntarily went to Japan to earn money, why would we now demand an apology and compensation like this? Think about it,” urged Lee, who was dragged to China as a teenage girl. “We are furious. They attempt to give us some money to shut our mouth. It can never happen."" ""Choose whether to remove us, or the comfort women statute. Why would you get rid of it?""By Ock Hyun-ju","woman statue on wednesday ,morning about 10 students ,statue on wednesday morning ,of 16 university councils ,20 students spend the",['Japan'],2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4014245   0.17921743

The four “vaccines” refer to keeping a real-time surveillance over state projects, managing risks preemptively for asset management agencies, sharing information on a continuous basis for the sake of transparency, and introducing a clean internal control system.The government is also establishing a special investigation department on corruption crimes at the prosecutor’s office, in an effort to add momentum to a forthcoming antisolicitation bill that is to take effect in September.“According to the World Bank’s survey, South Korea was ranked 27th in law and order last year, which was one of the lowest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members,” Park said.“Some studies have shown that our nation’s economic growth could inch up by about 1 percent, if only the level of our social integrity would border on the OECD average,” she said.The Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission of Korea, in its briefing, vowed to reduce the leakage of public finances by intensifying punishment for corrupt financial acts.“We will work on legislating a bill to prevent false claims of public finances, aimed at eradicating chronic practices of public financial abuse,” said ACRC chairman Sung Yung-hoon.Upon this new bill, those who have caused financial losses to public funds will have to pay up to five times the amount in punitive damages.During the meeting, Park also urged government officials to eradicate domestic violence, citing a recent series of child abuse cases. President Park Geun-hye speaks during the last policy briefing on this year’s government plans at Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday. YonhapEarlier this month, a father was arrested for letting his 7-year-old son die in 2012, cutting his body into parts and keeping them in a refrigerator until recently.Responding to the president’s calls to tighten the legal order, the Ministry of Justice said that it will expand the range and level of notification when it comes to child abuse crimes.“We will revise the related law so that those working in sex crime victims support centers and adoption agencies will be obligated to report to the police upon detecting suspected cases of abuse,” said Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong.The ministry is also planning to additionally allocate 111 officers to all 58 prosecutors’ offices nationwide to exclusively take care of child abuse crimes.The Education Ministry and the Welfare Ministry will increase their involvement by checking through long-term absentees in elementary schools and report to the police when necessary.According to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security, the number of child deaths caused by accidents was 2.9 per 100,000 in year 2014. It is the government’s target to bring down the figure to the 1.9-2 level.By Bae Hyun-jung","tuesday renewed her pledge ,child abuse president park ,hye on tuesday renewed ,eradicate corruption especially with ,tuesday renewed her","['Park Geun - hye', 'the Justice Ministry']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26308727  0.48599133

Also on Sunday, the KMA issued a cold wave warning to all regions in Gyeonggi Province as well as Seoul, for the first time in six years. The eastern island of Uleungdo is covered with snow on Sunday. The cold wave warning is issued if the temperature remains below minus 15 degrees for two or more days. Meanwhile, all flights at the Jejudo airport were canceled due to the biggest snowfall in 32 years and high winds. The airport on the resort island announced on Sunday morning that all flights will be canceled until 8 p.m. Monday. A total of 517 flights were scheduled for Sunday alone. On Saturday, 296 flights had been canceled while 122 had been delayed due to the weather conditions. Flights are suspended at the Jeju International Airport on Sunday due to heavy snow. Jejudo recorded its biggest snowfall in three decades at 11 centimeters as of Sunday, with more than 1 meter of snow in mountain areas. On Saturday night, The Korea Herald witnessed a number of road signs being blown down by strong winds accompanied by heavy snow. Some hotels had blackouts on Saturday night.  “It usually takes about 20 minutes to get home from my hotel,” said Oh Seung-ju, a 29-year-old Jejudo resident working at a hotel, who decided to stay back at work on Saturday due to the snowstorm. “My family members told me to stay at the hotel last night, as it’s not safe to drive in such weather. I slept in one of the suites .”Moon Young-gi, another Jejudo resident and a tourist bus driver, said it took him five hours to get to the city center from Seongsan Ilchulbong, the famous UNESCO World Heritage site of the island on Saturday, because of the severe weather conditions. “I don’t think my passengers  can visit any tourist sites today,” he said at a hotel in Jejudo. “I’m thinking of taking them to a Korean dry sauna after lunch.”Meanwhile in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, a large number of accidents were reported due to frozen water gauges and pipes on Sunday.From 5 p.m. on Saturday to 5 a.m. on Sunday alone, a total of 40 accidents were reported to the Seoul Metropolitan Government. From Jan. 20-23, a total of 764 cases were reported to the authorities. In Gyeonggi, 72 accidents were reported on Sunday alone as of 11 a.m.“I can’t shower, I can’t do laundry,” said Kim Yeon-ji, a 33-year-old office worker in Seoul, whose water pipe froze on Saturday. “I had to go to a launderette this morning. I was just told that I have to wait until the weather gets warmer. This is very frustrating.”The KMA also issued one of the three -- heavy-snowfall, cold wave or strong-wind -- warnings to 14 regions in North Jeolla Province, as well as 11 regions in South Chungcheong, including Gimje, Muju, Seocheon and Jeongeup. The Health Ministry announced on Sunday that the number of Koreans who sought medical attention for cold-related illnesses, such as hypothermia and frostbite, increased significantly on Jan. 17-20 from the week before. A total of 55 Koreans were treated for such conditions at 530 medical facilities nationwide from Jan. 17-20, which was more than double the number from Jan. 10-16, which was 24. Among the 55 patients, 72 percent were male, while 27.3 percent were those in their 50s.The health authorities strongly advised young children, those aged 65 older, as well as those who have chronic medical conditions to stay indoors as much as possible and wear long underwear under their clothes, along with socks and slippers even when staying at home. When going outside in the cold, it is important to wear a hat, scarf and gloves to prevent loss of body heat through one’s head and hands, they said.

That was done by civilian pimps at the military's request, he added.South Korea firmly refuted the claims.""The forced nature of the Japanese military's mobilization of the comfort women is an undeniable historical fact and truth under any circumstance,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said during a press briefing.That statement is backed up by various international reports and studies as well as the victims' testimonies, he said.Asked whether the government has any intention to nullify the December agreement, the spokesman only noted the importance of faithfully carrying out its terms.Under the deal, South Korea promised a final resolution of the issue if Japan fulfills its commitments.""It would be good to refrain from an atmosphere or actions and words that undermine the fulfillment of the agreement, and it is important to create an environment in which it can be properly carried out,"" Cho said.Seoul has delivered this position to Tokyo on numerous occasions, he added. Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for the Japanese military during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.","tuesday that korean women ,sex slavery south korea ,apology from japanese prime ,korean women were forced ,japanese prime minister south","['South Korea', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'japanese', 'Shinzo Abe', 'japanese']",2,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3707428   0.3604348
