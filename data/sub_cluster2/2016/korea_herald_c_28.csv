It plans to ask for the German prosecution's cooperation in repatriating her, and will take steps to invalidate her passport.The German prosecutors said it will cooperate with South Korea's investigation if there's a formal request, although they have yet to find the whereabouts of Chung. German investigators also have been looking into alleged money-laundering by Choi's company in Frankfurt.The independent counsel placed Chung on the wanted list, saying any attempts to help her escape will be a criminal offense.Chung's attorney said he will continue to persuade her to cooperate with the investigation.The team, which raided the state pension service Wednesday, said the investigation on the organization is under way.Samsung is under suspicion for receiving the support of the nation's largest institutional investor in exchange for its donations and favors to Park's long-time friend Choi Soon-sil and her daughter.Samsung allegedly donated 20.4 billion won to the two public foundations that may have been controlled by Choi. An opposition lawmaker also claimed that Samsung signed a 22 billion-won  contract with a Germany-based company owned by Choi and financially supported her daughter Chung's purchase of equestrian horses, training and other costs.The counsel, meanwhile, said the team has yet to decide on summoning officials of Samsung Group.The team said it would closely watch a National Assembly hearing, where Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, was being grilled Thursday over accusations that he neglected his duties by allowing Choi to interfere in state affairs.","german prosecutors said thursday ,german prosecutors to cooperate ,independent counsel german prosecutors ,peddling scandal surrounding president ,counsel german prosecutors said","['german', ""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Chung Yoo - ra', 'Choi Soon - sil']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.4364531   0.81291455

Pyongyang later called him “human scum” who embezzled official funds and committed other crimes. Thae, who has been under the protection of the National Intelligence Service, met with South Korean lawmakers on Monday together with NIS officers, according to Lee Cheol-woo, one of the lawmakers. The NIS, South Korea's main spy agency, said it couldn't confirm the meeting. Lee's office cited Thae as denying the North Korean accusations and saying he decided to defect after realizing the North's “horrific” reality. He was quoted as saying he learned about South Korean democracy by watching South Korean dramas and movies. He told lawmakers that North Koreans are suffering “slavery” under Kim's dictatorship and that higher-level officials are subject to more intense state surveillance. Thae, who is to be released into South Korean society on Friday, said he'll try to publicly raise the North's situation, Lee's office said. South Korean media said that Thae will be under a police protection program after his release into society. Thae is the most senior North Korean diplomat to defect to South Korea. In 1997, the North Korean ambassador to Egypt fled but resettled in the United States.  Kim, believed to be in his early 30s, took power upon the death of his dictator father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. He's since orchestrated a series of high-profile executions, purges and dismissals in what outside analysts have said was an attempt to bolster his grip on power. More than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, according to the South Korean government. Many defectors have said they wanted to leave North Korea's harsh political system and poverty.","ex korea diplomat fled ,korea diplomat fled due ,korean lawmakers on monday ,lawmaker ex korea diplomat ,korean defector told south","['north korean', 'south korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Seoul', 'Thae Yong - ho', 'London', 'South Korea']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.45678371  0.72666067

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  poses for photos with his troops.He added that when the leader visited a special forces battalion last Sunday and a civilian-military power generation station Tuesday, there was even a change in the usual protocol.In the photo taken with troops, soldiers were armed with assault rifles, which are generally prohibited in his presence due to security reasons, while the picture taken at the power plant revealed Kim standing at the center of the last row, instead of front and center of the group, which is his usual position.""Kim's interest in group photos seems to be aimed at highlighting that he is firmly in control of the country and to show he is a leader that thinks of his people,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies.Others said that Kim's surprise visit to a garrison on Kali Islet in the Yellow Sea, just 4.5 kilometers northwest of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, last week is an extension of the leader's desire to make a point that he is confident in his control over the country.The islet is located just north of the tense sea demarcation line between the two countries.

Seoul wants the EEZ to be drawn at the halfway point, but Beijing wants other relevant factors including the length of coastlines of each country to be reflected. Director general-level officials are expected to participate in the meeting, the day of which has yet to be confirmed. The two sides discussed the issue last time in Beijing in April following a vice minister-level gathering in December last year. Beijing, however, has not responded to Seoul's proposal to hold a meeting to discuss illegal fishing by Chinese boats in the Yellow Sea. They were supposed to meet in the second half of the year, but it is likely to be delayed until next year.Illegal fishing has been a sensitive diplomatic issue between the two countries in recent months. South Korea has toughened measures against illegal fishing in its waters since one of its patrol boats sank in October while pursuing Chinese vessels.Observers say that the delay might have to do with the ongoing diplomatic row between South Korea and China over the Seoul government's earlier decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile defense system on its soil. Beijing has strongly opposed the move, saying that it could hurt its national security interests.","next week in seoul ,in seoul over dispute ,hold meeting next week ,week in seoul over ,meeting next week in","['South Korea', 'China', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Beijing']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -1.09543717  0.49044228

The Ministry of Education said it will revise 13 factual errors found in the draft versions of the new textbooks for middle and high school students to be introduced next year, announcing the interim results of the opinion gathering which will last until late this month.Last week, the government revealed the pilot editions of the textbooks, about a year after it officially announced the plan to revise the current textbook publication system to address what it called predominantly left-leaning content.The government has been raising the need to forge a common understanding of history in a country where people are divided ideologically, as the two Koreas still remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce. The textbooks are currently published by eight private publishing companies, while primary schools have a single set of national history textbooks. Among a total of 984 opinions registered as of Friday, another 85 are currently under academic review to decide whether they will be reflected in the final version, according to the ministry.

Bilateral sanctions prepared by the US side may be strong enough to hurt North Korea more than the recent UNSC resolution, he also noted. The foreign minister hailed the latest UN action as ""the most powerful and comprehensive sanctions in the history of sanctions on North Korea.""The resolution newly mentioned the possibility of suspending the rights and privileges of UN member states, a new element in the push to isolate North Korea diplomatically, he assessed.

The prosecution has sought to call in Park for questioning to see if bribery should be included among her alleged crimes. It has already named the president as a suspect and accomplice to her old friend Choi Soon-sil and her former Senior Secretary An Chong-bum on a series of corruption allegations. Park, in a reversal of an earlier pledge to fully cooperate with the probe, snubbed the prosecution yet again Monday on its request for an interview.“Based on the situation now, I think it won’t be easy to reach such an important decision . We will do our best, but it will not be easy,” said an official from the prosecution. “We still believe that a face-to-face interview is necessary.”Calling Park’s decision not to comply with the investigation “unfortunate,” he said the investigation by an independent counsel will kick off as soon as the members are appointed by Park. The main suspicions surrounding Park, Choi and An involve allegedly coercing conglomerates to contribute 77.4 billion won  to the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation, two nonprofit organizations suspected to have been used to channel funds to Choi and, ultimately, Park’s inner circle.The prosecution has been trying to prove that the donations made to the two foundations -- along with extra donations by companies such as SK and Lotte, and financial support from Samsung to the Choi family -- had amounted to bribery.Park has denied taking part in any criminal activities. In a public address Tuesday, she said she “never pursued personal benefits” during her 18-year political career.The president said she had pushed ahead with the “series of problems currently occurring,” as it was necessary for the country’s benefit. She was referring to the establishment of the Mir and K-Sports foundations and other allegations related to the Choi scandal. Park declined to answer questions from reporters. Prosecutors also did not comment on Park’s statement, saying it was “not appropriate” for them to do so. Since Park was named a suspect in their investigation last week, Park has changed her stance on the probe, vowing not to cooperate with the prosecution.Nationwide discontent for Park has grown, with 1.9 million people calling for her resignation Saturday across the country. Her approval rating also fell to 4 percent last week, according to Gallop Korea.A survey of 1,011 citizens by Rep. Song Young-gil of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea showed that 59.1 percent of respondents thought the authorities should arrest Park and investigate her.The prosecution has ruled out the possibility of the president’s arrest.Meanwhile, investigators looking into former TV commercial director Cha Eun-taek -- accused of using his relationship with Choi for personal benefit -- found he used Choi’s influence to ensure his associates were appointed to high-ranking government posts.Cha reportedly told the prosecution he recommended Choi Kim Jong-deok and Kim Sang-ryul, as culture minister and senior presidential secretary for education and culture, respectively. Kim Jong-deok taught Cha when he attended Hongik University. Kim Sang-ryul is his uncle.Both were appointed to their positions in 2014, leading to suspicions that Cha’s recommendations were relayed to Park via Choi. Later in the year, Cha’s acquaintance Song Sung-gak was appointed as chief of the Korea Creative Content Agency.Song and Cha were arrested on charges of threatening an advertising agency to hand over its shares of Poreka -- the former in-house ad firm of Posco -- to Cha’s new company. A transcript of Song’s conversation showed that Song told the agency chief the authorities would conduct a tax investigation to “bury him” if he refused to hand over Poreka.Former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon is also accused of hiding Choi’s illegal activities, Kim, however, denied being acquainted with Choi, despite Cha claiming to have met Kim under Choi’s orders.By Yoon Min-sik","president refuses investigation south ,korean prosecutors said tuesday ,as president refuses investigation ,corruption scandal involving her ,president refuses investigation","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Park']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38003808  0.39361933

That means that the council is expected to hold a plenary meeting Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.After the North's fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9, the Security Council immediately vowed to impose fresh sanctions on Pyongyang, but has been unable to do so as the US and China have struggled to narrow differences on how strong new sanctions should be.The main point of contention in the negotiations was the US demand for banning all of North Korea's exports of coal, a key source of hard currency for the communist regime, including exports for ""livelihood purposes,"" which was excluded in the previous sanctions.Closing the loophole was the main US goal in the negotiations, but China has balked at it.The compromise the two sides reached in the upcoming resolution is to put a cap on North Korea's total exports of coal at 750 million tons or US$400.9 million, according to a Reuters report that cited unidentified UN diplomats.The cap would cut the North's annual revenues from coal exports by some $700 million, it said. In addition, the envisioned resolution also tightens screws in the maritime and financial sectors, which could cut the North's revenues by about $100 million a year, according to the report.In total, the resolution could reduce the North's annual revenues by $800 million.""When Resolution 2270 was adopted, we expected it would deal a blow as strong as this, but it wasn't that much effective due to the loopholes,"" a Security Council source said, referring to the resolution that was adopted in March in response to the North's fourth nuclear test.Also making the resolution less effective was the hike in global coal prices due in part to coal mine closures in Australia.The forthcoming resolution also imposes sanctions on 11 North Korean officials and 10 entities, including Pyongyang's ambassadors to Egypt and Myanmar, and bans the North's exports of helicopters, ships and statues, according to the Reuters report.It also requires UN member nations to reduce the number of officials at North Korea's foreign missions and limit the number of bank accounts to one per North Korean diplomatic mission and one per diplomat, according to the report.Should the resolution be adopted this week, it would come more than 80 days after the North's fifth nuclear test. That underlines the difficulty persuading China to agree to strong sanctions on its communist neighbor.China is North Korea's last-remaining major ally, and a key provider of food and fuel supplies. But it has been reluctant to use its influence over Pyongyang for fears that pushing the regime too hard could result in instability in the North and hurt Chinese national interests.Analysts say that China often increased pressure on the North in the past, too, especially when Pyongyang defied international appeals, and carried out nuclear tests and other provocative acts, but China never went as far as to cause real pain to the North.","after months of negotiations ,new sanctions on korea ,was finalized last week ,finalized last week ,finalized last week after","['the UN Security Council', 'North Korea', 'the United States', 'China', 'Britain', 'France']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47507775  0.81367725

Park has not been attending Cabinet meetings for six consecutive weeks after facing the biggest crisis of her political career.The bill still needs to be signed by the president, although observers said she is likely to do so. On Sunday, prosecutors booked Park as an ""accomplice"" in the criminal case surrounding Choi and key former aides. Park's attorney claimed it cannot concede the results, denying all allegations and questioning the fairness and credibility of the probe. The presidential office also hinted that the probe was politically biased.Under the bill, the main opposition Democratic Party and the splinter People's Party will select two candidates for the independent counsel, with Park officially designating one of them to the post.

China strongly opposes the move, expressing worries that it is part of the US missile defense system that would hurt its strategic security interests. Yang said that if Korea goes ahead with its deployment plan, it would end up hurting both the global and the regional ""strategic balance,"" and ""stability,"" adding there will be ""no winners in this game.""He also repeatedly called the THAAD deployment a part of a decadeslong arms race in the region that he said has not contributed at all to regional stability.""South and North Korea both have engaged in an arms race for the past two decades, but do you think that has helped bring in stability?

The Ministry of National Defense has agreed to secure the Lotte Skyhill Country Club in the southeastern rural county of Seongju from the country's fifth-largest conglomerate. The ministry will give state-owned military land near Seoul to Lotte in exchange for the golf course, the ministry said in a statement. It said an appraisal of the value of the two sites will be conducted and once this process is concluded, Lotte International, the operator of the golf club, will hold a board of directors meeting to sign off on the deal.If the results show any considerable gap between the two sites, additional steps will be taken, a ministry official said. ""If the government land in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, is more expensive than the golf course in market value, the ministry plans to provide less land to Lotte. In the opposite case, the defense ministry will offer a cash payment to make up for the deficit,"" Park Jae-min, director-general in charge of the ministry's military installation planning bureau, said in a press briefing.The 1.48 million-square-meter golf site is priced at 45 billion won  according to government real estate estimates, although the real book value is 85 billion won, according to the ministry. The 200,000-square-meter government land could fetch upwards of 140 billion won.The official said because acquiring the site for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  system involves a property swap with no additional expenditures, the deployment will not require parliamentary approval, Park said.""We will make sure that all the construction work will be finished in time to help install a THAAD battery within the next year,"" he said.The ministry has been in talks with Lotte since early October after selecting the Lotte golf club as the final site for THAAD a month earlier, instead of the controversial Seongsan anti-aircraft missile base in the same county, 296 kilometers southeast of Seoul. The ministry plans to deliver the golf course to US Forces Korea following the swap deal under the Status of Forces Agreement signed between Seoul and Washington. The construction planning and evaluation of the THAAD battery's environmental impact will then be carried out, he added.Through close consultations with the new US government, the Seoul government aims to deploy THAAD next year as scheduled. In a seminar held early this month, USFK Commander Gen. Vincent K. Brooks said: ""You're gonna see the deployment of a THAAD battery. This is an alliance decision. It will come in the next eight to 10 months.""In July, the South and the US announced a decision to deploy the THAAD system in South Korea to better defend against the North's nuclear and missile threats. The rogue regime conducted two nuclear tests and launched about 20 missiles this year alone. The initial decision to pick the Seongsan missile base as the site of the anti-missile system fell through due to strong objections by local residents living near the base. They claimed the system's powerful X-band radar would pose serious health risks despite government-led test results showing that the radar doesn't pose any health problems to nearby residents. THAAD, a core part of America's multilayered missile defense program, is designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles at altitudes of 40 to 150 km during the terminal phase of flight after detecting the missiles with a land-based radar system. A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors , a fire control and communications unit, and an AN/TPY-2 radar.","ministry concluded deal wednesday ,near seoul to lotte ,lotte skyhill country club ,defense ministry concludes deal ,deal wednesday to acquire","[""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'Lotte Group', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'the Lotte Skyhill Country Club', 'Seoul', 'Lotte']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.40837353  0.53823328

At that time, Kim, who showed up just three days after his appointment, criticized the international community's sanctions on his country, and claimed that a nuclear war can break out on the Korean Peninsula at any time, the broadcaster said. He also attended a news conference held right after the passage of the 12th North Korean human rights resolution by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday that calls for the referral of the North Korean leadership's human rights violations to the International Criminal Court., . Kim said that Pyongyang ""categorically rejects"" the resolution, asserting that it has ""political purposes to defame and eliminate the DPRK as well as it is based on lies and fabricated information.""

Park had previously opposed any full-fledged discussions on the highly polarizing issue, saying that the government should focus on tackling more urgent economic and security issues, including North Korea's ever-growing nuclear and missile threats.The chief executive, however, underscored that given political schedules, including the presidential election slated for next year, now is the ""right time"" to push for rewriting the Constitution, last amended in 1987.Park, in particular, stressed the need for a change in the current single five-year presidential term, which has made politics extremely confrontational and the government unable to pursue consistent, sustainable policy goals.""The single, five-year presidential term under the Constitution, which has been in force for the last there decades since its last amendment in 1987, might be suited for the past democratization period, but it has now become clothes that no longer fit our body,"" the president said.""With the political system in which we cannot move a step forward due to confrontation and division, we cannot expect a bright future for the country,"" she added.Park also noted that the change of government in the South every five years has made it difficult to pressure the North into renouncing its nuclear ambitions, and that frequent policy shifts have gotten in the way of economic leaders carrying out long-term, stable business initiatives.Her proposal came amid increasing calls for a major shift in the way the country is run. Proponents have said that the revision should take place, as the current constitution does not reflect the raft of social and political changes that have transpired over the years.The debate over the revision centers on spreading out power that is now concentrated in the president, a point on which many politicians from the ruling and opposition parties alike largely agree. But political circles are split over how to alter the Constitution, foreshadowing an intense debate before they build consensus over the crucial issue.Kim Jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, told reporters that Park ordered preparations for the revision at the end of the Chuseok holiday, or Korean thanksgiving, last month. Kim also said that, if necessary, the president can table a bill for the amendment. But she has not determined how the Constitution should be altered considering the importance of building national consensus, Kim explained. He added that Park intends to lead the schedule related to the revision process.""I believe that the president can spur the discussions on the revision by expressing her opinion or will towards it, if discussions  become lackluster due to the conflict over political interests,"" the presidential aide said. Touching on the budget plans, Park urged the Assembly to meet the deadline for their budget deliberations, which falls on Dec. 2, a date that has been set under the Constitution, but frequently missed by lawmakers due to partisan wrangling.""I ask the 20th National Assembly to meet the legal deadline for its first budget deliberations and to give hope of new politics to people by settling pending issues through dialogue and compromise,"" she said.The government has asked the legislature to approve 400.7 trillion won  in spending for 2017, up from 386.4 trillion won assigned for this year. It marks the first time that the government's proposed budget has exceeded the 400 trillion-won mark.""To overcome current economic and security challenges and lay the foundation for the 30-year growth of the next generation, we have drawn up budget plans in the maximum expansionary way -- within the range that does not undermine our mid- and long-term fiscal health,"" she explained. Following her speech, the Assembly began its 40-day deliberations on the budget proposal.Explaining the focus of the government's budget plans, Park stressed the need to turn the country's economic system into one that leads other nations rather than following others. To this end, the country should continue to push for finding new growth engines and overcoming the repercussions of the ongoing restructuring of major industrial sectors. ""Before the negative impact of the low birth rate and aging population comes to the fore, and before our economic growth rate is fixed at the 1-2 percent range, our nation should create an economic system that leads ,"" she said.Describing the current security landscape on the Korean Peninsula as ""grave and grim,"" the president called for parliamentary support to quickly secure a budget for the timely procurement of key defense systems such as the Kill Chain strike system and the Korea Air and Missile Defense system.","monday proposed constitutional revision ,revision south korean president ,during her parliamentary speech ,president park proposes constitutional ,on monday proposed constitutional","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Park']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17175862  0.17560044

Deployment of strategic assets, such as B-2 stealth bombers, would significantly back up repeated pledges by the US to mobilize all military capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to defend the South.""We discussed a lot of options, including permanently deploying US strategic assets on a rotational basis,"" Han said during a joint news conference with Carter at the Pentagon. ""We'll conduct a review  going forward, including those ones.""Permanently deploying US strategic assets on a rotational basis means keeping at least one such asset either in, over or off in South Korea at any given time. Such deployment would not only reassure South Koreans of the US defense commitment, but serve as a strong warning and deterrent to North Korea leader Kim Jong-un.The US has temporarily sent strategic assets, such as nuclear-capable B-52 and B-1B bombers, F-22 stealth fighter jets and nuclear-powered, cruise-missile submarines, to South Korea in a show of force in the wake of the North's two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches, but perceptions have grown among South Koreans that such one-off missions are not enough.Carter said the two sides ""discussed a number of ways that extended deterrents can be further strengthened.""""No one should have any doubt about this. We have today the capabilities for extended deterrence ... The full weight of our alliance capabilities including all US capabilities and they're very strong, very robust, very ready,"" he said. ""We are, however, talking about a number of measures, and you named one, to further enhance deterrence.""""Extended deterrence"" refers to the commitment to use nuclear weapons, if the need arises, to deter attacks on allies. The US has provided extended deterrence and the ""nuclear umbrella"" to South Korea after withdrawing nuclear warheads from the country in the early 1990s.Ensuring the commitment's implementation was a key focus in Thursday's annual defense ministers' talks, known as the Security Consultative Meeting, amid heightened security concerns in South Korea in the wake of the North's fifth nuclear test and a series of ballistic missile launches.In Wednesday's ""two plus two"" alliance talks that brought together their foreign and defense ministers, the two sides also agreed to established a high-level dialogue, known as the ""Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group,"" to discuss how to carry out US extended deterrence.""The United States remains committed to defending our allies against any threat with the full spectrum of American military might. That's why we're adapting our force structure on the peninsula, mostly recently by agreeing as allies to deploy THAAD to defend against North Korean missile threats,"" Carter said during a joint news conference with Han.""The United States is reaffirming its ironclad commitment to defend South Korea with our extended deterrence capabilities,"" he said. ""Make no mistake. Any attack on American or our allies will not only be defeated, but any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an overwhelming and effective response.""Carter also condemned North Korea's latest test of its Musudan intermediate-range missile the previous day, saying the test, even if a failure, is a violation of UN resolutions. The latest launch, which came Thursday morning , marked the second time the North has tested the missile in less than a week. The previous test on Saturday also failed.Han said he believes the North will continue testing the missile until it's successful. He also said that there was a high possibility that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was at the site when the launch occurred.After the talks, the two sides also issued a joint communique saying that Carter and Han agreed to ""to examine options to take additional steps that further strengthen extended deterrence capabilities to ensure that North Korea has no doubt about Alliance resolve.""""The Secretary and the Minister reaffirmed that any North Korean aggression or military provocation is not to be tolerated and that the United States and the Republic of Korea would work shoulder-to-shoulder to demonstrate our combined resolve,"" the communique said.The two countries also reaffirmed their commitment to THAAD's deployment in South Korea.""The secretary and the minister emphasized the military effectiveness of THAAD and reaffirmed that the system is aimed solely at defending against North Korean missile threats and would not be directed towards any third party nations,"" the communique said.

Park Kwang-on of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea.The amount is based on the won-dollar exchange rate at the end of 2015. On Thursday morning, the South Korean currency was traded at 1,135.90 won against the US dollar.Park cited data from the Bank of Korea, the Export-Import Bank of Korea and the National Tax Service, with the annual parliamentary audit of government affairs under way.During the five years, the conglomerates spent 22.9 trillion won for direct investment in those tax havens, such as the establishment of firms or factories and the purchase of real estate.The remainder was for trade-related payments and investments in third nations, and for other purposes.Their direct investment there jumped to 5.26 trillion won in 2013 from 4.29 trillion won in 2012 and 3.64 trillion won in 2011.It fell to 4.78 trillion won in 2014 but rebounded to 4.94 trillion won last year.Among the 441.5 trillion won sent to the tax havens, only 318.1 trillion won returned to South Korea, Park pointed out.It's not appropriate to regard every direct investment in tax havens as part of efforts to evade taxes or hide assets but related authorities need to tighten the monitoring of possible illicit activities, added the lawmaker.","lawmaker said friday conglomerates ,south korea large businesses ,korean conglomerates raise ,korea large businesses ,korean conglomerates raise presence","[""South Korea 's"", 'Bermuda', 'the Cayman Islands', 'Panama', 'Park Kwang - on', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.45046327  0.57720697

In a recent paper, the National Unification Advisory Council made an array of policy suggestions, raising the need to better utilize top-notch US weapons systems such as the F-22 stealth fighter and B-2 nuclear bomber. On home ground, Seoul should bring forward the establishment of its own Kill Chain and Korea Air and Missile Defense pre-emptive strike schemes, which are currently scheduled for the early 2020s to be used with the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system expected to be deployed here late next year.  “To explore the reinstatement of US tactical nuclear weapons and the permanent placement of some state-of-the-art US strategic assets inside the South could serve as pressure on not only North Korea, but also China over its sanctions against the North,” the report reads. “ the US’ deployment of Pershing II missiles in Europe against the then Soviet Union’s SS nuclear-equipped missiles helped place the Soviet on the defensive in their strategic weapons race and eventually served as a factor behind its collapse.” The NUAC also called for a comprehensive scheme to overhaul the impact of international sanctions against the communist state such as by creating a new expert group here apart from the UN mechanism. If Pyongyang carries out further provocations, additional steps should be taken to bar civilian trade and the dispatch of workers overseas as well as expand the blacklist of individuals and entities, it said. Presided over by the president, the council writes a quarterly paper to be submitted to Cheong Wa Dae, which contains a set of policy suggestions drawn up through discussions and deliberations among experts. The latest report was handed over late September, officials said. Later on Thursday, Park met with 530 international members of the panel from 92 countries, who were gathered in Seoul for a four-day conference.A focal point is whether she will look at the proposed ideas afresh, despite having reaffirmed Seoul’s commitment to a nuclear-free peninsula.Since Pyongyang’s fourth and fifth nuclear tests this year, some senior lawmakers and analysts have been calling for the allies to bring tactical nuclear weapons here, if Seoul is not to take the path toward its own nuclear armament. Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said that any armament move would face extreme difficulty in gaining acceptance worldwide and could also bring political, diplomatic, economic and military repercussions to Seoul. “South Korea should constantly emphasize that it will not need to build nuclear weapons if the US guarantees its extended deterrence in a more concrete and practical manner, but if not, it will inevitably be placed in a position  to pursue its own bomb-making capabilities,” he wrote on the think tank’s blog Thursday. “Meanwhile, South Korea may argue for the redeployment of tactical nukes starting with the hosting of dual capable military assets.” By Shin Hyon-hee","meets with park president ,deterrence against north korea ,panel on unification policy ,us tactical nuclear weapons ,against north korea evolving","['Park Geun', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'the National Unification Advisory Council', 'US']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20557305  0.38086331

The 2016 figure also marked the highest since 1998 when KCNA Watcher began to compile related data. North Korea's state media outlets increased uses of provocative and aggressive language including a threat to ""turn South Korea into a sea of flame"" when inter-Korean tensions flared up.So far this year, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests twice and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles in defiance of international condemnation.In March, North Korea's Central News Agency said that Pyongyang is ready to turn President Park Geun-hye and her office into ""a sea of flames and ashes,"" with its large-caliber multiple launch rocket system.A rise in the threat index in the past did not necessarily match signs of North Korea's physical attacks, but experts said risks of Pyongyang's military provocations are high this year.The index reached a 14-year high of 0.4 in 2013 when North Korea conducted its third nuclear test and threatened to target South Korea and the U.S. mainland with its missiles. But there was no physical aggression by the North.This year, North Korea is accelerating its push for developing its nuclear and missile programs. It claimed it has mastered the technology to make a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile.North Korea is seeking to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile that can fly as far as the US mainland.","media hit three year ,friday north korea threat ,state media hit three ,hit three year high ,showed friday north korea","[""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'KCNA Watcher', 'North Kor']",28,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.74733955  0.63670987

The Center for North Korean Human Rights Records that started operations on Sept. 28 will investigate and collect data on North Korea's human rights abuses in accordance with the law.Suh Doo-hyun, president of the center, told Yonhap News Agency last week that his agency plans to consider probing human rights abuses facing North Korean overseas workers over the long haul.More than 50,000 North Koreans are believed to be forced to work overseas, mainly in China and Russia, sending substantial amounts of their salaries to the North's regime. Pyongyang reportedly earns more than $200 million per year through labor exports.But the Ministry of Unification still remains cautious about whether it could support civic groups' moves to help North Korean defectors staying in third countries, citing the scope of the law.Opposition lawmakers and critics are opposed to the idea of applying the law to such defectors on concerns that the move can spark a diplomatic row and it could effectively spur defections orchestrated by the government.""We are taking a prudent stance over the issue by taking into account diplomatic relations with relevant countries,"" a government official said.President Park Geun-hye on Saturday called for ordinary North Koreans to defect to the South, saying that Seoul will keep the door open for them to find new hopes and lives here.A ministry official said that Park's message pointed to dismal human rights violations facing North Korean people and the need to hold the North's regime accountable for the rights abuses.""Her message indicated Seoul's commitment to making efforts to enable North Koreans to live a decent life as human beings and to enjoy the universal values of freedom and human rights,"" said the official, asking not to be named.He added that Park's speech does not signal changes in the government's policy with North Korea or its careful position on supporting civic groups helping people get away from the repressive regime.","official at seoul unification ,north koreans staying temporarily ,government official said tuesday ,koreans staying in 3rd ,countries official north koreans","['North Koreans', ""South Korea 's"", 'North Koreans', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.63935179  0.90844375

People working for the government, media outlets and schools are also banned from receiving meals priced higher than 30,000 won , gifts exceeding 50,000 won, and congratulatory and condolence money over 100,000 won.It aims to bring more transparency to workers in certain sectors who should maintain higher ethical standards than ordinary citizens. Workplaces and government agencies have been scrambling to determine the exact extent of the law and inform their employees and staffers what they can and can't do starting Sept. 28. The Foreign Ministry building in downtown Seoul According to the foreign ministry, official diplomatic activities will not be subject to the law. Such activities are defined as being directly related to ensuring effective execution of diplomacy, and being carried out by foreign governments or international organizations with their own budgets.For instance, South Korean diplomats may be treated to meals exceeding 30,000 won by foreign governments. They are still advised to stay within the reasonable range and consult with the government's anti-graft officials before accepting expensive meals.Also, South Korean diplomats may host their counterparts stationed here to meals over the legal limit because foreign diplomats aren't public officials as defined by the Kim Young-ran law.South Korean missions overseas may supply traveling South Korean delegates with official vehicles during their stays. The traveling diplomats, however, must pay for any extra vehicle they wish to rent during their stay.South Korean lawmakers who visit overseas missions to conduct their annual parliamentary audits may not be treated to meals during their stays. Should they eat together with diplomats at the same restaurant, they must pay separately.Asking foreign ministry officials to quickly issue passports and visas will be against the law, except for emergency or humanitarian reasons.The ministry worked with the ACRC to come up with the guidelines, hoping the new law won't discourage valid diplomatic activities.","schools are also banned ,foreign ministry said sunday ,banned from receiving mea ,anti graft law taking ,are also banned from","['Kim Young - ran', 'Law', 'the Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58984727  0.75964671

They also discussed ways to support the citizens of Gyeongju from any psychological impact.Gyeongju city officials Sunday work on covering damaged roofs of houses with nets and tents, after the area suffered from a 5.8 magnitude earthquake last week. The meeting at the National Assembly was attended by the party leadership including Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, along with the ministers for agriculture, food and rural affairs, vice minister for public safety and the head of the Korea Meteorological Administration.The government and the ruling party agreed to firstly determine the extent of the earthquake damage in Gyeongju by sending a joint investigation team to the site, prior to the designation.The capital of ancient Silla  was hit by a 5.8-magnitude earthquake Monday with the tremors felt throughout most of South Korea. The KMA said the quake was the strongest since 1978, raising alarms over the safety of the country that had been previously considered “earthquake-free.”On Saturday, officials at the North Gyeongsang Provincial Government and Gyeongju City Council requested the central government to designate the city as a disaster area to cope with the damage with the help of a fund of 5 billion won .An area with a calculated loss of 7.5 billion won can be designated as a special disaster area, according to Vice Minister Lee Sung-ho of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Sunday that it would complete safety tests on all of 24 units of the country’s nuclear plants by the end of 2018. Tests for the Kori and Wolsong nuclear plants located near the epicenter in Gyeongju will be completed by the end of next year.Korea Nuclear Power Co., operator of the country’s nuclear plants, said last week that despite two tremors in Gyeongju, the plant near the city and other plants in the adjacent areas were fully functional without error, producing electricity as per normal.  Officials said the planned safety tests are to make sure the power plants are built to withstand an earthquake with a magnitude of up to 7.0.Currently, two units at the Kori nuclear plants and four units at the Wolsong nuclear plants have ceased operation due to maintenance and accident-prevention checks. There has been rising concern about current regulations on earthquake-resistant construction. According to Rep. Chong Jong-sup of the Saenuri Party, South Korea lacks specific and detailed earthquake-resistant construction regulations for safe building designs. “The government should make earthquake-proof construction design mandatory for all constructors in case of building or remodeling, and establish a legal basis to strengthen construction safety for buildings without earthquake-proof design,” said Rep. Chong.He said he is preparing a revision bill to improve the current Act on the Preparation for Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions as well as the Building Act. The enforcement decree of the Building Act, which took effect in 1988, states that buildings six stories or higher with total floor area of 100,000 square meters must be built following earthquake-proof designs.In 2015, the legislation was revised to target buildings three stories or higher with an area of at least 500 square meters. Earlier this year, buildings two stories or higher came under the law to have more buildings made using earthquake-proof methods.Yet the lack of earthquake-proof facilities across the nation have been considered problematic.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s data, in 2015, just 26.7 percent of buildings three stories or over 13 meters high in Seoul were built based on earthquake-proof designs. The total figure across the country was slightly above 34 percent.Meanwhile, seismic experts have also raised concerns that the Korean Peninsula is no longer safe from strong shock waves and may experience severe earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.The Korean Peninsula was previously considered safe from earthquakes, as it is located away from the Pacific seismic belt “Ring of Fire.”According to the KMA, however, small and mid-sized earthquakes have occurred over the past three decades. A total of 1,212 earthquakes were detected since 1978, and six of them have been earthquakes with a magnitude exceeding 5.0.Oh Chang-hwan, a professor of earth environment at Chonbuk National University said that the Korean Peninsula has been experiencing a 400-year cycle of 7.0 magnitude tremors since mid-1600.Along with the active fault located by the east coast of the peninsula, experts added that strong tremors that originate from nearby epicenters can also cause extensive damages.“When strong shock waves are detected in nearby countries such as Japan, it may add on to the shock waves felt by the Korean Peninsula,” said Hong tae-kyung a professor of earth system science at Yonsei University. “Earthquakes of magnitude over 7.0 can create more secondary shocks in neighboring areas, which last from five to a maximum of eight years,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","sunday held an emergency ,the quake hit southeastern ,saenuri party on sunday ,quake hit southeastern city ,held an emergency meeting","['Saenuri Party', 'Gyeongju']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47620621  0.64926028

South Korea's meteorological agency said the 5.8-magnitude earthquake was strong enough to be felt throughout most parts of the country, even causing some people to evacuate buildings. The quake was preceded by a 5.1-magnitude tremor detected earlier in the same general location south of Gyeongju.""The latest earthquake seems to be linked to the massive quake that struck Japan in March 2011,"" said Chi Heon-cheol, a researcher at Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources  said, adding there has been a series of aftershocks of that major earthquake not only in the island nation but around the Korean Peninsula.South Korea's meteorological agency reports on the location of the record-strength quake that rocked the country on Sept. 12. ""Despite most earthquakes not being too dangerous, it is still worrisome that the numbers of such shocks have been rising,"" Chi adding that number of tremors being detected throughout the country is higher than previously anticipated.The researcher said the latest earthquake observed was caused by the strike-slip fault, adding that a release of energy from a side of the fault led to the quake felt across the country.Chi, however, ruled out the possibility that the kinds of tremors detected this time can lead up to a major earthquake that can cause serious damage.""There are no possibilities,"" Chi claimed. ""The earthquakes observed Monday night are nothing new for the country, and there were previous cases of tremors hitting the same area.""Although there can be earthquakes under 5.5 magnitude down the road, the overall geological structure in and around South Korea is not conducive to a major earthquake,"" the KIGAM researcher stressed.Reflecting this view Son Moon, a professor of geology at Pusan National University said the latest earthquake was caused by the well known Yangsan fault zone that has shown activity in the past. ""It marks the first time that an earthquake took place on the fault zone since 1978,"" the scholar said. He claimed that the fault area in the zone is not like those that affect Japan, which have been cited for causing serious damage.Son added Monday's earthquake did not indicate that South Korea will face a stronger shock in the near future, although the country still needs to pay more attention to the safety of nuclear reactors in the region.""As there are nuclear reactors and radioactive waste disposal facilities in Gyeongju, we need to be more cautious,"" Son said. He then said that while no significant damage is expected from a magnitude-5.1 earthquake, buildings without proper quake-proof design can collapse when a magnitude 5.5 or higher quake strikes.Hong Tae-hyung, a professor at Yonsei University, meanwhile, said more studies are needed to be done to better gauge potential earthquakes that can occur in and around South Korea.""The Gyeongju earthquake was the strongest one ever recorded in the country,"" Hong said, pointing out that the latest tremor can be considered a ""major"" seismic event.""The aftershocks of a major earthquake show a repetitive pattern of expansion,"" the academician said. ""Monday's earthquake shows that the country is in an expanding phase, which can lead to the number of earthquakes rising.""Earthquake experts said the latest tremor usurped the previous record posted in Jan. 8, 1980, when a 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck North Pyongan Province of North Korea. On July 5, South Korea also experienced a magnitude 5 earthquake in the water only 52 kilometers off its southeast coast not far from the industrial city of Ulsan.In a previous research, Hong forecast that a magnitude-7 artificial earthquake in North Korea, caused by an underground nuclear detonation can result in the eruption of Mount Paektu along the North Korea-China border.","monday record breaking earthquake ,safe from strong earthquakes ,safe from major earthquakes ,on monday record breaking ,earthquakes experts south korean","['south korean', 'Gyeongju', 'Seoul']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56779552  0.79213816

Putting together new sanctions could take weeks to complete as a new sanctions package should win endorsement from China, the North's main benefactor and permanent council member with veto powers. It took about two months for the council to adopt a new resolution following the North's fourth nuclear test in January.“Today the world is completely united in condemnation of the DPRK's fifth nuclear test,” US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power told reporters before heading into the council meeting. “This is more than brazen defiance. North Korea is seeking to perfect its nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles so they can hold the region and the world hostage under threat of nuclear strike.”Power said the council should “use every tool at its disposal to change North Korea's calculus.”“We know that divisions on the council only embolden the DPRK to further provocations. We must send a clear, united and strong message that the international community will never accept a nuclear North Korea,” she said. “The council must take further decisive action that forces North Korea to change its calculus.”UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he condemns the North's nuclear test “in the strongest possible terms” as “yet another brazen breach of the resolutions of the Security Council. He also urged the Security Council to take “appropriate action.” UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks at a press briefing, condemning North Korea`s fifth nuclear test as a ""brazen breach"" of U.N. resolutions, Friday at U.N. headquarters. “I count on the Security Council to remain united and take appropriate action. We must urgently break this accelerating spiral of escalation,” Ban told reporters.After the North's fourth nuclear test in January, the Security Council adopted the toughest-ever sanctions on the North, significantly tightening the screws on Pyongyang, including mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North and banning exports of coal and other mineral resources.It was the fifth Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on the North. The previous resolutions were adopted after the North's first nuclear test in 2006, its second nuclear test in 2009, its long-range rocket launch in late 2012 and its third nuclear test in early 2013.Cooperation from China is key to the UN Security Council's push to adopt a new sanctions resolution as the country is one of the veto-holding permanent members of the Security Council, along with Britain, France, Russia and the U.S. China is North Korea's top trading partner and supplies almost all of the isolated nation's energy needs, but analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border with China and the ultimate emergence of a pro-US nation.","council condemns nk nuclear ,condemns nk nuclear test ,friday strongly condemned north ,strongly condemned north korea ,condemns nk nuclear","['the UN Security Council', ""North Korea 's"", 'the Security Council', 'Security Council', 'Security Council', 'New Zealand', 'Gerard van']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.54606819  0.05927436

Choo Mi-ae talks with members of a committee of residents in Seongju and Gimcheon opposing the THAAD deployment in their region in North Gyeongsang Province during their meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday. The initial plan of the government was to deploy the THAAD in Seongsan-ri, Seongju-gun, but fierce opposition forced it to consider an alternate, more remote location within the county other than Seongsan-ri. This then sparked opposition from Gimcheon, which is near one of potential alternatives.Choo, the recently elected leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, reiterated her opposition of the THAAD system and accused President Park Geun-hye of “causing a rift among people by abusing national security to gain a political edge.”Seoul and Washington in July decided to deploy a THAAD battery against the North’s growing nuclear and ballistic missile arsenal. But there has been concern that the THAAD’s range would be unable to protect the highly-populated capital region, and that Pyongyang’s submarine-launched ballistic missile would be able to bypass its defense.“The THAAD is unable to protect the people from North Korean missiles and is useless in terms of military efficiency. It also is detrimental from the diplomatic point of view, as it makes China and Russia turn their backs on us , when we need their cooperation to persuade the North ,” Choo said, while meeting the residents at the National Assembly.The weapon system has a forward-looking radar with a 120-degree view. Military experts such as Jeffrey Lewis, director of the US-based East Asia Nonproliferation Program, have pointed out that the North Korean submarines would “not have to travel very far out to sea to attack the THAAD system from behind the field of view of its radar.”China has publicly opposed the THAAD deployment, refusing to send its delegations to the Seoul Defense Dialogue in what appears to be a show of disapproval toward the allies’ decision.Baek Cheol-hyeon, the joint leader of Seongju residents’ committee against the THAAD, urged Choo to reject the THAAD as an official party platform, as the Minjoo chief had vowed to do so on the heels of being elected last month.“It was wrong  to unilaterally announce the deployment to the people, when deployment of the strategic asset is related to the residents’ right to live,” he said.After the meeting with Choo, the residents’ group visited the US Embassy in Jongro-gu, Seoul to deliver a letter of complaint and hold a protest in front of the building.It was reported earlier in the day that the Defense Ministry had finished a field evaluation on the potential candidates for the THAAD system, besides Seongsan-ri, and is set to announce the results later in the month.A Defense Ministry official said that they are currently conducting assessments on the data they have acquired in the field, but said he was unable to confirm exactly when the results will be made public.By Yoon Min-sik","wednesday met with opposition ,locals voice rejection ,seoul to voice discontent ,discontent about the government ,locals voice rejection of","['citizen of Seongju and Gimcheon', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Choo Mi -', 'the US Embassy', 'Seoul', 'Gimcheon', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67970908  0.80523771

The statement's adoption means that even China and Russia have agreed to condemn the launches.""The members of the Security Council strongly condemned the ballistic missile launches conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 5 September 2016,"" the statement said. ""These launches are in grave violation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's international obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions.""Tuesday's statement, which came only 10 days after the council adopted a press statement condemning the North's launch of a submarine missile test, also urged Pyongyang to ""refrain from further actions, including nuclear tests, in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and comply fully with its obligations under these resolutions.""The statement also urged UN member nations to redouble efforts to carry out UN sanctions on the North. It also said the council will continue to closely monitor the situation and take ""further significant measures in line with the Council's previously expressed determination.""Monday's missile barrage was the latest in a number of missile launches of all ranges -- short, medium, intermediate and submarine missiles -- the communist nation has been carrying out since its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month. Such launches represent a violation of UN Security Council resolutions that ban the North from any activity using ballistic missile technology over concern that it can be used to develop long-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.Earlier in the day, Japan's UN ambassador, Koro Bessho, said the council showed ""much stronger"" unity.""All members recognized these launches as a blatant violation of the Security Council resolutions and other commitments by North Korea. They all opposed and condemned the launch in very strong terms,"" Bessho told reporters after the meeting.U.S. Amb. Samantha Power said she was confident that the council would adopt a statement, just as it did with Chinese consent last month when the North successfully carried out a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.""The Security Council must remain unequivocal and united in condemnation of this test and we must take action to enforce the words we put on paper, to enforce our resolutions,"" she said, calling for stringent implementation of UN sanctions.Power also said that the reason the U.S., South Korea and Japan called Tuesday's meeting is because with ""each violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and there have been 22 of them so far this year, the DPRK demonstrates further advancement of its ballistic missile program.""""This launch, which I would note took place while China was hosting the G20 summit, once again shows the DPRK's blatant disregard for its international obligations and its willingness to provoke and to threaten the international community with impunity,"" Power said.""The DPRK's missile test helped it threaten the territory of even more countries in the region, whether through its land-based missiles or now via its recently tested submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Once the DPRK has the capability to do so, we know what they intend to do with these missile systems ... They intend to arm the systems with nuclear weapons,"" she said.Amb. Hahn Choong-hee, deputy chief of South Korea's mission to the UN, also called for greater efforts to curb the North's weapons programs.""North Korea's advancement of nuclear and missile capability, if unchecked, will continue to pose a serious threat to regional peace and security as well as the nonproliferation regime,"" he said.","tuesday strongly condemned north ,latest ballistic missile tests ,condemning nk missile launches ,ballistic missiles on monday ,condemned north korea latest","['the UN Security Council', ""North Korea 's"", 'UN']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.14596775  0.68783551

Participants include Kim Hong-kyun, the special representative for the Korean Peninsula’s peace and security affairs at Seoul’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, US Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy David Shear, Vice President for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Douglas Paal, and Director-General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Ahmet Uzumcu.Uzumcu is slated to deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony Thursday. Defense Minister Han Min-koo will deliver the opening remarks, followed by a congratulatory address by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.China, which has been butting heads with South Korea over the deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here, will not be sending delegates this year, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday. The plenary session for Thursday will be about the denuclearization of North Korea and international cooperation, while the two sessions on Friday will address maritime security cooperation along with cybersecurity challenges and defense cooperation.“With rising missile and nuclear threats from North Korea, it is very significant that delegates of the six-party denuclearization talks -- except Pyongyang -- are discussing Pyongyang’s nuclear issues,” said the Defense Ministry. “As South Korean and US officials participating in the forum have in-depth knowledge about the North Korean nuclear program, we expect the discussion between experts to produce new solutions for this issue.”By Yoon MIn-sik","gather wednesday in seoul ,annual seoul defense dialogue ,in seoul to discuss ,wednesday in seoul ,wednesday in seoul to","['Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Seoul Defense Dialogue', 'the Defense Ministry', 'sept.7 - 9', 'Westin Chosun']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.87501556  0.85972553

They, however, failed to make progress.Mayor Park Bo-saeng and seven others from the city held an hour-long session with Han, during which he opposed the ministry’s option of deploying the THAAD at a Lotte-owned golf course in the adjacent Hojeon-myeon, North Gyeongsang Province. The site belongs to Seongju-gun, but is geographically closer to Gimcheon, which is located to its north. As the THAAD’s radar will be directed northward -- to defend against North Korean ballistic missiles -- residents of Gimcheon have raised concern over potential health hazards.Gimcheon residents and city council members shave their heads in front of the Defense Ministry in Seoul on Thursday in protest to the potential deployment of THAAD near their city. “We told them  that if the ministry truly seeks to protect the security of the people, they should select a spot where it  will inflict the smallest damage upon the people. As the Seongju CC  is the closest among the candidate spots to Gimcheon citizens, we cannot accept this,” said Kim Se-won, the leader of a committee against the THAAD deployment in Gimcheon. The last-minute meeting was announced this morning, after the committee had requested an audience with Han on Wednesday, according to the Defense Ministry.After Seoul and Washington decided to deploy the THAAD here, the Defense Ministry had planned to station it in Seongsan-ri, Seongju-gun. But vehement opposition from the inhabitants there forced the ministry to contemplate an alternate spot within Seongju.It is currently evaluating three spots, including the golf course.Kim also said that the residents demanded that the ministry should include people of Gimcheon in the decision-making process that currently only includes Seongju citizens, citing how Gimcheon is potentially the one being most penalized by the deployment.According to ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun, residents demanded that the ministry either: select a spot that would have the smallest effect on human health among the three candidates; stick with the original plan to deploy it in Seongsan-ri; or reconsider the deployment itself.Moon said the mayor specifically said that while defending against the North is important, the ministry should retain its original plan for Seongsan-ri.“The minister stressed that the military has decided to deploy the THAAD to better protect the people and the country against the North Korean threats. He urged understanding and support of residents in the cited areas, vowing to keep listening to what they have to say,” Moon said.The residents’ group denied accusations of a not-in-my-back-yard attitude, saying it was the ministry who broke their own rules first. “If Seongju says no , what justification does the ministry have on stationing it at Gimcheon? ...Whether it be Seongju, Gimcheon or Seoul, we all have the same rights as Koreans,” said committee leader Kim.Gimcheon delegates expressed discontent about their meeting, during which Han had remained silent on any specific plans and said he will “consider their positions.”After stepping out, the residents and Gimcheon city council members en masse shaved their heads in protest. Prior to the meeting, hundreds of citizens from Gimcheon had gathered in front of a war memorial across the street from the ministry to protest the deployment of THAAD near their city.From the chanting and placards hoisted by the protesters, it was apparent that the residents have yet to reach a consensus on what they are demanding. While the delegates group focused more on hosting THAAD elsewhere, many of the participants at the rally were calling for the plan to be scrapped entirely.“They say there is no such thing as an ‘ultimate ally’ or a ‘perennial foe,’ yet  is forcing a choice between the US and China,” said one participant to angry cheers of “That’s right!” and “No THAAD!”By Yoon Min-sik","meeting thursday with defense ,residents step up protest ,thursday with defense minister ,protest against thaad residents ,gimcheon held meeting thursday","['Gimcheon', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Park Bo - saeng', 'Han']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51138073  0.47441119

The move comes as Seongju residents strongly protested the government's decision to install the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system at the Seongsan artillery base which is not too far away from the county's main population center. The government announced on July 13 that it plans to have a THAAD battery in place in Seongju, 296 kilometers southeast of Seoul, by the end of 2017, to better counter growing threats from North Korea.""We have picked three possible sites for THAAD after consultations with the provincial government. The joint team composed of Korean and U.S. officials will make field visits and carry out a review of the sites' availability for THAAD,"" Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said in a press briefing.The three candidate sites are the area near Mt. Yeomsok in Geumsoo-myeon, Mt. Kkachi in Sooryoon-myeon and a golf course operated by Lotte Group in Chojeon-myeon. In its own analysis, the defense ministry already found the first two sites not appropriate for the missile defense system due mainly to cost reasons. The golf course in northern Seongju has emerged as a likely alternative site due to its remote location from residential areas and existing and good infrastructure. ""We will apply six principles -- operational effectiveness, health concerns by residents, infrastructure, overall safety considerations, construction time and cost, and the preparation period for installation -- to select an alternative site as quickly as possible,"" the official said.The residents of Seongju have opposed the THAAD system because they are concerned about the potential health risks regarding the powerful X-band radar that comes with the missile defense system.They have recently asked the government to select an alternate site in Seongju for the planned deployment of the THAAD battery.On July 8, Seoul and Washington announced they will deploy a THAAD battery in South Korea to better defend against nuclear and missile threats from the North.","korea military said monday ,seongju residents strongly protested ,detailed examinations into three ,military said monday ,korea to check alternate","[""South Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'Seongju', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seongsan']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.25948966  0.34093335

The congress was never held while the incumbent leader's late father Kim Jong-il ruled the country.""Youth league organizations and youth should become the vanguard and shock brigade in building a socialist power,"" Kim said during his speech at the congress, reported by the Korean Central News Agency.The youth league was created by the country's late founder Kim Il-sung in 1946, the largest youth association governed by the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.North Koreans aged from 14 to 30 are required to join the association which is known to command a membership of some 5 million young people.The congress came as more North Koreans including members of the elite have been defecting to South Korea amid the leader's reign of terror. Seoul's unification ministry said Friday that the holding of the youth congress reflects North Korea's move to strengthen its campaign for mobilization.Members of the youth league were mobilized last year to build a new hydroelectric power plant near Mount Paekdu, the highest peak on the divided peninsula.","korea has renamed major ,friday opened the congress ,media said monday move ,congress pyongyang on friday ,pyongyang on friday opened","['North Korea', 'North Korea', 'the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League', 'Kimilsungist - Kimjongilist Youth League', 'pyongyang']",28,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.58471751  0.92678857

51,51,51,Korea’s new birth rate policies raise eyebrows,"South Korea’s newly introduced measures to boost the country’s “critically low” fertility rate, including a campaign to urge workers to leave work without informing their bosses, are being questioned on their effectiveness.The Welfare Ministry on Thursday announced its short-term emergency measures to combat the demographic crisis, including expanding state allowance for those seeking infertility treatment and ra...","South Korea’s newly introduced measures to boost the country’s “critically low” fertility rate, including a campaign to urge workers to leave work without informing their bosses, are being questioned on their effectiveness.The Welfare Ministry on Thursday announced its short-term emergency measures to combat the demographic crisis, including expanding state allowance for those seeking infertility treatment and raising paternity allowances for parents welcoming their second child.In its effort to raise the total fertility rate from the current 1.24 babies per woman to 1.5 by 2020 -- which means at least 20,000 more babies must be born next year -- the ministry also urged the nation’s conglomerates to transform their work culture so that workers can spend more time with their spouses -- and eventually have more children. 123rfSouth Korea is notorious for its long work hours -- among the longest of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries -- as well as the binge drinking culture that is often considered a professional obligation. In order to combat the problem and establish a more “family and marriage-friendly” work culture, the Welfare Ministry last week made a number of suggestions. The suggestions included allowing all workers to leave work on time “without saying ‘bye’ to one’s boss.” Greeting and bidding farewell to one’s superiors and those older when coming to and leaving from the workplace is largely considered basic manners in Korea. A government official, who wished to remain anonymous, said he has heard from many Korean workers who could not leave work on time because whenever they bid farewell to their boss, he or she would either give them more work or express displeasure.“We think it’ll make it easier for many workers to leave work on time without having to worry about possible disadvantages they may face,” the official said. Encouraging workers to leave work on time also has to do with working Koreans’ poor work-life balance, especially among women. Statistics show that Korean men spend the least hours on domestic chores among all men in OECD countries. As of 2014, Korean women on average spent 3 hours and 25 minutes daily on household chores on weekdays, whereas men only spent 39 minutes, partly due to long work hours. Also as of 2014, only 4.45 percent of all Korean fathers took paternity leave. Many men who choose not to take the leave fear career disadvantages, such as possible demotion, according to a report by the Korean Women’s Development Institute. Only 29.9 percent of all Korean employers have at least one worker who has used their parental leave, according to the same think tank. Kim Ji-eun, a 33-year-old female professional in Seoul, said the government’s newly introduced measures are impractical and even “naive.” Kim, who works at one of the biggest local conglomerates, says workers at her company are not required to say bye to their boss when they leave work. However, the norm is that “no one should leave until their boss leaves.”“Maybe these measures could work for civil servants, but not at big private firms,” she said. “It’s not just about saying byes or not. It’s related to so many things, such as the workload -- I very often work on weekends because that’s the only way to finish projects on time -- as well as work hierarchy and politics that are so deeply linked in the professional world.”Park Han-sub, a 30-year-old office worker in Seoul, said he does not really understand why the low fertility rate is considered a “crisis” by the government. Park, who is currently single, said he wants to get married someday, but wouldn’t mind living a childless life.“Given our economy as well as the development of technology -- think about AlphaGo -- I assume there will be fewer quality jobs for the next generation. Considering this, I don’t think low birthrate is necessarily a bad thing,” he said, pointing to the fundamental outlook among the young that may be behind their reluctance to reproduce.“The government keeps saying the current birthrate would reduce the economically productive population. But I think a significant portion of the next generation -- those who are ‘young and hence economically productive’ -- would be either unemployed or live with limited job security. I think the majority of young Koreans get this. But I don’t think the government does.”  By Claire Lee","korea new birth rate ,korea newly introduced measures ,welfare ministry on thursday ,south korea newly introduced ,thursday announced its short","['South Korea ’s', 'the Welfare Ministry']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47836581  0.36008519

The congress was never held under the regime of the current leader's late father Kim Jong-il.The youth league was created by the country's late founder Kim Il-sung in 1946. It is North Korea's largest youth association, governed by the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, commanding the membership of some 5 million young people. The league also plays a key role in North Korean society because everyone aged from 14 to 30 is required to join. The North's state media said on Aug. 12 that the congress would demonstrate the ""steadfast"" faith and will of young people to showcase the might of the youth's power.Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party's main organ, said in its commentary on Friday that the country's young people should stand in the vanguard and show allegiance to the country's leader Kim and to build up the socialist country.The North's leader Kim Jong-un has highlighted the role of young people in an apparent move to mobilize them to solidify his power base, experts said.The congress came amid high tensions on the divided peninsula as North Korea fired off a submarine-launched ballistic missile toward Japan on Wednesday.The missile flew some 500 kilometers, the longest flight by such a missile, raising concerns about technical advances in North Korea's missile program.Seoul's unification ministry said that North Korea seems to be aiming to strengthen the leader's unfettered rule by holding events such as the youth congress.""North Korea is expected to continue to hold events of socialist associations following the youth congress,"" Jeong Joon-hee, a ministry spokesman, said at a regular press briefing.He said that the latest move appears to highlight the meaning of the Kim Jong-un era and to help consolidate his already firm rule.In May, North Korea held its first party congress in 36 years, a venue that reaffirmed Kim's hold on power. In early August, the country held a military gathering for exemplary servicemen in a bid to strengthen the military's morale and boost combat readiness.","korea on friday opened ,opens first youth congress ,north korea on friday ,friday opened the congress ,youth league since feb","['North Korea', 'Kim Jong - un', 'the Central Committee', 'Pyongyang']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.70548433  0.95521927

Yoo added it will also replace 180 police buses to improve their air conditioning systems.The government, meanwhile, will also increase the amount of monthly pensions to 2.5 million war veterans. Under the plan, the veterans of the Korean and Vietnamese Wars will receive 220,000 won every month next year, up from the previous 200,000 won.The ruling Saenuri Party said the amount exceeds President Park Geun-hye's earlier pledge of 190,000 won.The amount of funds allocated to prevent illegal Chinese fishing boats operating in South Korean waters will soar fivefold to 10 billion won in 2017 from this year's 2 billion won, it added.A rising number of South Korean fishing boats filed complaints against illegal Chinese operators emerging as a major threat to their livelihoods.The government will also spend 50 billion won in generating more jobs for elderly citizens. For single parents, the government plans to give 120,000 won subsidies every month, up from this year's 100,000 won.Following the anti-graft law that takes effect in September, the government will also expand support to the agricultural industries and recoup potential losses.Slated to go into effect on Sept. 28, the law is designed to bring more transparency among public officials, journalists and private school faculty. The law makes it illegal to accept meals exceeding 30,000 won, presents in excess of 50,000 won and money for congratulations or condolences of over 100,000 won.Local farmers claimed that the law will hurt their profits as people will be no longer exchange high-priced agricultural goods during holidays. ""The combined budget  will increase by 3.7 percent,"" a Saenuri official said, adding the fund allocated to create jobs will also increase 10 percent from this year's 2.3 trillion won.Policy watchers said the budget for next year is estimated at 400.7 trillion won, marking the first time that the total has gone over the 400-trillion won mark. The amount, however, may be cut after it is examined by lawmakers, they added.","finance minister on wednesday ,dorms south korea finance ,30 000 air conditioners ,billion won 56 million ,all military dorms south","[""South Korea 's"", 'Yoo Il - ho']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.6372062   0.56799108

South Korean parties have been divided over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense in the southern part of the country, which the government claims is vital to improve its defense capabilities against North Korea's nuclear provocations.While the conservative-ruling Saenuri Party has been supportive of the move, some opposition parties claim the deployment will hurt Seoul's ties with Beijing and Moscow, and thus must be scrapped. The major opposition Minjoo Party of Korea remains neutral on the move, although some of its lawmakers are expressing discontent against the party leadership for not voicing objections.The parliamentary speaker, however, did not express support nor opposition against the deployment of THAAD.Six-term lawmaker Chung, originally from Minjoo, took the post earlier this year after Saenuri agreed to let Minjoo take the speaker's post.""We need to come up with a long-term diplomatic and security strategy for the peace and stability of Northeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula,"" Chung added.The speaker added the on-going dispute over THAAD resembles the situation in the early 1900s, when the country became the battleground of great powers."" will continue to look straight into the grave situation of Northeast Asia and make active movements to come up with future-oriented diplomatic and security strategies,"" Chung added.","tuesday said south korean ,parliamentary speaker urges parties ,korean parties must overcome ,south korean parties must ,said south korean parties","['National Assembly', 'Chung Sye - kyun', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Chung', 'south korean']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5373072   0.51354635

It added that the review, however, does not mean an immediate withdrawal of the original decision to install the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the disputed location of Seongsan artillery base. “That decision remains intact until the evaluation results on the alternative site are released.”The position came hours after Seongju County Gov. Kim Hang-gon held a press conference and requested the ministry to decide on a site other than the Seongsan artillery base in Seongsan-ri, Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province to deploy THAAD.“Even in the latest poll and  the discussion among the county residents, the majority wish for an alternative site if  must be deployed ,” Kim said in his statement.Seongju County Gov. Kim Hang-gon speaks at a press conference in Seongju on Monday.“Due to the Defense Ministry’s unilateral THAAD deployment decision, the peaceful lives of the residents have deteriorated, and the local economy has been slashed in half … But an extreme opposition without an alternative cannot be a fundamental solution for the crisis,” he added.Adding that the people and the state need security to exist, Kim said that a “blind” opposition to the nation’s security would only lead to a catastrophe.Seongju residents have opposed the government’s decision to install THAAD at the base citing potential health and environmental impact due to its powerful electromagnetic waves from the radars. Some 20,000 reside within the 1.5 kilometer radius from the base. The protest has been vehement, with Kim shaving his head last week, and the members of a committee dealing with the deployment issue physically blocking visits by top-ranking government officials including Defense Minister Han Min-koo. Hundreds of residents have also traveled to Seoul to lodge their protest earlier this month. A number of progressive figures including opposition lawmakers and opinion leaders have joined their move. The opposition, however, has also been multifaceted, with some protesting any deployment of THAAD in any part of the country questioning the efficacy of the anti-missile system in protecting the South, namely the most populated capital region, and warning of diplomatic fallout with China and Russia.Some, on the other hand, have agreed to the need for the layered missile defense by bringing in THAAD in light of escalating military provocation by North Korea which has fired off numerous ballistic missiles, some in sharper angles to demonstrate its capability to strike South Korea. They instead question the location selection or the unilateral way the deployment decision has been made. The alternative site reportedly being considered is a golf course located in Chojeon-myeon in Seongju. It is some 18 kilometers North off the Seongju county office and takes about 20 to 30 minutes by car.The location is 680 meters above sea level, which is higher than the Seongsan base at 383 meters above sea level.The course spans some 1.78 million square meters including 820,000 square meters of land that remains vacant for further development. Observers have said the golf course can minimize the debate over any health risk from the THAAD radars’ electromagnetic waves as it is in a remote area.The infrastructure of the course that already exists would also make the construction easier, they have pointed out. THAAD is to be deployed by the end of next year based on the agreement between Seoul and Washington. Defense Ministry officials including Ryu Jae-seung, head of the ministry’s planning, have already paid a visit to the area for possible review.Kim Hang-gon, in his speech, also sought for the residents’ support for what he called was a “lonely decision.”Kim was supported by Rep. Lee Wan-yong of the Saenuri Party representing Seongju, Goryeong, Seongju and Chilgok, in a separate news conference.“I appreciate the decision by Governor Kim Hang-gon and will work to gather cooperation.”But Kim’s news conference also prompted a scuffle between dissenting residents and police.The group, who continue to call for a complete withdrawal of the deployment plan from their area, told a press conference that Kim’s statement was invalid as it “ran counter” to the wishes of the residents.They vowed to newly form a committee and pick a new leader to continue fighting the THAAD deployment.Amid persisting protest from the residents of Seongju that has been part of the political stronghold for the ruling camp, President Park Geun-hye took a step back last month and suggested considering an alternative site for the deployment, although it would still be within Seongju.Behind the alternative location, however, looms another round of protests as residents living near the golf course have begun protesting the possible site change.They include residents of Gimcheon, where a total of 5,120 households reside, that is 7 kilometers away from the golf course.Some 700 Gimcheon residents held a candlelight vigil protesting THAAD on Saturday night. The golf course is privately-owned. Among the things to be clarified for a relocation would be how to purchase the site and whether it would come from state coffers that may require parliamentary approval.","defense ministry said monday ,monday it will review ,ministry said monday ,ministry said monday it ,defense ministry to review","['the Defense Ministry', 'US', 'Seongju']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41887766  0.39477804

The North has been threatening retaliation for what it calls the kidnapping of restaurant workers in April, and with Thae's defection being confirmed by Seoul last week, it may be more inclined to strike.

The local committee on the retraction of the THAAD deployment in Seongju held an emergency meeting to discuss whether to retain its demand to scrap the plan completely. Although they failed to reach an agreement, the committee decided to further discuss the recently proposed plan B to place the advanced missile weapon system in a less populated and more remote spot than the government’s initial planned location of Seongsan-ri, Seongju.Members of a committee on the retraction of THAAD deployment in Seongju hold an emergency meeting Friday. “We plan to decide on our specific plans within this week. We hope to narrow the gap between each side’s positions,” the committee head Kim An-su said.He had suggested that the committee should provisionally agree to accept the “alternate location” option, on the basis that the ministry scrap its decision to place the THAAD in Seongsan-ri.Another official from the committee told local media that the committee appears to have at least reached an agreement on accepting the alternate location option and discussed whether to designate a specific spot or leave it to the ministry.But the hard-liners of the committee argued that deciding to house the THAAD within Seongju would threaten the group’s credibility, as it has claimed that the weapon should not be placed anywhere in the peninsula.The committee is slated to hold another meeting Saturday.While defending the THAAD deployment on Wednesday, Defense Minister Han Min-koo urged the locals to come up with a collective suggestion on the alternative spot. The main source of complaint for placing the THAAD in Seongsan-ri -- specifically at an artillery base 400 meters above sea level -- has been that it would sit just 1.5 kilometers from the closest residential area. Since Seoul and Washington decided to install the THAAD in the peninsula to counter North Korean missile threats, there has been concern that operating the THAAD’s AN/TPY-2 radar so close to people would spark health problems, especially from the microwave radiations.One of the locations mentioned as an alternative is the Lotte-owned golf course in the adjacent Chojeon-myeon, which is about 20 kilometers north of Seongsan artillery base and 680 meters above sea level. It is also more remote, located 18 kilometers away from the Seongju-gun office.  The Defense Ministry on Thursday denied rumors that it has agreed with Lotte to purchase the golf course.But talks of potentially locating the THAAD in the remote golf course has prompted complaints from residents in the neighboring city of Gimcheon, as the cited areas technically belong in Seongju but are geographically closer to Gimcheon. Gimcheon city held an emergency press conference Thursday to oppose placing the THAAD in the current location of the Lotte golf course, and vowed to reject placing the THAAD in “locations that threaten the safety and survival of 140,000 Gimcheon citizens.”Meanwhile, a string of high-ranking US military officials have been visiting South Korea and China since the THAAD deployment was announced last month. China has vehemently opposed having its biggest rival’s weapon system close to its territory.US Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Adm. James D. Syring visited South Korea last month to explain the proficiency of THAAD, its safety and how the THAAD is specifically against North Korean threats and not against China.Defense Minister Han met with US Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus on Friday and discussed measures to better counter threats from North Korea. The two did not discuss the THAAD or rumored deployment of the standard missile-3 on Seoul’s second batch of Aegis-equipped destroyers, the ministry said.By Yoon Min-sik","defense system on friday ,emergency meeting to discuss ,accepting the government plan ,government plan to deploy ,held an emergency meeting","['the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'US', 'Seongju']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62023914  0.29745078

South Korea's military on Thursday carried out the drill along the tense inter-Korean border, involving 49 front-line artillery battalions. It was the military's biggest-ever artillery exercise in size, with about 300 guns being fired in a show of force.It took place two days before South Korea marks the anniversary of a brief artillery engagement with North Korea on Aug. 20. The exercise aimed to demonstrate Seoul's determination to firmly counter Pyongyang's military provocations.

Choi Moon-soon, Jilin Gov. Jiang Chaoliang and Vladimir Miklushevsky, governor of Primorsky region in the Russian Far East, signed a pact to join hands toward the resumption of the route linking Sokcho on South Korea's east coast to the Russian port of Zarubino and the Chinese city of Hunchun bordering with Russia and North Korea.Launched in 2000, the Sokcho-Zarubino-Hunchun route was touted as a popular course for South Koreans to visit the popular tourist destination of Mount Paekdu bordering North Korea and China, and China's northeastern region. But it ceased to operate in 2014 as a result of difficulties with Russian customs and the exorbitant cost of the visa, among others.The agreement came on the sidelines of the 21st Northeast Asia Provincial Governors’ Conference held in Changchun, China's Jilin Province. The conference, initiated by the South Korean province in 1994, groups Northeast Asian's five regional governments comprising Gangwon, Jilin, Japan's Tottori Prefecture, Russia's Vladivostok and Mongolia's Tuv Province.With the view of having the route resumed, Gangwon has persistently expressed to the Russian province its interest in the route's reopening. Wednesday's agreement raised the South Korean regional government's hope that the maritime and overland route may be reactivated at a time that Russian President has taken many steps to develop Russia's Far East.The three regional government also agreed on the cooperation in making each region one of the best places for investments.Speaking during the conference, Choi called for the three regions to make a new leap with the timing of three Olympics in Northeast Asia -- the 2018 Winter Olympics in the South Korean alpine town of PyeongChang, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.At the close of the conference, the five member governments adopted a joint communique calling for the Sokcho-Zarubino-Hunchun route's reoperation, the launch of an air route linking the three regions and the widening of tourism and environment exchanges in the private sector.The next conference will take place in the Japanese prefecture next year.","northeast asia agreed wednesday ,agree to resume ferry ,agreed wednesday to cooperate ,to resume ferry route ,route to northeast china","[""South Korea 's"", 'Gangwon Province', 'China', 'Jilin Province', 'Russia', 'Maritime Province', 'Gangwon', 'Gangwon', 'Choi Moon - soon', 'Jilin', 'Jiang Chaoliang', 'Vladimir Miklushevsky']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.56697059  0.64490181

The foundation was launched late last month under a deal reached between the two countries in December to resolve their deep-running rift over the victims, euphemistically called comfort women. Tokyo promised to contribute 1 billion yen  to it. On Tuesday, South Korea and Japan held a director-level meeting to discuss follow-up measures including when the promised money will be delivered and for what purposes it should be spent. An official who joined the meeting told reporters that they made ""significant"" progress.""There will be a chance to talk very soon,"" Cho June-hyuck said at a regular briefing. ""We cannot specify the date about when Japan will send the money but we think that it will come through in a way that would not cause any delay in the operation of the foundation.""It is expected that the details could be made public by the middle of next week.Under the Dec. 28 deal, Japan expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to launch a foundation dedicated to healing the scars of the surviving victims and supporting them.The agreement that has been hailed a breakthrough in bilateral relations, however, drew flak from some victims and civic groups who have accused Seoul of striking a deal that lacked Japan's acknowledgment of its legal responsibility. They also said the agreement was reached without prior consultation with victims.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II.

It was a flip-flop from the ministry’s previous stance that it had reviewed others sites for potential deployment but concluded they were unfit.Seoul and Washington’s decision last month to install the THAAD in the country’s southern region -- to defend against North Korea’s ballistic missiles -- had sparked concerns over its potential effect on the people’s health, particularly from its high-powered AN/TPY-2 radar.Residents pointed out that upon operation, electromagnetic waves emitted from THAAD’s radar, if it were based in Seongsan-ri, would pass through populated areas of Seongju-gun. They reportedly told Park that they are willing to accept having THAAD placed in other areas in Seongju besides Seongsan-ri.Potential locations include the scarcely populated Mount Yeomsoksan and Mount Ggachisan, which stand respectively at 873 meters and 571 meters above sea level.

This would mark a rebound following a two-year decline. Since its peak at 2,914 in 2009, the figure had dwindled to 1,276, especially since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power in late 2011 and authorities sharply toughened border controls and penalties for failed escape attempts.  A choir of young North Korean defectors participate in an event hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in Seoul in June. The perceived reversal may reflect unabated political and social repression and deepening economic difficulties in the isolated country amid tightening international sanctions over its nuclear program. Some recent cases include senior military officers or people from relatively wealthy backgrounds, such as the mass defection of workers at overseas North Korean restaurants who were tasked with earning foreign currency. “For now more North Koreans are coming to the South in particular via China, but we need to wait and see if the pace will continue through the end of the year,” a ministry official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity. “In the Kim Jong-un era, the number has risen for those who flew directly from China, while the length of their stays there before arriving here has relatively shortened compared with the past, when it was as many as 10 years. Apparently their lives in China, too, have grown tougher.” But the official remained cautious about the proportion of elites and the middle-class, citing differences in standards and perceptions. Many activists and advocate groups say they are struggling to meet soaring demand for help from would-be escapees on the back of a jump in defection costs due partly to reinforced border security. A Seoul-based missionary nongovernmental organization supported the arrival here of 121 North Koreans through China last year alone, and it is now striving to raise funds to respond to growing requests. “I cannot determine whether more from the elite are seeking to exit than before, but the sheer number of aspiring defectors is up this year,” a Seoul expert linked with the NGO said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Sexual violence and domestic abuse are among “four societal evils” defined by the current Park Geun-hye administration, along with school violence and low-quality or adulterated food products.In June, a gang-rape case of a female teacher in a remote island village in Shinan, South Jeolla Province, sparked public criticism toward the lack of safety measures and flagrant disregard for the rights of women in remote regions.Earlier in March, it was revealed that a 7-year-old boy named Won-young died after being severely abused and neglected by his father and stepmother. Among the announced measures are antiviolence education programs for residents of remote areas. Teachers will visit remote towns and villages to talk about gender equality and the importance of preventing and combating sexual violence. The government is also coming up with new ankle bracelets -- a homing device that ex-convicts of sexual violence are often required to wear in South Korea -- that will analyze each individual’s body temperature and pulse, on top of the location of offenders. This is to help the authorities better monitor offenders and prevent possible future crimes. To tackle child abuse, the government plans to encourage Koreans to attend classes on parenting. As of this year, about 80 percent of all child abusers were the victims’ parents.In August, authorities will investigate and visit homes of all school children -- including those who attend high school -- who have not been in school for a long period of time or have taken a semester off. In the case of Won-young’s death, it was his school teacher who was worried about his absence in school and made a police report, bringing the issue into the public spotlight. Government data, such as National Health Insurance records, will be used to track down children’s whereabouts.The prime minister also released plans to combat violence in schools and protect young victims, including psychiatric support for students and the installation of surveillance cameras at all elementary, middle and high schools nationwide.By Claire Lee","korean government announced friday ,strengthen our sexual violence ,government announced friday additional ,abuse the south korean ,government plans to combat","['south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41089305  0.41323704

The submission, the first of its kind, was made the previous day after the ministry announced a plan in January last year to nurture the MRO industry by providing tailored support for the launch of an MRO consortium, including an airline, and the creation of an MRO complex. The ministry didn't fix the deadline for the submission of MRO business plans at that time, and KAI is the sole presenter. KAI, based in Sacheon, 437 kilometers southeast of Seoul, wrote up the business plan jointly with the city and South Gyeongsang provincial governments. The plan has yet to be made public for the ministry's review, but reportedly contains an initiative to form an MRO park on a 30,000-square-meter lot in the city in the first stage. In addition, the complex is expected to be expanded to some 300,000 square meters in the long run, with major MRO items to include fuselage, hydraulic system and landing gears.  To that end, KAI will reportedly invest 510 billion won  in the project, plus 90 billion won from the city and provincial government and 100 billion won from the central government.""The ministry is expected to conduct a preliminary feasibility study on our business plan in the latter half of this year via a screening panel,"" a KAI official said.

Defense Minister Han Min-koo's remarks made at the National Assembly policy review session come after speculations that the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system in Korea will invariably lead to the country becoming part of the Washington-led MD system which is seen by some as a move to isolate China.  Defense Minister Han Min-koo answers questions from lawmakers at the National Assembly on the planned THAAD deployment here on July 20. Seoul announced on July 8, that it will allow a U.S. THAAD battery to be stationed in the country after months of deliberation.The Seoul government has persistently said that it has no intention of joining the MD system and that it wants to build up its own ""Korea Air and Missile Defense"" system to deal with evolving North Korean missile and nuclear threats. ""The government remains committed to not joining the MD shield and this stance has not changed since the Kim Dae-jung administration,"" the policymaker pointed out. The late president led South Korea until February 2003. ""In line with this policy, Seoul has stepped up efforts to build up KAMD,"" he said. He made clear that the THAAD to be employed in South Korea will not be sharing information with the wider MD network. The MD is a sensitive issue because it can alienate neighboring countries such as China and Russia that South Korea wants to maintain good relations with. China, in particular, is Seoul's No.1 trading partner, and a key player in Seoul's drive to get North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.Seoul aims to finish the installation of its locally produced defense systems like its ""kill chain"" and KAMD by 2020. The kill chain aims to enhance Seoul's capability to detect and destroy North Korea's weapons of mass destruction.As THAAD is an integral part of the U.S. MD system, China and Russia have seen it as a threat to their security interests if deployed in South Korea.","defense minister said wednesday ,chief korea defense minister ,will not be incorporated ,korea defense minister said ,korea defense minister","['Korea', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', ""Han Min - koo 's"", 'National Assembly', 'Korea']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59620959  0.70313293

South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se is to attend the event.The ASEAN Regional Forum , the region's largest security gathering, will be held on Tuesday, the last day of the annual gathering. The forum will issue a chairman's statement that summarizes what has been discussed during the gathering. ""This year, we could have more difficulty ,"" a government official told a group of reporters on condition of anonymity. ""There are many things that Laos, a chair country, can decide on its own.""His remarks suggested that since Laos has close ties with North Korea and the ASEAN follows a rigorous consensus-building process in reaching an agreement, it would be tough for South Korea to reflect its stance in the wording of the statement related to Pyongyang's provocative behavior.This year's ARF comes amid heightened tensions caused by the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons. Earlier this year, Pyongyang conducted its fourth nuclear and long-range ballistic missile tests. The forum is a rare international occasion that North Korea attends along with all the other countries involved in the long-suspended six-part talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear ambitions. Ri Yong-ho, the North's foreign minister, will likely join the gathering.The source said that Laos has distributed the first draft of the statement to participating countries which mentioned such issues related to North Korea and South China Sea.

The broadcast started in the early hours of Friday morning and marks the first time Seoul picked up on such communication from the North in 16 years.The North halted all such broadcasting after the first inter-Korean summit in June 2000.The encrypted number system, a relic of the Cold War espionage age, requires the sender and the receiver to have access to the same book and other types of reference materials so orders can be handed down by mentioning a page and the position of a word on that. This was a favored method employed by the reclusive country to contact and give orders to spies that infiltrated the South.The coded radio broadcast began at 00:45 a.m. with a female announcer saying, ""starting now, I will give review work to No. 27 exploration agents.""The announcer then said, ""on page 459 number 35, on page 913 number 55, on page 135 number 86, on page 257 number 2,"" followed by more numbers.South Korean intelligence authorities are reportedly scrambling to find out why Pyongyang resumed this type of communication, particularly in the digital era when it could have simply given out orders via the internet. The revelation has put the Seoul government on alert over possible provocations that can be committed by the North's agents living in the South. The timing of the broadcast also is being looked into since it took place just one week after a decision by Seoul to deploy the U.S.-made missile defense system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on its soil.An official of the Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, a conservative think tank in Seoul, said that in the past, North Korea often used the encrypted number method to hand out orders.He speculated the resumption of the broadcasting is aimed at intensifying psychological warfare against South Korea as well as escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula.","pyongyang aired 12 minute ,shortwave segment last week ,korea resumes encrypted number ,government source said tuesday ,radio pyongyang aired 12","['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Radio Pyongyang']",28,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.28860921  0.73333746

The Ministry of National Defense is in the process of upgrading the PAC-2 Patriot anti-missile system at a military base in Gangwon Province into the more effective PAC-3 Patriot system which employs ""hit-to-kill"" technology that has no warhead, a ministry official said.  This undated computer graphic image shows a PAC-2 Patriot anti-missile system in the center and the advanced THAAD anti-missile launcher firing a missile in the right. The PAC-3 can intercept incoming missiles at higher altitudes of 30-40 km and have superior intercept capabilities than the older systems. The PAC-2s generally operate at 15-20 km and destroy targets by using a proximity fuse warhead.Korea operates several Patriot batteries in and around the capital city.""Once the upgrading process for the Gangwon-based missiles is completed in 2018, the PAC-3 missiles there will be relocated to a base near Seoul,"" he said. He added that the PAC-2 missiles currently deployed at a base in the Seoul region will be shipped to Gangwon.The government plans to gradually replace all PAC-2 missiles in and around Seoul with PAC-3 Patriots by 2022. As for the non-metropolitan areas, the government does not have such an upgrade plan for PAC-2 missiles due to budget reasons, according to the ministry.""Two PAC-3 missiles fired at the same target have a 90 percent intercept rate. If most of anti-missile systems are replaced with PAC-3 missiles, the ability to deal with ballistic missiles should be improved significantly,"" the official said.Seoul has pushed to ramp up its interception system and purchase advanced missile interceptors such as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system as it seeks to build its own independent missile defense system, called the Korea Air and Missile Defense. The KAMD, a multiple-interception program, is capable of shooting down incoming missiles at an altitude of 40-50 kilometers with multiple interceptors.On July 8, Korea and the U.S. announced a decision to deploy the THAAD missile defense system in Seongju, 296 kilometers southeast of Seoul, by 2017 to better cope with ever-growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea.","missile system in seoul ,area korea will beef ,korea will beef up ,korea will beef ,defense ministry said tuesday","['Korea', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'Gangwon Province']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.67780095  1.01181245

Both Mongolian politicians were inaugurated earlier this month after their Mongolian People's Party won a landslide victory in last month's general elections. The MPP bagged 65 seats in the 76-member legislature.President Park Geun-hye  and Mongolian Prime Minister Jargaltulga Erdenebat pose for a photo before their talks in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on July 18.Mongolia has a dual executive system in place. Under the system, the president, elected by a popular vote, takes charge of defense and foreign affairs, while the prime minister, selected by the parliament, leads economic and other domestic affairs.During her meetings with the two politicians, Park took note of the fact that the bilateral relationship has deepened and widened in various areas including trade, culture and infrastructure development.Park also called on them to help establish a business environment favorable to Korean firms pushing to expand their investments in the Mongolian market. She also asked them to support the efforts to ""realize the potential of bilateral economic cooperation"" through various measures including the signing of an economic partnership agreement.During a summit between Park and Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj on Sunday, the two countries agreed to seek the EPA, similar to a free trade agreement. They have decided to launch a joint study on it as early as late this year.Touching on the issue of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, Park stressed the need for the international community to put up a united front and faithfully implement the U.N. Security Council sanctions that were imposed in response to Pyongyang's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket test the following month.In her talks with Enkhbold, Park pointed to active exchanges that the legislatures of the two nations have made, expressing hope that such exchanges would serve as a catalyst for the development of relations between South Korea and Mongolia.Enkhbold is considered a pro-South Korea politician in Mongolia. He visited Korea in 2000, 2001 and 2005, when he was mayor of Ulaanbaatar.

It will be her first visit to Mongolia since she assumed office in February 2013. Her predecessor Lee Myung-bak visited the country in 2011.President Park Geun-hye attends a summit with her Swiss counterpart Johann Schneider-Ammann at her office Cheong Wa Dae on July 13.Under the main theme, ""20 years of ASEM: Partnership for the Future through Connectivity,"" the 11th ASEM summit, slated to take place on Friday and Saturday, will bring together leaders of more than 50 Asian and European countries, the presidential office said.Among the participants are Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Park has no plans at the moment to hold a summit with Abe or Li, her aides said.Observers said that the ASEM summit will provide a venue for in-depth discussions on an array of major regional and international issues, including military threats posed by a provocative, nuclear-ambitious North Korea.The summit is also expected to touch on economic uncertainties, which were fueled by Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union.Launched in 1996, ASEM is a consultative body aimed at strengthening cooperation between Asia and Europe in political, economic, social, cultural and other areas. The summit is held biennially, with the last one held in Italy in 2014.ASEM consists of 51 member states and 2 regional organizations: the European Union and the secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. As of 2015, the grouping represents 63 percent of the world's population and 58 percent of the global gross domestic product.Starting Sunday, Park will begin her two-day official visit to the country, which was arranged on the invitation of Mongolian President Tsakhia Elbegdorj. During their summit, the leaders will discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in tackling climate change through the development of renewable energy sources and an antidesertification program, and cooperation in telemedicine and electronic governance, as well as cultural areas, officials here said.The president is also expected to call on Mongolia to support South Korean firms seeking to participate in the country's infrastructure projects, including various urban development schemes and those to expand electricity transmission networks.South Korea has touted that Mongolia with a population of 3 million is a ""promising niche"" market that offers new business opportunities for South Korea's small and medium-sized enterprises.Park will be accompanied by a large delegation of business leaders from 109 South Korean firms, mostly SMEs.South Korea is Mongolia's fourth-largest trading partner.

Under one of the MOUs, the two nations agreed to seek joint research on various ICT-related areas such as information security, the Internet of Things , big data and broadband solutions, and to support startups specializing in these areas.The MOU was signed between South Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and Switzerland's Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications.The other MOUs concern two-way cooperation in fostering exchanges among the two countries' medical professionals and those engaged in the development of new pharmaceutical products and medical devices.The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation in vocational education in line with an MOU that was signed during Park's visit to the European country in January 2014. Under the MOU, students of the Korea Tourism Senior High School here can receive vocational training at a Swiss hotel.Last year, two-way trade reached US$3.94 billion, with South Korea exporting $1.48 billion worth of ships, cars and petrochemical products to Switzerland and importing $2.45 billion worth of watches, gold and medicine from the European state.During the bilateral summit, Park also called for Switzerland's continued support for the ongoing international efforts to curb North Korea's provocations and stop its nuclear development.  Switzerland has been active in implementing U.N. sanctions against the North. It has joined global efforts to put more pressure on Pyongyang by announcing its standalone sanctions against transactions in finance, trade and other areas with the North.","summit in seoul president ,korea and switzerland agreed ,wednesday to expand bilateral ,switzerland agree to expand ,switzerland agreed wednesday","['South Korea', 'Switzerland', 'ICT', 'Seoul', 'Park Geun', 'swiss', 'Johann Schneider - Ammann']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.58321238  0.7254656

The county located some 300 km southeast of Seoul places it out of range of North Korea's long-range multiple rocket launcher systems. Beijing has opposed the THAAD deployment on South Korean soil from the outset, claiming it hurt its core security interest. South Korea and the U.S. have previously said the deployment will be wrapped up at least by the end of 2017.The afternoon decision, meanwhile, is likely to cause anger among Seongju residents who are opposed to the THAAD deployment due to health and environmental concerns.","defense ministry said wednesday ,last week south korea ,korea to announce site ,media release last week ,release last week south","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'South Korea', ""the United States '""]",28,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.68502945  0.69254285

The system consists of five components: mobile launchers, interceptor missiles, radar, a fire control unit and a battery support center.The Ministry of National Defense said that the battery will be operated in a package, dismissing a local report that the system's radar and mobile launchers would be separately placed in different areas.""When the THAAD system's components are placed nearby, the battery can be operated effectively,"" Moon said at a regular press briefing. Six mobile launchers will be put in place 400 to 500 meters away from the powerful X-band radar, the ministry earlier said.Touching on the potential location of the THAAD system, Moon said that nothing has been decided over when the allies will announce it.South Korea's defense minister Han Min-koo told lawmakers that the THAAD battery is likely to be placed in mountainous areas.""The missile system that the South Korean military is operating is located on mountainous areas. So I think that the THAAD is likely to be deployed in such areas,"" Han said during a parliamentary budget committee session.He added that Seoul will select the optimal site for the THAAD deployment in a way to ensure the safety and health of residents near the location.Residents living in areas mentioned as the potential site for THAAD have voiced strong opposition out of fear that the electromagnetic waves emanating from the radar could pose health problems.Seoul and Washington plan to announce a site for the THAAD deployment within a few weeks, which they said is aimed at countering North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats.North Korea warned Monday that it will take ""physical"" action against the two nations once a decision has been made on where to deploy the THAAD system.","28 500 american soldiers ,defense ministry said tuesday ,500 american soldiers ,deployed in south korea ,500 american soldiers are","[""South Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'south korean', 'american']",28,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.21285184  1.00985253

The meeting resumed upon his arrival in the afternoon.Na Hyang-wook, director general of Education Ministry's policy planning bureau attends a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday. “I have realized how wrong I was. It happened all because of my carelessness. I am really sorry,” he said. “It took place under the influence of alcohol and I did not intend to say such things.”A local daily had reported last week that Na described the general public as dogs and pigs at a recent dinner gathering in Seoul with reporters. He reportedly said that the government should just make sure they are fed and alive. The report also quoted him as saying that equality is nothing but an unattainable illusion and there should be a stricter class system in Korea.As the remarks prompted public outrage, the National Assembly called Na for questioning at its Education Committee. Na, who has withdrawn from his post, did not appear at first citing to his “frail mental and physical condition.The Education Minister Lee Joon-sik also apologized and vowed strong punishment over his remarks. Lee said that he plans to take stern action in accordance with the result of the investigation into the case. “There cannot be any excuse for the inappropriate remarks made by a public servant under any circumstances,” Lee said. “Education officials take this case as an opportunity to make utmost efforts to have a desirable work ethic as a public servant.”Both ruling and opposition lawmakers lashed out at Na’s remarks as well as the education minister for condoning Na’s absence, and called for his immediate expulsion.Rep. Lee Jang-woo of the ruling Saenuri Party said, “ remarks are just not acceptable. I cannot understand how a high-ranking official can make such comments. We should make it clear what punishment will be imposed on him.” Rep. Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea, called on the government to expel Na. “We cannot see a person who described the public as dogs and pigs as a public servant receiving a paycheck from taxes.” Unions also expressed concerns over his remarks in a statement. “We cannot help but be worried about the future of our education as a high-ranking official in charge of mapping out Korean education policies has old-fashioned viewpoints such as advocating the class system for the top 1 percent,” said a union for the nation’s universities. A labor union for the nation’s public servants blamed the Park Geun-hye administration’s “authoritarian ruling system,” which led to the appointment of a person with “distorted” views in a key post. “The Constitution stipulates that public servants serve the public and take responsibility for the public. Na should be expelled from the public post forever,” it said in a statement. Na, who passed his civil service examination in 1993, previously served as the secretary for the minister and an administrative officer at Cheong Wa Dae under former President Lee Myung-bak. He was promoted to the head of policy planning at the Education Ministry in March.

On Wednesday , the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted 23 officials and entities, including Kim, for their roles in the North's human rights abuses. Their assets in the U.S. will be frozen and those individuals will be banned from traveling and conducting any financial transactions there.This was the first time Washington imposed direct sanctions on the North's leader and the designation also marked the first-ever U.S. sanctions on Pyongyang over its human rights abuses.South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck speaks during a press conference at the ministry in Seoul on July 7, 2016.""The government highly praises and welcomes the step that the U.S. has taken in imposing sanctions on human rights violators in the North,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

The report said the allies are warming toward selecting Chilgok, a southeastern town where a U.S. military base is located, as the location for the deployment of THAAD.Rose is scheduled to meet with defense deputy minister for policy Yoo Jeh-seung later in the day, but their meeting will only revolve around arms control and space cooperation issues, the spokesman said. ""As far as I know, any discussion on THAAD will not take place at the venue,"" Moon said.Earlier in the day, Defense Minister Han Min-koo told lawmakers that the two countries are discussing the issue of the THAAD deployment, adding that he has yet to be briefed on the results.The allies have been negotiating the idea of deploying one THAAD battery in Korea since March to counter North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threats.The countries' joint working group kicked off their negotiations in March following the North's fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the next month, which the outside world denounced as a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missile technology.The allies are considering deploying THAAD on a space the size of an operational base, a government source said. As candidate locations, they are reviewing the suitability of about five sites, including Chilgok, Wonju and Pyeongtaek, a western coastal city where U.S. Forces Korea's new headquarters is based.Other sources said the deployment may require the South to create a new base to house the THAAD battery. ""Military effectiveness and diplomatic dimensions with China are being weighed"" as the allies are seeking to nail down a final location, the government source said, adding that ""a final decision is likely to be made soon.""","korea yet to determine ,defense ministry said tuesday ,tuesday dismissing growing media ,ministry said tuesday dismissing ,thaad defense ministry korea","['Korea', 'the United States', 'american', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Seoul']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51160032  0.60142183

The delegation arrived in Pyongyang earlier in the day after a visit to China.Present at the meeting were Ri Chang-gun, vice department director of the WPK in charge of international affairs; Sin Hong-chol, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs; Ri Kwang-gun, vice-minister of External Economic Relations; and other officials. Earlier in the day, the ruling party's Central Committee gave a reception in honor of the Cuban delegation, where core North Korean officials in charge of diplomatic affairs were present, according to a report by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.Ri Su-yong, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the WPK, said at the reception that North Korea will make positive efforts to develop the traditional relations of friendship and cooperation with the Cuban party and people.The KCNA said, ""Ri wholeheartedly wished the Cuban party and people greater successes in the drive to defend socialism, the gains of revolution, and implement the decision of the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba under the leadership of Raul Castro."" Valdes Mesa said in a speech that Cuba would develop relations with the fraternal Korean people in the future, too. North Korea and Cuba have close diplomatic ties dating back to 1960.Still, attention is focused on whether the Cuban envoy will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korea watchers in Seoul said there is a high possibility of the meeting in Pyongyang, given the fact that Valdes Mesa met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday.If Kim meets with the Cuban vice president, it will mark his first known contact with a foreign political leader since October last year when he held talks with the Communist Party of China's fifth-ranked leader, Liu Yunshan.Kim has yet to travel overseas or meet any world leaders since inheriting power from his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011.South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se visited Cuba in early June with the aim of strengthening bilateral relations following last year's normalization of ties between Washington and Havana.Last month, North Korea's Kim Yong-chol, vice chairman of the WPK Central Committee, visited Cuba and conveyed greetings and a personal letter from Kim Jong-un to Raul Castro.Earlier this month North Korean party officials visited Vietnam and Laos apparently as part of the North's diplomatic efforts to break the international sanctions over its nuclear and missile tests.Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said that North Korea has no other way but to make desperate efforts to maintain close relations with traditionally friendly countries to break from its present military and diplomatic isolation.","cuban president in pyongyang ,korea met with cuban ,held talks on tuesday ,president in pyongyang key ,envoy of cuban president","[""North Korea 's"", ""Workers ' Party"", 'cuban', 'Raul Castro', ""the North 's Central TV Station"", 'Choe Ryong - hae', ""the Central Committee of the Workers ' Party of Korea"", 'cuban', 'Salvador Valdes Mesa']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.88575345  0.16837841

If the bill passes, pharmacists will be allowed to install medicine vending machines in front of their pharmacies.The Pharmaceutical Affairs Act states in Article 50 that an owner or a seller who runs a pharmacy should not provide medicine, including over-the-counter drugs, outside the designated pharmacy or store.According to the ministry, installation of medicine vending machines would help citizens purchase general drugs anytime, even at midnight and during public holidays.General medicine such as digestive pills and nutritional supplements will be available to purchasers through medication counseling from a pharmacist, via voice call on a monitor attached to the vending machine.Vending machine permits will be given to volunteering pharmacies whose owners will be required to respond to incoming inquiries from customers even during afterhours and during holidays, the ministry explained.The ministry said the revised bill will include strict regulations such as requiring pharmacists to check the expiry dates of drugs on a regular basis and to store recordings of voice calls with purchasers for six months.The measure, however, is vehemently opposed by the industry and the opposition parties.The Korean Pharmaceutical Association said in a statement that “medicine is different from gums or soft drinks,” and a face-to-face medical checkup to provide medicine is needed to prevent possible drug abuse or misuse.The Korean Federation of Medical Activist Groups for Health Rights also argued that installation of medicine vending machines may have unwanted consequences due to insufficient information on the exact dosage and purpose of the medicine.The main opposition The Minjoo Party also viewed the plan as “dangerous” with a high risk of the machines malfunctioning or the medicines spoiling.

""We didn't know any information about China's implementation report Friday when the National Assembly's foreign affairs and unification committee was held,"" Cho June-hyuck, spokesperson of the ministry, told a regular briefing. He, however, did not confirm whether it has actually been filed.What is contained in the latest report has yet to be disclosed. It is unclear whether the report will be disclosed since it cannot be made public if the submitting country does not want to reveal its contents.China has shown its commitment to working with global efforts to put pressure on the North. In mid-June, China's commerce ministry announced a decision to add about 40 items to the list of items banned for export to the communist neighbor. The ministry said the decision was part of efforts to implement the latest U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution.With Beijing submitting its implementation report, four of the five veto-wielding permanent member countries of the UNSC -- the U.S., Russia and Britain -- have turned in their action plans. It has yet to be confirmed if France forwarded its plan. Sources said that a total of 35 countries have turned in their implementation reports, including South Korea. Earlier this month, the Seoul government compiled its report in which it vowed to ""continue to contribute to international efforts to strengthen the global nonproliferation regime.""Meanwhile, the permanent missions to the U.N. of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan plan to hold an international conference this week to provide a chance to share views on the latest resolution slapped on the North, according to a diplomatic source. During the conference to be held on Thursday at U.N. headquarters in New York, participants mostly from other permanent missions to the U.N. along with experts in the academia and business sectors are expected to discuss the effects, challenges and cooperative issues in carrying out Resolution 2270. The conference is apparently aimed at reminding member countries of the importance of implementing the resolution in reining in the North's nuclear and missile provocations, the source said.","government source said tuesday ,sanctions against korea china ,china submits implementation plan ,punish pyongyang for conducting ,korea china has submitted","['China', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Yonhap News Agency']",28,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.74172676  0.71016413

""This showed  will to focus more on bilateral relations and the North Korean nuclear issue.""Russia and China have strongly opposed the possible deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea, claiming it would undermine the strategic balance in the region. Seoul and Washington insist the missile defense system, if placed in the South, would be purely defensive in the face of North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats.The official highlighted the effort Moscow made to ensure the success of Monday's talks.""Because Russia is placing more importance on Asia, it has begun to give more attention to South Korea, and the expression it's begun to use recently is that South Korea is a key partner in Russia's foreign policy,"" he said.Analysts say Russia is increasingly looking east for new business opportunities amid an economic crisis caused by low global oil prices and international sanctions against the country.As both China and Japan are seen as rivals in terms of geopolitics or territory, South Korea could be an optimum partner for Russia with all the necessary technology and resources but almost no source of tension between the two sides.In a speech at a conference of the Korea-Russia Dialogue forum Tuesday, Yun said Lavrov agreed with him on the large potential for bilateral cooperation in developing Russia's Far East region.He also noted the similarity between Russia's new ""Look East""policy, which centers on developing the Far East, and South Korea's Eurasia Initiative, which aims to draw countries in Asia and Europe closer by increasing rail, infrastructure and IT links.Yun was the first South Korean foreign minister to visit Russia in five years. His three-day trip included talks with Lavrov in Moscow on Monday and various events in St. Petersburg on Tuesday.The visit was seen as part of Seoul's efforts to strengthen the international sanctions regime against Pyongyang following its fourth nuclear test and its long-range rocket launch early this year.""In the past, Russia was very careful about mentioning North Korea,"" the official pointed out during the luncheon. ""They disliked criticizing the North even more and never used the word 'condemn' .""However, in a press conference following Monday's talks, the two ministers said they agreed not to recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state and to strengthen their cooperation for the North's denuclearization.""Russia has changed a lot in that it's showing its strength regarding the North Korea issue,"" the official said.Moscow is a key stakeholder in efforts to dismantle the North's nuclear weapons program. It is one of five veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which adopted a resolution in March imposing the toughest yet sanctions on Pyongyang, and a member of the now-stalled six-party talks on the North's nuclear program.Before leaving, Yun visited a cemetery where he laid a wreath in front of a monument honoring Lee Beom-jin, Korea's diplomatic representative to the Russian Empire in the early 1900s. Lee fought for Korea's sovereignty in the face of Japanese aggression but killed himself at his St. Petersburg home in 1911 in protest of Japan's annexation of Korea.The foreign minister also toured a Hyundai Motor plant located northwest of the city, the only foreign-owned car plant in Russia that handles the entire production process from parts manufacturing to assembly.The South Korean automaker has expanded its presence in the Russian car market since it began local production in 2011. Last year, its share reached 20 percent of new cars.The 200 hectare plant produces some 200,000 cars annually for sale in and outside the country and employs more than 7,000 locals.From Russia, Yun headed to Bulgaria, where he held talks with his Bulgarian counterpart Daniel Mitov on Wednesday.","korean reporters during luncheon ,korea russia talks official ,reporters during luncheon ,luncheon in st petersburg ,told south korean reporters","['South Korea', 'Russia', 'U.S.', 'korean', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'St. Petersburg', 'the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'south Korean']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.52863979  0.70294333

Kim Hong-kyun, South Korea's Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs, made the remarks after holding talks with Wu Dawei earlier in the day, during which the Chinese official briefed Kim on last week's visit by a top North Korean official, Ri Su-yong, to Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping met Ri in an apparent bid to mend political ties that were strained by North Korea's nuclear weapons ambition. Citing a conversation with Wu, Kim said, ""When Ri Su-yong visited China, the Chinese side made clear its stance on the Korean Peninsula, including denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" Wu also told Kim that China is committed to fully enforcing U.N. sanctions against North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. ""The Chinese side voiced its strong opposition to North Korea's additional provocations, including more nuclear and missile tests,"" Kim said.North Korea has been slapped with tougher U.N. sanctions following its fourth nuclear test in January.Wrapping up high-level talks with Chinese counterparts on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Beijing that China is determined to ""fully enforce"" U.N. sanctions against North Korea. The meeting between Kim and Wu comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency warned earlier this week that North Korea appears to have restarted its main nuclear bomb fuel plant. If the warning by the IAEA is correct, it would be the latest move by North Korea in expanding its nuclear weapons program, despite tightened international sanctions. Kim said South Korea and the U.S. are closely monitoring the warning by the IAEA on North Korea's nuclear activities with ""grave concern."" However, there was no discussion about the apparent restart of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to produce plutonium at the Yongbyon nuclear complex during Wednesday's talks with Wu, Kim said.","korean delegation last week ,said wednesday after meeting ,nuclear envoy said wednesday ,china told north korean ,wednesday after meeting with","['China', 'north korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'chinese', 'Kim Hong - kyun', ""South Korea 's"", 'Security Affairs', 'Wu Dawei', 'chinese']",28,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.7002303   0.72326261

They claim that there are many safety concerns about the technology, such as risks associated with Internet connection problems, a risk of data leakages and misdiagnosis. As a result, the bill was scrapped during the 19th National Assembly.A participant speaks during a gathering of physicians at the Korean Medical Association building in Ichon-dong Seoul, which was organized to discuss ways to prevent the government’s pursuit to legalize telemedicine and allow traditional medical doctors to use modern medical equipment. YonhapCurrently, telemedicine is only allowed between health care professionals. For example, a pharmacist who works in a remote region is able to consult a doctor who works in a general hospital in the city should he or she need the guidance. However, all doctors are prohibited from treating or diagnosing patients at a distance.The revised bill allows telemedicine between health care professionals and patients with specific medical, social or geographical conditions. To be eligible for telemedicine care, a patient must have chronic illnesses, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, or mental illness. Elderly patients with impaired mobility and individuals with physical disabilities would also be eligible. Residents of remote areas that do not have medical facilities, as well as patients in the military or prison, would also be allowed to be treated via telemedicine. Patients who have recently undergone a surgical procedure and are in need of postsurgery medical attention at home would be eligible for the treatment as well.In the case of medical accidents or misdiagnosis, doctors would be only responsible for damages once it is proven that the telecommunications device did not have a technical failure and their patients followed their guidance and instructions. The Health Ministry stressed that according to their own studies, patients with chronic illnesses were highly satisfied with telemedicine services. From September 2014 to March 2015, the ministry ran a pilot program for telemedicine services for some 845 patients. The largest proportion of them, 68.6 percent, were those with high blood pressure, and almost 40 percent of all patients were those in their 60s. A government survey showed that 76.9 percent of all participants were satisfied with the service. To ensure patients’ safety, the Health Ministry said no medical institution would be allowed to offer telemedicine services only. All institutions that offer telemedicine services will be required to offer in-person treatments at the same time, they added. Also, all patients who receive telemedicine services would be required to visit their physicians in person regularly. Still, Kim Joo-hyun, the spokesman of KMA, said the ministry should cancel its proposal altogether. He pointed out that the government’s pilot program was done “behind closed doors” and that it did not share its process with the nation’s physicians. “We still believe that telemedicine should be done between medical professionals only,” he told The Korea Herald. “Unless the government makes all documents related to the pilot program public, we don’t think we have enough proof that this proposal is going to be safe for all patients nationwide.”By Claire Lee","legalize telemedicine south korea ,health ministry on monday ,telemedicine south korea health ,pushes again to legalize ,ministry on monday announced","['South Korea ’s', 'Health Ministry']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35995182  0.71999508

Park has 1 1/2 years left in his second term.During a press briefing Tuesday, Park said that safety measures discussed in the past had mostly not considered the real conditions at work sites and had been “empty talk.”He added, “I will stop blaming the past and continue to think about how to build a safe system with thorough investigation.” Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon speaks during a press conference on Tuesday. The conference was held following the death of a 19-year-old subway mechanic on May 28 while repairing a screen door at a Seoul subway station. The death had sparked outcry against the “unfair” treatment of irregular workers.Despite Mayor Park’s promise to amend the situation, public criticism continued and news reports accused Seoul Metro, operator of the subway lines, of a bureaucratic operation with executive members who were closely associated with Park. More than 40 percent of employees at Eunsung PSD, a company that had been subcontracted by subway operator Seoul Metro for screen door maintenance, were found to be the former staff of Seoul Metro. Kim was hired as a subcontractor for Ensung PSD.According to a payroll sheet by Eunsung PSD in 2015, a total of 38 former Seoul Metro staff had received an extra 90 million won in “welfare costs.”The revelation has sparked heated debate over the current operation of the city subway lines and even led to the coining of the word “Mefia,” -- a combination of “Metro” and “mafia.”Following the fatal accident, about 180 executive officials of Seoul Metro on Sunday turned in their resignations.But the public still voiced concern over whether the organizational reshuffle of the company would fundamentally resolve the deep-rooted personnel practice and unfair working environment of employees at subcontracted companies. Others also called it mending the gate after the horse has bolted, pointing out that Kim’s death was the third fatal accident of its kind to occur since 2013. Faced with criticism toward the revolving-door employment system that secures stable positions for retired city officials while neglecting the working environment of less well-paid workers, Mayor Park said during Tuesday’s briefing that he would immediately delete the contract clauses which give Seoul Metro staff an advantage in being hired at subcontractor companies. The city will also run a direct company that handles the subway safety management system, he added.Park, who has often been dubbed as the likely presidential candidate for the opposition, has continuously underlined that he has a deep belief in the value of communication. “Communication is the greatest infrastructure,” he said. He has also been an adroit user of social media, such as by airing the one-person media broadcast “Won-soon’s X-file” every Thursday night. He said that it was to communicate better with citizens regarding sensitive issues in Seoul. As a popular politician among the liberals, Park’s status as the mayor of the country’s capital has been considered a sure ticket to gaining his presidential candidacy in the upcoming presidential race.“Recent incidents surely caused damage to Mayor Park’s political move, but it was something that Korea’s entire political circle should feel responsible for. That’s why Mayor Park needs to take the bull by the horns, by himself,” Youn Tae-gon, a political analyst told The Korea Herald. “Park will be able to come up with an answer by having more talks with media and citizens and he should resolve the issue in a calm manner,” he added. According to a poll on some 3,000 adults here released by Real Meter on Sunday, Park held an approval rating of 6.7 percent, a 1.2 percentage point fall compared to the previous week. He particularly suffered a decline in ratings among young respondents within the past week, with an about 3.7 percentage point fall among those in their 20s and a 3.3 percentage point fall among those in their 30s. It is not Mayor Park’s first time at the center of social conflicts. Another of them is a dispute with parents and civic group members of children with development disabilities who claim he has been ignoring their calls to talk. Parents and members of the Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities have been staging an all-night sit-in protest at the back gate of Seoul city hall since May 4. They have been urging Seoul City to accept their proposals to support housing facilities for those with developmental disabilities and a pension plan. Over the last month, the main entrances to the city hall have been ordered to be blocked to deter civic group members from entering the building.Last Friday, Park eventually made an appearance at the back gate for a two-hour long conversation. He reportedly recommended that protesters join the city-run task force and resolve the situation through talk.Seoul City explained that it was difficult for the city to accept the group’s proposals. It added that supporting their proposal requires a lot of funding as well as in-depth discussion with the central government.Park has also been mired in an issue with residents and redevelopment association members of the Okbaraji Golmok in Jongno, where most of the buildings in the alley have been demolished for the redevelopment project.The alley was approved for redevelopment by Seoul Metropolitan Government in July 2015 after it was designated as a redevelopment zone in 2006, citing it as “suitable for redevelopment considering the area’s poor infrastructure and the age of the buildings.”Some of the residents and civic groups have been resisting the demolition citing the site’s historical value of having been the temporary home of activists that had fought for independence in the 1930s.Park visited the site three weeks ago after a physical dispute on May 17 between the resisting residents and a gang trying to vacate Gubonjang, one of the remaining buildings.“Even if it costs me a compensation suit, I will block  by all means,” Park had said. While Seoul City has vowed to eradicate forced evacuations in the city’s development projects since 2013, there are no ordinances to protect residents who are evacuated from their own homes in the course of redevelopment, nor can the mayor stop the demolition. Some viewed Mayor Park’s actions to stop the forcible removal as belated.While the demolition of the remaining houses has been halted since then, Mayor Park proposed to have marathon talks with those involved to seek a solution. But it is undecided whether the discussion will be held due to protesters opposing the participation of the builder and the redevelopment association. Meanwhile, Seoul City announced Tuesday that it would speed up the follow-up investigation into the subway platform accident on May 28 by forming a committee comprised of city officials, Seoul Metro officials and experts. Kim Ji-hyoung, a former justice of the Supreme Court will head the committee and complete the fact-finding process by July.“I will look for various methods to resolve the situation and for the better working environments of young workers, part-time workers and subcontractor workers,” said Park at a press briefing.“I will move on with a new attitude, disposing old habits and starting from the beginning, thinking that 1 percent in safety means 100 percent safety,” added Park.

The visit to Cuba by the top diplomat is noteworthy because Cuba has close ties with North Korea.","monday after visiting vietnam ,state media said tuesday ,party officials visit vietnam ,media said tuesday ,media said tuesday apparently","['north korean', 'Vietnam', 'Laos', 'Choe Thae - bok', 'Vientiane', 'Vietnam']",28,"[ 0.          2.          0.         ... -0.39268759  0.71133244

But the focus of his two-day stay was widely expected to be on relations between South Korea and Cuba, which have yet to establish formal diplomatic ties. Yun is the first South Korean foreign minister to visit Cuba.   At the Palacio de Convenciones, the South Korean minister met with his Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez, behind closed doors for what was scheduled to be a 30-minute meeting. The talks lasted an hour and 15 minutes.""For an exceptionally long 75 minutes, our talks were very friendly, serious and candid,"" Yun told South Korean reporters after the meeting. ""We had a broad exchange of views on bilateral, regional and global issues.""   The minister stopped short of mentioning a normalization of ties, but he was optimistic about the future.   ""I expect there to be follow-up talks at various levels under a vision for the future,"" he said. ""Our government plans to put in a lot of effort with that vision and an improvement in bilateral ties in mind.""   Cuba formally recognized South Korea in 1949, shortly after its independence from Japanese colonial rule, but their bilateral relations had effectively been cut off since Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959. The country has formed a close alliance with communist North Korea.   The United States' normalization of ties with Cuba last year led to expectations that South Korea, a U.S. ally, could also establish diplomatic relations with the island nation. South Korean officials, however, have guarded against such optimism, noting the strength of the Cuba-North Korea alliance that began with the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 1960.   Yun's visit to Havana came as South Korea has been forging stronger ties with countries that have traditionally had close relations with North Korea, such as Uganda and Iran.   ""I stressed the point that even though our bilateral ties are developing smoothly in various fields, it is time to focus more on the potential our two countries have,"" Seoul's top diplomat said.""I delivered the various thoughts we have in order to go in that direction.""   He added that he felt a closeness developing between the two sides in the courtesy shown by the Cuban government during his attendance at the ACS summit and the extra time set aside for the talks.   South Korea is not among the 25 member nations of the ACS, but it has joined the group's gatherings as an observer country since 1998.   Yun told Rodriguez that South Korea is actively studying ways to contribute to Cuba's efforts to tackle the harmful effects of climate change on the region, according to a statement released by Seoul's foreign ministry.   Rodriguez thanked Yun for his comments, saying he has high expectations of working with South Korea on the issues of climate change and sustainable development, some of the top items on this year's summit agenda.   Before wrapping up his trip, Yun met with ethnic Koreans in Cuba at a culture center set up in 2014 with the South Korean government's help.   According to the ministry, there are currently 1,104 ethnic Koreans who have descended from the first generation of Korean migrants who moved from Mexico to Cuba in 1921 to work in sugar cane fields.   This year marks 95 years since the first Korean migrants settled in Cuba.   Yun encouraged the leaders of the ethnic Korean community and spoke highly of the contributions their forefathers made to Korea's struggle for independence from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. He also lauded the Korean community's efforts to preserve their ethnic identity.   Among the attendees was the son of the first Korean community leader, Lim Cheon-taik, who had raised funds for his country's independence movement and fought for the rights of his compatriots in Cuba.   The South Korean government conferred an order on Lim in 1997 and buried his remains at a national cemetery in 2004.","havana sunday breaking decades ,south korean foreign minister ,talks in havana sunday ,in havana sunday breaking ,korea cuba hold first","['South Korea', 'Cuba', 'Havana', 'south korean', 'Yun Byung - se', 'cuban', 'the Association of Caribbean States', 'South Korea', 'Cuba']",28,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.7288416   0.67389297

The message was exchanged during a meeting in Beijing between Chinese President Xi Jinping and a visiting high-level North Korean delegation, led by Ri Su-yong, vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party's central committee, according to a report by China's official Xinhua news agency.  Chinese President Xi Jinping  and vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party`s central committee Ri Su-yong hold a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday. At the meeting, Ri conveyed Kim's message to Xi, the report said. In the message, Kim said North Korea ""hopes to work together with the Chinese side, to strengthen and develop the traditionally friendly relations and maintain regional peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia."" Xi said China ""attaches great importance"" to its bilateral ties with North Korea and Beijing is willing to work with Pyongyang to ""reinforce and develop"" bilateral relations, according to the report. Without mentioning North Korea by name, Xi urged ""all parties to remain calm and exercise restraint"" on the Korean Peninsula. The Xinhua report, however, made no mention of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.The meeting in the Chinese capital marks the first time in about three years that Xi has met senior North Korean officials as their political ties remain cool over the North's nuclear ambitions that are seen as hurting Beijing national interests. Ri arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a three-day visit. China is North Korea's diplomatic backer and economic lifeline, but it has expressed public displeasure over the North's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons program. Still, few analysts believe that China would put enough pressure on the North to abandon its nuclear program out of fear that a collapse of the Pyongyang regime could spark instability in China's northeastern regions. North Korea was hit by tougher U.N. sanctions in March following its fourth nuclear test in January and launch of a long-range rocket in February. On Tuesday, Ri held talks with Song Tao, minister of the International Department of the Chinese Communist Party. In a brief statement on the Tuesday talks, the Chinese Communist Party stopped short of saying that Ri and Song discussed North Korea's nuclear program. However, North Korea's official media reported on Wednesday that Ri told Song that the North will not give up its policy of simultaneously pursuing both economic development and nuclear development.During a regular press briefing on Wednesday, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying was asked about the remarks by Ri on North Korea's nuclear policy. Hua sidestepped the question and repeated China's stance on North Korea's nuclear issue. ""We stay committed to promoting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, peace and stability of the peninsula as well as a proper settlement of relevant issues through dialogue and consultation,"" Hua said. ""We believe that sound relationship between the two countries is conducive to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" Hua said.","during meeting in beijing ,mend ties north korean ,korea china voice hope ,beijing between chinese president ,ties north korean leader","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'north korean']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63065845  0.37125358

Chung Jin-suk, the floor leader of the Saenuri Party said.April's election results are fueling confusion over which party should take the speaker's chair, which is traditionally taken by the ruling party and largest player in the parliament.The Saenuri Party failed to become the largest player despite its ruling party status, with its seats falling one shy of that held by the major opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. But it claims, citing past precedence, that the ruling party should still be given priority.""It is only the Minjoo's opinion that it should take the National Assembly speaker seat just by having one more lawmaker,"" Chung added. Others in Saenuri said that while it is not written policy, the ruling party has almost always taken the speaker's position unless the opposition held an overwhelming majority.Although a National Assembly speaker must secede from the party upon appointment, the ruling and opposition have been wrangling over the top seat in parliament. The Minjoo demands it should take the position as it is currently the biggest player in the National Assembly.Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the Minjoo Party, said it cannot conduct ""normal negotiation"" due to the ruling party's stance.The Minjoo Party became No. 1 at the 20th National Assembly with 123 lawmakers, although it could become the No. 2 at anytime if independents join the ruling Saenuri Party, which holds 122 seats. Chung, however, said such factors are not matters of concern for the formation of parliamentary committees, which also must be negotiated alongside the positions of speaker and the two vice speakers.

Kenyatta condemned North Korea’s provocative acts that could heighten tensions in the region and urged North Korea to halt provocations. He also said Kenya will take necessary steps to faithfully implement the U.N. sanctions.Park also said implementation of the U.N. sanctions is critical in creating conditions under which Pyongyang has no choice but to abandon its nuclear program.The comments at the summit on Tuesday came hours after North Korea’s latest attempt to launch an intermediate-range ballistic missile ended in failure.The missile launch is widely seen as North Korea’s latest defiance against U.N. sanctions. North Korea is banned from launching ballistic missiles under U.N. resolutions. The summit -- the first between the leaders of the two countries in 34 years -- came as Seoul is reaching out to Africa to explore business opportunities on the continent that has huge growth potential.The two leaders shared personal affinity as the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1964 when Park’s late father, Park Chung-hee, and Kenyatta’s late father, Jomo Kenyatta, were both in power.Park proposed that South Korea and Kenya develop a mutually beneficial partnership, saying Seoul’s experience of successful economic development can make it a good partner of East Africa’s largest economy.Kenya is pushing for massive infrastructure projects, including power plants, roads, ports and railways under its development blueprint. Kenyatta called for strengthened bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, saying there is “no better model than South Korea” for Kenya’s economic development.South Korea has become a donor country from a key recipient of U.N. aid in half a century, a transformation that has inspired many developing nations to follow in the footsteps of the Asian country in advancing their economies.Kenya’s central bank governor has said his country’s economy could grow by 6 percent this year. This number will allow Kenya to have the fifth fastest growth rate on the continent.Kenya -- the world's eighth-largest geothermal producer -- is seeking to expand its geothermal power capacity to 5,500 MW by 2031, from the current 598 MW. Geothermal energy accounts for 26 percent of Kenya’s total electricity production.A consortium -- which is composed of South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering and Japan’s Toshiba -- built two geothermal power plants in 2014 that can generate 280 MW power.Hyundai Engineering is pushing to secure a US$4.3 billion project to build three more geothermal power plants in Kenya. The bidding is set to begin later this year.Nairobi is seeking to diversify its energy source by building nuclear power plants by 2033 that have 4,000 MW generation capacity.Park told Kenyatta that she expects South Korean companies to participate in Kenya’s project to build nuclear power plants, citing Seoul’s track record of running 24 nuclear reactors and of building four reactors in the United Arab Emirates.After the summit, Park and Kenyatta watched as their representatives signed several memorandums of understanding in such areas such as nuclear power, science, health and education and information and communications technology.Kenyatta also expressed hope that the two countries can deepen and strengthen cooperation in energy and nuclear power.The MOUs also call for, among other things, bilateral cooperation in building a pilot industrial zone for South Korean companies on about 800,000 square meters of land.The pilot zone, if built, could serve as a starting point for South Korean companies in making further forays into U.S. and other African markets. Textile goods produced in Kenya can be shipped to the United States without tariffs under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a U.S. trade preference program for Africa.Kenyatta asked Park to cooperate in setting up a science and technology university and running a training program, which is modeled on Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.Park said she will make efforts to ensure South Korea’s relevant bodies can cooperate with Kenya.South Korea “will be with Kenya in the process of its development as a friend and partner of Kenya,” Park said in a luncheon meeting with Kenyatta.Also Tuesday, Park launched a pilot program of South Korea’s new aid program for Kenyans.The ""Korea Aid”program is designed to provide mobile health care and nutritional support to local people in medically underserved regions by using 10 vehicles, including ambulances. The program also allows local people to experience South Korean culture.She also watched a cultural performance that featured a demonstration of the traditional Korean martial art of taekwondo and N.Flying, a South Korean rock band.Kenya is the third leg of her trip that also took her to Ethiopia and Uganda. Park is set to leave for France for a state visit on Wednesday.","kenya president condemns korea ,president condemns korea provocations ,kenyatta condemned north korea ,president condemns korea ,condemned north korea provocative","['kenyan', 'Uhuru Kenyatta', 'North Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'U.N.', 'Kenyatta', 'North Korea ’s']",28,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -1.00204289  0.37864655

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked South Koreans Monday to refrain from speculating about whether he will run for president next year, saying the meaning of his six-day stay in the country has been exaggerated.South Korea's former foreign minister said in a press conference after the U.N. Department of Public Information Non-Governmental Organization Conference in Gyeongju, 371 kilometers southeast of Seoul, that talks with senior reporters last Wednesday were a closed door affair and that what he said was blown out of proportion.""My remarks were somewhat exaggerated and blown up, which baffles me,"" he commented.On his first day here, he told reporters on the southern resort island of Jeju that he would contemplate his future as a South Korean citizen upon completing his two terms as U.N. chief at the end of this year. He also offered his vision for a political leader as someone who is willing to give up everything for national unity.South Korea's next presidential election is slated for December 2017.On Monday, however, Ban said there should be no misunderstanding about his activities here.""The purpose of my visit was unrelated to any personal purpose or political move. I came strictly to take part in and oversee international events as the U.N. secretary-general,"" Ban said.He added that he still has seven months to go before his second five-year term as secretary-general comes to an end.""I will do my best to successfully finish my term,"" he said, asking the South Korean public to help him achieve that goal.On future prospects, he pointed out that speculating on what he will do is useless.""The press has written many speculative stories about my future actions, but only I know what I plan to do,"" he said, making clear he will make the decisions in due course.Ban's latest trip home, meanwhile, caused more people to think of him as a strong presidential contender, especially in the wake of the ruling Saenuri Party's crushing defeat in April's parliamentary elections.The U.N. chief has never said he will not run for president.A survey conducted by the vernacular daily JoongAng Ilbo showed that 40.2 percent of conservatives and 25.4 percent of moderates supported Ban as the next president, making him the most popular of the existing contenders. The poll, conducted between Friday and Saturday on 1,000 adults nationwide, had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points with a 95 percent confidence level.Ban's itinerary fueled speculation over his motives as it covered a wide area of the country with clear resemblances to a presidential campaign trail. From Jeju, the U.N. chief traveled to Japan to attend a G7 summit before returning home to Seoul. He then went to Goyang, just outside the capital, and also visited the southeastern cities of Andong and Gyeongju.The final two stops were especially viewed with suspicion as they are located in the ruling party stronghold of Gyeongsang.Throughout his trip, Ban also had frequent meetings and encounters with Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, North Gyeongsang Governor Kim Kwan-yong, Saenuri floor leader Chung Jin-suk and other politicians.On a train from Gyeongju to Incheon, where Ban is to board a flight back to New York later in the day, the secretary-general's spokesman repeated Ban's words.""He said, 'don't listen to what other people are saying, don't listen to the speculation,'"" Stephane Dujarric told Yonhap News Agency.""'Only I know what I'm going to say and what I'm going to do, and I will decide my future after I finish as secretary-general.'His focus right now is just on being the secretary-general.""","asked south koreans monday ,koreans monday to refrain ,run for president next ,korea former foreign minister ,south koreans monday to","['U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Koreans', ""South Korea 's"", 'the U.N.

While a bill of a similar nature was first filed with the National Assembly in November 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, there had been no significant progress until this year. The delay came amid concern over privacy breaches, such as allowing South Korea's top intelligence agency to collect personal data on anyone suspected of posing a threat to national security.Critics have argued the law infringes on the public's right for privacy.In addition to the anti-terrorism law, the Cabinet approved a law that obligates carmakers to report any problems with gas emissions to the Ministry of Environment. The measures are in response to Volkswagen and other auto manufacturers faked emissions tests that hurt consumer confidence.Meanwhile, the controversial bill that will enable parliament to open hearings more often was not tabled at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, with government and ruling party insiders suggesting it may be vetoed by President Park after she returns from her trip to Africa and France.","korea cabinet on tuesday ,cabinet on tuesday approved ,terrorism bill korea cabinet ,cabinet passes anti terrorism ,on tuesday approved package","['Korea', 'Cabinet', 'Cabinet', 'Yoo Il - ho', 'the National Intelligence Service']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25000808  0.15530673

The news wire did not date the latest visit, but it was Kim's first public appearance since the WPK's four-day congress that ended on Monday. Kim was appointed to the chairmanship at the congress as he further tightened his hereditary power over the country. He has been running the country since late 2011 after the sudden death of his father Kim Jong-il. The party's top echelon accompanied Kim to the exhibition, including Hwang Pyong-so, Pak Pong-ju and Choe Ryong-hae, all members of the standing committee of the party's politburo. Kim expressed ""great satisfaction"" and said it is ""a great success"" after viewing new types of tractors, trucks and cargo ships on display, according to the KCNA. The leader noted that the products ""proved once again that self-development is the best and self-reliance and self-development are the way for us to live. He also called for the eradication of imports, the KCNA said.

The country's outbound shipments to Africa accounted for just 1.4 percent of its total exports last year, according to government data.The chief executive is set to meet with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn during her trip to Addis Ababa from May 25 to 28 before holding two separate talks with Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.In Ethiopia, Park is also scheduled to deliver a speech at the headquarters of the African Union and meet with African Union Commission chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Cheong Wa Dae said.Park also plans to attend ceremonies for South Korea's official development assistance  programs in the three African countries. The Korea Aid program is designed to provide health service, food and cultural contents to local people.South Korea -- which has become the first former aid recipient to join the ranks of official donors in a half-century -- has so far concentrated its aid on Asia, but has recently expanded its assistance to African nations.Seoul has earmarked 2.43 trillion won  for its 2016 ODA budget to be used on some 1,230 overseas aid projects.The trip is expected to assist economic and social development of the three African countries and pave the way for South Korean companies to make inroads into their markets, the presidential office added.The latest tour is also set to take Park to France for a state visit on the occasion of the 130th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries.Park is set to meet with her French counterpart Francois Hollande to discuss a wide-range of issues, including economy and culture, as well as North Korea’s nuclear program and other global issues.Last year, Park visited Paris to attend the U.N. climate change summit.","this month president park ,presidential office said thursday ,month president park geun ,day four nation trip ,later this month president","['Park Geun', 'Ethiopia', 'France', ""South Korea 's"", 'Uganda', 'Kenya', 'South Korea']",28,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.78779906  0.76381934

Seoul hopes the MOUs pave the way for South Korean companies to eventually win massive infrastructure projects under way in Iran.Tensions persisted on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's possible provocations amid its rare congress of the ruling Workers' Party.Park's job approval rating plunged to 31 percent in the fourth week of last month following an election rout by her ruling Saenuri Party in mid-April.

South Korean experts and government officials say the comment hints at the softened attitude of Kim, who has stepped up nuclear and missile threats against Seoul and Washington, but by no means implies its intent to take actual steps toward its own denuclearization as demanded by the allies.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un speaks during the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's Congress in this photo distributed by communist state's Korea Central News Agency on Saturday. According to the Korea Central News Agency, Kim claimed that his country had become a nuclear state by conducting its first hydrogen bomb in Jan. 6, which most experts along with Seoul and Washington’s government officials have said is highly unlikely to be true.“As a responsible nuclear state, our republic  will not preemptively use a nuclear weapon unless hostile forces attempt to infringe upon our autonomy with nukes. We will carry out our obligation of nuclear non-proliferation for the international society, and work toward realizing denuclearization of the world,” he said during the second day of the congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. The event is expected to last for up to four days, with the party unveiling its future goals and naming Kim to the highest-ranked position in the party.  As Kim’s father and former leader Kim Jong-il holds the position of “eternal general secretary,” there are expectations that Kim will be named to a newly-created position.In addition, he said that military officials of the Koreas should hold talks and negotiations to “address mistrust and misunderstanding” between each other, once again urging the U.S. not to intervene in peninsular affairs.The North is currently under U.N.-led sanctions, intended as punitive actions against its January nuclear test and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch which violated previous U.N. resolution banning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. While this marks the first time the North leader has mentioned denuclearization at all, government officials have said that such remarks do not indicate that the communist will abandon its nuclear programs.“Not much has changed, since Kim said that the North’s actions will be ‘as a nuclear state.’ It just means that he wants to reaffirm his country’s status as a self-proclaimed nuclear state,” said a high-ranking South Korean military official.During his WPK speech, Kim said that developing nuclear weapons in parallel with boosting its economy -- which Pyongyang adopted as its official strategic goal in 2013 -- is now its permanent objective.Contrary to the North’s claim of having a nuclear strike capacity, it has yet to demonstrate its ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount onto a ballistic missile. Its botched launches of the intermediate-range Musudan missile last month puts the country’s nuclear strike capacity further in doubt. The official added that the military cannot consider Kim’s offer of talks, as the government’s stance right now is that the North giving up its nuclear programs should prelude recommencing negotiations.“Unless North Korea takes some additional, meaningful actions -- such as ceasing production of nuclear materials --  cannot be regarded as having a legitimate intent to resolve nuclear issues in the peninsula, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. The professor pointed out that the WPK’s reports on its future plans did not have any mention of such actions, saying Kim’s comments were largely “symbolic.” While Kim’s comments were “nothing new,” University of North Korean Studies professor Yang Moo-jin said that it showed Kim’s willingness to talk.North Korea threatened in late March to strike South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye as a response to Seoul and Washington’s annual joint military drills that concluded on April 30. South Korean military said last month that the North was seen preparing an attack simulation on a model of Cheong Wae Dae last month. Yang pointed out that the North had refrained from carrying out another nuclear test ahead of the WPK congress, as widely predicted by local experts and government officials.“There are two countries that can stop the North’s nuclear test: China and the U.S. China has sent a strong message toward Pyongyang , and U.S. director of national intelligence  Clapper is said to have mentioned peace talks,” he said.Local media reported that James Clapper, the DNI director, had asked South Korean government officials what conditions they would accept if the U.S. started to discuss peace talks with Pyongyang. Government officials refused to confirm the report.“Both the U.S. and China influenced  not to conduct  nuclear tests, and as an extension , Kim is now sending a relatively peaceful message,” Yang said.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at a local think-tank Sejong Institute, suggested that Kim’s mention of inter-Korea talks and improving relations is not directed toward Park, but the next administration. Park has retained her hawkish approach toward the North, repeatedly mentioning the fall of Kim regime’s downfall in public speeches.“The WPK’s policies and directions are announced with the next five to 10 years in mind, which leads me to believe that the prospects of improving relations with the next  leadership is factored in Kim’s statement,” Cheong said. “South Korea’s general election that took place right before the WPK congress, saw the opposition -- which is more positive toward inter-Korea talks -- taking an overwhelming victory. This may have led Kim to demonstrate a relatively softer attitude toward the South.”Observers have said that Kim’s seemingly softer remarks may reflect his will to find an exit strategy amid the powerful economic sanctions. Defense Minister Han Min-koo, in a report to the parliamentary defense committee last week, said that the international sanctions and preparations for the WPK congress has driven up complaints from  North Korean citizens, leading to an increase in defection and robbery. Experts say it is unlikely for the hermit kingdom to conduct another nuclear test any time soon, But Kim Yong-hyun of Dongguk University said that there is a possibility that the North may test-launch another ballistic missile before the incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama completes his term in January 2017.By Yoon Min-sik","korean leader reaffirms nuke ,north korean leader reaffirms ,sunday south korean experts ,missile threats against seoul ,talks north korean leader","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'south korean', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Washington']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64369577  0.46636778

The first veered off course and crashed into the coastal area and the other one reportedly exploded in midair.The botched launches came despite the North's first Musudan also ended in catastrophic failure earlier in the month. On the high-profile national anniversary of founding father Kim Il-sung's birthday on April 15, the reclusive country attempted its first test-launch of the IRBM, but the projectile blew up only seconds into its flight.The military said the second missile launched by North Korea on Thursday did manage to go up several kilometers, staying in the air for about a minute before exploding. Experts have said the string of failed launches may give North Korea greater incentive to conduct a nuclear test in the run-up to the country's rare congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, in order to save face. ""It is highly likely that North Korea would venture a nuclear test in the short run, with that in mind, the military is maintaining heightened surveillance and readiness,"" he said.

Presiding over the National Security Council, Park also ordered a regular meeting against the North’s provocation threats while she is away on a visit to Iran from this weekend.“If the Kim Jong-un regime goes ahead with an additional nuclear test despite the international community’s warning, there will no longer be a future for them,” Park said.“It will be taking place under the strongest-ever U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed upon the fourth test. This is an explicit full-frontal challenge and provocation against the international society. ... We will be facing a situation that is totally different in its gravity.”President Park Geun-hye presides over the National Security Council on Thursday. YonhapPark ordered the members to hold regular NSC meetings during her May 1-3 visit to Iran in preparation against the North’s possible nuclear test that will lead to “extreme unease.”The meeting, the third one to be attended by Park this year, opened amid signs of Pyongyang preparing to conduct its fifth nuclear test in time for its Workers’ Party congress slated for May 6. There have been reports of increased activities near its nuclear test site northeastern Punggye-ri. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gave an order on March 15 to execute at an early date the detonation test of a nuclear warhead and launch tests of ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. South Korea’s intelligence agency told the National Assembly on Wednesday that they believed the North has completed preparation for an additional test and is awaiting Kim’s final order. Observers view that Kim may be aiming to show off the North’s nuclear weapons capacity in time for the congress and show off its determination to nuclearize.Making for the latest provocation, the North on Thursday test-fired what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile, South Korean military officials said. They said the launch of what may seem to be the same Mudusan model that the North fired off on April 15, seems to have failed by crashing several seconds later.The North has been test-firing short-range intermediate missiles in the past months following the U.N. Security Council’s heavy sanctions against its Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch. The reclusive regime has also repeatedly lodged threats to strike against the South and its allies.Park had convened the NSC both upon the January nuclear test and February long-range missile launch.“North Korea, which has been consistently raising tension, has been reported to be preparing for an artillery drill using a model of Cheong Wa Dae in the outskirts of Pyongyang,” Park said earlier in the day during the Cabinet meeting.“If the North conducts an additional nuclear test, it will not be tolerated, as  an extremely serious act of provocation that rattles the security order of Northeast Asia.”On the same day, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said Beijing would not tolerate any war or confusion on the Korean Peninsula, underscoring his country’s commitment to implementing sanctions against the North, but also calling for dialogue.“China will fully implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions,” Xi said in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia.","thursday warned north korea ,park warns against nuke ,additional nuclear test despite ,iran from this weekend ,warned north korea against","['Park Geun - hye', 'North Korea', 'the National Security Council', 'Park', 'North ’s', 'Iran', 'Kim Jong - un']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.66619688  0.91077822

This remains U.S. policy,"" he added during the interview on the sidelines of the Asan Plenum 2016, an annual forum hosted by the Seoul-based Asan Institute for Policy Studies.Einhorn made the remarks amid growing concerns here over America's security commitment to the South in the face of an increasingly provocative North Korea that has threatened the South and the U.S. through its evolving nuclear and missile programs.The concerns escalated further after U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump indicated the possibility of the withdrawal of American troops from the peninsula due to heavy costs for the upkeep of such forces. ""The U.S. has 28,500 military personnel here in South Korea. We have the Combined Forces Command. We exercise jointly frequently. The military interactions between our two governments are intimate and they are stronger than ever,"" he said.""So, I think the U.S. nuclear umbrella is credible today, and it would remain credible in the future -- as long as our alliance is strong and as long as the U.S. forces are deployed here.""Pointing out that diplomacy cannot succeed without pressure, Einhorn called for a dual-track approach that mixes diplomacy with pressure to persuade Pyongyang to renounce its nuclear ambitions.In applying the pressure, China is the ""key,"" he stressed. ""Unless China implements conscientiously and vigorously, then sufficient pressure will not be placed on North Korea to give it incentives to negotiate seriously and to limit and eventually give up its nuclear capabilities,"" he said.Commenting on President Park Geun-hye's planned trip to Iran, Einhorn, who also served as a U.S. negotiator on the Iranian nuclear issue, said that there are several messages the president needs to convey to the Islamic republic. Park is set to visit Tehran from May 1-3 with a focus on bolstering bilateral economic ties.""Park should urge Iranians to show restraint in the ballistic missile activity area,"" he said, calling Iran's missile tests ""destabilizing activities."" He also said that Park should emphasize to the Iranian leadership that South Korea's security could be adversely affected by collaboration between North Korea and Iran on either nuclear or missile technologies.","tuesday stressing that america ,nuclear option against ,korea former senior official ,senior official said tuesday ,official said tuesday stressing","['the United States', ""North Korea 's"", 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'America', 'asian', 'Robert Einhorn', 'the U.S. State Department']",28,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.32721218  0.60023725

Still Pyongyang claimed Sunday that the test was successful.The launch was the latest in a series of provocative acts the North has undertaken in defiance of international pressure increased in the wake of its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month.Earlier this month, the North also carried out its first launch of the intermediate-range Musudan missile, but the launch ended in failure as the missile blew up shortly after launch.Concerns also persist that Pyongyang could carry out yet another nuclear test in an effort to project an image of Kim Jong-un as a strong leader in the lead-up to the Workers' Party Congress next month.","council condemns korea submarine ,sunday condemned north korea ,condemns korea submarine missile ,condemned north korea submarine ,strongly condemned the firing","['the U.N.

According to police, 498 drunk drivers caused fatal accidents last year. The number of people who broke the law by driving while intoxicated five times within the last five years stood at 139.Still, cautious implementation is needed as the seizure could lead to an infringement on private property.

This year, the regional forum will bring together foreign ministers and other cabinet level officials from the 26 member states, including China, Russia, India, Turkey and Iran.On Thursday, Yun plans to deliver a keynote speech to highlight the serious threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and seek the active cooperation of CICA member states in blocking the North's nuclear advances and deterring future provocations through the faithful implementation of U.N. and bilateral sanctions against Pyongyang.Yun also plans to promote Seoul's signature Eurasia Initiative that seeks to build regional peace and stability through increased infrastructure and other links across the continent.The forum will set the stage for a series of bilateral talks between Yun and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and other foreign ministers of the region.Should the talks take place, Yun will call for support for stronger pressure on the North to force a change in its behavior as the communist regime has only stepped up its saber-rattling following last month's adoption of new U.N.

For tobacco shops to be installed in such large buildings as a bus terminal, the shops would most likely be within 50 meters of each other, so the new regulation makes it difficult for two smoke shops to be located in such a building.The municipal government expects the regulation, if implemented, will reduce new tobacco shops by half. Last year, 120 new cigarette stores and 27 on the premises of buildings started business in the southern Seoul ward.Ward officials said the new regulation is aimed at keeping tobacco retailers away from each other and youth in order to help improve public health.They also expect the number of cigarette retailers per ward population to be reduced. The ward's population per cigarette shop stands at 412, higher than the average for South Korea at 389, but lower than those of Songpa, Gwanak and Dongjak wards at 566, 560, 465, respectively.In terms of population per shop, Seocho trails the United States at 1,071, Britain with 915, France with 1,955, Spain with 3,206 and Japan with 413.The ward office said it would accelerate the ""No Puffing Ward"" policy down the road.So far, it has implemented a smoking ban near subway stations.The municipality has instituted a measure to crack down on anyone smoking within 10 meters of 121 exits of the ward's 22 subway stations. Offenders of the ban face a fine of 50,000 won .","in seoul said wednesday ,50 meters for tobacco ,new regulation in late ,any future smoke shop ,regulation in late october",['Seoul'],28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62979484  0.87166655

Ri Myong-su, chief of the military's general staff, to vice marshal, the North's media said Friday, a move designed to help its leader tighten his grip on power.The 82-year-old Ri, chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was bestowed with the title on Thursday, a joint decision made by the North's key military commissions, the Korean Central News Agency said.Early this year, Gen. Ri was promoted to the chief of the KPA's general staff to replace his predecessor Ri Yong-gil, who is believed to have been executed on corruption charges.North Korea's military has special general officer ranks -- marshal and vice marshal. Its general officer ranks have four titles -- general, colonel general, lieutenant general and major general.The KCNA also said that two KPA commanding officers -- Kim Yong-chun, 80, and Hyon Chol-hae, 82 -- were given the title of marshal.The report said that they have made great contributions to thoroughly establish the party's monolithic command system in the KPA and strengthen the military by remaining faithful to the leadership.Since Ri Ul-sol, the last remaining marshal of the KPA, died in November last year, the North has only had the marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- its leader Kim Jong-un.The two newly-appointed marshals were key military aides to Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader who died in December 2011, experts say.Vice marshal Ri is viewed as spearheading efforts to boost the military's monolithic command scheme, earning trust from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, according to Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.""The promotion appears to be aimed at succeeding the spirit of revolutionary fights and beefing up the current leader's grip on power,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.The lineup came on the occasion of North Korea's celebration of the 104th birthday of North Korea's late founding father Kim Il-sung.Earlier in the day, North Korea attempted to launch what appeared to be the Musudan medium-range ballistic missile, but the launch seems to have ended in failure, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said.If confirmed, it was the North's first test-launch of the Musudan missile which is believed to be capable of flying as far as Guam with a range of 3,000-4,000 kilometers.The launch came amid high speculation that North Korea may carry out its fifth nuclear test or fire off a long-range missile ahead of the founder's birthday or the upcoming party congress slated for May.","media said friday move ,vice marshal north korea ,korea promotes top military ,north media said friday ,korea has promoted gen","['North Korea', 'Ri Myong - su', 'Ri', ""the Korean People 's Army"", 'the Korean Central News Agency']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.4169195   0.72078985

The loudspeakers should be delivered by the end of November.The plan aims ""at replacing aging loudspeakers with high-performance ones in order to enhance the flexibility of broadcasting operations,"" the notices on the public tender said.New loudspeakers should be powerful enough for listeners to be able to recognize messages some 10 kilometers away, and they should work in all kinds of weather. The military also wants mobile speakers that have the same capabilities as the stationary speakers.The latest tender notices came in amid escalating inter-Korean tensions and pointed to the government's willingness to further raise the stakes in its propaganda war against the North.After turning off the speakers following an agreement reached with the North in June 2004, Seoul restarted broadcasting in retaliation for North Korea's landmine provocation last August.That attack maimed two South Korean soldiers.The loudspeakers blare anti-North Korea messages and enticing K-pop music towards the North.Seoul has continued the operation at some 11 points along the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries. Further escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula, the North carried out more military provocations, including its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February.","april inviting local suppliers ,government notices showed tuesday ,broadcasting south korea plans ,korea plans to introduce ,notices on april inviting","['South Korea', 'anti -', 'north Korea', ""the Ministry of National Defense 's""]",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36911699  0.59096009

This week, China, the North's diplomatic and economic lifeline, imposed restrictions on North Korean coal and iron ore trade, while banning imports of North Korean gold and rare earth, in line with new U.N. sanctions against the North's nuclear and missile programs. In a statement released on Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the Chinese measures ""appear to be a step toward in following through on"" China's pledge in enforcing the U.N. sanctions on North Korea. ""We will continue to urge China to do more until we see concrete signs that Kim Jong-un has come to the realization that the only viable path forward for his country is denuclearization,"" it said. The U.N. Security Council adopted a set of new sanctions against North Korea early last month, in the aftermath of the North's fourth nuclear test in January and launch of a long-range rocket in February. China accounts for nearly 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade estimated at US$7.6 billion in 2014. Coal and iron ore are key parts of bilateral trade between North Korea and China, but the U.N. sanctions have an exception that allows trade of such items unless the proceeds are used for the North's nuclear and missile programs. Chinese officials have pledged to fully implement the U.N. sanctions, but also stressed that it should not affect normal trade between the allies. In an editorial on Friday, state-run China Daily newspaper said the Chinese restrictions of trade with North Korea ""should be a welcome indication that Beijing is serious about its vow to 'conscientiously' implement the sanctions."" Although North Korea has shown no signs of giving up its nuclear ambitions, China has proposed pursuing peace treaty talks with the North in tandem with denuclearization negotiations. Signing a peace treaty, which would replace the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War, has been one of Pyongyang's long-running goals, but South Korea and the U.S. have demanded the North abandon its nuclear program first.The Chinese newspaper was also skeptical about the prospects of reviving talks with North Korea. ""So no matter how hard Beijing works to revive talks, it will not happen until Pyongyang convinces the others of its sincerity about denuclearization. Something that appears unlikely at present,"" the editorial reads. ""Beijing should avoid playing into Pyongyang's hands by single-mindedly advocating for peace. Peace-brokering should never be at the price of appeasing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions,"" it said.","welcomed china restrictions on ,denuclearization this week china ,welcomes china restrictions on ,welcomed china restrictions ,ore trade while banning","['the United States', 'China', 'North Korea', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'U.N.']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.51977211  0.47044703

Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, refer to aircraft that require no human pilot with varying degrees autonomy in their operation. Their uses vary from military use to aerial surveillance, filming, search and rescue, cargo transportation.  Shim Hyun-chul, a professor of aerospace engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, said KAIST had been developing drones that can be used to carry out military missions. This includes research and development of suicide drones, which are remotely guided to a target and set off an armed device upon reaching it. “KAIST lab has been carrying out studies on using drones for attacks since 2014. ... We conducted a test flight under supervision of the Agency for Defense Development in November of 2014,” he said.Shim also revealed the photos of the test flight, adding that the researchers were working on detection and tracking of the target, along with automated landing technologies for the drone.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation, there are currently 895 UAVs being operated in the country. The drone technology on the military front dates back to the 1970s when the ADD sought to introduce a miniature air launch decoy codenamed “Solgae.” While the project never fully took off, the ADD and the Korea Aerospace Industries launched Korea’s first homegrown UAV RQ-101 “Songgolmae” in 2001. Shim pointed out that combat drone technology had made strides over the past 30 years, with drone roles expanding from mainly reconnaissance to striking enemy bases. He explained that there had been a worldwide move to develop unmanned combat aerial vehicles with stealth capabilities. This includes the Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus, a demonstration UCAV model.Brig. Gen. Moon Seong-cheol, principal of the school, stressed the importance of drone technology in the military and said that the Army planned to make the conference an annual event. There has been a security concern on the peninsula recently over reports that objects suspected of being North Korean drones have infiltrated across the border. The South Korean military officially denied that any drone had passed the inter-Korea borders since Jan. 13, and reiterated that it is on constant surveillance against North Korean drones.In a closed-door press briefing, the military added that it plans to raise required operational capability of its air defense radars -- which currently detect aircraft -- to also detect smaller drones.By Yoon Min-sik","korean army on saturday ,conference on military drones ,researchers rolled out drone ,the army drones also ,army on saturday held","['the south korean Army', 'Korea Army Intelligence School', 'Army']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71555191  0.5778901

He has since been making field tours in the economic sector apparently to show that he cares about the livelihoods of ordinary people and the country's moribund economy.Kim ""guided the test of a new-type anti-air guided weapon system to estimate its feasibility,"" the North's Korean Central News Agency  reported without mentioning the date and location of the inspection.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the move appears to mention the North's test-firing of a surface-to-air missile into waters off its east coast, conducted on Friday.The North fired off an anti-aircraft missile at around 12:45 p.m. from South Hamkyong Province in the country's northeastern area toward the East Sea, according to the JCS.""The test verified that the feasibility of the new-type AA guided weapon system is perfect in the light of the latest military sci-tech requirements,"" it said, adding that the leader expressed great satisfaction over the ""successful"" test.In another dispatch on Saturday, the KCNA said Kim inspected a machinery factory in Hamhung, North Hamkyong Province. It also did not give the date of the visit as it usually does.Rodong Sinmun, an organ of the Workers' Party, also released 10 photos on the same day of Kim inspecting the missile test-fire. The Workers' Party is the North's only active political party while other parties exist only nominally.Seen in the pictures were two trucks loaded with three large launching tubes. A guided rocket was launched from one of the trucks. Other images showed the rocket flying obliquely shortly after the launch and then turn vertical before striking the target in the air.Military experts here say the tested missile is believed to be the North's KN-06 with a range of 100 to 150 km. Pyongyang first unveiled the KN-06 system during a military parade to mark the 65th founding anniversary of the Workers' Party in October 2010. Experts presume that it is a copy of Russia's surface-to-air missile, S-300.","korean leader resumes military ,state media said saturday ,march 25 to inspect ,long range artillery exercise ,missile in his first","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61852747  0.73338437

It said the portion of spending on fisheries will account for 6.9 percent and that on science and technology will be equal to 5.2 percent of its budget.Its state budgetary revenue is expected to rise 4.1 percent on-year in 2016, it added.Every April, the SPA holds a plenary session, attended by hundreds of deputies, to finalize the country's budget spending and overhaul Cabinet organs. But this year, the North's parliament held a smaller meeting led by its presidium ahead of the ruling party's congress slated for May.The Workers' Party of Korea plans to hold its first congress in more than three decades in early May when the North's leader is expected to unveil new lines of policies.","state media said thursday ,year budget on defense ,korea to spend 15 ,year earlier the korean ,media said thursday amid","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the Korean Central News Agency']",28,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.72787982  0.70590538

The ultimatum issued by the North’s long-range artillery force late Saturday calls for “an official apology” from Park for her “daring attempts to slander and do harm to the sun of Songun,” referring to its leader Kim Jong-un, while demanding her administration punish the architects of the exercises and “finish them without mercy.”If Seoul does not respond, the force’s large combined frontline unit will “move over to merciless military action” against Cheong Wa Dae and other major government facilities, the official Korean Central News Agency reported. Pyongyang has in recent weeks been upping its threats, increasingly targeting the presidential palace and other agencies at the heart of Seoul. Also, another North Korean propaganda outlet posted on Saturday a video portraying a nuclear strike on Washington.The move came as the South carries out a series of military drills alone and with the U.S. at an unprecedented scale, which the communist state deems rehearsals for a potential invasion.Earlier this month, the allies conducted training intended to hit Pyongyang’s top leadership and nuclear and missile sites in a contingency as part of their annual Key Resolve and Foal Eagle programs. “North Korea’s additional provocation will lead its leadership to a ruin,” the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, urging it to cease provocative words and behavior regarding Park.

The audit agency said the defense ministry had already completed its development of far superior liquid body armor that could resist armor-piercing shells, but introduced the outmoded vests in a corrupted deal. The defense ministry said the developed liquid bulletproof vest was too expensive and inefficient to be distributed to troops.Although it cannot protect against armor-piercing bombs, the current vests are strong enough to resist rifle-fired projectiles and meet the required standard, the ministry added.

A 43-year-old man tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus after traveling to Brazil between mid-February and early March.The government said it will first work with the country's three major mobile careers to adopt a so-called ""smart quarantine system"" by the end of this year to effectively prevent the influx of the disease.Under the system, a text message will be automatically sent to a passenger entering the country who has been to a country with known Zika outbreaks.""The government has mulled over  since last year's MERS outbreak,"" Health Minister Chung Chin-yeob told reporters following the meeting.Chung said that the government currently works with the No. 2 mobile carrier KT and plans to join hands with the two others.Also, the government and the ruling party agreed to push forward with a system allowing airport authorities to automatically monitor the temperature and symptoms of passengers.The government will also send text messages to doctors across the country, as the mosquito-borne illness can pose a serious health threat, especially to pregnant women and unborn babies.These countermeasures were drawn up during the meeting attended by Chung and the chief of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as ruling party lawmakers.The World Health Organization has declared the Zika virus outbreak a global emergency after it was first discovered in Africa, and has spread to parts of Asia and Latin America, including many Caribbean countries.In Asia, China and Japan have reported a few confirmed cases.Local health authorities, meanwhile, say that there is no immediate health threat at present, since the virus is mostly transmitted through mosquito bites.

I believe that we need to introduce abstract judicial review to solve this,” Park said during a debate held in Seoul.South Korea currently only allows reviews of legislation, ordinances and regulations when a case challenging their constitutionality is filed, which is usually well after the laws have been put in place.Introducing the abstract review system, practiced in such countries as Germany, would require a constitutional amendment.“Much of the conflict will be alleviated when we adopt a system where the Constitutional Court reviews legislation before or immediately after it is enacted,” he said. He noted that political institutions faced criticism for failing to fulfill their role, in some cases aggravating social conflict and violating constitutional values.The need for an abstract review of legislation has been raised in judiciary circles to minimize confusion arising from enforcement of controversial legislation. Some have also opposed the notion of amplifying the authority of the Constitutional Court. Last year, the Assembly passed a law enabling the parliament to demand changes to government decrees. The bill was later vetoed by President Park Geun-hye.Park Han-chul also said that a decision would be made before the end of May on the controversial law on Assembly procedures, following Assembly speaker Chung Ui-hwa’s request for a decision as soon as possible.The National Assembly Advancement Law, passed in 2012, requires approval of more than 60 percent of attending lawmakers for a contested bill to be put up for a vote. It also requires a bipartisan agreement for the speaker to table the bill.","korea needs to introduce ,south korea needs to ,worsening each day due ,han chul on friday ,south korea needs","['Constitutional Court', 'Park Han', 'South Korea']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.68622464  0.83081621

But it installed nine-speed transmission instead, raising questions over whether the replacement was done intentionally.However the automaker said in a phone call with The Korea Herald that it had not been intentional to install nine-speed transmission without notifying the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. “It was actually found out during our internal monitoring session. Then we reported our fault immediately. “It was simply our mistake to forget to report and get an approval before sales from the ministry,” said an official from Mercedez-Benz Korea’s public relations agency Ketchum Korea.The Environment ministry said it will soon begin verification tests of exhaust gases from vehicles that use seven-speed and nine-speed transmissions, to find out the difference between the two.“Mercedes-Benz Korea has agreed to provide cars for the verification tests, and we will select vehicles that have a mileage of over 4,000 km to increase the accuracy of the tests,” said Lee Kyung-bin from the ministry’s environment transportation division to The Korea Herald. According to the ministry, Mercedes-Benz Korea had reapplied for official approval of nine-speed transmission for their cars on March 10, six days before the ministry imposed the fine.By Kim Da-sol","wednesday fined german automaker ,fined german automaker mercedes ,fined german automaker ,ministry fines mercedes benz ,ministry on wednesday fined","['Yonhap', 'the Environment Ministry', 'german', 'Mercedes - Benz Korea']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.85966241  0.65733558

The North's leader also said that a new ""nuclear warhead explosion test"" and ballistic missile tests will be conducted ""in a short time,"" according to state media.""We have not seen North Korea demonstrate capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and again, put it on a ballistic missile,"" Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said at a briefing. ""We don't assess that that's a capability they're demonstrated at this point.""The spokesman said, however, that the U.S. is prepared to cope with all threats from the North.""We are doing everything that we can, as the American people would expect, to prepare, just in case North Korea's words turn into something else,"" Cook said.The U.S. is also taking steps to ""shore up our alliance partner, South Korea, our alliance with Japan in the region, other partners in the region who have to address that threat more immediately than we do,"" he said.Last week, U.S. Northern Commander Adm. William Gortney said that the North can ""range the continental United States"" with an intercontinental ballistic missile and it would be prudent to assume Pyongyang can also miniaturize a nuclear warhead to put on an ICBM.North Korea has sharply ratcheted up tensions with nuclear and missile threats as South Korea and the United States have been conducting annual joint military exercises that Pyongyang has branded preparation for a northward invasion.The threats are believed to show the outside world that the regime remains unfazed by the new U.N. sanctions imposed for its nuclear and missile tests, and to assert Kim Jong-un's leadership in the lead-up to a key Workers' Party Congress in May.Michael Elleman, a senior follow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the North's claims of acquiring the reentry technology could mean that ""engineers tested some heat-resistant materials in the laboratory to determine performance and reliability.""""This would be a standard first step in perfecting the creation of a heat shield for a long-range missile re-entry system,"" he said. ""Regardless, to establish a reliable thermal protection coating, at least one successful flight test on a long-range rocket would be prudent.""As an alternative to flying a missile to full range, the North could use a shorter-range missile, but in that case, a small second stage would be added and the missile would fly straight up, and once it began descending into the atmosphere, the second stage would further accelerate the re-entry body downward to simulate the velocity experience on a long-range missile, he said, adding that the U.S. used the technique in the early 1960s.","downplays nuclear missile ,tuesday north korean leader ,worst the pentagon spokesman ,downplays nuclear missile capabilities ,pentagon spokesman said tuesday","[""North Korea 's"", 'the United States', 'Pentagon', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.70549828  0.83259451

Scud missiles have ranges of 300-500 km while Rodong missiles can fly around 1,300 km.Pyongyang was also seen making improvements in terms of in-flight rocket altitude control. In a 2009 test, it attached a small thruster to a long-range rocket to ensure that the rocket soared in the right position. In a 2012 test, it also put a thruster on the propulsion system of the three-stage rocket to control the altitude.   Despite much progress in missile technology, Pyongyang faces the toughest challenge of developing an operational ICBM: re-entry technology. As the intercontinental missile re-enters the earth at the speed of Mach 20, the rocket's warhead needs to be capable of withstanding temperatures of around 6,000-7,000 degrees Celsius. On Tuesday, Pyongyang said it has acquired ""reliable"" re-entry technology. But Seoul officials dismissed the claim as the reclusive regime has yet to conduct any open test of its re-entry technology.The North has deployed the Musudan missile with a range of more than 3,000 km. But it has yet to conduct any test on it. It has also been pushing to develop the KN-08 ICBM but without any confirmed test of re-entry capabilities.","all core missile technologies ,north korea has all ,core missile technologies except ,has all core missile ,military officials said tuesday","['North Korea', ""South Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang']",28,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.43025514  0.8221007

In the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the Employment and Labor Ministry unveiled measures to root out business practices that disadvantage smaller employers and non-regular workers under the dual structure of the country’s labor market.  The plans are a mix of financial incentives and stepped-up monitoring to reduce the gap in competitiveness between large and small companies and in treatment between regular and non-regular workers. The government plans to expand financial support for conglomerates willing to give regular status to non-regular workers by covering 70 percent of their wages for one year. It will also give tax incentives to companies signing contracts with subcontractors hiring fewer irregular workers. It will also beef up monitoring of 20,000 enterprises in the manufacturing industry to punish employers who illegally recruit workers -- many of who are young -- through subcontractors and exploit them through unreasonably long working hours. To better protect workers with a temporary status, the government plans to create a standard contract form based on legally binding labor conditions and make it mandatory for businesses to offer the same welfare benefits for non-regular workers as well. The move comes amid mounting worries over the widening labor market duality in the country that is linked to the nation’s low productivity, lack of quality jobs and wage disparity. According to Statistics Korea, there were 6.27 million workers with irregular status last year, accounting for 32.5 percent of the entire labor force in the country. The monthly wages of irregular workers stood at an average of 1.46 million won , about half the wages of regular workers at 2.69 million won per month. Irregular workers are not protected by pension, health and employment insurance. Many of them are also excluded from incentives, overtime pay and paid holidays. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development pointed out in its 2015 Employment Outlook that major challenges facing the nation’s economy are the high incidence of non-regular work, coupled with low mobility from non-regular to regular jobs, and large wage gaps between small enterprises.“It is important to reduce Korea’s labor market duality and to strengthen access to well-tailored vocational training services so that more workers can move up the career ladder to better jobs,” it said in the report. The government has blamed the nation’s “strong” labor unions with high membership of regular workers for protecting their interests at the expense of irregular workers. It saw labor unions and the rigid market as factors which encouraged companies to hire non-regular workers rather than create new jobs. Only 2.8 percent of the irregular workers in the country joined a labor union, while 12.1 percent of salaried workers in Korea are members of labor unions. “The government’s efforts for policy implementation has its limits to improving the market duality fundamentally,” the labor minister Lee Ki-kown said in the meeting, urging the National Assembly to pass a set of labor market reform bills.But the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the nation’s largest trade unions, slammed the plan, calling it a repetition of already failed policies. It also accused the government of implementing business-friendly polices at the cost of laborers. In the policy meeting, the government also revealed a plan to tighten security at the country’s major airports following a series of security breaches. Under the plan, doors of immigration checkpoints will be closed after working hours and security cameras will be installed to monitor major locations at the airport. The ministry will also enhance cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, the airport council and relevant agencies to share information about potentially high-risk passengers. It will also prescreen passengers before airliners issue boarding passes to keep potential terrorists from entering the country.By Ock Hyun-ju","policy meeting held thursday ,airports in policy meeting ,south korean government mapped ,thursday in the meeting ,build fairer business ecosystem","['south korean', 'Hwang Kyo - ahn', 'the Employment and Labor Ministry']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.04831564  0.79559171

Security Council sanctions that aim to punish the North for its recent nuclear and rocket tests.Visalo pledged his country's support for the efforts, the ministry said in a press release.Noting their efforts to establish their military attache offices in each other's countries, the two sides agreed to deepen cooperation in diplomatic and security areas.Cambodia already established its military attache office in Seoul in August while Korea plans to open its office in August this year. To further strengthen diplomatic ties, Seoul also plans to open a consulate in Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia.Lim and Visalo also took note of the plan to hold an inaugural session of the two countries' Joint Economic Committee in Seoul sometime this year and agreed to make efforts to bolster bilateral trade and investment.The economic committee was launched last November to strengthen their economic cooperation at national, regional and global levels.The trade volume between the two countries reached $840 million in 2014, according to data from the Korea International Trade Association.The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation in Cambodia's rural and regional development program.","sanctions cambodia has reaffirmed ,in cambodia on wednesday ,wednesday to discuss cooperation ,cambodia on wednesday ,cambodia on wednesday to","['Cambodia', ""North Korea 's"", 'U.N.', ""South Korea 's"", 'Foreign Ministry', 'Lim Sung - nam', 'Long Visalo', 'Cambodia', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Cambodia']",28,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.58441657  0.85398084

Hotel Shilla is an affiliate of South Korea’s biggest conglomerate Samsung Group.

Security Council resolution is carried out to the letter to produce its desired effect,"" the official told reporters. He asked not to be identified, citing policy.His comments came after the council unanimously adopted a new resolution to punish North Korea for its fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.The resolution, if implemented to the fullest, is expected to deal a blow to North Korea as it would cut off the country's access to hard currency.The resolution mandates U.N. member states to inspect all cargo going in and out of North Korea. The official described the clause of the resolution as something that is ""unimaginable."" It also bans the North's exports of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a key source of hard currency that accounts for roughly half of the country's total exports.North Korea has already been under U.N. sanctions for its three previous nuclear tests, although these have failed to deter the communist country's nuclear ambitions.The official said China has decided that it cannot keep the situation as it is following the North's nuclear and missile tests, and this change of heart has led to the stronger U.N. sanctions.China has worked out the resolution with the U.S., a clear signal that Beijing is serious about reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.China is North Korea's most important trading partner and key source of food and fuel, giving Beijing significant leverage over Pyongyang.China has long been under fire from critics that it has been reluctant to enforce tougher measures against North Korea, apparently worried that such a move will destabilize its neighbor.The presidential official said South Korea also gave an impetus to the U.N. resolution, citing its recent shutdown of the last-remaining economic project with North Korea.South Korea has shuttered a factory park that it had jointly run with North Korea in the North's border city of Kaesong, cutting off a major revenue source for North Korea.South Korea provided around $560 million in cash to North Korea in total since the two sides opened the factory park in 2004.President Park Geun-hye has described the closure of the factory park as just the ""beginning"" of measures that South Korea and the international community will take against North Korea.","presidential official said thursday ,missile tests senior presidential ,enforce the latest sanctions ,slapped against north korea ,latest sanctions slapped against","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'U.N.

Last week's agreement by the United States and China on a draft U.N. resolution, which includes a ban on the supply of aviation fuel to North Korea, was evidence of the shift in Beijing's stance towards its only treaty ally Pyongyang, said Li Kaisheng, research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Li made the remarks during an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV on Sunday.The United Nations is weighing over the draft resolution to punish North Korea for its Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 launch of a long-range rocket, both of which violated previous U.N. resolutions. Winning China's cooperation is key to ensure the effectiveness of U.N. sanctions against North Korea because China accounts for nearly 90 percent of the North's foreign trade. Still, China is unlikely to put crippling sanctions on North Korea because a sudden collapse of the regime could spark a refugee crisis at its border and lead to a pro-U.S., democratic Korea on its doorstep, analysts say.","chinese scholar on monday ,sanctions against north korea ,monday last week agreement ,sanctions on korea scholar ,scholar on monday last","['China', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', 'the Chinese Communist Party', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'the United States', 'China', 'U.N.']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.29922616  0.57241046

Our response to North Korea's proposal was consistent with our longstanding focus on denuclearization,"" he said.It is not new that North Korea wants a peace treaty with the U.S. to formally end the Korean War.

U.S. officials have stressed that the communist regime has got the order wrong and should first focus on negotiations to end its nuclear program.The South Korean government echoed such a view, saying that the North's denuclearization should be the top priority.""The issue of peace treaty talks is not just a matter between Washington and Pyongyang,"" Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at the Unification Ministry, told a regular press briefing Monday.

A special government task team, headed by Lee Suk-joon, the top official in charge of government policy coordination at the Prime Minister's Office, came up with support measures for 124 South Korean companies, which had to leave behind their production lines earlier this month after Pyongyang's decision to deport them all from the Gaeseong Industrial Complex.  The government said it would provide companies with factory sites in the South if they are struggling to find alternative ones free of charge for the first one year and will provide such sites at a 50 percent discount for the next two years. ""The government has been responding to companies' difficulties through one-on-one support services in a timely manner,"" said Lee during the task team's third meeting on assisting the companies. The official said the government had received 291 cases of complaints from the companies and had so far resolved 133 of them. ""The government is working actively to resolve the rest,"" added Lee. Another support measure allows the companies to hire additional foreign workers, 40 percent more than the legal quota.  The South Korean government decided to at least temporarily shut down the operation of the joint industrial complex in North Korea on Feb. 10 in response to Pyongyang's nuclear test and long-range rocket launch. A day after Seoul's decision, Pyongyang expelled all 124 South Korean firms from the joint industrial park in Gaeseong.The joint industrial park was the last remaining vestige of inter-Korean business cooperation until its closure earlier this month. Around 54,000 North Korean workers were employed by 124 South Korean firms with production facilities in Gaeseong.When the industrial park was closed for 160 days in 2013 in North Korea's protest against a joint military exercise between South Korean and U.S. forces here, the South Korean firms reported a combined loss of 1.05 trillion won .The firms claim their damage will be greater this time considering the growth of their business operations over the years, saying that they may even seek a lawsuit if the government refuses to compensate them for their losses.","korean government said friday ,100 south korean firms ,lending factory sites free ,south korean firms withdrawn ,korean firms withdrawn from","['south korean', 'south korean', 'Lee Suk - joon', ""the Prime Minister 's Office""]",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4226236   0.71621442

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that Wang expressed the concern to South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se during their meeting in Munich on the sidelines of international talks on Syria, and that the deployment is “not conducive to taking the proper response to the current situation and is not conducive to maintaining peace and stability in the region.”Despite growing protest from China and Russia, South Korea and the U.S. are accelerating the preparation with the working-level team set to consult the time line of the deployment and potential sites to house the system that consists of launchers, interceptors, a radar, a fire control unit and THAAD-specific support equipment.Safety matters and environmental costs that entail the deployment will be discussed based on both sides’ domestic laws and the Status of Forces Agreement, the official explained.The location of the THAAD battery will be somewhere that “the military utility can be maximized with minimal safety and environmental damage to nearby residents,” the official added, referring to ongoing debate over the environmental risk the system would pose due to its strong electromagnetic waves.The official also brushed off speculation that the location will be selected by taking China’s opposition into consideration, saying, “Considering a neighboring country’s position in choosing the location runs against the military .” Some news reports have suggested that THAAD in South Korea will be positioned further away from China, such as in the southern part of the country, rather than areas like Pyeongtaek where it directly faces China across the Yellow Sea.  South Korea’s Deputy Defense Minister Yoo Jeh-seung  and 8th U.S. Army commander Lt. Gen. Thomas S.

Based on SOFA, the official explained that the Seoul government would be providing the site and infrastructure, including electricity, water and sewage systems. The U.S. side, in turn, would bear operational costs. One THAAD unit will be deployed at the U.S. Forces Korea base and not more, he added. The timing will depend on the way the consultation proceeds with an aim to complete it as soon as possible, he added.","next week south korea ,thaad talks next week ,defense ministry said friday ,talks next week ,said friday that seoul","['the south Korean Defense Ministry', 'Seoul', 'Washington', 'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense', 'Korea', 'U.S.']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.92808557  0.60848248

Vehicles loaded with goods from Gaeseong industrial park return to South Korea through Paju, Gyeonggi Province on Thursday. Yonhap“The frozen equipment, materials and products will be managed by the committee of Gaeseong people,” Pyongyang's statement said prior to the workers' return to South Korea. “From 10 p.m.  on Feb. 11,  will seal off the industrial park and nearby military demarcation line, shut the western overland route and declare the park as a military off-limit zone.”Seoul’s Unification Ministry also vowed to minimize damages to the 124 firms that operated factories in the complex.The North’s move came as South Korea began pulling out of the industrial complex. The previous day, Seoul announced the suspension of the factory park as a retaliatory step following Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and rocket tests. The decision to shut down the complex, a symbol of cross-border reconciliation and cooperation, has sparked concerns that bilateral tensions could spiral out of control and Seoul’s trust-building efforts may be headed down the drain.The South Korean firms operating in the complex sent one truck each to Gaeseong to bring to the South their finished products, production materials, equipment and other belongings, while Seoul authorities vowed to try their utmost to minimize possible damages to firms.An additional 130 South Koreans entered the complex to prepare for the suspension of factory operations. There were 70 more South Koreans in the park from the previous day as more workers were sent to carry out the government’s withdrawal instructions.Apparently in line with Pyongyang’s instructions, North Korean workers did not show up at the park, Seoul officials said. Some 55,000 North Korean workers worked at the complex through which Pyongyang raked in around $100 million annually. Factory owners have expressed concerns that they would have to shut down their businesses as they would fail to meet their respective deadlines for supplying goods to clients. South Korean employees would also feel apprehensive about their impending unemployment.“I feel bitter when I think about the possibility that I might lose my job due to the suspension of the factory operations,” said Yun Sang-eun, a worker who drove a 22-ton truck back to the South with factory products from Gaeseong. Later in the day, South and North Korean officials in charge of management of the complex held consultations over the procedures of the pullout. Observers say they could be at odds over various issues including those concerning Seoul’s cuts in the supply of electricity and water to the complex.A senior official at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said that the pullout decision was an “administrative act that was carried out for public interest based on highly political judgment.” “This  decision is to ensure the safety of our citizens, end the vicious circle of provocations and pressure Pyongyang to change course,” he told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.“The government would offer the maximum support to the firms who would sustain damages in the process of pulling out of the complex.”His remarks came after a progressive association of local lawyers demanded that the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae and the Unification Ministry explain the “legal grounds” on which they decided to close the Gaeseong park.The association argued that the government’s decision restricts corporate activities and the property rights of companies operating in Gaeseong, hence it should be made according to clear legal grounds, and implemented through legitimate procedures.In the afternoon, vice ministers of related government agencies held a meeting to discuss ways to support South Korean companies that are expected to suffer damages due to the suspension of factory operations in Gaeseong.They formed a special task force to support the firms.

The government also vowed to minimize damages to the 124 firms that operated factories in the complex.The North’s move came as South Korea began pulling out of the industrial complex. The previous day, Seoul announced the suspension of the factory park as a retaliatory step following Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and rocket tests. The decision to shut down the complex, a symbol of cross-border reconciliation and cooperation, has sparked concerns that bilateral tensions could spiral out of control and Seoul’s trust-building efforts may be headed down the drain. Vehicles from Gaeseong industrial park pass through the transit gate in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, to enter the South on Thursday. The South Korean firms operating in the complex sent one truck each to Gaeseong to bring to the South their finished products, production materials, equipment and other belongings, while Seoul authorities vowed to try their utmost to minimize possible damages to firms.An additional 130 South Koreans entered the complex to prepare for the suspension of factory operations. There were 70 more South Koreans in the park from the previous day as more workers were sent to carry out the government’s withdrawal instructions.Apparently in line with Pyongyang’s instructions, North Korean workers did not show up at the park, Seoul officials said. Some 55,000 North Korean workers worked at the complex through which Pyongyang raked in around $100 million annually. Factory owners have expressed concerns that they would have to shut down their businesses as they would fail to meet their respective deadlines for supplying goods to clients. South Korean employees would also feel apprehensive about their impending unemployment.“I feel bitter when I think about the possibility that I might lose my job due to the suspension of the factory operations,” said Yun Sang-eun, a worker who drove a 22-ton truck back to the South with factory products from Gaeseong.  Later in the day, South and North Korean officials in charge of management of the complex held consultations over the procedures of the pullout. Observers say they could be at odds over various issues including those concerning Seoul’s cuts in the supply of electricity and water to the complex.A senior official at Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said that the pullout decision was an “administrative act that was carried out for public interest based on highly political judgment.” “This  decision is to ensure the safety of our citizens, end the vicious circle of provocations and pressure Pyongyang to change course,” he told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.“The government would offer the maximum support to the firms who would sustain damages in the process of pulling out of the complex.”His remarks came after a progressive association of local lawyers demanded that the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae and the Unification Ministry explain the “legal grounds” on which they decided to close the Gaeseong park.The association argued that the government’s decision restricts corporate activities and the property rights of companies operating in Gaeseong, hence it should be made according to clear legal grounds, and implemented through legitimate procedures.In the afternoon, vice ministers of related government agencies held a meeting to discuss ways to support South Korean companies that are expected to suffer damages due to the suspension of factory operations in Gaeseong.They formed a special task force to support the firms. The team, led by Lee Suk-joon, head of the Office for Government Policy Coordination under the prime minister‘s office, consists of vice minister-level officials from 11 government agencies including the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and Ministry of the Interior.The task force is expected to offer financial assistance to the affected firms in the form of tax benefits, loans and insurance payments, among other measures. By Song Sang-ho","thursday froze south korean ,south koreans freezes assets ,froze south korean assets ,closed the factory park ,pyongyang on thursday froze","['pyongyang', 'south korean', 'inter - korean', 'Gaeseong', 'Seoul', 'South Koreans']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53319234  0.72571433

Ambassador Rafael Dario Ramirez Carreno, the council's president for February, told reporters on Sunday while reading a press statement after the closed-door meeting.""The members of the Security Council underscore this launch as well as any other DPRK launch that use ballistic missile technology even if characterized as a satellite launch or a space launch vehicle contribute to the DPRK's nuclear weapon delivery system and is a serious violation of the Security Council resolutions,"" he said.The Security Council also noted its intent to develop ""significant measures"" in a new resolution in response to the North's latest nuclear test while also recalling previous warnings that it would take ""future significant measures"" in the event of another DPRK launch.""In line with this commitment and the gravity of this most recent violation, the council will adopt expeditiously a new security council resolution with such measures in response to this dangerous and serious violation,"" the council president said.The council also expressed its commitment to continue working toward a ""peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation leading to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" the ambassador said.The meeting was convened less than a day after the North defied international warnings and carried out the rocket launch in violation of U.N. resolutions. Right after the launch, South Korea, the United States and Japan jointly requested an emergency council meeting.South Korea hailed the U.N. Security Council's adoption of a press statement condemning the North's rocket launch.""We welcomed the Security Council's vow to 'expeditiously adopt a new resolution' against North Korea,"" an official at Seoul's foreign ministry said.The launch came as the U.N. Security Council has been struggling in negotiations to put together a new resolution imposing sanctions on Pyongyang for the nuclear test because China has been reluctant to impose harsh measures on its communist neighbor.The rocket launch is expected to help break the deadlock as China would find it difficult to oppose tough measures any longer, analysts said. China's cooperation is key to any sanctions resolution because it's a veto-holding permanent member.""We are hopeful that China, like all council members, will see the grave threat to regional, international peace and security, see the importance of adopting tough, unprecedented measures, breaking new ground,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.S. Samantha Power told reporters.She also said she will ensure the Security Council imposes serious consequences on the North.""DPRK's latest transgressions require our response to be even firmer,"" she said.Sunday's launch was successful as the rocket put what Pyongyang claims was a satellite into orbit.It represented the North's sixth long-range rocket or missile launch since 1998 and once again demonstrated that Pyongyang is making steady progress in its efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.North Korea says its rocket launches are aimed at putting satellites into orbit, claiming it has the right to the peaceful use of space. But Pyongyang is banned from such launches under U.N. Security Council resolutions as it has been accused of using them as a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missiles.Experts say long-range rockets and ICBMs are basically the same, differing only in payload.So far, the Security Council has adopted six resolutions, six presidential statements and two press statements with regard to the North's nuclear and missile program. Of the six resolutions, four included sanctions on the isolated nation.    A new sanctions resolution is expected to be much tougher than the previous ones.   ""I understand that there was a consensus on the need to put together a sanctions resolution, which has been under discussions since the nuclear test, at an early date and with stronger content,"" South Korean Ambassador to the U.N. Oh Joon said.    ""Existing Security Council sanctions on North Korea are mostly related directly to weapons,"" Oh said. ""I think most Security Council members think that it's time for powerful sanctions that go beyond that, now that it's obvious they were unable to stop North Korea's weapons development.""","strongly condemns korean launch ,council strongly condemns korean ,strongly condemned north korea ,condemns korean launch ,condemns korean launch the","['the U.N.

But Seoul suspended its signing due to strong opposition from civic groups, which claimed the deal was inked hastily and behind the scenes.Seoul's defense ministry dismissed the report, adding that Han's remarks meant that various factors should be first taken into consideration.""Support from the National Assembly and the general public should be prerequisites for the accord to be clinched,"" the Defense Ministry said.On Sunday, North Korea launched a long-range rocket carrying what it called a satellite, drawing international condemnation. Seoul and Washington view the launch as a disguised test of intercontinental ballistic missile technology.In December 2014, South Korea, the United States and Japan signed a preliminary deal that calls for voluntary sharing of military secrets on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs among the three countries.The deal paved the way for Seoul and Tokyo to share such intelligence via the U.S. after they failed to strike the accord on sharing military intelligence in 2012.","south korea said monday ,report on seoul tokyo ,seoul is mulling reviewing ,kyodo news reported sunday ,dismisses report on seoul","['South Korea', 'Seoul', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Kyodo News', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Defense', 'Han Min - koo', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",28,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.66860169  0.70342219

Chinese cooperation is key to putting together strong sanctions on Pyongyang as China is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel for the North.Beijing has condemned the North's nuclear test, but has been lukewarm about calls for stern responses. Analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border with China and the untimely emergence of a pro-U.S. nation.   Kirby said that sanctions are one piece of additional tough measures against the North, stressing the importance of rigorous implementation of the sanctions. In the past, he said, the enforcement of sanctions and measures ""hasn't necessarily been evenly applied and that's been a challenge.""Asked if the U.S. has any intention to apply the solution used in the Iranian nuclear problem to the North Korean issue, Kirby said the two cases are different, and the North's problem should be resolved through six-party talks.""We have long said, we are willing to resume this six-party process, but the onus is on the North ...They have not yet shown any inclination.

Security Council's ongoing discussions to punish North Korea for its fourth nuclear test last month.The North's notification coincided with a surprise visit to Pyongyang by China's top nuclear envoy, Wu Dawei.Wu is in Pyongyang to discuss the current situation, China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a brief statement to Yonhap News Agency, without elaborating.Wu is expected to try to dissuade North Korea from launching a long-range rocket while trying to bring the North back to the negotiating table on its nuclear weapons program.The nuclear talks -- which involve the host China, both Koreas, the U.S., Japan and Russia -- were last held in 2008.North Korea has repeatedly vowed to launch a series of satellites as part of its space development program.In 2012, North Korea launched a satellite for what it claimed were peaceful purposes.But South Korea, the United States and other regional powers suspect the North's satellite launch could be a cover for testing its ballistic missile technology, which is banned under U.N. resolutions.Experts say there is a technological similarity between a rocket launch and a long-range missile test. They also say a rocket can carry either a satellite or a warhead, so the technology in launching a satellite could be diverted for military purposes.In 2009, the North claimed it successfully put a satellite into orbit. However, South Korea and the U.S. said at the time that the launch was to test North Korea's ballistic missile technology and that no object entered orbit.","pyongyang to cancel rocket ,to cancel rocket launch ,urges pyongyang to cancel ,cancel rocket launch south ,on wednesday to cancel","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'North Korea', 'the International Maritime Organization', 'Cho Tae - yong']",28,"[ 1.          0.          2.         ... -0.62618566  0.70803505

The plan will focus on ways to expand the country's low-cost carrier  market and attract more Chinese tourists in step with airport developments taking place in other parts of Northeast Asia.""The goal is to fuel economic developments, help LCCs increase their market size and make regions more accessible to visitors that can lead to more economic growth and tourism,"" the ministry said.A feasibility study on Saemangeum, some 280 kilometers south of Seoul, is centered on an airport that can replace or augment a nearby airport in Gunsan that needs to be expanded.An airport in Saemangeum, a region reclaimed from tidal flats, can also make it more attractive to foreign investors, mainly from China.In regards to Seosan, which lies 151 kilometers south of the capital city, studies will be carried out on adding a passenger terminal to a military airbase that has two operational runways. A plan for Baengnyeong Island in the Yellow Sea near North Korea calls for building a small airport that can handle propeller planes. The island is home to over 5,000 people who can only reach the mainland by a long ferry trip. The remoteness has affected the island's ability to attract visitors and hindered development.The ministry said an airport built on Baengyeong, some 270 kilometers northwest of Seoul, will be similar to the airports approved for Ulleung Island in the East Sea and Heuksan Island in the Yellow Sea late last year.Besides the three airports that will be reviewed, the transportation ministry said it will decide where to build a new hub airport that will serve the whole of the Gyeongsang region in the southeastern part of the country. This airport must be built so planes can land and takeoff around the clock.Daegu, Ulsan, and the North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang provinces support Milyang as the candidate site for the new airport, while Busan, the country's largest sea port and No. 2 city, wants the airport to be built on Gadeok Island, not far from the existing Gimhae International Airport.The ministry said that even if a site for the new airport is selected, facilities at Gimhae airport, which are expected to hit full capacity in 2023, will be steadily expanded to meet the rise in international air passenger traffic.Besides the new airports, the transportation ministry said construction to add a second passenger terminal to Incheon International Airport is on time with the structure to be ready by 2017.Small regional airports for the islands of Heuksan and Ulleung will be open for passengers in 2020 and 2021, respectively, with the second airport on Jeju Island to be ready for passenger traffic in 2025, the ministry said.","new airports in three ,construction of new airports ,feasibility of new airports ,new airports the government ,transportation ministry said wednesday","['Korea Transport Institute', 'saemangeum', 'Seosan', 'Baengnyeong Island']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4436284   0.96391892

""That's one of our measures to secure Russia's support over the nuclear test.""Yun has yet to visit Moscow in his three years in office as the Park Geun-hye administration has largely focused on strengthening ties with China and bolstering the alliance with the U.S. Japan has also been a major diplomatic headache throughout the first half of Park's five-year term ending in early 2018.But Russia's backing will be critical in order to draw a powerful sanctions resolution from the U.N. Security Council because it is one of five permanent veto-wielding members, along with China, France, Britain and the U.S.Seoul and Washington have been pushing for a ""strong and comprehensive"" resolution differentiated from those of the past to force North Korea to finally give up its nuclear weapons program.Russia and China have so far expressed caution about punishing the North too hard, apparently out of concerns for their own security interests. China in particular is known to be resistant to the idea of a U.S.-allied, unified Korea at its borders.Yun said Russia will play an important role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula and leading the two Koreas to reunification.Park's signature foreign policy objectives -- the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative and the Eurasia Initiative -- cannot be fulfilled without Russia's help as they both seek to build stronger and broader links among countries in the region.Yun acknowledged Russia's contributions to the success of the Eurasia Express train expedition last year, which took mostly South Korean travelers on a 14,400-kilometer journey across Russia to Berlin. The expedition, meant to publicize the Eurasia Initiative, carried a message of peace and hope for inter-Korean reunification as it couldn't pass through the heavily fortified border between South and North.Moscow has invited Park for a visit, so the issue will be on the agenda if he goes to Russia, Yun said.""We think it is important to develop South Korea-Russia ties based on their own merits,"" he said.On South Korea's foreign policy objectives for the year, Yun stressed the importance of garnering international support for peace and reunification on the peninsula.He noted South Korea's growing role in the global community this year, including as chief of 10 international bodies for peace and security, development, and human rights and culture.""Of course, in multilateral diplomacy, what's most important is to contribute to universal values, but stemming from that will be something that can contribute to our foreign policy goals, including Korean Peninsula issues and particularly to the process of achieving peaceful reunification, which will be an important asset for reunification,"" he said.","top diplomat said tuesday ,mulls russia visit for ,its fourth nuclear test ,tuesday he is planning ,fm yun mulls russia","[""South Korea 's"", 'Russia', 'U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Yun Byung - se', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Seoul', 'Russia', 'China']",28,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.30708018  0.58811527

The Defense Ministry here last week introduced plans to connect its interface control center with that of the U.S., both installed at Osan air base here, through the “Link-16” system that allows real-time data sharing. South Korean chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lee Sun-jin and U.S. JCS chairman Joseph F.

The three nations clinched a trilateral intelligence-sharing arrangement in December 2014.“The fact that two sides share intelligence does not mean that we act according to the U.S. MD  system,” Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said during the briefing.  “The to-be-exchanged information is confined to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and thus does not portend our MD participation.”By Shin Hyon-hee","video conference next month ,fourth nuclear test officials ,korea fourth nuclear test ,hold video conference next ,latest provocation on jan","['the Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'North Korea ’s', 'Pyongyang']",28,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.38348636  0.74879837

On Wednesday, he is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam, according to the ministry.Local media are paying keen attention to whether or not the two sides will discuss the possible deployment of the U.S. advanced missile defense system, THAAD, in South Korea.Blinken's trip is part of a regional tour that took him to Japan over the weekend, where he held bilateral and trilateral talks with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts -- Lim and Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki.The three agreed to push for a ""strong and comprehensive"" U.N.Security Council resolution that will punish the North for its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6.They also urged China -- a veto-wielding permanent member of the council -- to join them in their efforts.Blinken is scheduled to visit China from Seoul amid Beijing's lukewarm stance toward tough sanctions on Pyongyang.Later Tuesday, South Korea's top nuclear envoy, Hwang Joon-kook, plans to meet with his Russian counterpart, Igor Morgulov, in Moscow in another diplomatic outreach move to draw a strong response from the council. Russia is also a permanent member, along with the U.S., France and Britain.North Korea announced that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, which is far more destructive than the conventional atomic weapons it tested in three previous experiments. Outside experts are highly skeptical of the claim.","seoul tuesday for talks ,recent nuclear test deputy ,top diplomat in seoul ,diplomat arrived in seoul ,arrived in seoul tuesday","['U.S.', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'North Korea', 'State', 'Tony Blinken', 'U.S.', 'Park']",28,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.3948341   0.38765204

During the talks, the Chinese side said it would join a new U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution, which is in the making.“Beijing said that as North Korea’s nuclear test violated UNSC resolutions and the 2005 joint declaration , China would participate in the UNSC resolution,” Yoon Soon-gu, director general of the international policy bureau at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, told reporters following his talks with his Chinese counterpart Guan Youfei.“During the talks, Beijing also said that it has publicly stated that it is absolutely opposed to North Korea’s development of nuclear arms and its nuclear test, and that it delivered such a message when it called in Pyongyang’s ambassador to Beijing,” he added.Yoon Soon-gu , director general of the international policy bureau at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Guan Youfei on Friday.Their talks came as Seoul has ratcheted up pressure on Beijing to cooperate in drawing up a new UNSC resolution entailing toughened sanctions so as to curb the growth of Pyongyang’s evolving nuclear program.China has so far been seen reluctant over the adoption of excessively harsh sanctions against its traditional ally. It has called on Seoul and other countries to exercise “restraint and caution” in responding to the North’s provocation. China’s stance has appeared different from those of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, which have vowed to craft “strong, comprehensive and meaningful” sanctions and argued the international community can no longer take a “business-as-usual” approach with the North.On the previous day, Seoul’s chief nuclear envoy Hwang Joon-kook held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei in Beijing. Hwang also pressured his counterpart to support the ongoing efforts to adopt stronger sanctions at the UNSC. There appeared to be a subtle difference in their positions as Wu reportedly stressed stronger yet “appropriate” sanctions against Pyongyang, while Hwang called for “stronger and comprehensive sanctions.” “South Korea and China shared the view that the international community should ‘clearly’ respond  through a UNSC sanctions resolution, and we agreed that we would continue our consultations on the details ,” Hwang told reporters after his talks with Wu.“We also shared the view that we need to make North Korea recognize that it cannot find an exit out  through its nuclear armament, and the view that North Korea should come out to the negotiating table with its denuclearization will and sincere attitude.”Hwang also met with Li Baodong, China’s vice foreign minister in charge of U.N. affairs.According to Hwang, Li said China was “actively” reviewing a draft of the UNSC sanctions resolution with a sense of urgency, and that it would closely cooperate with the South to adopt the resolution.China is viewed as the most crucial player for anti-Pyongyang sanctions, as it wields the greatest influence over the North that is heavily dependent on it for trade and various forms of aid including the supply of oil.The trade volume between China and the North accounts for more than 90 percent of Pyongyang’s overseas trade. The North is also known to secure 100 percent of its oil from China through a pipeline linking its border city of Sinuiju to Dandong in northeastern China.By Song Sang-ho","pyongyang recent nuclear test ,sanctions seoul on friday ,bomb test last wednesday ,punish pyongyang recent nuclear ,seoul on friday stepped","['Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60678375  0.6829471

Security Council’s “strong and comprehensive” embargos on the reclusive regime’s finance and trade. Speaking in her national address followed by a press conference, Park also stressed the looming crises on security and economic fronts, urging political parties to pass the pending bills on terrorism prevention and labor reforms.“National security and economy are the two key axes that sustain a country, but we are now facing an emergency situation in which both are at risk,” the president said in a televised event that ran for about 90 minutes.North Korea, the economy and reform were the main focuses of her speech, while Park also took time to criticize the National Assembly for idling. President Park Geun-hye. Cheong Wa DaeRegarding North Korea’s Jan. 6 nuclear test, the president said reinforced international sanctions are needed to impact the communist state and prodded China to play a more aggressive role.“ will make all diplomatic efforts to ensure that the UNSC adopts a powerful new resolution that may actually push North Korea to change its actions,” Park said.As the communist state has been under U.N. sanctions for its three previous nuclear tests, a mere reiteration of past restrictions will not be sufficient this time, according to the president.“China has repeatedly pledged to stamp out North Korea’s nuclear weapons,” she said.“But unless such determination is transferred into action, there will continue to be other nuclear tests that impede on the peace of the Korean Peninsula, and China is well aware of this.”China, in response to North Korea’s nuclear test, has reiterated a set of basic principles such as denuclearization and communication, but refrained from mentioning actual sanctions. The fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping has not returned Park’s calls in the wake of the nuclear test led to skeptic views on the bilateral ties of the two countries.“A good partner is one that would hold the other’s hand in times of difficulty. ... We believe that China will henceforth play its expected role as a permanent member of the UNSC,” Park said.Park also said the deployment of the U.S.’ THAAD missile defense system to South Korea would be reviewed in consideration of the North’s nuclear and missile threat.While acknowledging the calls to bring U.S. nuclear weapons as a defense against Pyongyang, the president maintained the “nuclear-free” policy for the Korean Peninsula.The state leader cited the North Korean factor to defend the series of bills that have been pending at the National Assembly amid partisan disagreement.“In order to respond to the potential attacks from North Korea or other terrorist organizations, the legislation of the terrorism prevention law is absolutely necessary,” she said.The president also spared a large part of her speech for economic reforms, focusing on how to boost employment.“The five pending labor-related bills are improvement plans to create jobs for youths and strengthen the social safety network,” she said.Park suggested the government and the labor compromise on the two most disputed bills that involve expanding the scope of dispatched workers and extending the maximum period of temporary workers.As an option, Park suggested the government to hold off on the bill regarding temporary workers for further discussion in return for the laborers to consent to enlarging the scope of dispatched workers that would include placing senior job seekers at small and medium-sized companies.The president also reiterated her stance on the diplomatic agreement with Japan on the surviving wartime sex slaves.“Past administrations have failed to properly address this difficult issue over the past 24 years,” she said of the Dec. 28 deal that is vehemently opposed by civic groups and the surviving victims. Seoul and Tokyo had verbally agreed to settle the issue with Japan’s apology, admittance of military involvement and a creation of a 1 billion yen  fund to compensate the victims. The protesters claim that the agreement made without prior consultation with the directly involved parties lack legal and ethical validity.“ deserves some credit for drawing the best possible result from such a tricky situation,” Park said, noting that the elderly survivors are not given much time.“With little time on our hands, the top priority and most realistic task is to restore their dignity while they are still alive.”Park’s address was attended by Cheong Wa Dae’s chief secretaries and some 130 members of local and overseas press.By Bae Hyun-jung","recent nuclear bomb test ,park vows strong sanctions ,pledged wednesday to impose ,strong sanctions on president ,its recent nuclear bomb","['Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'U.N.

The party changed its name to the Minjoo Party of Korea last week.""We have agreed that the goal of the new party is to put the livelihoods of the people first, narrow the wage gap and evenly improve the quality of the people's lives,"" Kim told reporters following a luncheon with Ahn.  When asked who will head the party, Ahn and Kim said they have not decided on the issue yet.The Ahn camp, which was scheduled to launch a preparation committee for the new party Friday, has been making efforts to bring in political heavyweights.""This party is not a party solely for Ahn Cheol-soo,"" Ahn said, adding that the two will make efforts to find the talents for the next general elections in April.Ahn announced his departure about a month ago following internal strife with incumbent Chairman Moon Jae-in.Ahn had called for Moon's resignation and party reform following the NPAD's crushing defeat in the parliamentary by-elections in April 2015. He left the party when negotiations with Moon over a leadership change fell through.A stream of similar desertions from the Minjoo Party are expected, with some assuming more lawmakers may follow suit by the end of January.Ahn, the founder of the nation's largest anti-virus software firm Ahnlab Co., co-founded the NPAD after merging Kim's main opposition Democratic Party with his supporters. Ahn jointly shared the party's top post with Kim for four months.","last month the party ,opposition party said thursday ,new party kim han ,month the party changed ,korea last week we","['Kim Han - gil', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Kim', 'the New Politics Alliance for Democracy', 'Ahn', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",28,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68680876  0.60165346

""It had also limited contacts by South Koreans with North Koreans at the complex.""The official said that South Korea plans to retrieve the thermal devices from the North later in the day.The reclusive communist country has been highly sensitive to the outbreak of contagious diseases because of concerns about its weak health care system.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un delivers his New Year`s message live on the North`s television on Friday.    In his New Year's message delivered live on the North's television, Kim said North Korea is open to having candid dialogue with the South. He did not mention the North's nuclear weapons program.   ""We will make aggressive efforts to hold talks and improve relations with South Korea,"" Kim said in the speech, which lasted about 30 minutes. ""We are willing to have talks in an open-minded manner with anyone who wants peace and unification.""   He called on Seoul to honor an inter-Korean deal reached in August to defuse military tension, urging it to refrain from doing acts that hurt what it called a conciliatory mood.""   The two Koreas reached a rare deal in August to ease military tension following a land mine blast near the inter-Korean border blamed on North Korea.   As part of such a deal, the two sides held high-level talks over how to mend ties last month, but they ended the meeting without any agreement, dimming the outlook for their ties.   His speech came days after Kim Yang-gon, the leader's key aide, who handled inter-Korean affairs, died in a car accident Tuesday, which analysts said could cast a cloud over Seoul-Pyongyang ties.   In the address, Kim expressed his willingness to improve ties with Seoul but fell short of commenting on a possible inter-Korean summit. The North's leader also rebuked Seoul for the South's unification policy, which Pyongyang has called Seoul's attempt to absorb the North.   Last year, Kim called for a ""big shift"" in inter-Korean relations in his New Year's message, saying that he is willing to hold summit talks with President Park Geun-hye if conditions are met.   ""At a time when inter-Korean relations remain deadlocked, North Korea passed the responsibility for the strained ties to the South,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies atDongguk University in Seoul. ""It may hint at the North waiting for Seoul to make the first move.""   North Korean leader's New Year's message is closely monitored by South Korea and others as it offers clues to the annual policy goals by the secretive communist state.   For the fourth straight year, Kim Jong-un delivered a verbal message on the first day of the new year.   Kim did not mention North Korea's nuclear weapons program in what may be a gesture not to irritate China ahead of the North's key party event in May.   Kim has been pursuing the development of a nuclear arsenal while boosting the country's fragile economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy. Seoul and Washington have warned that theNorth's dual-track policy is a dead end.   Kim also stressed the need to rebuild its moribund economy without touching on the nuclear issue. But he also said that North Korea should continue to build up its military capability by producing various striking means.   ""All efforts should be directed toward building an economic power and there should be a fresh turn in the development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards,"" he said.   The North Korean leader stressed the importance of holding the upcoming congress by the Workers' Party of Korea, calling for thorough preparations for the event.   The North's ruling party plans to hold the first congress in more than three decades in May, when Kim may unveil new lines of policies and conduct a major reshuffle.   ""This year is a significant year, which will greet the 7th Congress of the WPK,"" he said, calling for efforts to make the party event a ""glorious"" one.","for unification north korean ,friday to improve ties ,television on friday yonhap ,efforts friday to improve ,unification north korean leader","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'South Korea', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim', 'North Korea']",28,"[ 1.          0.          1.         ... -0.81904179  0.82022864
