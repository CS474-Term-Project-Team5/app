The Seoul High Court in September 2015 overturned a district court ruling that fined Cho 5 million won  for spreading false rumors about his rival, Koh Seung-duk, during the election campaign.The previous sentence reached in April of the same year could have nullified the election if confirmed by the Supreme Court.In Tuesday's ruling, the top court agreed with the lower court's ruling that ordered Cho to pay a fine of 2.5 million won, suspended for two years, for his public comments against Koh, which the court deemed were not malicious and did not affect the results of the election. During the 2014 campaign, Cho falsely accused Koh of using his US green card to educate his two children in the United States, after announcing at a press conferences on May 25, 2014, that he was tipped off about Koh's alleged acquisition of US citizenship.It was seen as a move to stress that Koh was not qualified to lead the education system in South Korea if the allegations were true.Koh denied being a US permanent resident and said his children are US citizens by birth.","2014 election however suspended ,convicted seoul chief educator ,court on tuesday upheld ,seoul chief educator suspended ,chief educator suspended sentence","['the Supreme Court', 'Seoul', 'First Petty Bench', 'Cho Hee - yeon', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Septem']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11197295  0.04519035

The special committee seeks to hold a hearing with Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is in custody at a detention facility on the outskirts of Seoul, at 10:00 a.m. and Ahn Jong-beom, former senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, and Jeong Ho-seong, former secretary for private presidential affairs, later in the day.But observers said the committee's visit may end in vain. The three figures had said they would not attend the hearing, saying their testimonies could affect an on-going investigation by independent prosecutors. There is no legal ground to force witnesses to attend a parliamentary hearing. The special committee hosted five sessions at the parliament this month, summoning presidential staff members, business tycoons and other figures involved in the influence-peddling scandal. Choi allegedly exerted power over state affairs without any government position and used her ties with the president to extort money from businesses. During an interrogation by special prosecutors Sunday, Choi denied new allegations that she stashed around 10 trillion won  abroad. She told investigators that she would donate all the money to the state, if there were any such money, according to the independent counsel team.Local media reported Choi may have hidden 800 billion won in Germany and more in other European countries via her ghost companies.The independent counsel on the scandal said the team has hired a former state tax agency official to trace Choi's assets at home and abroad.Choi and Ahn are suspected of forcing conglomerates to donate 77.4 billion won to the Mir and K-Sports Foundations, which she virtually controlled.Sources said that the team will also track down dubious assets Choi's family amassed over the past 40 years.Choi is the fifth daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min.The late Choi, who used to lead a religious cult, had reportedly advised Park since her mother, Yook Young-soo, was assassinated by a North Korea sympathizer in 1974.","visit detention center monday ,south korean lawmakers ,scandal at detention center ,in scandal involving president ,detention center monday","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'the National Assembly', 'Park', 'Seoul', 'Ahn Jong - beom']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.13869368  0.45667258

Ban Ki-moon Although Ban, a former foreign minister, has not clearly declared his intention to join the presidential race, his name has long been bandied about as an odds-on presidential contender on the ruling party ticket. Observers here anticipate that Ban will begin political activities after the end of his second five-year term as UN helmsman at the end of this year.""I have been musing about how and where I will dedicate myself,"" he said. ""I will determine  after I meet citizens from various walks of life and listen to their opinions. What is most important is citizens' thoughts.""During the interview, Ban made an unusual criticism of South Korea's establishment political parties long plagued by factional feuds and partisan wrangling, but he did not rule out the possibility of his future tie-up with a political bodies.""You can't do politics all by yourself,"" he said. ""There should be some sort of means and a vision.""Commenting on the political scandal that has threatened to end President Park Geun-hye's presidency, Ban pointed out that citizens are frustrated and enraged by the ""lack of good governance,"" and that the fault lies with the ""system and leadership."" ""The genuine leadership... genuinely inclusive leadership comes from harmony, integration, inclusive dialogue, national cohesion and social integration. That is what I have usually thought of as the crux of the leadership,"" he said.Mentioning the massive anti-Park candlelight vigils that have taken place across the country over the past two months, he said that he felt saddened and heavy-hearted.""As those deep-rooted evils have been brought to the fore, we should get together and fix them,"" he said. Asked if he has given any thought to use his title as a former UN chief on the international stage, rather than in domestic politics, Ban said that at the current juncture, it is ""more urgent"" for him to work for his own country and fellow citizens.""It is not like I can't carry out any international task while engaging in domestic affairs. I can handle both,"" he said.As for the date of his return to South Korea, Ban reiterated that he would return to Korea in mid-January. Upon his return home, he will first pay a courtesy call to Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and meet with other national leaders including National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, the outgoing UN chief said.During the interview, the UN chief criticized North Korea as the ""most irresponsible"" country among the 193 UN member states.He also expressed concerns about Pyongyang's evolving nuclear and missile technologies, which he said would pose a ""hard-to-handle"" security challenge at some point.Following Ban's apparent show of presidential ambitions, the main opposition Democratic Party renewed its stance against his run for the presidency.""It is undesirable for the UN secretary-general to snoop around the murky domestic political arena,"" Choo Mi-ae, the party's leader, told reporters.The minor opposition People's Party, however, showed its interest in inviting him into its party's primary race.""I think he can join us,"" said Kim Dong-cheol, the interim leader of the party.","president in south korea ,south korea next year ,his presidential ambition ,for president in south ,would run for president","['UN', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'UN', 'the Republic of Korea', 'Ban', 'South Kore']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78399509  0.36219266

At the current pace, the amount for all of 2016 is widely expected to reach nearly 600 billion won.  Experts said the amount is just the tip of the iceberg because a large number of fraudulent and unfair health insurance claims go undetected. Health care scams include phantom treatments, double billing and unneeded care.A report by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs shows that false and improper health insurance claims cost the state health insurer 1.04 trillion won in 2013.Local health care providers' false and unfair claims are cited as a major drag on the coffers of the taxpayer-funded health insurance program, with lawmakers calling for more on-the-spot inquiries to counter fraud and manage the insurance fund more effectively.Currently, the state service conducts on-the-spot inquiries into only 1 percent of all health care providers in the country.As part of efforts to prevent money leaks, the state health insurer operates a reward program for informants and unveils the list of false claimants.","won 456 million in ,korea big this year ,billion won in 2015 ,594 billion won in ,billion won 456 million","['South Korea', 'the National Health Insurance Service']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1651141   0.4122189

South Korean Minister of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Cho Yoon-sun and China National Tourism Administration Chairman Li Jinzao presided over the celebration of the yearlong national drive to promote Korean tourism among the Chinese on Thursday.The event came amid growing diplomatic tension over Seoul's decision to set up a U.S. missile defense system called THAAD next year to better counter increasing North Korean threats. Beijing fiercely opposes the plan, which it said would harm its strategic interests in the region. In an apparent retaliation, China has restricted cultural exchanges in the tourism and entertainment sectors. In his opening remark, Li said the two countries, with geographical proximity and cultural similarity, should cooperate in the tourism sector for mutual benefits.  Li also openly expressed his concern that the on-going feud over THAAD could have negative impacts on bilateral relations down the road.Saying that the bilateral relations have recently faced new challenges and are heading toward an uncertain era, he stressed that the two governments should seek solutions together to secure conditions for solid cooperation in tourism. His remarks apparently suggested that unless disagreements between Seoul and Beijing are resolved, cooperation in the tourism sector won't get any easier next year.Echoing the sentiment, Culture Minister Cho relayed the concerns shared by the Korean tourism industry and sought Li's active cooperation in keeping private exchanges intact from political conflicts.In her celebratory address, Cho emphasized the importance of keeping private exchanges flourishing regardless of political situations. ""In 1992, when the two countries established diplomatic ties, there were only 100,000 mutual visits. After 20 years, the number has passed 10 million,"" she said. ""The 'Visit Year' events this year and last year helped bring about the era of 20 million visits. ""We will continue inviting  to Korea, and , we will try to show a new side of Korea,"" she said. Participants said the overall atmosphere appeared to be better than previously expected. During his speech, Li lightened the mood by speaking simple Korean several times. They later shared their thoughts on the results of the tourism campaign over dinner.","korea china tourism campaign ,2016 campaign in beijing ,beijing in ceremony overshadowed ,over korea china tourism ,the chinese on thursday","['South Korea', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Cho Yoon - sun', 'China National Tourism Administration', 'Li Jinzao', 'korean', 'Chinese']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27090099  0.39465484

Celebrating the first year since the launch of the Seoul foreign residents’ council, a total of 38 representatives from 23 countries and different walks of life gathered for a general assembly at the Seoul City Hall.“We represent some 460,000 foreigners residing in Seoul,” said Taki Yukari, a Japanese office worker who settled in Seoul five years ago.“As a chair of the counsel, I feel  good amount of pressure to deliver ideas  that can spark changes in Seoul. I’m also glad that we’re starting to see some changes for the multicultural population here,” said Yukari, commencing the meeting.Members of the representative council for Seoul’s foreign residents participate in a meeting at Seoul City hall on Wednesday. Launched in December 2015, the representative counsel for Seoul’s foreign residents kicked off as an advisory body under Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Women and Family Policy Affairs division, with the aim of directly hearing from foreign residents and about the difficulties they face. Latest data from Seoul City shows that foreigners from 117 different countries have paid 15.7 billion won  in taxes to Seoul so far this year, up 19 percent from the corresponding period in 2012. Since its first meeting in July, 14 suggestions made by the representatives were adopted into policies at Seoul City.One of the policies was to publish and distribute disaster prevention guideline booklets in 11 different languages for the convenience of foreigners. “We were impressed by the depth and variety of suggestions they bring up during meetings,” Eom Gyu-sook, head of the Women and Family Policy Affairs division told The Korea Herald.“As Seoul City’s work ethic states ‘governance through communication,’ we will continue to make improvements through ongoing communication with experts, foreign residents, travelers and more,” she said.On Wednesday, Karolina Zasadzka, who moved to Seoul from Poland three years ago, raised a point regarding Seoul’s public transportation.Zasadzka said that Seoul’s bike roads are not only small in numbers but authorities have also failed to properly control the speed limit of users and manage bike parking, compared to other companies.“In Poland, citizens who use public transportation can enjoy privileges such as discounts in transportation fares, parking fees or even free museum passes. Seoul should adopt more user-friendly advantages to develop a bike riding culture for the environment,” she said.Zasadzka said that Seoul could tap on a K-pop celebrity to become an ambassador to promote Seoul’s bike roads and bike rental services, raising user awareness. Seoul City welcomed the suggestion.“We like the idea of promoting Seoul’s bike riding system, since it could be significant in helping citizens avoid traffic congestion as well as to save the Earth,” said an official from the Public Transportation Service division at Seoul City.To become eligible to work for the counsel, members need to receive recommendations from 10 foreigners residing in Seoul and go through examination by a selection committee at Seoul City.Twice a year, all of the members gather to suggest ideas on issues largely divided into three sections: human rights and culture, improvements in the living environment and the strengthening of residents’ abilities.By Kim Da-sol","in seoul on wednesday ,seoul on wednesday shared ,seoul on wednesday ,the seoul city hall ,assembly at the seoul","['Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Taki Yukari']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3564966   0.30757496

Yet, the message was stern and unforgiving: President Park Geun-hye should be removed from office right now, not several months later.The protests, which flared up Saturday in Seoul and at over 60 locations throughout the country, were a clear sign of growing public anger toward the president over an influence-peddling and corruption scandal, as well as the political parties that have so far failed to remove her from office. An estimated 2.32 million -- 1.7 million in Seoul -- poured onto the streets to ramp up pressure on the embattled leader.  If the tally, counted by rally organizers, is correct, it is the biggest in the nation’s history, estimated at more than double the size of that in June 1987 when about 1 million people poured onto the streets to protest for democracy. Candlelight fills the streets of central Seoul on Saturday, where the sixth massive anti-President Park Geun-hye is taking place. The protestors chanted “Park Geun-hye, step down immediately. It is the public’s order” and “Arrest Park Geun-hye” while holding their candles. Many held signs reading “Impeach Park Geun-hye.”“President Park is delaying stepping down, leaving the decision on her own presidency up to the parliament,” Kim Seong-ju, 27, told The Korea Herald in Gwanghwamun Square. “That way, she is sparking infighting in the National Assembly. We  have no option but to topple the president ourselves.”A day earlier, three opposition parties submitted an impeachment bill against Park, aiming for a vote on Friday. The bill’s submission and voting schedule has been delayed by one week and the prospects of its passage have also been dimmed by the embattled president’s surprise offer Tuesday to cut her term short. Park has asked the parliament to decide the timetable for her early departure. Park’s Saenuri Party, controlling 128 votes of the 300-member parliament -- enough to thwart the opposition-led move -- suggested a schedule in which Park would be allowed to stay in office until April next year. “I think Park’s third televised address  was a sophisticated political ploy. Now, the public fury, which was directed at President Park and her confidante Choi Soon-sil, spreads to the National Assembly,” said Seo Young-soo, 23.  Before the main candlelight vigil that began at 6 p.m. in Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, some 500,000 protesters marched toward the Presidential Office of Cheong Wa Dae.  They were allowed to march up to 100 meters from Cheong Wa Dae. Last week, protesters were blocked from further access at Cheongwundong Community Center, 200 meters from the presidential palace. “As we are only 100 meters away from President Park in her office, I hope our voices are better delivered,” said Choi Jeong-seon, 53. “The opposition parties should join forces to impeach her.” Showing the public anger directed at lawmakers opposing Park’s impeachment, some protesters flocked to the Saenuri Party headquarters in Yeouido, southwestern Seoul.“The Saenuri Party is an accomplice to President Park’s crimes. Ignoring the public’s voices, she is clinging on to power. She should step down right now,” said Park Jae-young, 29. Some threw eggs at the banner on the building reading: “Dear Koreans, we are really sorry. We will get state affairs back on track as soon as possible.”They tore apart a large party flag during the rally. On the other side of Seoul, some 15,000 loyal supporters of President Park gathered in front of Dongdaemun Design Plaza, denouncing anti-Park protestors as “witch-hunting” the president. The police tally of attendance was 1,500. President Park Geun-hye’s approval rating remained at a record-low 4 percent this week, a Gallup Korea poll showed Friday, while 91 percent disapproved of her. So far, the cumulative number of Koreans who participated in the past six weeks of anti-Park protests has exceeded 6 million, according to rally organizers.  Police’s tally of Saturday’s protest was 320,000 in Seoul and 104,000 more across the nation.

Education programs for young defectors and job training will be strengthened, it added.The move comes as the number of North Koreans entering the country topped 30,000 on Nov. 11 with the total reaching 30,021 as of Monday.The number of North Koreans escaping to the South hit an all-time high of 2,914 in 2009. The pace of annual growth had slowed since 2011 as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered tighter border control, according to Seoul's unification ministry.But this year the pace has picked up again with even North Korean elites, including diplomats, abandoning the repressive country to seek freedom in the South.A case in point is Thae Yong-ho, a former minister at the North's embassy in London, who defected to South Korea with his family in late July. He has become one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials to escape to the South.The government earlier said that the reasons for defections markedly changed as a growing number of North Koreans have fled the North for noneconomic reasons since 2000. More and more defectors have cited aspirations for freedom and dissatisfaction with Pyongyang and tighter surveillance as the reasons they decided to leave their homeland.The portion of such escapees shot up to 87.8 percent in the 2014-2016 period, compared with 33.3 percent tallied in the years before 2001.The ministry said that a rise in ""immigration-style"" defections seems to be affected by the fact that more North Koreans are coming into contact with South Korean culture and information.The government said the new support measures are being unveiled to take into account the changing trend of defections and meet their needs so they can resettle successfully in the South.It said previously, Seoul focused on providing protection to defectors and helping them stand on their own feet, which did help boost the overall employment rate for defectors.But as such policies fell short of raising their quality of life, the government said it has decided to come up with measures to promote their ""social integration"" into society.","korea on sunday unveiled ,support north korean defectors ,help defectors better integrate ,south korea on sunday ,korean defectors including ways","['South Korea', 'north korean', 'the Ministry of Unification', 'south korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15021317  0.5389902

Four officials from the North’s National Academy of Sciences received a four months of training from September last year at a startup space run by Singapore’s state-run venture capital firm, Infocomm Investments, company officials said Wednesday. Dubbed Build Amazing Startups Here, or BASH, the Southeast Asian country’s largest all-in-one facility brings together all stakeholders across the value chain, from young startup hopefuls and entrepreneurs to accelerators and incubators. photo credit: Shin Hyon-hee/The Korea HeraldThe “accelerators” -- largely former and incumbent corporate executives -- are tasked with assessing market demand for product development and then helping build startups. BASH also offers office space and other support for free to the up-and-coming entrepreneurs. With the mentor system, the overall success rate easily tops 40 percent, compared with below 1 percent posted by the traditional scheme, Infocomm head Alex Lin said. During their stay, the four North Koreans studied the new incubation system in a perceived bid to harness the country’s relatively advanced information technology skills, such as in courting investors to its special economic zones, Infocomm officials said. The move has been deemed part of the Kim Jong-un regime’s efforts to explore fresh ways to secure hard currency, as it has been struggling to keep its economy afloat amid tightening international sanctions over its nuclear programs. In August 2014, North Korean researchers and businesspeople took part in a two-week workshop as part of Choson Exchange’s Tech Start PY program, focusing on helping foster an entrepreneurial culture and a favorable environment for startups there, according to the Guardian newspaper. Last July, the Financial Times reported the communist state held its maiden, weeklong startup fair at a university, though it was attended by six foreign professors and students only, without any real venture firms or investors. While showing a keenness and high ability to learn as well as technical expertise, the North Koreans confronted two main challenges: language barriers and their lack of fundamental understanding of a “market-driven economy.” “ was their ability to translate their thinking into the market. They don’t communicate with markets enough to be able to find out what is needed and to adjust,” Lin told visiting Korean reporters. It remains unknown whether and how the officials have utilized their lessons in their own business projects. Since their return home, they have rarely been in touch, though they did send emails once in a while, he noted. “But they’ve seen more customers here, and would see more customers back home. That would help them a lot. That is the change.” By Shin Hyon-hee  Korea Herald Correspondent","entrepreneurial domain startups four ,unlikely entrepreneurial domain startups ,last year at startup ,startups singapore though north ,startups four officials from","['SINGAPORE', 'North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'the North ’s National Academy of Sciences', 'Singapore', 'Infocomm Investments']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22768338  0.42164901

With President Park Geun-hye determined to cling to power, opposition parties are campaigning for a parliamentary impeachment motion whose passage will set the stage for the nation’s second impeachment trial in history. The Korea Herald interviewed six prominent law experts over the phone to find out what to expect from the looming trial. The following are excerpts from the interviews: The Korea Herald: Does President Park’s alleged wrongdoing constitute grounds for impeachment? Lim Ji-bongLim Ji-bong, a professor at Sogang University Law School: President Park violated the Constitution. Her governing authority was granted by the people through election, but she transferred  to an individual never elected by the people. Therefore, she violated the Constitution’s first and 67th clauses that state Korea is a democratic republic and its president is elected by the people. The president also kicked out public officials who she thought did not support the athletic career of Choi’s daughter. That constitutes violation of the basic law’s seventh clause designed to protect the status of public officials working for the people. All of these show that the president disrupted the very basis of our Constitutional system. It is a grave violation of the Constitution and, by extension, other relevant laws. I think there is sufficient case for the president to be impeached.  Shin PyungShin Pyung, a professor at Kyungpook National University School of Law and chairman of the Korean Constitutional Law Association: Charges  are 99 percent confirmed by the prosecution, so I think it is quite possible to impose liability.Han Sang-hieHan Sang-hie, a professor at Konkuk University Law School: She broke the constitutional order and violated the nation’s liberal democracy. She messed with the separation of powers and privatized state power. Lee Heon-hwanLee Heon-hwan, a professor at Ajou Univeristy Law School: As she is a sitting president and immune to criminal prosecution, there is no way we can find out whether she is guilty of a crime or not. That’s why the Constitution makes it possible through an impeachment process.  Huh YoungHuh Young, a professor emeritus at Kyung Hee University Law School and the first president of the Constitutional Research Institute for the Constitutional Court: The president is subject to the impeachment process because she violated both the Constitution and other law. By consulting with Choi Soon-sil on important state affairs and following through on her instructions, she violated the Constitution. Her allegation prescribed in the prosecutors’ arraignment shows that she also breached other laws Jeon Hak-seonJeon Hak-seon, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and a former member of the Constitutional Research Institute: I think there are enough grounds for launching an impeachment. Even though the president is not indicted by the prosecutors and has refused to undergo their investigation, the impeachment process is warranted because it is a totally separate procedure.KH: What are your views on the Constitutional Court’s ruling for the president, following a parliamentary motion for her impeachment? Huh: Given the circumstances, I think the court will reach a different conclusion from the ruling on the late President Roh Moo-hyun.  Shin: Some conservative judges hold positions at the court, but this issue is not about conservatism and liberalism. It is a severe matter which can shake the root of this republic nation. With patriotism, the judges will make a right decision.Jeon: I think the parliamentary motion will hold the key. It must clearly state what Park has violated and how. Han: It is hard to tell. I think it will depend on the dynamics of public sentiment. Regardless of the outcome, the fact that impeachment will keep the president from doing her duty would be seen as progress in the current situation. Lee: If the judges’ decisions were to be affected by the fact that they were recommended and appointed by the president, it would be in violation of the constitution. Those kinds of judges are not qualified to be on the bench. Lim: An impeachment could be difficult if the special probe cannot yield decisive evidence linking Park to corruption charges. I’m also worried about votes at the National Assembly. Some say 32 Saenuri members will vote for impeachment, but it is unclear whether two-thirds of the National Assembly will really cast their votes during a secret ballot. KH: How long will the court proceedings take? Huh: It only took two months and five days for former President Roh. It should be shorter this time, three months at the longest. Han: There is a chance that the trial could drag on, particularly with the replacements of two judges who will finish their term early next year. But I think the court can speed up and come to a conclusion soon. Citizens and the National Assembly should put pressure on this.Lim: I think it will take about three months to pass the impeachment motion in the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court will then have to rule in 180 days, and it is very likely the court will take the whole period. It is a matter involving the president’s removal from office and is likely to involve a large amount of lengthy documents and materials for judges to check. KH: Can Park resign while being tried? Huh: No, she cannot. By law, high-profile officials involved with an impeachment process are banned from being dismissed or offering their resignations. Lim: The president can step down. Appointed government officials who are impeached are banned from holding public office for five years afterwards. So once the impeachment process begins, resignation is not accepted to prevent the person from avoiding punishment. However, the president is not appointed but elected, meaning there is no one to stop her from resigning. Han: It is possible for the president to step down. For the elected presidential position, there is no law to prevent the president from resigning. She can leave the office as soon as she announces it. No rule clearly prevents the president from quitting. KH: Can the prosecution take forceful measures to investigate Park? Can Park be arrested or detained? Huh: While in office, the president cannot undergo a forced probe. The president cannot be arrested or detained. Han: President Park is an important figure who represents Korea and leads diplomatic relations. That is why she has immunity from criminal charges. During the impeachment process, however, she is suspended from her presidential duties so a mandatory probe should be possible. Still, unelected officials -- prosecutors and judges -- arresting or detaining an elected president can be seen as lacking legitimacy. Lee: A compulsory investigation is not done on the incumbent president because it could interrupt her carrying out her presidential duty. Once she is impeached, she is stripped of her Constitutional privilege, so she won’t be able to avoid the investigation. Jeon: Theoretically, it is possible but one should proceed carefully. The president is immune to criminal prosecution. Shin: It is a sensitive issue and there is not a definite answer to the question. A mandatory probe is only possible when the charges are obvious. The need for an investigation on the president is incontestably apparent, but she is trying to conceal and avoid the probe.By Yeo Jun-suk","nation second impeachment trial ,south korea with president ,campaigning for parliamentary impeachment ,second impeachment trial ,second impeachment trial in","['South Korea', 'Park Geun', 'the Korea Herald']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29090157  0.06426962

Sensitive habitats, endangered species and the marine food chain need to be maintained to keep the oceans healthy and productive,” said Caleo, who visited Seoul for the second series of Panda Talks hosted by World Wide Fund for Nature on Monday. As an Asia-Pacific regional director at the Marine Stewardship Council, Caleo said MSC certification and eco labeling enables everybody to play a part in healthy food selection, as well as securing the future for our oceans.Patrick Caleo, Asia Pacific Regional director at Marine Stewardship Council, talks during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul on Monday. Founded in 1997 under the joint effort of WWF and Unilever, MSC was established to address the problem of unsustainable fishing and safeguard seafood supplies for the future. According to WWF’s Marine Living Planet Index, about 700 million people around the world consume marine products as their main source of protein and over the past 40 years the marine population has halved. As of 2016, about 10 percent of some 100 billion tons of marine products sold in the market annually are certified with MSC’s eco-label. At least 250 fisheries and 1,600 distributors around the globe are participating in this program. MSC certified fisheries meet robust requirements in terms of fish stocks, impact on the ecosystem and effective management. They are also encouraged to develop new ways to conserve the marine environment for future generations.“Our team of scientists go there and look at all of aspects of fishery performances. The result takes years and if successful, fisheries earn the right to use the MCS eco-label,” Caleo explained.Fisheries also regularly receive MSC standard counseling and improvement tools for development, as well as being continuously monitored in their progress toward MSC certification.Caleo, with his 20 years of experience working with seafood, joined the MSC in 2008 to support the development of the program within the Asia Pacific region. Over the past five years, the MSC program in the Asia Pacific has expanded significantly, enjoying strong acceptance in many parts of the region including Hong Kong, Sydney, Beijing and Tokyo. While the MSC eco-labeling program has been strongest in European countries, where supermarkets have 8-9,000 products for consumers to choose from, the program recently penetrated the Chinese market. As for Korea, there are 17 MSC-certified products sold in the market and 28 companies with certification which can purchase MSC-certified products as a supplier, such as Ottogi, Hansung Food, Ikea.“We are seeing more Korean fisheries showing interest in getting MSC certification. Once consumers here start to make a choice for MSC-certified products, they will realize how easy it is to track down where it came from,” said Caleo.For the first time in Korea, Pukyung University in Busan kicked off a project in June in collaboration with MSC.In early November, the university signed a memorandum of understanding with MSC to spread awareness and promote its eco labeling.“There are other country based schemes. But MSC is by far the easiest program for consumers to participate in. When you pick sea bass labeled ‘certified sustainable,’ at a supermarket, you are helping to protect the world’s oceans from overfishing. That sets us apart from any other schemes,” said Caleo.

WWF’s second series of Panda Talks in Korea was held at Seoul City Hall on Monday, aiming to raise awareness and public consensus by taking steps toward sustainable market transformation.Attended by some 200 participants, the Panda Talks were presented by five speakers who came to share their insights on ways to avoid damaging natural systems in the production of goods. Jason Clay, senior vice president of the WWF US, shared his visions and solutions to the challenges of sustainable development in the food and private sectors. Jason Clay, senior vice president of WWF US, talks during WWF Korea’s Panda Talk at Seoul City Hall on Monday. Clay said that WWF’s market transformation initiative is targeted at 500 major global companies which control about 70 percent of the world market for priority commodities. He also noted the environmental risks, availability of raw materials as well as reputations of those companies. “We all should have sustainable choices, instead of a choice about sustainable products.” he added.Joanne Park, the public relations director at Coca Cola, took to the stage as the second speaker and talked about how to build a sustainable business within a sustainable community.Citing the example of the 2020 Environmental Sustainability Goals, which was initiated in 2013 with the WWF, Park said that the partnership between the government, businesses and civil society is significant.“We have given back an estimated 115 percent of the water we use in our products to communities and nature as of 2015. By 2020, we are aiming to safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equivalent to what we use in our finished beverages and their production. For every drop we use, we give one back.”Wi Ji-yeon, CEO of abalone distributor Cheongsanbada Co. and Patrick Caleo, Asia-Pacific regional director at the Marine Stewardship Council, also shared their ideas on why it is important to purchase sustainable food products and how such choices can lead to market transformation. “In a world where the true value of companies is mostly based on money,  should give ourselves the question of who we should target as the market transformation initiator,” said Kim Sung-woo, regional head of climate change & sustainability at Samjong KPMG.“When smart companies consider environmental and social benefits along with sustainability goals, they will gain not only reputation but high CSR  values converted into monetary terms in return,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","largest environmental group wwf ,panda talks in korea ,group wwf second series ,world largest environmental group ,held at seoul city","['the World Wide Fund for Nature', 'Panda Talks', 'Korea']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14342852  0.49014294

It said that Park received briefings or issued directives, related to the tragedy, some 30 times on April 16 when the ferry Sewol sank in waters off the southwestern island of Jindo, leaving some 300 passengers, mostly young students, dead or missing.It marks the first time that the presidential office has clarified through it’s website Park’s exact location on the day of the sinking. Cheong Wa Dae posted information on its official website in a section dedicated to “correcting false reports and rumors.”The new revelation, however, is unlikely to quell the controversy over Park’s mishandling of the national disaster. It only reconfirmed that the president was never briefed by anyone in person or held a meeting, while the nation watched the ferry slowly sink on live TV, with hundreds of students on a class trip trapped inside. In an indication of her lack of understanding of the situation, Park had showed up at the disaster control center at around 5:15 p.m., seven hours after the incident, and asked, “Why is it hard to find those students? I heard they all had life vests on.” This had given rise to rumors that she may have been absent from Cheong Wa Dae for the seven hours or for some reason unable to tend to her duties. The presidential office, last week, denied one of the rumors that Park was under anesthesia related to a cosmetic medical procedure. Rep. Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Democratic Party lambasted Cheong Wa Dae’s new explanation, saying it means Park never left her home that day, not even for her own office. “That Park used her office in residence is synonymous with that Park did not even come to work that day,” said Moon, who served as the chief of staff to the late President Roh Moo-hyun.“What did you do during those urgent hours, not come to work?” the opposition political asked. Cheong Wa Dae argued the president is on duty, regardless of where she is and that the office in her residence is one of Park’s three working spaces in Cheong Wa Dae, along with the main station in the office building and another office in the secretariat building.   From news reports","the 2014 ferry disaster ,2014 ferry disaster cheong ,2014 ferry disaster ,disaster president park geun ,the 2014 ferry","['Park Geun', 'Park ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.2311528   0.58274543

The Ministry of Education said Monday that it would extend a special inspection for four days into the allegations that Ewha Womans University manipulated the admissions process and grading system for Chung.   The inspectors dispatched by the ministry are set to call in Namgung Kon, chief of admissions, who allegedly ordered faculty members to select a student who brought a “gold medal” to the admissions interview. Chung was reportedly the only one wearing a gold medal -- which she won at the 2014 Asian Games -- at the interview. Chung Yoo-ra competes in the 2014 Asian Games The school is suspected of adding horseback riding to a list of categories open to student athletes in 2014, right before Chung’s admission. It also allegedly stretched its own rules to consider Chung’s medal even though she won it four days after the application deadline. The ministry is also looking into whether professors gave her overly generous grades despite her not turning in assignments and missing most of her classes. The school also allegedly changed its school policy to grant student athletes grades if they submit documents as evidence.Starting on Monday, the ministry is set to grill professors suspected of giving Chung preferential treatment.  “The result will be released as soon as the inspection is over,” said an official from the ministry. A separate on-site inspection by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education into the alleged special favors for Chung widened to her elementary and middle schools, which are suspected of receiving kickbacks from her mother. The education office is slated to release an interim result Tuesday. Chung’s school Chungdam High School is accused of creating a program in 2011 to accept dressage athletes, right before her admission in 2012, in what many critics see as an attempt to find a way to accept Chung. The focus is on whether she turned up to enough classes in order to meet graduation criteria. Under the current law, she was required to attend at least two-thirds of classes to graduate from the schools. She allegedly attended her high school for only 28 out of 193 days in her senior year. There is a possibility that her graduation from high school as well as her entrance into Ewha Womans University will be canceled if her records of attendance prove to be fabricated. The prosecution also continued to investigate allegations that Chung received special treatment from Korea’s governing body for dressage.  It summoned former and current executive directors from the Korea Equestrian Federation on Saturday to investigate whether the organization pulled strings to have Chung sponsored by Samsung Electronics and qualify for the national team for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.Prosecutors earlier found that Samsung Electronics last year transferred some 2.8 million euros  to Core Sports, a company in Germany established by Choi and Chung. Some of the money was used to buy a horse for Chung and to cover training expenses in Germany.According to a news report by TV network SBS, the government allegedly promised support for Samsung in return for the firm financially supporting Choi and her daughter. A Samsung official involved in the suspicions was questioned last week. The company said that it would fully cooperate with the prosecution in the investigation.Nearly 600 people from the sports industry declared a “state of crisis” through a statement on Monday, saying that the industry has been abused.They called for an extensive investigation into Chung, as well as Choi’s niece, Chang Si-ho who was also a national dressage rider, and other allegations that Choi peddled influence over projects for the 2018 PyongChang Winter Olympics.

Under the “Art on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens” project, participants -- in groups of 10 each joined by field experts -- visited various parts of Seoul to discover relatively unknown artworks. They came up with ideas on how to promote and preserve these hidden gems. Participants of the “Art on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens” project pose for a photo in Seoul City hall on Saturday. Wrapping up the two-month journey, they said that the program helped them build connections to Seoul’s public art. “We came to realize how important it is to find the meaning of installed public art,” said Lee Won-kyung, a Seoul resident who was a participant of the program. After learning about relatively unknown artworks, participants said they developed a sense of duty to preserve them for the next generation through this program.Participants also highlighted the coexistence of practicality and aesthetic elements as a significant factor in public art.“After we walked around some 60 neighborhoods in 18 districts in Seoul, we noticed a variety of public art scattered around Seoul was not receiving recognition because they are in harmony with the background or the setting, like a random media facade that was installed near an apartment town in Mapo,” said Lee Chan-yang. Others also said that the impact of public art can sometimes be maximized by keeping things to a minimum. “A town in Dongdaemun was displaying too many public art installations -- some were even using one of the sculptures there as a chair. We suggest that Seoul City remove some of the public art on the streets so the citizens can have a better look at it,” said Yoon Hae-cheol.Each group also chose the best and worst public art out of the some 3,400 pieces installed on the streets of Seoul. A safety zone storyboard is installed in front of an elementary school in Seoul For instance, a yellow safety zone storyboard installed on a road in Seocho to deter crimes at night was chosen as the best public art for its noticeable design as well as positive function.Recycling Haechi” is seen in front of Dongdaemun Design Plaza “Recycling Haechi”, a sculpture made out of recycled bottles in front of Dongdaemun Design Plaza and a statue inspired by the hit song “Gangnam Style” installed at Coex mall were chosen as Seoul’s worst public art pieces.“So far, many of the programs supported by Seoul City were less likely to have been driven by citizens. However, the city expects to see more programs that are created by citizens, that involve the participation of citizens and assessed by citizens, just like ‘Art on Seoul’s Streets Found by Citizens’ project, so we can extend citizen participation in municipal programs,” said Go Hong-suk, the head of the cultural division at the Seoul Metropolitan Government.“It is important for Seoul City to put in the necessary budget for installations or programs, which all citizens can participate in, to enjoy and share such public art,” said Kim Kyung-ja from Seoul City Council.By Kim Da-sol","100 seoul residents art ,some 100 seoul residents ,100 seoul residents ,at seoul city hall ,seoul residents art connoisseurs","['Seoul', 'Citizens', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30499116  0.22969495

So to many South Koreans, the allegations that Choi Soon-sil, President Park Geun-hye’s civilian friend, had been freely coming and going into the presidential palace are beyond comprehension, not to mention her suspected meddling in state affairs and alleged pocketing of taxpayers’ money. Located at the foot of Bugaksan in central Seoul, Cheong Wa Dae is the South Korean presidential office and residency She was reportedly not stopped for security checks and entered through the main gate used by Cabinet ministers or higher ranks. On the other hand, the scandal captures the formidable power -- to the extent it is sometimes above the law -- bestowed upon South Korean presidents with their single, five-year stint. The presidential system is meant to ensure the independence of the legislature and judiciary, separate from the executive branch, preventing the concentration of power and sustaining checks and balances. In Korea, however, the president’s influence overshadows that of the parliament and ruling party. Presidents have a tight grip on every policy, law enforcement and other powerful institutions, especially in their first years in office. Yet many of them -- along with their families and close associates -- cave in to the temptation to abuse their clout, leaving the presidential office with influence-peddling and graft scandals.As part of efforts to help sever the vicious circle, a growing number of lawmakers and experts have raised the need for a constitutional amendment to alter the presidential system. “Over the one year and four months left in Park’s term, the ruling and opposition parties should experiment cooperative governing and explore a chance to reform the single, five-year presidential system, despite all the ongoing confusion,” Rep. Chung Jin-suk, floor leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, told reporters Friday. Last week, he said the scandals that often take place late in the president’s term underscore the need for constitutional amendment, as under the current system the president has “too much power and information” which should be shared with the other branches of government. Rep. Kim Chong-in, former interim chief of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, also called Friday for the initiation of a campaign to set up a “new political system that disperses the president’s absolute power, and a transparent economic management scheme in which the government and businesses forge a back-scratching alliance.” The roots of the uniquely powerful presidency can be found in the system’s establishment in the authoritarian era. Despite efforts to empower the assembly and political parties ever since, many leaders have been criticized for brandishing power like an emperor, and when Park was sworn in, many pundits feared a return of the ironfisted rule of her late father and strongman Park Chung-hee. The presidential office Since Koreans began to cast ballots to elect their own leaders in 1987, six people including Park have occupied Cheong Wa Dae. But no one was free from scandals in their final years. Roh Tae-woo was put behind bars. Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung saw their family members and aides arrested for taking bribes. Roh Moo-hyun jumped to his death amid a probe into corruption allegations surrounding him and his family. Lee Myung-bak’s term was marred by graft, stock price manipulation and other scandals involving him, his brother, his former company and major conglomerates. Throughout her nearly four years as president, Park appears to have striven to keep family scandals at bay, giving the cold shoulder to her younger sister and brother. This has contributed to the explosiveness of the Choi scandal, coupled with the president’s stubborn refusal to discuss policy directions with not only civil society but ruling party lawmakers.While shunning face-to-face, one-on-one meetings with her own secretaries at Cheong Wa Dae, Park had carried out what was dubbed “notebook politics,” meaning her instructions and choices for senior positions came from her notepad -- a sarcastic metaphor for her obscure decision-making. Now, she has been found to have covertly relied on the advice of Choi, who has no background or qualifications in state management. “Ever since the democracy movement of June 1987 that gave birth to the current Constitution, the unity  has never been that strong,” said Yoon Pyeong-joong, a political philosophy professor at Hanshin University, referring to the nationwide protest. “It’s bringing together everybody irrespective of their ideological inclinations, hometown, age and gender. It’s a historic experience.” Ideas for constitutional revision have been floated, including a transformation into a Cabinet government, a dual executive system and two, four-year terms for the president. A poll last week by Gallup showed that about 54 percent of 1,033 respondents were in favor of the change. Some 40 percent preferred the two, four-year presidential term scheme, while 24 percent supported the dual executive system and 16 percent the Cabinet government plan. As a stopgap measure to put the nation back on track for now, both the ruling and opposition parties call for the establishment of a neutral Cabinet, though Park opted to propose a new prime minister instead, to the wrath of the opposition. Even Park’s Prime Minister nominee Kim Byong-joon displayed support for a Cabinet government during a news conference Thursday, citing the deep-rooted problems with the presidential power and assistance mechanisms as the essence of the scandal. But other experts cautioned against any possible distraction from the debate, saying the focus should be on how to best embrace constitutional change. “The ongoing discussions seem to concentrate too much on the formalities, rather than how to dilute presidential authority and strike a balance with the Cabinet,” said a retired government official who served as a senior presidential secretary in the Lee Myung-bak administration. “Even within the present system, you could restructure the power balance such as by having the prime minister oversee the personnel and budgetary affairs.” Yang Seung-ham, a political science professor at Yonsei University, stressed the need to put priority on a “reinstatement of the rule of law” which he said has been backpedaling in particular under the Park leadership. “World indexes show that we’ve been going from full democracy to flawed democracy, and the Choi scandal wasn’t even taken into account,” he told The Korea Herald. “In reestablishing the rule of law, the role of civil society is imperative. The job of civic groups is to keep the government in check, and if the government does wrong, it should heed them and correct it.” By Shin Hyon-hee","korea teetering presidency ,presidents and video clips ,south koreans the allegations ,korea teetering presidency cheong ,former presidents and video","['South Koreans', 'Park Geun']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33975729  0.65563196

In an interview with The Korea Herald, the designer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Choi came to purchase a hanbok for a “very important person” in December 2012. Choi Soon-sil at a Seoul court Thursday to attend a hearing “Choi was first reluctant to reveal who will wear the cloth,” she said. “I asked her several times for more details about that person, as otherwise I couldn’t tailor hanbok that actually suits the person.” The person was President-elect Park, Choi later told the designer. The designer handed Choi several samples of upper garments of different colors.

NEACE is a multilateral forum involving high-level policymakers, defense ministry officials, military officers and researchers from the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia.In March 2013, his name again appeared in the list of U.N. diplomats as a councilor of the North Korean mission.The report came amid speculation that North Korea recalled Hyon to hold him responsible for the defection to Seoul of Thae Yong-ho, a former minister at its embassy in the British capital.In late July, Thae defected to South Korea with his wife and children, making him one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials to escape to the South.Seoul's unification ministry said Thae chose to defect due to his disillusionment with the North's regime and concerns about his children's future.A growing number of North Koreans, including elites, have defected to South Korea, as the country's leader Kim Jong-un tightens his iron-fisted rule over the country.South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said in October that the largest-ever number of educated, upper-echelon defectors have come to the South over the past eight to nine months, although he did not provide details. North Korean workers toiling in overseas countries and diplomats are under heavy pressure to send hard currency to the North's regime. Pyongyang is facing economic hardship in the face of tougher sanctions over its nuclear and missile provocations.","senior diplomat defection north ,new ambassador to britain ,diplomat defection north korea ,following senior diplomat defection ,britain pyongyang state media","['North Korea', 'Choe Il', 'Britain', 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'London', 'Pyongyang', 'Britain', 'the Korean Central News Agency', 'Hyon Hak - bong']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.52653003  0.33258769

The following are excerpts from The Korea Herald’s telephone interviews with five political experts on the Choi Soon-sil scandal and what the country should do to move ahead.The Korea Herald: What should President Park do to best address the current situation? Yang Seung-ham, professor of politics at Yonsei University: The president should lay bare the truth -- everything that happened before the prosecutors’ inspection. She knows it all. She should explain and sincerely apologize. She has lost legitimacy. The prime minister should step up to proceed with state affairs, including next year’s election and reshuffling of the Cabinet. Park may have to just step aside and hold the presidential title until the term ends. Lee Nae-young, professor of political science at Korea University: The president is to blame. The president has the utmost responsibility over the whole incident. Her current stance of not saying a word on the matter is worsening the situation. Rumors are spreading that the prosecution  is acting as part of a prearranged scenario . Park should understand the anger of the people and step up to resolve the current mess. She should  apologize sincerely.Shin Yul, professor of politics at Myongji University: There’s nothing she can do. No action will gain sympathy. How would an apology change the people’s angry minds now?Yoon Tae-gon, senior political analyst at Moa Agenda Strategy: The president should play the key role in solving this crisis. Because she is keeping quiet right now, further investigation is difficult. She should come forward and say she, herself, and Cheong Wa Dae will undergo investigation. Yoon Pyeong-joong, political philosophy professor at Hanshin University: It is basically impossible for the president to wield authority in the current situation. She should back down. This scandal should hold priority over North Korea’s nuclear tests and the economy right now, because she has lost legitimacy as president. KH: What should political parties do? Yang: The ruling party’s proposal for a neutral Cabinet is wrong. I think it is only a strategic move. The lawmakers should make sure the probe is conducted thoroughly. We should give them a chance to either choose to put forth a powerful prime minister, or to have an early election next year. The time is not for parties to cause unnecessary fights. The president should also be investigated, if not in person, then via written statements. The politicians should see this case as a chance to reinforce constitutionalism at this time when national status has fallen to rock bottom.Lee: Ruling Saenuri Party Chairman Lee Jeong-hyun is keeping his position , but I have little doubt that the pro-Park faction of the party will soon collapse.   How the opposition party deals with the situation is very important, but they also have taken some wrong steps. The authority of the president has already rotted, so the opposition should have a strong sense of responsibility, instead of calculating the next steps.   Shin: When Korea’s politics face the question of holding or falling, the parties should consider making the right moves. Hassling about a nonparty Cabinet does not look good. The opposition is not accepting the coalition government proposal as it is calculating  for the upcoming election. In the end, the opposition party will have to accept it anyway. Yoon Tae-gon: With Cheong Wa Dae, the Saenuri Party has lost its authority. The opposition parties should take a lead in standing committees to handle budget deliberation and other pending parliamentary tasks.  Yoon Pyeong-joong: I see no practical exit other than the opposition party accepting the proposal for a neutral Cabinet. It will then open up ways to patch up the crisis.KH: What is civil society’s role in this? Yang: When a government sets foot in the wrong direction, civic organizations should raise their voices and correct it. Condemnation and pressure is needed, but they should not be extended over a long period of time. The public should point out and keep an eye on those trying to cover up the scandal related to the president. Lee: I understand public sentiment demanding the resignation or impeachment of the president. It may, however, be difficult to realize with the next year’s presidential election just around the corner. Such demands should take the role of giving pressure only. Fact finding and a special prosecution should be operated as planned.  Shin: People call for the president’s resignation and impeachment, but they should think further about what will be done after such measures are taken. There is no discussion over whether they will carry forward with a Constitution revision or prepare for a new election. Yoon Tae-gon: Different parts of society should speak for themselves. Calling for a proper and thorough probe is just the minimum the general public can do. Yoon Pyeong-joon: People should speak out and condemn . The fundamental identity of a civil society lies in independence and autonomy. It should be free from the government. It is hard to find a time when the Korean society found unity, except for the democratic uprising in 1987. It was 1987 when the current Constitution was revised to a direct election system. Now, unity is stronger than then, with all people regardless of their age, gender and region voicing one opinion. This whole Park Geun-hye scandal is unprecedented in history. There will be no exit other than the resignation of the president herself. This confusing crisis cannot be resolved without Park taking responsibility. A historical lesson tells us there has been no group with vested rights to give up power by their own will. Chaos is inevitable. This is a power game between civic society and the inner circle of the president. Staff reporter Jo He-rim contributed to this report.

""Reason to invest in science is that it is part of every culture of humans and so it is about how the world works, what we are and what the universe is like. These are increasingly important questions,"" the British structural biologist told reporters in Seoul on Friday. The 64-year-old scientist has served as the president of the world's oldest society which dates back to the 1660s, since November 2015. He won the Nobel Prize in 2009.The India-born scientist visited South Korea at the invitation of the Institute for Basic Science which is celebrating its fifth anniversary.Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, talks to reporters on Oct. 28, in Seoul.  ""One thing that many of us are surprised is the commitment of  government to invest in science. In terms of its gross domestic product per capita, South Korea is one of the highest investors,"" the scientist known has ""Venki"" said.According to international science journal ""Nature,"" South Korea is the world's largest investor in scientific research by pouring 4.29 percent of its GDP in 2014. The country outstrips runner-up Israel, as well as Japan and the United States.""I would say it is a very good thing that  Korea is investing so much in science and that is one way for  Korea to continue to grow economically,"" he said. The Seoul government has been spending big in the hopes of winning a Nobel Prize. However, many industry experts have pointed out the lack of a long-term plan.""My advice is to see this as an long-term investment in the country and not look for quicker results,"" he said, adding that science should not only be funded top-down by a few people in the government.""Good investment should come from scientists themselves because that is the only one way to get completely new ideas,"" the president said. Venkatraman also urged the public to get more interested in basic science as the government funding in the field is done by taxpayers' money. ""It is the public right to know how money is spent. The public needs to know what science is about and how it is spent,"" he said.The society, which earlier signed memorandums of understanding with the IBS, already held two joint seminars and plans to hold the third one. ""Our hope is that as time goes by, we will have some increased level of collaboration and the exchange of scientists,"" he said, stressing that there are many possibilities in the future.Venkatraman, who initially majored in chemistry as an undergraduate, advised young scientists not to be afraid of failure.""It's always the most important thing that people should do something they are really interested in,"" he said, noting that scientific works is very ""tedious.""The biologist, who won a Nobel prize for his part in unlocking the key to the ribosome, said he is currently working to explore how proteins work.""Noble Prize is not an end result... science has to keep on going,"" he said.","stresses basic science venkatraman ,science venkatraman ramakrishnan president ,spearheaded by scientists reason ,scientists reason to invest ,chief stresses basic science","['Venkatraman Ramakrishnan', 'the Royal Society of London', 'Improving Natural Knowledge', 'the Royal Society']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41415414  0.60108131

At the very front of the money-spinning marketing world, he designed logos for global companies like Pepsi Co. and international events such as 1988 Summer Olympics. Then one day, a thought struck him that he may be on a train running at full speed toward the edge of the cliff. Civilization, consuming resources at an ever-accelerating pace, had reached a point of no turning back, he thought. “I couldn’t live the way I did in the past, splurging Earth’s resources,” Yoon, now professor emeritus of design at Kookmin University, told The Korea Herald.He decided to live a life of an artist and environmental activist. Yoon Ho-seob, professor emeritus of Kookmin University, talks during an interview with The Korea Herald. In 2002, Yoon started a street campaign -- drawing the same message “Every Day is Earth Day” on T-shirts. Ever since, every Sunday between April and September, he was on the street of Insa-dong, a popular tourist district in Seoul, spreading the “green virus” among ordinary people. In the beginning, people called him an eccentric and said they couldn’t understand why he abandoned such a high-flying career all of a sudden. “I consider myself normal,” Yoon said, saying it was a natural transition for him once he started thinking about the continuing destruction of the planet being done by mankind. “In fact, I think we all should think about how we should live as a human being,” he said. When you first start acting like an environmentalist, some people may raise their eyebrows. But think of it as a green virus, he says. “You know that viruses are contagious? This green virus, too, can spread quicker, if we can plant a green factor in the mind of at least one person,” he said. His efforts to spread the green virus are far-ranging, although the weekly T-shirt drawing event is what he is most known for. At his university, he has pioneered eco-friendly design education to help incorporate environmental consideration in creative thinking of future artist and designers. In 2004, his “Green Design” course first opened at Kookmin University which through he fostered talented artists with an eye for environmental problems. He emphasized that artists and designers should put effort into balancing people’s minds through green designs, in a materialistic society where competition is fierce and artworks are mass produced.“Finding balance for coexistence while living in an ever-so capitalistic society is really important,” Yoon said.At his own atelier, Yoon holds a workshop every week, with the main theme of “Think about Trees.” The weekly workshop is intended to help teens to think about trees and eventually reconnect with nature. “I ask them to close their eyes and listen to the sounds I make. I rub two steel dishes and interestingly it sounds like as if I’m cutting a tree. Sometimes it sounds like trees swaying in the wind.”Yoon also reads to the teens a book called “The Man Who Planted Trees” by French author Jean Giono. Through his workshop, this book has been transcribed by hand for more than 10,000 times, he said. The 400-word-long tale has been transcribed not only by those who visited workshops. Many who never visited it sent transcription copies to his atelier. He gathered the transcription copies and exhibited them as part of his artpiece at a show. “This one class at an elementary school in Siheung have been sending me transcription copies for four years. That is, it is really important to spread the green virus among students from a young age,” said Yoon. He said that many Koreans are still “environmentally blind,” which according to him means feeling at a loss over what to do to protect the environment and how to find a balance in their lives for coexistence with nature.But a small change in thinking can help. Going green can start with trivial things like not littering on the street, he stressed. “We all know we should not litter on the street, avoid making food waste, unplug televisions and refrigerators to save electricity, we all are very well aware of how to go green,” said Yoon.By Kim Da-sol","interview spreading green virus ,global companies like pepsi ,train running at full ,1988 summer olympics then ,logos for global companies","['Yoon Ho - seob', 'Pepsi Co.']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.72180909  0.44544759

The lobby, which has large companies as Samsung and Hyundai as its members, is said to have spearheaded the collection of around 80 billion won  from conglomerates for the two foundations. Lee is suspected of having played a role in the process.There have been allegations that the money at the foundations -- established in 2015 and early this year, respectively -- was funneled to Choi Soon-sil, who is at the center of a political scandal that is rocking the country.""I will fully cooperate with the investigation,"" Lee told reporters before entering the prosecutors' office. He declined to comment on the allegations raised. The summons came a day after the prosecution expanded its investigation team to look into a string of corruption allegations surrounding Choi, who is suspected to have peddled influence based on her connection with President Park Geun-hye.On Tuesday, Park offered a rare public apology over a leak of dozens of presidential speeches to Choi before they were made public. Acknowledging her ties to Choi, which go back decades, the president said she asked for consultation ""out of the best intentions"" to be more thorough in her work. Still, the scandal has only been snow-balling as local media outlets have been reporting that Choi might have intervened in other state affairs. Choi -- the daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min and ex-wife of Park's former secretary Chung Yun-hoi -- does not have a government position.In a recent interview with a local daily, Choi flatly denied any allegations raised against her, except that she received and edited drafts of the president's speeches. She is currently known to be in Germany.Prosecutors here have been summoning a number of officials from the government and private companies related to the scandal, including Ko Young-tae, one of the closest figures to Choi.Ko, a former member of the national fencing team during the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok who now heads a fashion company, returned to South Korea from Bangkok on Thursday and volunteered to appear at the prosecutors' office later in the day.","korea biggest business lobby ,chairman summoned over scandal ,seoul central district prosecutors ,south korea biggest business ,two nonprofit foundations allegedly","[""South Korea 's"", 'Park Geun', 'Lee Seung - cheol', 'the Federation of Korean Industries', 'FKI', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.11750679  0.41465104

The school was established in 2011 by the late Lee Bong-duk and is located in Incheon Free Economic Zone. It offers students the chance to develop the skills required of future leaders through its pre-school and 12-year educational programs, according to the school. Aerial view of Cheongna Dalton SchoolLee, who also founded Bongduk Education Foundation which oversees the Hangaram High School in Seoul, set up the international school after visiting Dalton School in New York. Cheongna Dalton School is committed to the Dalton Plan which advocates freedom and cooperation in a bid to develop the creativity, adaptability and leadership of its students. In order to pursue this the school adopted a curriculum which focuses on project-based learning, inquiry-based Advanced Placement and “Capstone” style senior projects.  Inquiry style learning and technology integration begin in elementary school where students are constantly engaged in projects that are highlighted and reflected upon in their e-portfolios. The students enrolled in the elementary program are also given the freedom to choose where they want to study and what activities they want to try. Close collaboration between teachers and parents has created a family-like atmosphere, which helps students feel safe and valued as individuals when they explore their options, the school said. Cheongna Dalton School‘s students and faculty membersAs students progress to middle school, the curriculum widens to include character education, which focuses on the responsibility and outcome of decision-making. Students also develop their social and academic skills through projects that foster cooperation. During the high school years, students are given the opportunity to make multiple choices in terms of course subjects, varsity sports and senior projects, to name a few. Cheongna Dalton School is accredited by both the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Incheon Board of Education, which means that students can choose whether to study in Korea or move overseas. About 40 percent of the students decided to enter Korea-based universities. A team of college counsellors support the students during the university admissions process, the school said. Since the school opened six years ago, its students have been accepted into prestigious universities at home and abroad, including Seoul National University, Waseda University in Japan, Cornell University and New York University in the US, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Les Roche International School of Hotel Management in Switzerland. To qualify as an applicant for Cheongna Dalton School, a student must have at least one parent who holds a foreign passport, or the student must be out of Korea for more than 1,095 days at the time of enrollment.","top choice for parents ,dalton school in incheon ,their children the school ,cultivate world leaders cheongna ,parents seeking an international","['Cheongna Dalton School', 'Lee Bong - duk', 'Incheon Free Economic Zone']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47561362  0.47569066

If the revision is approved, it will include new clauses such as: “The Seoul Mayor should protect public servants’ rights to rest and prohibit public officials from ordering work through phone calls, text messages, social networking services and other communication channels after office hours.”According to the survey conducted among Seoul City public servants in September, receiving work requests via Kakao Talk after office hours is one of the top work-related problems.South Korea has among the longest work weeks of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries. “Although it depends on the character of the manager, many public servants here are stressed about receiving work at night or during the weekend. That is why I welcome systemically prohibiting ordering work during off-duty hours,” a Seoul city official told The Korea Herald on the condition of anonymity.Some expressed concern the ban could “become a nuisance” when officials have to respond quickly to an urgent matter. In June, Minjoo Party of Korea lawmaker Shin Kyung-min proposed a revision to the current Labor Standard Act, which bans ordering work through text messages and other communication channels. The revision is pending at the National Assembly. Shin said the revised law will be able to protect laborers’ rights and privacy, as many of them handle work duties after office hours via their smartphones, tablets and other smart devices.By Kim Da-sol","apps after office hours ,ban after hours work ,servants bill last week ,fifteen seoul city council ,messenger apps after office","['Seoul City Council', 'Kim Gwang - su', 'Seoul City Council']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41535699  0.20737387

According to media outlets that dispatched investigative teams to the European country, Choi had since last year lived in a rural town near Frankfurt called Schmitten with her horseback rider daughter training at an equestrian center there. Choi is found to have purchased a number of properties in the area, including Widec Taunus Hotel. The hotel is currently out of business and is believed to be up for sale.  The 60-year-old woman appears to have left the Schmitten house hurriedly after allegations of her influence peddling surfaced in South Korea. On Tuesday, President Park Geun-hye admitted to have such a close relationship with Choi that she would even show her scripts of her speeches in advance. A German media outlet reported Tuesday that large moving trucks were spotted last month in front of the house where Choi used to live. Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong said Wednesday the prosecution was considering taking steps through international judiciary cooperation channels to bring her back to Korea for questioning.Rep. Woo Sang-ho of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea insisted Wednesday state prosecutors investigating the influence-peddling allegations surrounding Choi should have knowledge of her whereabouts, demanding immediate action. “Even we know that she’s in Germany and Cha Eun-taek is in China,” he said. Cha is a TV commercial director who is suspected to have exerted influence in various cultural projects of the government as well as the appointments of culture-related posts, using his close ties with Choi.","choi hiding overseas ,german city until recently ,south korea presidential office ,small german city until ,rural town near frankfurt","['Choi Soon - sil', 'South Korea ’s', 'german', 'european', 'Choi', 'Frankfurt']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50213927  0.35744056

The doctor-venture entrepreneur-professor-turned-politician says he will become a fighter who faces up to the challenge in order to make Korea a better place for you.“Mentor Ahn Cheol-soo, who in 2012 offered you consoling messages, thinks in 2016 that he must toughen up and become a real doer, fighter to change the world,” the centrist politician wrote via Facebook on Monday. He even called himself “Kang Cheol-soo,” a combination of his name and the Korean word for strength. The founder of the third-biggest People’s Party hinted in August at his bid for the 2017 presidential election. Ahn Cheol-soo“Things are not getting better. It is to my great chagrin but things have gotten only worse in Korea. ... Today, I reflect on the days when I first started politics – how I wanted to create a hopeful future for the young people,” Ahn wrote. An IT guru behind Korea’s No. 1 anti-virus software firm Ahn Lab, Ahn jumped into politics in 2012 amid polls that put him even ahead of President Park Geun-hye in the race for the nation’s top job. During the campaign, however, he yielded to Moon Jae-in, the candidate from the main liberal opposition bloc, although his approval ratings were as competitive as Moon’s in a hypothetical one-on-one faceoff with Park. South Korea will pick the successor to Park, whose single five-year term is to end in February 2018, in December 2017.  Perhaps a hint of his toughened spirit, Ahn on Monday harshly criticized Park’s proposal for an amendment of the Constitution.“Back in 2007, when President Roh Moo-hyun first proposed a revision to the Constitution, President Park had called him ‘a very bad president,’” he quipped.","doctor venture entrepreneur professor ,korea better place for ,soo vows to toughen ,the doctor venture entrepreneur ,entrepreneur professor turned politician","['Korea Herald', 'Ahn Cheol', 'Korea', 'Ahn Cheol']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46265185  0.69717175

North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol speaks to reporters in Malaysia on Oct. 22. The rare meetings drew intense media attention as they could signal Pyongyang's willingness to reopen negotiations with the United States amid heightened tensions in the wake of its fifth nuclear test and a series of missile launches.But the US government dismissed the talks as an unofficial ""Track 2"" contact.""We have seen the reporting on Track 2 meetings. Track 2 meetings are routinely held on a variety of topics around the world and occur independent of US government involvement,"" State Department spokeswoman Anna Richey-Allen said. Sigal told Yonhap News that the two sides mainly discussed the North's nuclear and missile issues. The North stuck to its stance that it wants to sign a peace treaty with the US before it stops its nuclear and missile programs. But the US side reiterated its position that scrapping the nuclear program should be put before anything else, Sigal said. Drawing his own conclusions that there was partial progress in the informal meetings, he said he expects no official dialogue with the North to take place under the Obama administration, but that a new US government needs to reconsider policies toward the North.","former us nuclear negotiators ,korean diplomats and former ,sunday dismissed recent talks ,diplomats as track meeting ,nuclear negotiators robert gallucci","['the United States', 'north korean', 'US', 'US', 'north Korean', 'Han Song -', 'UN', 'Jang Il - hun', 'US', 'Robert Gallucci', 'Joseph DeTrani', 'asian']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38517386  0.51936769

Even though he has refused to discuss such a possibility, he has never ruled it out, either.Speculation about his presidential ambitions spiked earlier this year as Ban said during a visit to South Korea that he would “contemplate” what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after stepping down as U.N. chief.During the interview with Reuters, Ban also expressed concern about tensions on the Korean Peninsula.“Never in the past have we seen such heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, that is a source of my great concern and worry,”he was quoted as saying.He also criticized the U.N. Security Council for “taking unnecessarily long time in expressing their positions” on North Korean provocations.“That kind of sense of lack of unity gives some good excuse for the member states like North Korea not to abide by this resolution,” he said.","considering run for president ,better future of korea ,for korea future new ,role for korea future ,korea after stepping down","['NEW YORK', 'Yonhap', 'U.N.', 'Ban Ki - moon', 'South Korea', 'U.N.', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Ban']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0773254   0.34742019

Minjoo immediately dismissed the attack as a stint by the recently feud-ridden ruling party to divert attention away from a political scandal tied to presidential aides, as well as its plan to cripple Moon, who is a prospective opposition candidate for the presidential election slated for December next year.The fight came amid mounting controversy over former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon’s new memoir “Moving the Glacier.” The retired career diplomat said Moon had accepted the proposal of asking North Korea about the issue and that he eventually decided to withdraw the vote after hearing Pyongyang’s negative view. “If the allegation proves to be true, it shows that Moon has sympathized with our enemy and that he truly undermined public sentiment,” said Saenuri floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk. “We will get to the bottom of this and find out what happened.” The floor leader added that his party would summon Kim Man-bok, a former director of the National Intelligence Service who reportedly suggested the idea to Moon. The party is planning to bring Kim as a witness in the parliamentary Intelligence Committee’s state audit Wednesday. Moon Jae-in , former chairman of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and then-presidential chief of staff, sits at a Cheong Wa Dae meeting back in 2007 with then-Foreign Minister Song Min-soon, whose recent political memoir triggered controversy over the former Roh Moo-hyun administration’s North Korea policies. The retired top spy chief denied the allegation that he made such a proposal to Moon and vowed to take the stand should the bipartisan committee reach consensus. Kim said that he is willing to face a cross-examination session with Moon, if necessary. Also, the main opposition party countered that what the former chief of staff did was not an “inquiry” about Pyeongyang’s position, but a “notification” of Seoul’s decision made by the president and Cabinet members.According to Moon, former Foreign Minister Song was the only one who approved joining the vote, while other members such as former NIS Director Kim and former Unification Minister Lee Jae-jung opposed the move. “It was a delivery of our decision to North Korea,” said Rep. Kim Kyoung-Soo who had served as a presidential aide in charge of speech writing during the Roh administration. “There was no reason and need for us to ask North Korea about the UN vote.” Though he did not offer direct evidence to rebut the allegation, Moon expressed his resentment on his Facebook account, especially toward Saenuri floor leader Chung and the party’s Chairman Rep. Lee Jung-hyun, who had labeled him as a sympathizer with the North.“President Roh made the decision, after sufficiently gathering opinions from both proponents and opponents,” said Moon. “Never did he bypass the regular decision-making system and rely on personal channels instead. This is what the Park Geun-hye government should learn from the former Roh administration.”Meanwhile, Saenuri Party’s former floor leader Rep. Yoo Seong-min, who is from the moderate wing of the conservative party, criticized Moon for his “problematic view” on North Korea.“I don’t think the rule of majority should be applied to the matter about national security and foreign policy,” said Yoo, “I doubt the decision to abstain from the UN vote would lead to the improvement of North Korea’s human rights condition.” By Yeo Jun-suk","condemning north korea human ,former top diplomat memoir ,deepen controversy sunday over ,moon jae in denouncing ,resolution condemning north korea","['South Korea ’s', 'North Korea', 'UN', 'North Korea ’s', 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Moon Jae - in']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.33819324  0.47380811

US news broadcaster CNN also released a report on Jeonju as a distinctive destination when visiting South Korea.Foreign tourists make traditional Korean rice cakes at Jeonju Hanok Village. “Though we were always confident about the domestic public’s perception of Jeonju, we were not quite certain of the response from the international society,” the city’s Mayor Kim Seung-su told The Korea Herald in an interview.“But the recent CNN report has confirmed our belief that our city indeed has much to offer to visitors.”What really counts, according to the mayor, is that Jeonju earned the positive reviews by preserving and focusing on what it already had instead of building artificial commercial facilities.Tourists clad in traditional Korean costume hanbok pose for photos at a historic site in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. Jeonju“Our key strategy, should there be any, is to expose Jeonju exactly as it is, no disguise, no distortion,” Kim said.“And no amusement parks, casinos or mega-sized shopping complexes are needed for this.”City of bibimbap and hanokJeonju has acted upon such belief. It earned two international titles based on its two most famous cultural features -- traditional food and architecture.Traditional homes are seen inside Jeonju Hanok Village, located in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, in the southwest of the peninsula. In 2012, the city was named by UNESCO as a Creative City for Gastronomy. There are currently a handful of designated creative cities in South Korea -- Seoul for design, Busan for film, Icheon for crafts and folk art, Gwangju for media art and Jeonju.When making the selection, the international organization cited Jeonju’s ample yield in rice from the Honam Plain, fish from the West Sea and fresh vegetables and greens from the mountains, as well as the city’s history of preserving the country’s food culture.The most eye-catching occasion in the food sector is the upcoming bibimbap festival, a yearly event to be held Oct. 20-23.“Considering foreigners’ improved recognition of this food genre, we will no longer limit the festival contents to gastronomic experiences, but expand into new cultural exchange and communication,” the mayor said.For instance, local residents from each of the 33 administrative districts of the city will create an original recipe of bibimbap to offer at the festival. This program was initiated so as to underline the concept of harmony and community sharing incorporated in the menu, the city chief explained.Also, the city was reauthorized this year as a “slow city” by Cittaslow International, an international network of Slow Cities, in recognition of its efforts to maintain sustainable growth based on traditions and nature.By doing so, Cittaslow expanded the range of its certification from Jeonju Hanok Village to the entire city, making it the first of such cases in a city with a population of 600,000 or more.An employee dressed in traditional Korean costume hanbok prepares for an event about the chronicles of Joseon Dynasty inside Jeonju Hanok Village. “This shows that Jeonju is a model example of an urban slow city, achieving the ideal balance of traditional culture, nature, and sustainable growth potentials,” Kim said.But the city should also take caution not to be swept away by the soaring popularity of Korean traditional homes – hanok -- the mayor said in a warning message.“I do not intend to build a new hanok village just to meet tourist demands,” he said.The core of his redevelopment plan is to focus on the relatively underexploited city districts, a 3.3-kilometer-square urban area which embraces the city hall and a large number of neglected hanok in the vicinity.“There are some 1,500 hanok that are aged 30 years or more nearby the city hall, which is more than double the number in Hanok Village,” he said.“These traditional houses, if well preserved, will turn into state-designated cultural assets within two decades.”Self-sustaining, growing, and inspiringIn this year’s UNESCO Creative City Network meeting, held in Sweden last month, Jeonju announced the Jeonju Food Plan 2025, a 10-year program aiming to boost the consumption of local food and to promote the self-sufficiency of manufacturers.“Our 660,000 citizens spend about 1 trillion won  annually on their food bills, but only 50 billion won of this gross sum is produced in Jeonju,” the mayor said.“The plan is about pulling up the ratio of locally produced and manufactured food to 20 percent, or 200 billion won, within 10 years.”The city is also making aggressive investments in the carbon fiber industry, pledging to take the initiative in the long-term growth, high value-added sector.“I am the third-generation mayor here to encourage the carbon fiber business, under the awareness that we need to pioneer new frontiers in order to create new, sustainable values,” said the mayor.Jeonju Mayor Kim Seung-su The international market’s demand for material safety will continue to increase, due to climate changes and consequently enhanced regulations, Kim claimed.“Though South Korea and Jeonju have not yet reached the world’s top level in carbon technology, it is significant that we have managed to manufacture related goods without relying on imports, all this in just over a decade.”Hyosung, the nation’s ranking conglomerate in the textile business, is currently operating a carbon fiber manufacturing plant in Jeonju.Historic, yet young and vigorousFor a city with a history of some 1,300 years and a long reputation for cultural heritage, Jeonju has an interesting twist -- its mayor being one of the youngest administrative leaders in the nation.“Not only is our city old, but it is also quite conservative, which is why many were surprised when I was elected for my post back in 2014, as the youngest mayor then,” Kim said.At the time, Jeonju was perplexed by a series of social disputes, ranging from never-ending strikes of public transport labor unions to the relocation of a local prison. A decades-long prostitution area at the heart of the city was also considered a major obstacle to the growing tourism business.“I thought  was a message that the people wanted a young, innovative figure to step in and take some bold actions,” the 47-year-old mayor said.One of his signature projects was to transform the red-light district into a cultural zone by expanding the public’s access to the area and supporting voluntary art programs there, instead of relying on forceful eviction.“It is not just because the district defames the image of the city in the eyes of tourists, but because it stands for the violation of women’s rights and violence in our society,” he said.He is also working on a project to renew the Jeonju Train Station, promoting it as a comprehensive information center and cultural space representing the entire province.“Jeonju Station is often recognized by its hanok-style appearance, but this is but a superficial gesture, as the building currently fails to meet the diversifying needs of visitors,” he said.The station, according to the ambitious mayor, should be more than just a platform for transport. It should also be a channel through which visitors can better experience the city and the surrounding region.“For this we not only need to build a whole new space, but also should build information centers, craft shops, rest areas, all equipped with sufficient infrastructure, data and translation manpower.”There was once a time when a city’s profile was almost entirely dependent on the state to which it belonged. This is no longer the case, the city leader stressed. “It may not be an exaggeration to say that it is now individual cities that decide the reputation of the nation itself,” Kim said.“This is why it is important for every city to stand on its own feet, facing and developing its forte, instead of depending on the central government.”By Bae Hyun-jung","hanbok and local festivals ,lonely planet in august ,herald interview jeonju ,southwestern city known for ,the mayor of jeonju","['Jeonju', 'North Jeolla Province', 'Lonely Planet']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05379327  0.698744

In a petition submitted to the Finance Ministry on Sept. 7 and released by Rep. Shim Jae-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party, Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corp. asked the government to adjust the minimum age of passengers entitled to free rides from the current 65 to 70. It also proposed that the beneficiaries be charged 50 percent of the fare, instead of being given full exemption. The metro operator, funded by Seoul City, runs subway line numbers 5 to 8 in the capital, carrying over 2.8 million daily. Free access to public transport is a core part of the country’s welfare package for the elderly, the disabled and others recognized by the government for their contributions to the nation. It was introduced in 1984.Due to the increase in the elderly population, the number of holders of free subway passes has been rising by an average of 13 percent annually, accounting for 14 percent of all passengers in 2015.  Over the years, SMRT saw losses snowballing from 198.7 billion won  in 2012 to 271 billion won in 2015. The national welfare policy will incur further losses of 141.5 billion won of its potential revenue this year, the firm said, demanding the central government cover the amount with state subsidies.  However, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance refused the demand, saying the operator is responsible for covering the charges related to the elderly and the disabled. “It is the local government’s role to take care of the urban railways and it would lead to fairness issues among regions if government expenditure was provided for the matter,” the ministry said.SMRT on Wednesday stuck to its stance, saying a change is inevitable. “The sociocultural environment has changed and so have people’s perceptions about the necessity of the program, as witnessed in the altered stance of the Korea Senior Citizens Association,” the city-run subway operator said. The senior citizens’ group had last year proposed that the age at which citizens are considered elderly should be raised to 70. The metro firm plans to present the agenda to a December meeting of the nation’s rail and subway operators, and hopes to come up with a joint petition or other collective action plans.

David Knight, an international migration expert, says in combating this, Korean companies have a role to play.  “Companies may not be aware of human rights abuses in their supply chain and sometimes there is a gap between what they are told and what happens in practice,” said Knight, chief of Vietnam Mission for International Organization for Migration, in an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. “But those companies are still responsible and held accountable for any breaches of human rights abuses through their supply chains.” David Knight, chief of Vietnam Mission for International Organization for Migration, during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. He noted that as the supply chain is often complex with multiple layers from treating raw materials to creating final products, it has become more difficult for companies to monitor exploitation and abuses at a myriad number of their subcontractors. That’s why the IOM stresses companies’ “proactive” role in monitoring its supply chains and following ethical recruitment practices. The ethical recruitment means that migrant workers are not charged fees to find work abroad, granted freedom of movement and clearly aware of terms and conditions of contracts. The IOM helps companies to conduct audits with a more investigative approach to uncover human rights breaches, offers training sessions to raise awareness of ethical recruitment among lower tier suppliers, he said. Knight, who is leading the IOM’s initiative International Recruitment Integrity System based in Vietnam, made his way to Korea last month to participate in a forum to address risks about hidden forced labor in supply chains and adverse impact it could bring to Korean businesses. In Vietnam, where about 4,000 Korean-owned companies are operating as of 2016, mostly in the manufacturing sector, some Korean firms are directly involved with labor abuses. According to Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, there have been about 800 strikes from 2009 to 2014 by workers in Vietnam against breach of labor laws by Korean employers. A 2015 report by Korean Trans National Corporation Watch based on interviews with local workers, labor unions, companies and civic groups, revealed that Korean companies allegedly underpaid local workers, verbally and physically abused them, forced them to work long hours and even punished them for using toilets too often. Even if Korean companies are not directly involved, being associated with charges of human trafficking and forced labor through subcontractors and recruitment agencies is a risk for their business, Knight said. “By failing to follow the ethical recruitment in labor migrations, companies may not be able to access the US and EU markets because of slavery that was found in their supply chains,” he said, citing the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act enacted in 2010 and the UK’s Modern Slavery Act enforced in 2015. Both acts require companies supplying goods and services in California and the UK, respectively, to publish annual statements to prove that there is no slavery or labor abuses linked to any goods and services sold there. “The corporations might also suffer from reputational damage, penalty for violation of laws and declining sales,” he said. “By addressing these issues and doing things in the right way, they can reduce those risks and brand themselves as a promoter of human rights and sustainable development.”By Ock Hyun-ju","labor abuses in asia ,combating this korean companies ,korean companies role crucial ,slavery behind the global ,trafficked into forced labor","['David Knight', 'korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33279955  0.19201036

In his new memoir, titled “Moving the Glacier,” Song Min-soon chronicled the decision-making process on sanctions, dialogue and other moves taken during the Roh Moo-hyun administration around the so-called first nuclear crisis in 2006 and afterward. Dr. Baek Seon-ha of Seoul National University Hospital explains the medical records of Baek Nam-gi, an activist farmer who died last month nearly 10 months after being knocked out by a police water cannon, during a parliamentary audit session at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. The doctor stuck to his view that the patient died of illness, not extrinsic trauma, as he wrote on the death certificate. YonhapThe 68-year-old retired career diplomat was the deputy representative to the four-nation talks in 1999 between the two Koreas, the US and China; the chief nuclear negotiator to the six-party denuclearization forum that also involved Japan and Russia in 2005; the head of unification, foreign and security policy at Cheong Wa Dae in 2006; and the foreign minister until 2008. After his retirement, he was a member of the National Assembly from 2008-2012 and now serves as the president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. Three days after Pyongyang signaled its maiden nuclear test on Oct. 3, 2006, Washington circulated a draft of a UN Security Council resolution. Song, then with the presidential office, notified that should the North reject the allies’ reconciliation offer and conduct the explosion, Seoul would seek “strong sanctions” and have no option but to “nullify the  inter-Korean denuclearization declaration,” suggesting the possibility of its own nuclear armament, he said in the book. “At the same time, I thought we and the US should together consider physical action including military power if North Korea presses ahead with the nuclear test, and did explore its possibility,” the memoir reads. “I believed we were able to meet North Korea’s demands to the extent of China’s consent, and to show the legitimacy for inevitable physical action if the North refused to discard its nuclear program nonetheless.” Among the factors to be taken into account were whether Washington -- occupied with its “war on terror” in the Middle East -- would have the political will to mobilize its military forces against the North; whether the allies could take such a step in the face of Beijing’s opposition; and whether the South Koreans are prepared for an escalation that may evolve into an intensified clash. Then President Roh and his counterpart George W. Bush had agreed on the “diplomacy first and military action later” principle during their summit in September 2006, Song noted. He also depicted the discord between Roh and then US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. During their meeting one month later, Rice said Pyongyang would not launch a nuclear attack and the more pressing matter at hand was the possibility of a transfer of fissile devices or materials to a third country or a terrorist organization. Roh took issue with the view, saying the focus should be on how to make the regime abandon its nuclear program and that the US needed to “listen more carefully” to Seoul’s positions. The former minister also criticized the decision to station the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system here, as well as the current hard-line approach that no dialogue is to be held unless Pyongyang forsakes its nuclear program. “Once the THAAD system is deployed, not only South Korea and the US, but also China would not have the means to deter North Korea’s nuclear and missile development,” he argued. Song raised the need for “constructive ambiguity” in dealing with Pyongyang, saying that with denuclearization being the top priority, a lifting of sanctions should be offered after the country reports on its nuclear program, followed by the kickoff of desertion and inspection processes in tandem.By Shin Hyon-hee","seoul once mulled nuke ,underground detonation in 2006 ,in his new memoir ,its own nuclear weapons ,his new memoir titled","['South Korea', 'US', 'North Korea ’s', 'Song Min - soon', 'Roh']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46589792  0.66139531

But our findings tell otherwise,” said Woo Young-kyeong, a senior researcher at Korea Internet and Security Agency, and Kim Eun-ha, a professor at Dankuk University, in a paper published in a local academic journal. According to their study of 133 children who were born to a Korean father and a mother from a different Asian country, those with fluency in their mother’s native language identified more strongly as Korean, whereas fluency in Korean did not have a meaningful correlation.  “Multicultural children already think of themselves as Koreans, so speaking better Korean does not necessarily add to their cultural identity as Koreans,” the research team explained. Korea, which once prided itself on its racial homogeneity, is witnessing a rapid rise of multiculturalism, with children from multicultural families making up 2.7 percent of elementary school pupils. According to the Education Ministry, the number of these multicultural students jumped 20 percent in just one year to reach 99,186 at the end of last month.

Guggenheim Museum, discussing and bringing public art to a different level, much unlike Seoul where governmental institutions run public art projects from time to time,” Seo told The Korea Herald. Seo added that communication between art itself and citizens should be the key when planning and presenting public art.As such an example, the curator referred to the Weather Project, held by Danish artist Olafur Eliasson at the Tate Modern London in 2003. In the experimental exhibition, Eliasson installed a giant sun with light bulbs within an empty space where viewers could lie down and enjoy sunbathing -- a way to describe how the weather shapes a city.“I personally think that public art does not necessarily have to be in a certain format. Experience should come first before art format. The main role of public art should be about giving good experience to viewers,” Seo said.The Weather Project, a work by Danish artist Olafur Eliasson displaying a giant light bulb sun in an empty space. Another curator, Kwon Yun-hee, 38, an artist manager at Artist Pension Trust, stressed the importance of communication between artists, curators and citizens in order to understand and share diverse opinions. “After having a conversation with citizens , I also came to break my own perception toward public art.  worked as a stimulant and a motivation for me to broaden my viewpoint working in this field,” said Kwon.“As citizens are the main target of public art, their participation in enjoying public art can have a huge impact to all stages of it, ranging from planning public art to installation, follow up management and assessment of public art in the future.“Kim Hyun-ji, 39, a freelance curator based in Seoul, said that the current art culture should be able to invite a wide range of people, from young children to elders, in order to provide them with memorable experiences of enjoying pubic art. “Museums in different countries allow for a freer way of watching art and participating in cultural programs. For example, school children could be allowed to sit down at the corner of the exhibition hall and draw a sketch, as long as they do not disturb other viewers’ watching,” said Kim.With the average age of art appreciators on a constant fall, efforts to provide programs for young viewers will widen the public’s access to art, according to Kim.“That way, public art will not only spread out to various cities other than Seoul, but also attract the attention and focus of all age groups,” she said.By Kim Da-sol","some 100 seoul residents ,100 seoul residents who ,100 seoul residents ,art on seoul streets ,project art on seoul","['Seo Ji - eun', 'Coreana Museum of \xa0 Art', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41211691  0.09922054

They are just six matches away from finishing the season without a loss, an unprecedented feat since the league started in 1983.   At the Asian Football Confederation  Champions League, Jeonbuk are one step closer to reaching the final after beating FC Seoul 4-1 in their first semifinal leg Wednesday. They are looking for their first AFC Champions League  title since 2006.   Since they were founded in 1995, Jeonbuk have never won both domestic league and the ACL in the same year. However, even if they go on to claim both titles, the 2016 season will not be remembered as a glorious one.   On Friday, the K League's disciplinary committee slapped Jeonbuk with a nine-point deduction and 100 million won  fine after one of the club's scouts was convicted for bribing two referees in 2013. The decision came two days after the Busan District Court sentenced the scout, identified only by his surname Cha, to a six-month suspended jail term.    The penalty slashed Jeonbuk's points from 68 to 59. They are now only five points ahead of No. 2 FC Seoul, who have 16 wins, six draws and 10 losses with six matches remaining.   The domestic title defense isn't even the club's biggest concern. Now, Jeonbuk's legacy has been spoiled and fans will doubt whether the club's achievements in the past and the present are trustworthy. The scout joined Jeonbuk in 2002.   In 2013, Jeonbuk finished third in the league with a record of 18 wins, nine draws and 11 losses. During that season, current head coach Choi Kang-hee rejoined Jeonbuk after leading the South Korean national team for 18 months.   Fortunately for Jeonbuk, the K League disciplinary committee concluded that there was no evidence of match-fixing in 2013 although the two referees accepted the bribes.   ""If we found that the matches were fixed, the punishment on Jeonbuk would have been more severe,"" said Cho Nam-don, who heads the league's disciplinary committee.   However, Jeonbuk's attitude during the investigation may further anger fans. According to Cho, Jeonbuk were not cooperative at all as they also sent their documents late. He also pointed out that Jeonbuk players and coaching staff have shown little respect to referees' calls during matches.    Just minutes after the league confirmed the penalty, Jeonbuk released a statement to apologize for the incident.    Choi and general manager Lee Chul-geun both hinted at resignations when the bribery scandal was first reported in May, saying they will take responsibility. It is widely expected that the two will announce their future moves after the season is over.   If they both depart Jeonbuk, it will be the first such double resignation in K League history over a scandal of this type.   It also means the end of so-called ""Jeonbuk Dynasty."" Choi and Lee have been the backbone of Jeonbuk's success in the 2000s. They have produced four domestic league titles and the 2006 ACL crown.Choi first came to Jeonbuk in 2005, two years after Lee arrived at the club as secretary-general.     The bribery scandal involving the league's top team isn't also good news for the K League, which is trying to become one of the world's top-10 football leagues by 2020. After a huge match-fixing scandal in 2011, in which more than 50 indicted players received lifetime bans, the league has been trying to revive football fever in the nation.   Earlier speculation had it that Jeonbuk might face demotion to the second-division K League Challenge, just like the Italian giants Juventus, with the K League seeking to send a message on corruption. Juventus were relegated to Serie B for their involvement in a massive match-fixing scandal in 2006, also known as ""Calciopoli.""    However, Jeonbuk's punishment was not even as severe as that on Gyeongnam FC, who were given a 10-point deduction and a 70 million won fine for the 2016 season after their club executives were also convicted of bribery last year.   Cho said considering Jeonbuk's status in South Korean football, they had to be punished properly for the bribery scandal. However, since the scale of the corruption is smaller than that of Gyeongnam's or Juventus', the league decided to settle for nine-point deduction and a 100 million won fine.    ""We had to think about the objectivity and consistency of the punishment level,"" he said.     The committee's decision came just a day after the Korea Professional Sports Association, whose member includes the K League, and the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Tourism vowed zero tolerance for corruption. The new measures will go into effect next January.   The K League will likely face criticism that the penalty on Jeonbuk may not have been enough to prevent corruption in the future and send warning to others.

Stuck in a political limbo imposed by the actions of dictator Bashar al-Assad, brutal militant groups and foreign powers, it is ordinary Syrians who are paying the price, he pointed out. “Men are forced to serve in the Islamic State’s army, women are not allowed to walk alone on the streets and children are not able to go to school because of continued bombings,” he said of the situation in Raqqa, the de facto capital for the Islamic State group. “It is like a prison.”“As air strikes continue, many more civilians than terrorists die. Kidnapping, injuries and death from bombings have just become a part of life for ordinary Syrians,” he said. “We die there or we die while crossing the sea. But IS only expands its territory.” The war also reshaped their culture, he said. They say good-bye to their families before leaving home every day as if they may not see each other again. “My family is in the process of seeking refugee status in Turkey and one brother in Norway,” he said. “Many Syrians could not flee, as IS has completely shut down the area in recent months.” Almohammad Agha, a former law student at the University of Damascus, first came to Korea in 2009 to pursue a Ph.D. degree in law at Dongguk University in Seoul. While studying, he founded Help Syria in 2013 to collect donations, send humanitarian aid for Syrians and run campaigns to raise awareness of Syrian refugees in Korea. The revolution began in March 2011 as peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations against President Assad’s dictatorship as a part of the Arab Spring. President Assad opened fire on protestors to crush the dissent, which prompted hundreds of thousands of Syrians to take to the streets and then escalated into a full-blown civil war. But the conflict grew into more than just a battle between those for and against President Assad, with the rise of the radical militant Islamic State taking over large swathes of the country and foreign countries swaying influence. Calling the war in Syria a “proxy war” among major world powers, Almohammad Agha claimed that international intervention has only prolonged the bloody confrontation in Syria. “The world’s powerful countries set foot in Syria, but not in a way we wanted. They have come together to solve the situation in Syria, but they never listened to Syrians’ voices,” he said. “By selectively supporting different groups in the opposition bloc, the situation became complex, and even rebel groups are fighting with each other.”“The opposition bloc, which all want the president to resign, is deeply divided over their stances on terrorist groups and how to finance their war, with hundreds of different groups forming alliances with different countries,” he said. “In the face of the fragmented opposition forces, the Syrian government and IS are advancing.”The US and its allies -- Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, the UK and France -- have selectively supported moderate rebels in the Sunni-dominated opposition bloc as part of efforts to fight IS and other jihadist groups. Russia and Iran have remained the closest allies of President Assad, supplying funds and weapons to the Alawite-led Syrian regime to suit their own agendas. A series of attempts to bring peace to Syria amid intensifying attacks to occupy the northern city of Aleppo, including a recent agreement between the US and Russia for a cease-fire, have been foiled, with the countries trading accusations for the failed truce. Further complicating the situation, IS cashes in on the chaos and fights rebel groups and rival jihadists from the al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front, the government and government-backed Kurdish forces to expand its territory. “The Syrian war has been described as a war of religion, but the situation is more complicated. Religion is not as big of an issue as it seems from the outside world,” he said. “Syria’s leadership and regional and world powers are pursuing their self-interest and they are using religion as the cause.” “For many Syrians, IS is a terrorist group with beard, the international community is a terrorist group without beard,” he said. “The Syrian government is to blame for the civil war, but the conflicts escalated after the international community meddled in the situation.”“As I see it as a Syrian, the answer is simple. The international community should leave Syria alone and stop funding any groups so that it can solve its problem on its own,” he said. “Otherwise, the international community and rebel groups should come as a one and join forces to topple the autocratic Assad government and IS.” “When the government gains control again, Syria will slip back into dictatorship,” he said of the Assad administration. Five years into the drawn-out war in Syria, more than 250,000 people have been killed by air and ground strikes as well as land mines, with half of them believed to be civilians. There are 4.8 million Syrian refugees registered on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in its neighboring countries, with Turkey hosting the largest number of Syrian refugees at 2.7 million. At least 6.6 million Syrians struggle to survive inside the war-stricken country while being internally displaced. “In Syria, the food price skyrocketed. The Syrian government cut off water, electricity supplies and telecommunications in rebel- or IS-held regions,” said the activist, who has traveled to Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan on several occasions to deliver relief aid. The situation at refugee camps in Europe and the Middle East is also appalling as asylum-seekers are often squeezed into small areas without sufficient food, medical care and education or any freedom to move around.“I think that the continued war and refugee crisis are a result of the international community’s failed intervention in Syria,” he said. “But foreign countries shift responsibility onto each other for Syrian refugees, treating us like a burden.”“It is worrisome that anti-refugee sentiment grows, with radical groups blaming refugees for everything from faltering economy to terrorism, which leaves little place for Syrian refugees to settle in.” The European Union is currently discussing an asylum seeker redistribution plan, as migrants fleeing violence in the Middle East flock to its member countries. According to Eurostat, 1.2 million people made perilous crossings to seek asylum in Europe in 2015, with Syrians accounting for almost one-third of those. South Korea, the first Asian nation to enact a Refugee Act, also saw a surge in the number of asylum-seekers, from 1,574 in 2013 to 2,896 in 2014 and 5,711 last year. It has accepted 576 cases out of a total of 15,250 asylum applications, putting the refugee acceptance rate at 3.7 percent. But the country did not appear to be welcoming of Syrian asylum-seekers either, he said.As of the end of last year, 1,052 Syrians applied for asylum, but only three received refugee status, though another 644 were granted the right to stay here on humanitarian grounds until the war ends in their home country. The humanitarian visa restricts holders from bringing their families or freely traveling outside Korea. The visa holders are required to extend their work permits every six months, which further reduces their chance of securing a stable job and income. “It is difficult to get jobs as most Syrians, who are on humanitarian visas, should extend it every six months. The procedures are too complicated for asylum-seekers who are not able to speak the local language or English,” he said. “Many find work illegally without insurance, and their unstable status makes them more vulnerable to exploitation at work.”The most difficult part is, however, that the public increasingly views all Muslims as potential terrorists, he said. This year, the Justice Ministry drew criticism for denying Syrian asylum-seekers’ rights to apply for refugee status in the country at the height of fears following the Paris terrorist attack in November 2015.The ministry had cited that the Syrians had no clear reason to seek asylum in the country and that they flew to Korea via what it saw as safe countries, such as China or Turkey. A total of 28 Syrians stayed for six months at a deportation room at Incheon International Airport from the end of last year while challenging the ministry’s decision at court. Since the court ruled in favor of them in June this year, they have legally entered the country and are going through a refugee screening process. “Lack of awareness on refugees creates misunderstandings. What Syrians need in Korea and around the world most of all is their understanding that we did not choose to be forcibly displaced,” he said. “We are the people who want to return to Syria where our family, our jobs and our home are.”To stop the refugee crisis from engulfing the world, the war should come to an end, he said. While Russia and the US blame each other for the collapse of a recent cease-fire deal, it takes the greater political will of the international community to bring peace to Syria, he added.Despite the seemingly grim outlook for the situation in Syria, Almohammad Agha remained hopeful about the country’s future. “Peace is absolutely possible in Syria. As a tree with strong roots can further grow when rotten parts are removed, Syria is going to rise again as soon as flawed leadership is excised.”By Ock Hyun-ju","syrian war refugee ,war refugee crisis life ,for syrian war refugee ,syria before the war ,crisis life in syria","['Syria', 'mespotamian', 'Almohammad Agha']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48368645 -0.04492078

Being born out of incest encouraged by zookeepers, the little tiger – named “Crane” -- was predisposed to cataracts and had a deformed face. Ten years later, Hwang reunited with Crane, who was relocated to a zoo in Gangwon Province after losing popularity among Seoul spectators when it became bigger and older. By the time Hwang saw Crane, the tiger had fallen ill because the financially troubled zoo could not afford enough food for him. A tiger eats a chicken at Seoul Zoo. It is a part of a program improving animals’ behavioral awareness. The story of the little tiger Crane sparked a debate here within social and scientific communities: whether the government should keep allowing private or public entities to keep wild animals in the name of conservation. While some groups argue that taking in animals from the wild is crucial to protect species and educate the public, others say that any preservation strategy that involves violence or captivity should be stopped and demand alternatives to cruel practices. “No matter how ‘natural’ they make the animals’ caged-in areas, once zoos recreate an area, it is now artificial and unnatural,” American animal rights activist Gary Yourofsky wrote on his website Animals Deserve Absolute Protection Today and Tomorrow. The activists assert that modern-day zoos must be transformed into sanctuaries for wild animals, allowing animals to live out their lives, while visitors can be given a virtual ride in such areas as an auditorium to see them.Animals living in zoos are exempt from laws dealing with animal protection in Korea. Zoos can be built by anyone in accordance with the Museum and Art Gallery Support Act and Tourism Promotion Act -- none of which include clauses preventing abuse.South Korea’s Animal Protection Act, which took effect in 2014, stipulates that the term “abuse” should be defined as a behavior causing injury and death. Other disciplinary behavior on animals, such as punishment during training for animal shows, is not banned, animal activists groups point out. Some lawmakers here attempted to enact laws aiming to prevent abuses at the zoos. They sought to ban zoos from imposing harsh training on animals for entertainment shows and restrict what they saw as “unqualified” entities from building zoos with poor environment.Among them was a bill sponsored by Jang Han-na, a former lawmaker of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea. Titled “bill for managing zoos and aquariums,” the legislation cleared the National Assembly in May 2016 during its final plenary session. It was nearly three years after draft bill was submitted. But the bill was criticized for amendments to some key clauses. According to the final version of the law, any entity can run zoos as long as they get approval from the government. The draft version forced the authority to approve the operation only if they deem that the zoo provides adequate environment for the animals. “We feel more disappointed than welcoming,” the Korea Animal Welfare Association said in a statement published after the bill was signed into law. “It is regression from the draft version and we might as well pin our hopes on the next Assembly.”Chang claimed that there was “systematic interference” in the legislative efforts by conglomerates who own private zoos and aquariums. Denying the allegation, the zoo operators asserted that imposing stricter laws would push out minor zoos and hamper their efforts to preserve species. “Almost all private zoos would have closed their businesses if the law had been passed as intended,’ Noh Jung-rae, a former head of Seoul Zoo, said in a media interview. Experts suggested that the government should officially designate the role of zoos as promoting biodiversity – and the zoos themselves also should move beyond tourism attractions to become places to preserve endangered species. “The most important role of the zoo is to preserve species,” said Lee Hang, a professor at Seoul National University who teaches evolutionary biology and zoology. “The government should implement laws that stipulates the purpose of zoos is species preservation, not public entertainment.” By Yeo Jun-suk","zookeepers the little tiger ,incest encouraged by zookeepers ,little tiger named crane ,zoos for south korea ,baby tiger who lives","['South Korea ’s', 'Seoul', 'Hwang', 'Crane', 'Gangwon Province', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17638449  0.42425892

The survey added that teachers believe the 12-year course of education puts students under an excessive amount of pressure only for the sake of exams, but teaches few subjects that can help students become more adaptable in the future. Meanwhile, a low level of proficiency and understanding of subjects among students is attributed to textbooks that “cover too many topics that are too difficult,” said 64 percent of the survey’s respondents, or 426 of them. On the other hand, customized education and curriculum for students are “almost impossible” at the moment, said 422 of the surveyed teachers. They added that the structure of the education system in South Korea is to blame.

""It is also a diplomatic failure as it will induce China and Russia, necessary partners in our talks with Pyongyang, to turn their back away from us,"" Choo said, adding Park's security policies are ""outdated.""Choo's remark is significant as the main opposition party had remained relatively neutral in comparison to other minor parties on the THAAD issue.The main opposition also criticized the failure of the government to make enough efforts to revitalize the national economy that directly impacts the livelihood of the people.""Operating profits of some local firms have hit bottom.Outlooks suggest the growth will reach 1-2 percent in 2020,"" Choo said.""Shipbuilding, shipping, steel, and petrochemical industries, which have been standing as key sectors, are also facing challenges due to falling exports and sluggish domestic demand,"" Choo added.Choo said the situation is attributable to Park as well as her predecessor Lee Myung-bak for not doing an effective job in propping up the economy.","tuesday said the government ,criticized south korea plans ,during her parliamentary speech ,head slams gov security ,south korea main opposition","[""South Korea 's"", 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Park Geun', ""South Korea 's"", 'US', 'Termi']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.10318355  0.31855363

Park's visit to Russia is part of her eight-day trip that will also takes her to China and Laos. Under the main theme, ""Opening up the Russian Far East,"" the second EEF will bring together some 2,500 participants from 32 countries, including China, Japan and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations .At the forum on Saturday, Park will deliver a keynote speech to put forward her vision for cooperation with Russia in the development of the Russian Far East, her office Cheong Wa Dae said.After the forum, Park will sit down with Putin for a summit to discuss cooperation on an array of issues, including joint efforts to denuclearize North Korea and curb its provocations. The agenda also includes a set of global issues, such as terrorism and climate change.The recent decision by Seoul and Washington to deploy an advanced U.S. antimissile system on South Korean soil is expected to be discussed at the summit, since it has emerged as a source of tension in bilateral relations.Moscow, along with Beijing, has strenuously opposed the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense  battery to the Korean Peninsula, arguing the deployment would only escalate regional tensions and undermine its security interests.During her summit with Putin, Park will likely reiterate that the THAAD deployment is an inevitable, self-defense measure to counter Pyongyang's evolving nuclear and missile threats, and that it will only target the provocative state, observers said.The South Korean leader is also expected to use the summit to restore trust with Moscow.The bilateral relationship has apparently chilled since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which Seoul, in tandem with the international community, maintains breached international law and undermined Ukraine's territorial integrity.The suspension of the “Rajin-Khasan” project, a three-way logistics scheme involving the two Koreas and Russia, has added fresh tensions to two-way ties. The project got bogged down after Pyongyang's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month.This week's summit between Park and Putin will be the fourth one.The two leaders held talks on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20  in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in September 2013; during Putin's visit to Seoul in November 2013; and at the U.N. conference on climate change in November 2015.Following Park's visit to Russia, she will travel to Hangzhou, eastern China, to attend the G-20 summit.The two-day event, slated to begin Sunday, will be held under the main theme, ""Towards an Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy.""At the summit, Park plans to voice her concerns over the recrudescence of protectionist tendencies and call for more active efforts by the G-20 to expand free trade, Cheong Wa Dae said.From Wednesday to Thursday, Park will attend the South Korea-ASEAN summit, the ASEAN-plus-three summit, which involves South Korea, China and Japan, and the East Asia Summit , all of which will take place in the Laotian capital of Vientiane.The EAS is a summit that includes the U.S., Russia, India, Australia and New Zealand, along with the ASEAN-plus-three members.Following the multilateral summits, Park will begin her official visit to Laos, which was arranged on the invitation of Laotian President Bounnhang Vorachith.On Friday, the leaders of South Korea and Laos will hold a summit to discuss trade, investment, development and other areas of mutual concern, the presidential office said.","vladivostok russia on friday ,annual eastern economic forum ,forum summit with putin ,her eight day trip ,russia on friday","['vladivostok', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Vladivostok', 'Russia', 'russian', 'Vladimir Putin', 'China', 'Laos', 'russian', 'Park', 'Eastern Economic Forum', 'EEF', 'Russia']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43648738  0.60638791

She also admitted her lack of experience in the cultural sector but underlined her expertise in intellectual property, pledging to achieve the nation’s cultural prosperity and thus to contribute to economic growth.Culture Minister nominee Cho Yoon-sun attends her confirmation hearing at the National Assembly on Wednesday. ”I am well aware that my culture-related experience is limited to dealing with intellectual property as lawyer,“ Cho said at her hearing held by the parliamentary committee for education, culture, sports and tourism.The former lawyer and lawmaker, known for her close ties with President Park Geun-hye, was named on Aug. 16 as chief of the culture department.In response to the doubts over her qualification as culture minister, Cho cited a tourism promotion bill which she had motioned back in the 18th National Assembly when she was member of the culture committee. She also mentioned her leading role in a key state-led project to restore cultural assets, including the legation building of the former Korean Empire in the United States.”Culture should be combined with other industries such as tourism, medical care, education, manufacturing and information technology to create jobs and to steer economic growth,“ Cho said.”It was for such reason that the government suggested cultural prosperity as a keynote.“Creative economy, a broader concept encompassing cultural prosperity, is the essential state administration slogan put forward by the Park government.As for the disputed removal of the ”girl statue,” the nominee remained passive.”I understand it is not for the  government to decide ,“ she said, in answer to a question by Rep. An Min-suk of The Minjoo Party of Korea.When the main opposition lawmaker repeatedly urged for her stance, she said that she ”personally doesn‘t agree.“Cho’s hearing kicked off in the late afternoon after hours of delay and a heated verbal battle between rival parties, which had led to an abrupt adjournment of the session earlier on the day.The trigger of the dispute came from the ruling Saenuri Party members of the committee, who claimed that chairman Yoo Sung-yop was unqualified to lead the hearing, citing his alleged lopsidedness over the government‘s extra budget bill. Rep. Yoo is affiliated with the runner-up opposition People’s Party.The committee, in the absence of the objecting ruling party members, had voted in favor of a budget bill clause to draw up 600 billion won  to cover for regional education debts Monday.Yoo attempted to push ahead with the hearing, urging lawmakers to focus on assessing the minister nominee, but had to adjourn the session due to the aggravating verbal exchange. The 10 a.m. meeting, which was delayed by 55 minutes, only lasted 40 minutes.The session reopened in the afternoon but only opposition lawmakers were present, with Saenuri members boycotting it.","war ii sex slavery ,personally against the removal ,confirmation hearing on wednesday ,culture minister nominee grilled ,ii sex slavery she","['Cho Yoon - sun', 'Japan']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.0457365   0.3692905

These multilateral summits have provided opportunities for participating leaders to meet bilaterally on the sidelines.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula spiked after the North successfully conducted an SLBM test last week, sending the missile, designated KN-11, some 500 kilometers over the East Sea, the greatest distance the communist nation has achieved since it began SLBM tests last year.Moreover, the missile was launched at a high angle, meaning the missile could have flown farther, possibly more than 1,000 km, if it had been fired at a regular angle.","president barack obama will ,south korean president park ,with south korean president ,korean president park geun ,attend the g20 summit","['US', 'Barack Obama', ""South Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Group', 'the White House', 'G20', 'chinese', 'Hangzhou']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26238975  0.8237136

Earlier this year, he was appointed head consultant for Seoul City’s design policy.Ahn said Seoul City’s recent project can bridge the gap between art and citizens.Ahn Kyu-chul, a formative arts professor at Korea National University of Arts and head consultant of the Seoul City’s design policy, poses for a photo at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on Saturday. “There are many of us who do not even try to understand art. People feel distant from art, thinking, ‘What does that statue have to do with me?’” Ahn said in an interview with The Korea Herald.“Through this project, we have tried to change that paradigm in which the public remains silent over art,” said Ahn.Signs that citizens are starting to become more vocal over public art could be seen in 2008, when a sculpture shaped like a conch shell, named “Spring,” was installed by Cheonggye Stream. Created by Dutch artist Coosje Van Bruggen and Swedish artist Claes Oldenburg, the 3.4 billion-won  sculpture was paid for by mobile carrier KT. Public debate was stoked over it, with some supporting its installation at the then newly refurbished stream through the heart of the capital. Others criticized it as having little links to the history of the site and being designed by foreign artists. According to the SMG’s design policy principals, measures regarding public art should put Seoul residents before visitors, while problems should be publicly discussed -- instead of hidden -- to come up with solutions. Ahn also mentioned the current Korean museum culture that views visitors simply as consumers. “The local art scene has been trying via trial and error to increase audience engagement in their artworks, but there are still many that let the audience passively view art and leave exhibition halls without any impact,” said Ahn.That is why museums here should constantly help educate audiences on how to effectively digest art to newly define it and make the local scene more active, he added.“These ideas will become reality through this project by allowing citizens to uncover and appreciate public art. We hope this project will establish an effective feedback system to build a strong public art scene in Korea,” Ahn added.By Kim Da-sol","saturday for seoul city ,lecture to hundred participants ,arts professor at korea ,on saturday for seoul ,love locks at seoul","['Ahn Kyu - chul', 'Korea National University of Arts', 'Namsan', 'Ahn', 'Seoul City ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4303045   0.10747936

The construction of the model park was overseen by Jang, the source added.Located in the foothills of Mount Taesong in the North's capital, the 2-million-square-meter theme park is known to have been set up and spearheaded by Jang, under the instruction of the incumbent leader's late father.Another source said that Kim ordered officials in May to delete photos and records related to the folklore park from publications, saying that it is a political matter of erasing the vestiges of reactionary elements.""We assumed that North Korea is partially doing work , but the country may not be deleting anything  indiscriminately all at once,"" said an official at Seoul's unification ministry.","erasing executed uncle ,2013 for treason source ,executed uncle ,with erasing executed uncle ,erasing executed uncle legacy","[""North Korea 's"", 'Jang Song - thaek', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Pyongyang']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.43429357 -0.01200214

This photo, taken on Aug. 17, 2016, shows President Park Geun-hye speaking during a meeting with leaders of provincial governments at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. Her trip to China was arranged amid growing tensions over the planned deployment of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to South Korea. Attention is being drawn to whether Park and her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will discuss the deployment on the sidelines of the multilateral summit.Following the G-20 gathering, the president will travel to the Laotian capital of Vientiane on Sep. 7 for summit meetings related to the 10-member ASEAN -- South Korea's strategically crucial partner whose regional influence has been increasing since it launched the ASEAN Community late last year.The resource-rich Southeast Asian states are of great strategic importance as they stretch across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, where the world's most crucial trading and energy supply routes pass, including the vulnerable and congested Strait of Malacca.During the summit with the ASEAN, Park will explore ways to strengthen the bilateral strategic partnership with the bloc, her office said.

Nagamine, who joined the Japanese Foreign Ministry in 1977, previously served as ambassador to the Netherlands and director general of the ministry's International Legal Affairs Bureau.The appointment of Nagamine, who is not a South Korea expert, as Japan's top envoy in Seoul is seen as a move to manage the bilateral relations in a stable way following a landmark agreement in late December on resolving the issue of Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women for its troops during World War II.Bessho served as Japan's top envoy to South Korea for nearly four years from October 2012 before taking office as U.N. ambassador in June.","seoul next week sources ,in seoul next week ,the new japanese ambassador ,seoul next week ,seoul next week multiple","['japanese', 'South Korea', 'Yasumasa Nagamine', 'Seoul', 'Seoul', 'Nagamine', 'japanese', 'Koro Bessho', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'japanese']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.88365448  0.43773061

According to a report by the ministry, 67.6 percent of elementary, middle and high schools in the nation provide free meals to all students regardless of their families’ income, as of 2016. The proportion was 46.8 percent in 2011. The free lunches cost the schools a combined 2.64 trillion won, a 4.7 percent increase from the previous year. By region, schools in cities and provinces under liberal education superintendents were most likely to provide students with the free meals. Nearly 88 percent of the students in Sejong enjoyed meals for free, followed by Southern Jeolla Province , Northern Jeolla Province  and Gangwon Province . South Gyeongsang Province, where its Mayor Hong Joon-pyo vehemently objected to the free lunch policy and stopped funding the program last year, saw only 24.3 percent of its students offered free meals. Daegu  and Ulsan  also had a relatively lower portion of students benefitting from the free meal scheme. Students participate in a rally calling for the abolishment of the free school meal system in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in January. In the report, the Education Ministry called on municipal education offices to rethink the current free meals, citing concerns that the policy worsens the quality of food due to the lack of budget. The Education Ministry’s position on the universal free meal program comes amid persistent tension between right-wing regional governments and left-wing education superintendents over the progressive-initiated welfare policy. The right-wing bloc has portrayed the free meal plan as “populist” and claimed that free lunches should be limited to only students from low-income families. The liberal opposition has argued that it is a part of mandatory education under the Constitution and a selective welfare system would divide students into the rich and poor. Thirteen liberal education superintendents out of 17 in the country, who took office in the 2014 election, support the free school meal plan. While the central government pressures local education offices to assign their own budget for the state-initiated child care program called the “Nuri curriculum,” left-wing education superintendents have prioritized the implementation of the free lunch program over the child care scheme. The free child care program, which was initiated by former President Lee Myung-bak’s administration, was a major part of President Park Geun-hye’s welfare pledges during her campaign in 2012. The expenses for the program are currently shared by municipalities and regional education offices, with the portion depending on each region.Conservative mayors including Hong Joon-pyo have been reluctant to assign budgets for free meal schemes, resulting in a lower proportion of students enjoying free meals in such regions. In July, Rep. Roh Hoe-chan of the minor opposition party submitted a revision to the School Meal Act in an attempt to protest Hong’s decision to stop funding the free meal program. The revision was aimed at expanding municipalities’ responsibility to implement the free meal scheme and make it mandatory for the central government to cover more than half of the amount needed to buy ingredients for school meals.

They met with the coast guard stationed there as well as civic groups. It was the first such trip by Korean lawmakers since 2013 when a group of politicians visited the Dokdo Islets to counter Japan’s territorial claims to it. “ is a part of the routine job as a member of the National Assembly,” said Rep. Na Kyung-won of the ruling Saenuri Party, who led the bipartisan delegates. The group also included two members from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea and one from the People’s Party. Ten Korean lawmakers led by Rep. Na Kyung-won  of the Saenuri Party, salute the national flag during their visit to Korea’s easternmost Dokdo Islets on Monday. Citing Tokyo’s protest of the visit, the former chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee denounced Japan for “overreacting” to the lawmakers’ visit to their own territory, dismissing the neighbor state’s argument as something that “is beyond comprehension and common sense.” Japan has made repeated claims to the islets, most recently on Aug. 2 when it referred to the Dokdo Islets as its territory in a defense white paper.Following the visit, the Japanese government lodged a protest.“It is extremely regrettable that this visit took place despite protests beforehand,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference Monday. Since the lawmakers’ trip plan was released over the weekend, Japan’s Foreign Ministry officials have delivered complaints. Korea’s Foreign Ministry officials refused to accept the complaints, according to diplomatic sources.Although rare, South Korean politicians have made visits to the Dokdo Islets in the past. The most recent visit was by former chairman of the Minjoo Party Moon Jae-in, who made a trip there last month.Another high-profile visit was by former President Lee Myung-bak in 2012. Japan had reacted to the presidential visit by temporarily calling in its ambassador to Korea and pushing to take the case to the International Court of Justice.It has been a long-held position of the Seoul government that Tokyo’s incessant public claims over the islets and open protests are aimed at depicting the issue as an international conflict. The South Korean government maintains that the sovereignty of the Dokdo Islets controlled by Korea has no room for dispute. Some experts warned that the move is not helpful and that the islets should not be used to boost a politician’s political profile.“I doubt that there was diplomatic consideration before pushing for the visit,” said Hosaka Yuji, a professor who studies Japan and regional politics at Sejong University, told The Korea Herald. The Japanese-turned-Korean scholar is a prominent advocate of Seoul’s claim to the islets. “The Dokdo  issue requires delicate strategy. Politicians should refrain from acting emotionally and being obsessed with domestic politics.”By Yeo Jun-suk","korean lawmakers since 2013 ,1945 ten lawmakers landed ,trip by korean lawmakers ,ten lawmakers landed ,1910 1945 ten lawmakers","['Korea', 'Dokdo Islets', 'japanese', 'korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37757656  0.54255748

Tokyo's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga expressed regrets over the lawmakers' visit to Dokdo.South Korea maintains that Dokdo is its territory ""historically, geographically and by international law.""South Korea has been in effective control of the islets since the Korean Peninsula's liberation from Japan in 1945.

In addition, the North's report that Choe Ryong-hae met with the interim Brazilian leader turned out to be false.Choe, who holds the title of vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, arrived in Rio de Janeiro last Thursday  to attend the Olympics, local sources said. His visit has been seen as a move to take full advantage of the Olympics to carry out sports diplomacy in a bid to break away from international isolation following Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missile development. Choe Ryong-hae, vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, leaves Sambodromo in Rio de Janeiro on Aug. 10, after watching the women's individual archery competition at the 31st Summer Olympic Games. However, Choe, who doubles as the head of North Korea's commission for physical culture and sports, seems to have had little activity in meeting with influential political figures, and has restricted himself to watching North Korean athletes' perform and going on sightseeing trips.Choe on Tuesday visited Sambodromo, where the archery events are taking place, and watched compatriot Kang Un-ju performing in the women's individual archery qualification rounds. He then went to Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre to watch the women's synchronized 10m platform diving final where North Koreans Kim Kuk-hyang and Kim Mi-rae competed. On Monday, Choe watched table tennis player Kim Song-i and toured the Christ the Redeemer statue on Corcovado Mountain, the iconic tourist attraction in Rio. Wearing a black suit, he was with Kim Chol-hak, North Korea's ambassador to Brazil, and other four officials. The senior official on Sunday was at Riocentro-Pavillion 2 to watch weightlifter Om Yun-chol's performance. But after Om failed to defend his Olympic gold, Choe left the venue and didn't watch the weightlifter receiving the silver medal from Chang Ung, the lone North Korean International Olympic Committee member. Choe did meet with some top figures from around the world on the eve of the Olympic opening ceremony. He attended the gala dinner hosted by the IOC where U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, French President Fran?ois Hollande, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the IOC President Thomas Bach were present.Pyongyang's state-run Korean Central News Agency, meanwhile, reported on Sunday that Choe ""separately met"" with Bach and International Judo Federation President Marius Vizer on the day of the gala dinner. The KCNA also said Choe on Friday met with Interim Brazilian President Michel Temer and expressed the North's willingness to ""develop friendly and cooperative relations with Brazil."" North Korea and Brazil established diplomatic ties in March 2001.However, an official from Brazil's foreign affairs ministry told Yonhap News Agency that the meeting with Choe and Temer never took place on Friday. ""We know there's a high-ranking North Korean official in Rio, but he didn't separately meet with Temer,"" an official said Tuesday on condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the issue. ""We can't also tell whether Choe's side tried to contact top Brazilian officials, but was denied a meeting."" It was widely expected that the North will try to show that it is a normal country and improve its external image through the Olympics. After sanctions from the international community, Choe was expected to meet with global leaders in Rio and explain the overall situation facing the country and defend its actions. Sources following Choe in Rio said he is staying at a hotel that is outside of the downtown area. His room is apparently next to where Kwon Sung-chol, former North Korean ambassador to Cuba, is staying. An official from hotel said not many foreign VIPs are staying here due to security concerns. Choe is known to be staying at this hotel until Thursday.","31st summer olympic games ,nonexistent in sports diplomacy ,the 31st summer olympic ,31st summer olympic ,korea no man attending","[""North Korea 's"", 'Choe Ryong - hae', 'brazilian', ""North Korea 's"", 'State Affairs Commission']",8,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.71949255  0.43117011

South Korean Ambassador to the United States Ahn Ho-young  and other participants cut the tape during a ceremony in the Presidio of San Francisco on Aug. 1 to mark the inauguration of a 1950-53 Korean War memorial. Prior to the unveiling of the memorial, the foundation held a ceremony at the national cemetery to mark the inauguration of the memorial, which faces south in the direction of South Korea and carries the engraved words on the war's progress and achievements of felled U.S. soldiers.Among the 300 participants to the ceremony were retired Superior Court Judge Quentin Kopp, chief of the foundation's board; South Korean Ambassador to the United States Ahn Ho-young; former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Kathleen Stephens; U.S. Congressman Mike Honda; and former U.S. Congressman Paul McCloskey.Photo taken on Aug. 1, 2016, shows a 1950-53 Korean War memorial unveiled in the Presidio of San Francisco. During the ceremony, McCloskey, who fought in the war as a U.S. Marine officer, said, “It was a war that had to be fought, and I was proud to have fought in it.”The South Korean envoy recalled the sacrifices that U.S. soldiers made in the war, which is often called the forgotten war, saying, ""Americans came to fight for a country they never knew, for a people they never met."" Korean-American residents, Korean War veterans and various companies provided a combined 2.8 billion won  and the ministry provided another 1.1 billion won to build the first Korean War memorial in the western part of the United States.The U.S. led the 21-nation Allied Forces to help South Korea repel the Chinese-backed communist troops invading from the North.Nearly 38,000 U.N. troops, most of them from the U.S., were killed in action during the conflict. The war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the divided peninsula still technically at war.","korean war monument unveiled ,for korean war veterans ,korean war veterans opened ,53 korean war memorial ,korean war memorial foundation","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'San Francisco', 'U.S.', 'U.S.']",8,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.37231743 0.04553313 0.64732385],임정요,Social affairs,8,2016,"city for korean war veterans ,53 korean war memorial unveiled ,korean war memorial unveiled ,korean war veterans opened the ,the first korean war memorial","['South Korea', 'U.S.', 'San Francisco', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'the Presidio of San Francisco', 'the San Francisco National Cemetery', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'south korean', 'the United States', 'Ahn Ho - young', 'the Presidio of San Francisco', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Superior Court', 'Quentin Kopp', 'south korean', 'the United States', 'Ahn Ho - young', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Kathleen Stephens', 'U.S.', 'Mike Honda', 'U.S.', 'Paul McCloskey', 'the Presidio of San Francisco', 'McCloskey', 'U.S. Marine', 'south korean', 'U.S.', 'Americans', 'korean', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Allied Forces', 'South Korea', 'Chinese', 'U.N.', 'U.S.']",13,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.37231743 0.04553313 0.64732385]

It is Fanning's first trip to the region since taking office as secretary in May.U.S. officials declined to provide details on Fanning's itinerary, but sources in Seoul have said he is expected to visit the Eighth Army's 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade that is expected to operate the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit to be deployed in the South's southeastern town of Seonju.He is also expected to visit other Army units and hold talks with South Korean officials.In early July, South Korea and the United States jointly announced a decision to put a THAAD battery in the South to cope with North Korean missile threats. The decision marked an official end to years of soul-searching by Seoul over how to deal with the sensitive issue amid Chinese claims the system can be used against it.The U.S. had long desired to deploy THAAD in the South, but Seoul had wavered over whether to accept the deployment because of Chinese objections. The North's fourth nuclear test in January and the long-range rocket launch the following month provided a strong impetus for the U.S. and South Korea to deploy the system.North Korea has been stepping up war threats in the runup to annual military exercises the U.S. and the South Korean militaries conduct jointly to test their preparedness against North Korean aggression.Pyongyang routinely denounces such maneuvers as a rehearsal for invasion.In Malaysia, Fanning was quoted as saying that the joint exercises with the South, set for late August, will go ahead as scheduled. He was also quoted by The Associated Press as saying that the exercises ""contribute to stability, they don't compete with stability.""","south korea on monday ,korea on monday ,korea on monday on ,fanning three day trip ,secretary to visit korea","['U.S.', 'Army', 'Eric Fanning', 'South Korea', 'the U.S. Army', 'asian', 'South Korea', 'Hawaii', 'Guam', 'Malaysia', 'Japan', 'Fanning']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32569811  0.21476156

85,85,85,[EYE] Author writes on her ‘right not to date’,"Throughout her 20s, Lee Jin-song has received unwanted advice on how to “improve” herself so she can enjoy dating.

The advice came from friends, both male and female, as well as acquaintances of different ages. “Some told me to grow my hair longer , some told me not to talk too much,” the 27-year-old author told The Korea Herald.“Some even told me, ‘Make sure you look impressed when talking to a man -- use phrases like “Really?” “I had no idea!” Be sweet when you listen, and pretend you don’t know what he’s talking about even if you do.’” Her latest book, “The Right Not to Date,” is a chronicle of her own experience as a young woman in South Korea, where, in her opinion, being single in one’s 20s and 30s is considered lazy, sad and even incompetent. Author Lee Jin-song poses for a photo after an interview with The Korea Herald on Monday. While arguing that being single should be respected as personal choice -- rather than something pitiable -- the book also claims such social pressure to date, and ultimately find the “right” spouse, is deeply linked to the nation’s prevalent lookism culture. While there is no academic study or statistics on the specific issue, Lee is confident that almost all Korean women in their 20s and 30s have experienced single-shaming at least once. This includes intrusive questions about their relationship status, such as “ you need to lower your standards to see someone” or “You should lose weight to find men.” “I think there is this pressure for young women to look desirable to the opposite sex at all times,” she said. “For example, I was once told to always put on makeup, in case I meet ‘someone’ -- a potential future boyfriend -- on public transportation. But not every woman’s life priority is to date men, or to be noticed by potential romantic partners.”Regardless of the social pressure, more Koreans are delaying marriage or deciding not to marry at all. The average age when Korean women have their first marriage rose from 23 in 1981 to 30 this year. For men, the age went from 26.4 to 32. The proportion of single-person households in Seoul increased from 4.5 percent to 27 percent over the same period. Lee said Korea is now seeing a new generation of women who desire neither marriage nor dating. The “sweet home” fantasy is now gone among many young women here, yet the social pressure that opposes being “against the norm” -- choosing not to be someone’s girlfriend or a mother at a certain age -- still persists in today’s society, she said. “There’s this rule on what you should be doing according to your age,” she said. “When you are a teenager, you should be studying. When you are in your 20s and 30s, you should be dating and get married. When you get married, you should have kids. This cycle never ends.”Lee said she assumes about 60 percent of all shaming of body and appearance against women in Korea is associated with their relationship status and value in the dating scene. There are countless ads that feature women’s clothing and beauty products marketed with taglines such as “lipstick that will get you men’s attention” or a “skirt that will net you a boyfriend,” she noted. At the same time, female friendships between single women are often mocked and trivialized in popular culture. For example, female comedians Kim Sook and Song Eun-yi are often made fun of for being close friends -- both of them are single -- in comedy shows, receiving comments like “You guys are too close. This is why neither of you are dating!”This oppresses women, regardless of being perceived as “attractive” or not, Lee said. When those perceived as good-looking choose not to date, they are often considered cocky or odd. For example, people might think that something must be wrong with them, despite their looks. Meanwhile, single women who are perceived as unattractive are often assumed to be single due to lack of interest from men. “Among many things, not ‘being popular’ among men often becomes a source of insult for many young women,” she writes in the book. “For example, feminists are insulted for being feminists by those who say, ‘They are into feminism because they were never liked by men.’ But popularity takes many different forms. People rarely get insulted for not being popular among children or among the elderly.” For the latest edition of her quarterly magazine Holo Quarterly -- “holo” means being alone in Korean -- Lee interviewed a young woman who has been single for a number of years by choice. In the interview, the woman shared her experiences of single-shaming in Korea’s dating scene, where she was often perceived as “peculiar” for choosing not to date “in spite of her pretty looks.”“When I turned down someone’s blind date offer, the person asked me, ‘Why do you waste your pretty face like that?’” she told Lee. “So does that mean my appearance is just solely for dating? If I’m not in a romantic relationship, am I ‘wasting’ myself? I personally like dressing up for my own satisfaction, but it seems that whatever efforts I make to look good are seen as efforts to appear desirable to men.”Once, when she turned down a man who asked her out on a date, he became angry and told her, “You are too cocky.  you are not pretty enough .” “So I guess in order to reject him, a woman has to be prettier than a certain degree,” the woman told Lee in the interview. She said there were a number of times she encountered unpleasant experiences with male strangers, who would follow her in the street or ask for her number. She genuinely found such experiences uncomfortable and even unsafe, but most of her friends would accuse her of “bragging” whenever she talked about it. “People would say, ‘Things like that only happens to good-looking people,’ or ‘You just want to brag, don’t you?’” Even when she experienced dating abuse from one of her ex-boyfriends, an acquaintance told her, “I don’t know why you are enduring such treatment from your boyfriend when you are a pretty woman.” “Being attractive and being a dating abuse victim are two different things,” the woman said. “So what does it mean? If a woman is not pretty, is it okay for her to be abused by romantic partners?”In Lee’s experience, even her postgraduate degree was considered something undesirable in the dating scene. Currently a Ph.D. student in Korean literature, she would often be told, including by cab drivers, “Smart women are not popular among men.” Lee also heard comments such as “Why do you study so hard? That’s going to make it harder for you to get married” and “That’s why men find you intimidating.”“But I wasn’t born to be ‘popular’ among men. That’s not the sole purpose of my life,” she said. “So if your life goals and choices are unpopular among people of the opposite sex, do you have to give them up?”Lee said ending single-shaming starts with accepting the diversity of human relationships, desires, tastes and choices. She said the current dating scene in Korea is strictly heterosexual-oriented, while women who are considered desirable are largely expected to look and behave in certain ways -- youthful, popular, attractive, smart -- but not ""too"" smart --  and nonaggressive. Yet not everyone wants to date and get married, and not everyone finds only a certain kind of person to be attractive, she said.“There are many ways to live your life. Often, single people are considered lazy or as not having the willingness to find someone. But life is all about making choices. That person may have chosen to invest his or her time and efforts in something else. That does not mean she or he is an unfulfilled person,” she said. “I think those who are single can be just as happy -- and unhappy -- as those who are in relationships. Just because you are married or in a relationship, it does not make you a superior person to someone who is single. One’s relationship status is not a symbol of success or failure. It’s just one of many choices you made in your life.” By Claire Lee","her 20s lee jin ,she can enjoy dating ,date throughout her 20s ,dating the advice came ,27 year old author","['Lee Jin - song', 'the Korea Herald']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59972     0.59366089

She publicly announced Sunday that “I am on the same side of Megalian,” which heated up debate online.Yoo pointed out what Korean feminists were trying to achieve in the group. “What Megalians do,” she wrote, “is swap the gender roles and send the comments right on back to men, what they have been doing against women on the Internet.” “If they call us names, we do exactly the same as they do,” she added. Her posting came after voiceover actress Kim Ja-yeon was let go by her employer Nexon, a game company, on July 25 after she uploaded a selfie on Twitter wearing a sweatshirt that read, “Girls do not need a prince.” The slogan indicates that she supports the online feminist group. Megalian, reacted furiously by holding a rally in front of Nexon’s head office in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province on July 25. Roughly 100 members of the feminist group gathered together from 10 a.m. to protest against the game giant that it “unfairly fired the voice actress” just for standing up for women.  Meanwhile, Lezhin Entertainment, a major player in Korea‘s e-comics industry, announced Monday that the company requested its comics writers refrain from posting on SNS regarding the issue. This announcement was due to a barrage of full refund requests by its subscribers who took offense by the writers seemingly supporting the radical feminist group.

The project “Arts on Seoul’s street found by citizens” invites anyone living in Seoul to participate in uncovering art in the city. It will run from Aug. 19 to Oct. 18. Under 10 themes, participants are to find public art and landmarks in a group of 10, joined by field experts and art connoisseurs. Their promotions of Seoul’s public arts and introductions of iconic landmarks in the city can be viewed via Seoul City’s social media.

Under the deal, Japan expressed an apology for its colonial-era atrocities and committed to providing the fund for the foundation. The island nation had ruled over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were enslaved to serve in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during World War II, according to historians.Only a small number of them have come forward as victims of the sexual servitude, and there are only 40 confirmed South Korean victims alive today. The focus of the foundation will be on financially benefiting the surviving victims and carrying out commemorative works for the sexually enslaved women, who have been euphemistically known as comfort women.Headed by Kim Tae-hyun, an honorary social welfare professor at Sungshin Women's University, the foundation in Seoul is scheduled to open for business starting Thursday, the foreign ministry said. Despite the launch, however, controversies are expected to linger over the foundation.The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, a vocal support group for comfort women, is challenging the foundation's representativeness. The group denounced the South Korea-Japan government deal as lacking Japan's official acknowledgment of liability and prior consultation with the victims. How smoothly Japan would transfer the committed fund is another issue, with some observers speculating that it could be delayed because of the two countries' unsettled matter of whether to keep a bronze statue of a seated girl symbolizing comfort women in front of the Japanese Embassy in South Korea. Seoul has said that the statue was set up by local civic groups and it has no authority to remove it.","at compensating korean women ,launch foundation this week ,thursday to financially compensate ,set sail on thursday ,compensating korean women","['South Korea', 'korean', 'Japan', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43034586  0.5896616

This is the sixth installment on Lee Jae-yong and Samsung Group. – Ed.Samsung Group, South Korea’s most powerful family-run conglomerate and a driving force behind the nation’s rapid economic growth, has been a global symbol of pride for many Koreans with its brand name recognized almost everywhere in the world. According to a survey by job portal Saramin, its flagship Samsung Electronics was the most-favored company among Korean job seekers for seven years straight until last year. This year’s U.S. corporate reputation index by Harris Poll placed the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer in seventh place among 100 multinational companies, showing its amicable image on the world stage. But behind the glamour, Samsung group -- with 59 affiliates ranging from tech and construction to fashion -- has been criticized for what civic groups see as undemocratic corporate structure, suppression of labor rights and its owner’s monopoly of power. The long-running controversy over its anti-union policy and alleged dangerous working conditions for its subcontracted workers in particular has undermined its brand power at home.Samsung’s ‘no-union’ policyIn 2011, four workers for Samsung Everland -- then-Samsung Group’s de-facto holding company and now a part of Samsung C&T; through a merger -- set up a legally approved trade union at the family-owned conglomerate for the first time in the company’s history. A week later, Cho Jang-hee, who worked for the amusement park company for 16 years and led the move to establish the union, was fired. The company accused him of professional negligence for leaking company information, but the court later ruled that the dismissal was not justifiable. “The consequences I faced -- including a year-long trial, lay-off and financial difficulties -- for challenging Samsung Group’s no-union corporate policy sent a warning to other workers not to join a labor union,” said the vice chairman of the labor union. According to labor law, dismissed employees can remain members of the union.Cho is no longer employed by Samsung Group, but continues to fight against Samsung’s crackdown on union activities along with five other union members working at Everland. The union is open to workers from all of Samsung’s units.“Samsung Everland set up 150 additional CCTV cameras, presumably to oversee union members, changed our workplaces and slashed salaries, making it difficult for us to continue our labor activities,” he claimed. “It is a laborer’s right to set up labor unions under the Constitution and it is illegal that a company interferes with that.”After several attempts to set up a union at Samsung affiliates were foiled, there are currently two -- one belonging to Samsung Everland and another on a larger bigger scale comprising of some 1,300 out of the 7,000 subcontracted workers under Samsung Electronic Service. Samsung Group maintains that its workers choose not to join labor unions because they don’t feel the need for a union. “We have some unions at some affiliates, but the mediation committees between the management and the workers at Samsung Group and its affiliates already serve as a communication channel,” an official from Samsung Group said, wishing not to be named.But questions had been consistently raised over Samsung Group’s stance on unions, such as when Rep. Shim Sang-jeong of the minor left-wing Justice Party revealed a 150-page document in 2013. The materials outlined the management’s detailed tactics regarding labor unions, including the shadowing of those involved in the union, collecting personal information about them and setting up a “company-friendly” union when workers move to establish a trade union. Samsung Group had initially admitted that it had created such a document for high-ranking officials to discuss “desirable” company culture, but later denied it. The high court ruled in 2015 that the document had, in fact, been written by the group. Before the document was made public, former employees including Cho have claimed that the company gave “anti-trade union” education to the workers, explaining how labor unions can take a toll on the company’s sound operation. “Samsung Group looks smart and modernized from the outside, but it is still ruled by a single family, with all the decisions related to its affiliates made by the family in a top-down corporate structure,” said Cho Dae-hwan, director of Samsung Labor Watch, citing the company’s decision to sell four chemical and defense units to Hanwha Group in 2014. “Employees, who lost their jobs at Samsung overnight, told me that they had learned about the news on TV,” he said. “Without labor unions, workers cannot represent their interests and communicate with the company.” Legal battle against Samsung Last year, Samsung Electronics announced that it had reached an agreement over its compensation plan with its workers who had contracted leukemia, cancer and other diseases while working at Samsung’s memory chip plants. With no exact figures available, Banolim, an advocacy group representing victims of the alleged workplace illness, claims that there are 223 victims of diseases that appear related to hazardous conditions at Samsung’s factories. Among them, 76 died as of July. Kwon Oh-hyun, a chief executive of Samsung Electronics, issued an official apology for mishandling the leukemia issue in 2014 and promised financial compensation. But the tech giant has denied a link between the diseases and its working environment at semiconductor production lines, citing lack of evidence. The court has so far confirmed nine of the cases as work-related accidents.Last year, the arbitrating committee, approved by both sides, recommended that Samsung compensate the victims through an independent body. But the company has since laid out plans to directly distribute funds to the victims. Samsung Electronics said that the company had completed providing funds to about 110 out of 150 who applied for the Samsung-led compensation scheme. It did not disclose the contract papers, citing privacy reasons. But some of the victims are refusing to accept the compensation, demanding reparations through an independent body and an apology that acknowledges the company’s responsibility for alleged lax safety management. The victims have staged a sit-in in front of Samsung Group headquarters in southern Seoul for nearly 10 months. “Samsung ignored the outcome of the mediation committee for the company and victims and pushed for a unilateral compensation scheme,” said Lim Ja-woon, a lawyer representing victims. “I think the company was not happy about the mediation committee’s recommendation to compensate workers through an independent third body.” The lawyer claimed that the company had pushed the applicants to accept the amount of compensation calculated by the company’s standards without giving them detailed information.While the victims continue their accusations and are collecting relevant data, the company has not revealed related information citing trade secrecy.More recently, the conglomerate’s mobile phone parts’ suppliers were also mired in safety controversy concerning workers from outsourced subcontracted firms.Since late January, four workers belonging to third-level and fourth-level subcontracted firms producing mobile phone parts for Samsung Electronics have allegedly suffered loss of vision and brain damage due to methanol poisoning. The use of ethanol is recommended over methanol for safety reasons, but ethanol costs three times more. Samsung Electronics have explained that they are primarily responsible for safety management at first-level subcontracted firms.“We monitor safety conditions at first-level subcontracted firms that we directly make contracts with and demand them to manage the safety of workers and chemical substances at their subcontractors,” an official from Samsung Electronics said. Civic groups have sent an open letter to Samsung Group, asking whether it was aware of the use of methanol by its subcontractors.“In the multilevel supply chain, the main contractors also share responsibility for workers’ safety because they pressure subcontractors to cut costs and quicken production,” said Park Hye-young, labor attorney for Solidarity for Workers’ Health. “Samsung Electronics should make it clear that it cannot work with subcontractors using methanol, for example.”“And the government has no information at all about how many were affected by the use of cheap toxic chemicals at phone manufacturers’ factories.” By Ock Hyun-ju","korea most powerful family ,samsung samsung grapples with ,south korea most powerful ,analyzing rising business tycoons ,powerful family run conglomerate","['the Korea Herald', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Samsung Group', 'Samsung Group', 'South Korea ’s', 'Koreans']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55551863  0.54926825

He headed the consumer goods company from 2005 to 2010 when sales of the problematic sterilizer peaked. The Korean-American is also accused of fraud and violating the Act on Fair Labeling and Advertising.  John Lee  former CEO of the South Korean unit of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, appears at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul on May 23, 2016, to face questioning over the British firm's toxic humidifier sterilizer that has allegedly resulted in scores of deaths and illnesses here since 2011.Prosecutors suspect that Lee produced and sold the products without having them undergo proper health checks. He also allegedly ignored reports from the company's researcher that the sterilizer should not be advertised as ""safe for children"" and went ahead with the phrase.Prosecutors had earlier sought a warrant to formally arrest Lee, but the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the request, saying there is not enough reason or necessity to detain the suspect. The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems from unknown causes in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.Seoul prosecutors said they have been interrogating related government officials since last week to see if they are responsible for failing to stop the consumer goods maker's wrongdoings in advance.","toxic sterilizers the ceo ,ceo of google korea ,ceo to stand trial ,trial over toxic sterilizers ,google korea ceo","['Google Korea', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'british', 'John Lee', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39908531  0.2796064

""They returned home after surviving all sorts of hardships and their communities rejected not only them but also their children.""He named the fund ""Friend of 22"" because there were 22 registered victims in China at the time he conceived the idea in May. In the two months since, two of them have died.""I jumped in thinking that I have to help them before it's too late,"" Yang said. ""China's younger generations aren't aware of the seriousness of the comfort women issue. It's rewarding to see young people showing a response, thanks to the media's attention to the work I'm doing as a South Korean.""A well-known Chinese cosmetics blogger has offered to donate a large sum of money to the fund, while news about the organization has often appeared on local sites, he said.The professor stressed that the issue of the comfort women should be approached from the perspective of human rights and welfare, transcending politics and national borders.Once he establishes the necessary foundation to help the Chinese victims, Yang said he plans to assist trilateral research among South Korea, China and Japan and film a documentary on the comfort women issue.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45, while China also suffered from Japan's aggressions in the early part of the 20th century.South Korea and Japan reached a landmark deal in December to settle the dispute over the comfort women through an apology from the Japanese government and Tokyo's payment of 1 billion yen  into a Seoul-based foundation for the Korean victims.","professor helps chinese sex ,korean professor helps chinese ,helps chinese sex slavery ,chinese sex slavery victims ,university recently launched charity","['south korean', 'chinese', 'Japan', 'Yang Pil - seung', 'chinese', 'Seoul', 'Konkuk University', 'China', 'japanese']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45098239  0.39144295

Since the 1950-1953 Korean War, the military group has made significant contributions to protecting South Korea and promoting bilateral ties between the two nations. The KATUSA program was launched in August 1950 through a verbal agreement between Korea’s first President Syngman Rhee and Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who led the United Nations forces during the war. Since the agreement was never documented, the state of KATUSA was designated by other military references such as the 8th Army’s Army in Korea Regulation 600-2. The document stipulated the unit’s mission statement, chain of command and specific policies for the enlisted personnel. According to the document, the original purpose of KATUSA was to overcome troop shortages during the initial phase of the war. Since it took so much time to bring in forces from the U.S., most of the U.S. augmentees were dispatched from Japan, and they were short on manpower and equipment. A total of 8,637 KATUSA soldiers were sent to Japan for training during the war. They were assigned to the U.S. 7th division, which was stationed in Japan and mobilized to Incheon afterward. Some 25,000 were deployed in combat missions, and about 11,000 were killed or went missing in action.“We received a 20-day training in Japan and it was mostly about basic battle skills and landing operations. Sometimes we helped the U.S. soldiers to tell the differences between the two Koreas’ soldiers and the Chinese ones,” Yu Yong-bong, an 84-year-old KATUSA veteran who served during the war, told The Korea Herald.These first KATUSA soldiers played roles in various turning points of the Korean War. This included the Battle of Incheon, an amphibious landing that turned the tide of the war in favor of the U.N. forces, and the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, one of the deadliest battles between the U.N. forces and Chinese troops. Following the war, KATUSA’s role was readjusted to follow the armistice condition to act as “military ambassadors” enshrined in the unit’s code of conduct. They help U.S. soldiers new to the peninsula understand Korean customs and the language.Their job involves translating communication between local residents and the U.S. Army. KATUSA personnel are proficient in English because the recruiting process requires a candidate to achieve minimum passing scores on standardized English tests such as the TOEIC. They are also assigned military roles just like U.S. Army soldiers. Their military occupational specialties range from combat soldiers to office workers. About 30 percent of those under KATUSA are said to be engaged in office duties. “We are like working-level translators for combined units. High-ranking generals have their own interpreting officers and most meetings were translated by them. So we help them with communication for their day-to-day jobs or as an outreach program,” said Han Ji-hoon, a 26-year-old KATUSA who worked at a Yongsan garrison in Seoul. Currently, about 3,000 KATUSA soldiers are serving alongside 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea. They are dispatched throughout most of the 8th Army departments, filling in positions of the U.S. Army enlisted soldiers and junior noncommissioned officers.The KATUSA program is a unique system employed by the U.S. Army. The Korean military holds the responsibility for personnel management of KATUSA, but they are treated pretty much the same as the U.S enlisted soldiers in the office since the U.S. bans any discriminatory treatment of Korean augmentees. On the other hand, there has also been criticism that the Korean Army is losing some of its intelligent soldiers to the U.S. through the KATUSA program. According to 2015 statistics from the Ministry of the Defense, about 20 percent of KATUSA soldiers are from Korea’s top universities. But military expert Yang Uk, who serves as a senior research fellow at the Korea Security and Defense Forum, noted that the highly-educated service members are all the more valuable to performing complex and challenging combined operations between the Korean Army and U.S. Forces Korea “The language is still the biggest barrier to the combined operation.

Hanieh Sadat Kazami, 18, is Iranian, but she can text in Korean slang and abbreviations on mobile messengers just like any other Korean. While most Iranian women use Germany-based Telegram to chat over smartphones, Kazami even uses Kakao Talk, South Korea's most popular mobile messenger application. ""I use Telegram for my Iranian friends and Kakao Talk for my Korean friends,"" Kazami said. On June 23, she won a Korean language speaking contest in Tehran. At the event organized by the South Korea-sponsored King Sejong Institute, contestants were divided into two groups -- elementary and intermediate -- based on their Korean speaking skills. Kazami topped the intermediate class, although she only has studied Korean about a year. ""Her speaking, writing and reading levels are very high,"" said Choi Yeon-suk, chief of the institute's Tehran branch. ""If foreigners want to speak Korean like Kazami in just a year of learning, they should have very good linguistic sense and study very hard."" Kazami said she began learning Korean after watching Korean TV dramas. ""Last year, one of my friends showed me the South Korean drama 'You're Beautiful' with Iranian subtitles, and I loved it,"" she said. ""I was looking to learn another foreign language in addition to English. I decided to go with Korean after watching the drama.""Kazami then searched Korean textbooks online and self-studied the language until she registered at the institute's Korean language school in Tehran this March. Among five classes offered by the school, Kazami was able to enter the second most advanced class. ""When I first saw Korean characters, it was like a picture,"" she said. ""But now, I speak Korean first even when I'm surprised. I think this is because Korean is the language that can best express human emotions."" Kazami said she is now interested in Korean culture too. ""I was amazed that there are lots of similarities between Iran and South Korea,"" she said. ""For example, women here wear the hijab, and it was interesting that South Korean women in the old days wore a long veil called 'sseugae chima.'"" As a winner from Iran, Kazami will enter the Korean speaking contest finals in Seoul in September. She said she also wants to finish first at the contest where winners from other countries can also join. ""I have eight textbooks from the Sejong Institute, but I have to read four of them in the next two months,"" she said. ""It already makes me nervous.""Kazami, however, said she is happy to visit South Korea and wants to go to some K-pop concerts. ""I want to study Korean more and become a person who can serve as a bridge between South Korea and Iran,"" she said. ""If I have a chance, I want to study in South Korea, majoring in industrial design.""","korea most popular mobile ,most popular mobile messenger ,korean while most iranian ,korean contest winner in ,smartphones kazami even uses","['korean', 'Hanieh Sadat Kazami', 'iranian', 'korean', 'Korean', 'iranian', 'Germany', 'Telegram', 'Kazami', 'Kakao Talk', ""South Korea 's""]",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67788541  0.71600497

Sohn Hye-won of the Minjoo Party of Korea claimed that there are “unmistakable similarities” between Korea’s new logo “Creative Korea” and the French government’s “Creative France” logo used to promote French businesses.Pointing to how both logos consist of letters in red and blue, the designer-turned-politician said that using the word “creative” before the name of the country and the use of the similar colors was a “clear case of plagiarism.”“It is incredibly shameful and is a tragic case of Korea that the plagiarized slogan actually calls itself ‘creative,’” said Sohn, who is the head of the Minjoo Party’s head of public affairs.The first-term lawmaker urged the government to stop using the brand in international events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, denouncing President Park Geun-hye and Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok for approving the logo.Following the remark, the Culture Ministry issued a statement to dispute the accusation. The ministry said that it had already used the colors in many government slogans and campaigns, and that the word “creative” is not something to be used “exclusively” by a certain government.  The government agency also noted that the purposes of the two logos were different, with the Korean one intended to promote national vision and the French one aiming to attract overseas investment. The new slogan and logo were created following nationwide polls the government conducted among citizens who were asked about keywords that represent Korea. The government said that they had spent about 3.5 billion won  on the project.   The new brand replaces various logos being used by government agencies for different purposes. Among them is “Dynamic Korea,” a logo used by the country since the 2002 World Cup hosted by Korea and Japan. Experts said the fundamental question came down to originality.“The standards for design plagiarism are always vague. But on the perspective of the design only, it cannot be viewed as having been plagiarized as they use different shades of the colors and in different fonts. The question should instead be whether the new brand is as creative as it claims to be, as it definitely resembles one of that of France ... a copycat, if not plagiarized,” said a Seoul-based designer who wished to remain unidentified.By Yeo Jun-suk","debate surrounded south korea ,on wednesday with allegations ,heated debate surrounded south ,korea new logo creative ,wednesday with allegations","['South Korea ’s', 'Sohn Hye - won', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'french', 'French']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53352469  0.46632046

100,100,100,[HERALD INTERVIEW] Go grandmaster gets first taste of politics,"Long before South Korea’s Go master Lee Se-dol was thrust into the limelight for his historic match against Google’s artificial intelligence AlphaGo, many of his predecessors left indelible marks on the history of the Chinese board game.   Topping the list is inarguably Cho Hun-hyun, the 63-year-old who became the first Korean Go player to be promoted to 9th dan, the highest level assigned to professional players...","Long before South Korea’s Go master Lee Se-dol was thrust into the limelight for his historic match against Google’s artificial intelligence AlphaGo, many of his predecessors left indelible marks on the history of the Chinese board game.   Topping the list is inarguably Cho Hun-hyun, the 63-year-old who became the first Korean Go player to be promoted to 9th dan, the highest level assigned to professional players. Throughout his more than 50 years playing the game, Cho amassed 160 titles, more than any other player in the world. Now the retired grandmaster aims to translate the success he learned from the intuitive and complex board game to a more “sensational” arena: politics. Rep. Cho Hun-hyun of the Saenuri Party Rep. Cho became a lawmaker for the ruling Saenuri Party for the 20th National Assembly through the proportional representation system. “Doing a public job is something that I have wanted to do for a long time,” said Cho in an interview with The Korea Herald at his new Assembly office. “Admittedly, people around me have doubts about it. But I was thinking: If you are going to do it, then do it right,” he said. Professional athletes’ forays into politics are not unheard of around the world. Brazilian soccer legend Pele worked as an extraordinary minister for sport from 1995 to 1998. Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao was elected as a member of senate in June and served in the House of Representatives of the Philippines between 2007 and 2013.Korea has been no exception. In just the previous Assembly, table tennis champion Lee Elisa and Moon Dae-sung, a taekwondo competitor who won gold at the 2004 Athens Summer Games, served as representatives. But Go masters have not been granted the same opportunity to assert their interest in the legislative body, said Cho. Despite the popularity of the board game among average citizens, there were zero politicians who had previously been professional players of Go -- or Baduk, as it is called in Korean. “Other professional sports have politicians representing their interests through politics. Unfortunately, there were no such cases in Baduk. My working as a politician would set a precedent and offer Baduk players a chance to work a public job,” he said. One of his goals as a first-term lawmaker is to enact a law designed to support Go. The bill is expected to include clauses allowing the government to set up a promotion plan and offer assistance to aspiring or lesser-known Go competitors in the country.Cho also plans to include a clause in the bill that grants the status of intellectual rights to “gibu,” a game record for a game of Go, as is the case for copyrights and intellectual rights in chess. Past gibu records by grandmasters are widely used by amateur Baduk players to craft their strategies.Previous parliaments had reviewed similar bills. The Baduk promotion bill was first introduced in 2007 during the 17th Assembly. The 19th Assembly had discussed similar legislation, only for it to be scrapped, having lost momentum and lacked consensus. “South Korea is a Go powerhouse and boasts a lot of renowned and talented players. In order to keep the title, we should keep fostering and educating them. Now that I have retired , it is time to take the initiative and spearhead the effort,” Cho said. “In the world of professional athletes, only top-ranked players become wealthy. Professional players who marked as high as 300th in national ranking make, on average, less than the minimum wage. Those who rank at the top don’t need the support; we need to care for those who don’t,” he said. Having chosen to work at a parliamentary committee on education, culture, sports and tourism, Cho also set “sports diplomacy” as his legislative priority. Among his plans is a push to enhance ties with Real Madrid, a professional soccer team based in the capital of Spain. In June, the lawmaker met with the club’s Asia-Pacific director Paco Wu and vowed to promote bilateral ties. They discussed plans to invite the soccer team to Korea, hold a friendly match with the Korean team and engage with young soccer players through educational programs. “ said in the meeting that Real Madrid is willing to promote themselves in Korea and expand cooperation with us. This is indeed a very good opportunity and I’d like to do as much as I can also in sports other than soccer,” he said.Throughout the interview, Cho applied Go metaphors to politics. The rookie politician said it was his unique way of understanding the political dynamics that he said were as complex and intuitive as the intellectually challenging board game. But the game of politics still appears beyond the mastery of even the Go grandmaster. When asked about power struggle and factional strife inside the Saenuri Party, Cho said the issue should be left to fellow lawmakers who hold a “9th dan title” in the political arena. “Baduk is a battle against myself and the one sitting opposite. But politics is a whole different game. It needs the ability to interact with many people like in this interview. It is still awkward for me,” he said. “There is not much I can do in the political game. I just earned the 1st dan in the game and there are a lot of master players in the party. So if someone accuses me of that, I admit to my lack of capability. I am still learning,” he said.

""Only renewable green energy power stations will produce electricity in the country.""The outdated coal plants have been singled out as the main culprits of fine dust, along with old diesel vehicles. Out of 53 coal power plants operating in South Korea, 10 are over 30 years old.Coal-powered electricity accounted for 28 percent of the country's total power production in 2015, following by nuclear power with 33 percent.The government will inject 2 trillion won  to help retrofit eight coal generators aged 20 year old or over to improve their efficiency and reduce sulfuric acid emissions.The remaining 35 plants will be equipped with desulfurization system, added the ministry.The plan details the follow-up measures to the Korean government's efforts unveiled last month to control fine dust which has recently emerged as one of the biggest threats to public health, as the country has increasingly become more dust-polluted.Fine dust refers to particles that are smaller than 10 micrometers and have been known to cause various respiratory problems while also affecting the body's immune system.The country has been experiencing frequent ultrafine alerts especially in the spring, with people required to refrain from outdoor activities.Trade Minister Joo Hyung-hwan said the latest plan will decrease fine dust by 24 percent by 2030.""We will invest a total of 10 trillion won  to carry out the plan by 2030,"" said the minister.

While living on her own, she worked for a clothing company, six days a week, and was paid 600,000 won ($508) per month. Due to severe work-related stress and grueling hours, she developed abnormal vaginal bleeding. “It went on for more than two months,” Ock said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I had to use sanitary pad...","Ock Hye-rim was 21 years old when she moved to Seoul from her hometown in Busan in 2001. While living on her own, she worked for a clothing company, six days a week, and was paid 600,000 won  per month. Due to severe work-related stress and grueling hours, she developed abnormal vaginal bleeding. “It went on for more than two months,” Ock said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I had to use sanitary pads every day. And the cost for the pads just became unbearable. I was only getting paid 600,000 won and my monthly rent alone was 200,000 won.”Her difficult first years living in Seoul is what makes Ock empathize with teenagers from low-income households who cannot afford to buy sanitary pads. Ever since Yuhan-Kimberly -- a leading sanitary pad maker here -- announced plans to raise prices of its premium pads by up to 20 percent in May, heartbreaking stories have filled social media here, including instances of girls who had to use shoe insoles as alternatives. Sanitary pads painted in red and signs that protest the stigma and taboo associated with menstruation are struck in Insa-dong, Seoul, Sunday. The signs say: “Students have to use shoe insoles as alternatives as pads are too expensive” and “Why are pregnancies and deliveries considered sacred while menstruation is not?” Ock considered herself lucky. Having been trained in the fashion industry, she managed to create her own reusable sanitary pads by using cotton cloth from her towel. She would hand wash them every night and it involved soaking the used pads in water for a few hours to wash out the bodily fluids first. “I didn’t really mind washing the pads,” she said. “I was used to hand washing my clothes growing up. Yet I just wish no young woman has to struggle because they don’t have access to hygiene products today.”Poverty and reproductive health The ongoing controversy reveals not only the costly price of the products in Korea, but also the effects of poverty and poor menstrual hygiene on young women’s reproductive health. It also highlighted how talking openly about menstruation in Korea is considered a taboo. According to a local news daily, a single sanitary pad in South Korea costs about 260 won  to 331 won, which is about 50 to 70 percent more expensive than most other developed nations. In Korea, the average price of sanitary pads rose by 25.6 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to the Korea National Council of Consumer Organizations.Studies have shown that poverty has an impact on young women’s reproductive health. According to lawmaker Rep. Kim Seung-hee’s office, Korean female teenagers who fall under the poorest 10 percent in the country experience reproductive tract infection 1.6 times more frequently than those belonging to the wealthiest 10 percent, based on national health insurance data from 2005-2015. According to health care professionals, not changing sanitary pads every three to four hours -- no matter how light the menstrual flow -- can lead to conditions like skin rashes and vaginal infections. “We can’t conclude that poor menstrual hygiene management is the main cause of reproductive tract infections among young women,” the ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker said. “But both the statistics on the particular infection and the controversy on sanitary pads have revealed that the country did not look after young women’s basic health needs properly.”According to a report by the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, a network of international organizations that work on issues of hygiene and water, millions of girls and women worldwide are subject to “restrictions in their daily lives just because they are menstruating.” The report also pointed out that the lack of, or unaffordability, of appropriate sanitary products and facilities may lead menstruating girls to temporarily or sometimes permanently drop out of school. “The gender-unfriendly school culture and infrastructure and lack of clean, safe and private sanitation facilities for girls undermine the right of privacy, resulting in a fundamental infringement of human rights,” the report added. It cited research from 2007 that found a relationship between the onset of puberty and significantly reduced school participation among girls, especially in developing countries.‘What I had to give up in exchange for pads’Whenever Oh Min-ju had her period, she had to put on a brave face. Having been raised single-handedly by her grandmother, who relied on government subsidies for a major part of her income, Oh always used free pads that were available from her school’s infirmary. “The pads were free to whoever asked for them,” the 18-year-old told The Korea Herald. “But most girls went to the infirmary only when they forgot to bring the pads from home. I was the only one who went there every day whenever I was on my period. I had to go often because my flow was so heavy and I was scared the pad may leak.”She said most of her teachers were understanding, but some of them would scold her for not bringing her own pads or ask unnecessary questions. “I think this teacher was aware of my financial situation,” she said. “But she would always ask me why I get my pads from the infirmary . It was at times humiliating. I acted as if the questions didn’t affect me. But of course I cared. I just had too much pride to show it.”Oh dropped out of high school last year to make and save money. Her goal is to enroll in a university famous for its creative writing program after passing a high school diploma qualification exam. Ever since she quit school, she has been working part-time and now purchases her own pads. “I don’t think I would risk my health by using something as unsafe as an alternative to sanitary pads,” she said. “But purchasing the pads means I sometimes can’t buy the books I need or give up on my snacks.”Kim Soo-young, a 17-year-old high school student who has suffered from domestic abuse, currently lives on her own after leaving her family. A relative pays for her monthly rent, but she has to rely on her own income from part-time jobs for all other living expenses. To save money, Kim said she does not use pads at all when her menstrual flow is light. And whenever she is on the night shift, she is too busy to change her pads regularly. “I only have enough pads for my heaviest days,” she said. “I often get skin rashes and it’s painful.”Since the issue was brought to light, both the government and private firms have donated pads for school children who have limited access to hygiene products, but some activists say they should be available for free for all school children from now on. “Right now medicine is free at all school infirmaries, but sanitary pads are not,” said Yeo Gyeong from the nongovernmental organization Womenlink.“All girls menstruate regardless of their income status, just like any girl can get sick in school regardless of their household income. Those girls who ask for the products in school shouldn’t be shamed. Free and clean pads should be a human right.”‘Fight to end period shaming should go mainstream’ Last month, Park Sam-yong, a fourth-term Gwangju city councilor from the Saenuri Party, said Koreans should stop calling sanitary pads “saengridae,” which is Korean for menstruation pads, and instead start calling them “wisaengdae,” which translates into sanitary pads. His reason was that the word saengri -- meaning menstruation -- is “repulsive” to the public. Han Soo-jin, a 25-year-old Seoulite, remembers a particular incident of period shaming when she was in high school. When she accidentally dropped one of her pads in a hallway, her physical education teacher picked it up and threw it at her face. He told her, “You should be careful and don’t make people feel uncomfortable by making such a careless mistake.”In response to Park’s remarks, a group of women stuck sanitary pads with red paint on them around central Seoul to protest against the stigma and taboo associated with menstruation. They also held signs that read: “No uterus, no opinion” and “Menstrual blood is not blue.” The latter refers to a story that recently went viral: A woman recently found out that her boyfriend had thought all along that menstrual blood was blue, as he had only seen the blue liquid used in feminine hygiene TV commercials. In Australia, a campaign recently replaced the common blue liquid used to represent menstrual blood. It features instead a bunch of furious-looking people in red suits to demonstrate that they are locked in a “prison” of padded cell.“There is nothing wrong with women’s menstrual blood,” said Jeong Ji-hye, a 31-year-old office worker. “I never really thought about it, but the ongoing controversy makes me wonder why menstrual blood has to be shown as blue liquid on TV in the first place. The blood is not harmful.”Lee Soo-yeon, a researcher from the Korea Women’s Development Institute, said the general public perceives menstruation as something private and not to be openly talked about, contrary to pregnancies and deliveries that are often portrayed as “sacred.” She said the common practice of providing black plastic bags for feminine hygiene products at stores -- apparently to hide it -- is one prevalent example of period shaming in Korea.“I definitely think the perception should change,” she said. “Menstruation should be talked about in a more open manner, in a more positive context. The products don’t need to be hidden in public places.”Inspired by her personal experience, Ock now runs a business selling reusable menstrual products made with cotton cloth. Although she started using her reusable pads because she could not afford disposable ones, Ock said she in fact experienced health benefits by using reusable products, such as fewer occurrence of skin rashes. When some activists suggested donating reusable pads to teenagers living under the poverty line last month, critics called the idea “inconsiderate” and even “ridiculous.” They said such products cannot be used by those who share rooms with male family members, or those who do not have adequate washing and drying facilities at home. Yet Oh, who recently benefitted from Ock’s donation of her products, said the presence of male family members should not prevent any woman from using reusable pads, if that is what she prefers. Not being able to hang up a reusable pad to dry just because there is a male family member in the house is unfair and is a clear example of period shaming, she added. “I have a good washing machine and I only live with my grandmother,” she said. “But I don’t think I would’ve changed my mind even if I did . There’s nothing wrong with washing and hang drying sanitary pads. If someone in the house is uncomfortable, it’s their problem.”By Claire Lee  Kim Soo-young and Han Soo-jin are not their real names.

The official insider said the embassy has recently sent out invitations to government and military officials, diplomats and politicians to mark the 62th anniversary of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. The event will be held at a Seoul hotel on July 12.The JSDF, which encompasses land, air and sea elements of Japan's military, was founded in July 1, 1954. The Japanese embassy has held a ceremony marking the day every year, although more recently, with the straining of bilateral relations, it has been obliged to keep the event low-key.Japan's military causes particular aversion in South Korea because it brings back memories of the island nation's imperialistic past and Tokyo's brutal colonization of Korea from 1910 through 1945. Reflecting this, the Japanese embassy here had a hard time securing an outside venue to hold the celebratory event in the past few years due to protests and unwillingness of hotels to take flak for hosting the controversial gathering.In July 2014, the year that the JSDF marked its 60th anniversary, the embassy was compelled to hold the event at its embassy, instead of the originally booked Lotte Hotel in central Seoul, after the hotel chain turned down its reservation. The event was again held at the embassy in 2015, but this year out of fear of public backlash. Still, Japanese officials are seeking to celebrate the occasion at a hotel in Seoul, as some headway has been made to reduce bilateral tensions.","seoul hotel on july ,sunday the official insider ,next week local diplomatic ,held at seoul hotel ,founding event in seoul","['japanese', 'Seoul', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59019476  0.45867363

The International Journal of Social Psychiatry last week published an article discussing the odds of depression associated with one’s dinner companions, citing data from South Korea’s Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2014.The survey on 4,181 adults showed those who ate dinner alone rather than with family members were 1 1/2 times more likely to suffer from depression.The prevalence of depression in those eating alone was higher among men by 2.4 times when comparing those who usually dine alone and those accompanied by family.People who ate alone, despite having other family members around, also had a 1.6-fold higher chance of being depressed.Depression in the research was measured by using the Patient Health Questionnaire, a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression developed by Pfizer.The researchers said the lone diners have a higher risk of suffering from solitude or depression by lacking the chance to relieve stress and communicate.The team also explained that the higher risk seen among men shows men are more dependent on expressing their thoughts and emotions through sharing meals.Professor Kim Tae-hyun, one of the authors of the study, said there was also analysis showing that individuals who eat dinner alone due to their busy work schedule or familial conflict can feel higher degrees of depression than those who live alone and are accustomed to eating alone.“Support from one’s family has been reported to have a positive effect on depression severity. Hence, family dinnertimes, when the whole family can gather together, can be effective for depression by providing support from family,” the IJSP said.","social psychiatry last week ,men who eat dinner ,eating alone increases chance ,psychiatry last week published ,recently published south korean","['south korean', 'the International Journal of Social Psychiatry', 'South Korea ’s', 'Korean National Health and Nutrition Examinatio']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45255294  0.17985758

The company has been selected as a model example of operating a time-selective working hour system, allowing its employees to flexibly control their work schedule.President Park Geun-hye on Wednesday visits Air Korea at Incheon International Airport to hear about its implementation of the flextime working hour system. Since adopting the flextime system in 2014, Cheong Wa Dae said the company has been able to hire more female workers, which consequently boosted productivity and curbed the turnover rate.The number of local companies implementing the system stood at 4,041 as of May this year, soaring from 319 back in 2013, Labor Ministry data showed.Also, in a recent survey conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 300 firms, 96.7 percent of respondents said that the flextime system was helpful in improving work-family balance.The president’s visit to the air service company was the second of her on-site campaign to promote the government’s employment support program. Last Thursday, she visited a local elementary school to observe and participate in an after-school child care program.The field tours also came in line with her remarks at Monday’s meeting with senior secretaries.“We have to solve the problems concerning people’s daily lives, by visiting the actual scenes more often and promoting the  systems,” Park said.“President Park will continue her on-the-spot visits so as to establish new growth momentums and to create jobs for the people, which will then contribute to economic revitalization,” said a Blue House official.By Bae Hyun-jung","flexible working hours president ,international airport to meet ,working hours president park ,geun hye on wednesday ,she visited incheon international","['Park Geun - hye', 'Incheon International Airport', 'Air Korea', 'Hanjin Group']",8,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.08751824 0.68152267 0.2897312 ],Korea Herald,Politics,6,2016,"on wednesday visits air korea ,incheon international airport to meet ,monday meeting with senior secretaries ,wednesday visits air korea at ,thursday she visited local elementary","['Park Geun - hye', 'Incheon International Airport', 'Air Korea', 'Hanjin Group', 'Hanjin', 'Korean Air', 'Park Geun', 'Air Korea', 'Labor Ministry', 'the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry', 'Park', 'Park', 'Blue House', 'Bae Hyun - jung']",18,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.08751824 0.68152267 0.2897312 ]

Her family looked better off ― she lived in a clean and spacious house in Pyongyang, ate nutritionally balanced food and received quality education at a public school.But the director soon realized that her life had been sugar-coated and decided to explore deeper, often secretly. The reality he encountered was shockingly different from that which he observed through the camera.Since the film's original version was released on April 27 in South Korea, President Park Geun-hye and other key government officials watched the documentary. After seeing the film, Park expressed hope the North would halt its nuclear weapons program and look after its own people. Some 50 people, including North Korean defectors, were invited to watch the movie with Park at a local theater in southern Seoul.Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and Defense Minister Han Min-koo also watched the film at separate occasions.But the documentary attracted merely 32,000 viewers in South Korea. ""Under the Sun"" will be released on a limited run in U.S. theaters beginning July 6 at the Film Forum in New York City and July 15 at Laemmle Monica Film Center in Los Angeles.North Korea has long been accused of violating its people's basic rights in order to build a cult of personality around the Kim dynasty. Pyongyang bristles at such talk, claiming it is a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.","new documentary on north ,new documentary ,said the russian documentary ,new documentary on ,released in july new","['russian', 'North Korea', 'korean', 'a - List Entertainment', 'russian', ""Vitaly Mansky 's"", 'Sun', 'korean']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.41715744  0.42127159

The report calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer Pyongyang's ""crimes against humanity"" to the International Criminal Court.The scholar said that the international community should focus on the North's governing mechanism, which systemically violates human rights, along with holding the North's leadership accountable for crimes against humanity.""We should not just look at symbolic accountability. ... There is a much greater system at work. We need to look at the architects of the system,"" Breuker said.Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director at the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, also echoed this view by stressing that the world should not only consider the ""symbolic target"" -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un -- but also other officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo-jong, should be held accountable for grave violations of human rights in the North.""It is very important to adopt an approach toward accountability that relies on full and deep understanding of the mechanism on human rights denial from the top down,"" Scarlatoiu said.Meanwhile, North Korean defector Ko Young-hwan, now vice president at the Institute for National Security Strategy in South Korea, said that attention should be focused on the North's leader when it comes to the responsibility for right abuses.""If North Korean officials at organs, including the ruling party, are extensively blamed for the violations, internal solidarity could even be strengthened as they would show allegiance to leader Kim Jong-un,"" he said.North Korea has long been labeled one of the worst human rights violators in the world. Pyongyang has bristled at such criticism, calling it a U.S.-led attempt to topple its regime.The communist regime does not tolerate dissent, holds hundreds of thousands of people in political prison camps and keeps tight control over outside information.Lee Jung-hoon, the South Korean ambassador for human rights, said that the opening of the U.N. office took on a symbolic significance in advancing the goal of punishing North Korean perpetrators.Signe Poulsen, a representative of the U.N. office, said that in the coming year, she hopes her office will ""broaden and deepen"" its work on monitoring Pyongyang's rights record and raising awareness about the issue.","professor specializing in korean ,specializing in korean history ,korean history said monday ,forum on north korea ,human rights dutch professor","['North Korea', 'dutch', 'korean', 'Remko Breuker', 'Leiden University', 'Netherlands', ""North Korea 's"", ""North Korea 's""]",8,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.23591304  0.71609664

The proposed ordinance gives the Seoul mayor the right to designate parks and children’s playgrounds, among other public spaces, as alcohol-free zones. Signboards will be put up indicating the ban. The mayor will also have the authority to discourage alcoholic beverage distributors from sponsoring or joining in events that are either targeting teenagers or organized by the city government. Additionally based on the ordinance, people who cause a nuisance in public transportation and spaces in their drunken state will be slapped with a fine of 50,000 won. Anyone who sells or provides alcoholic beverages to minors would be fined up to 1 million won. The city government is also reviewing the option of limiting sales of alcohol altogether in areas adjacent to public parks.Prior to this move, a nationwide crackdown on habitual drunk drivers was put into effect in April under the previous 19th National Assembly, which allowed prosecutors and police to confiscate lawbreakers’ vehicles.

The session was held following the death of a 19-year-old subway mechanic on May 28, who died while repairing a screen door at a Seoul subway station. The death sparked outcry against the “unfair” treatment of irregular workers, as he was found to have skipped due safety measures to save costs and time, as is customarily done.Many of the participants called for an overhaul of the existing labor market system and long-continued customs of employing irregular workers through subcontracted companies. Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon enters a meeting of the city council on Monday. The death of the subway worker had invited criticism against the city government, which governs subway operator Seoul Metro, and Park, who had been one of the presidential hopefuls among the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea on the back of his progressive policy initiatives and outspoken views both online and offline. The tragedy also highlighted the rampant recruitment of retiring high-ranking Seoul City officials to the city’s subsidiary firms at high wages. Since the fatal subway accident, Park has suffered a decline in approval ratings for two consecutive weeks. According to a poll of some 2,000 adults here collected by Realmeter from June 7 to 10, Park held an approval rating to be the next president of 5.6 percent, a 1.1 percentage point fall from the previous week. He was also pulled down to fifth place, passed by his conservative predecessor Oh Se-hoon.At the debate, Park vowed to revolutionize the current labor system in the city’s business operations after the recent death of a subway mechanic shed light on poor treatment of employees at subcontracted companies.“Over the last four years, I was able to change temporary positions of at least 7,000 workers to permanent positions, but if you say that employment discrimination still exists, I will review the system all over again,” said Park.A worker from subway operator Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit’s labor union who attended the debate said that they were constantly exposed to flawed safety systems and tight working schedules.“Statistics showed that at least 98 percent of subway station platform’s screen door mechanics said they have done work by themselves during repairs,” he said at the debate. According to the safety manual for subway maintenance subcontractors established by Seoul Metro last year, workers are instructed to work in pairs. But such requirements are often overlooked due to the limited number of workers as well as urgent calls by subway operators to quickly fix screen doors for passengers’ convenience.At the end of the debate session, Park said he continued to stand by his core values in humanity.“I think the only way to resolve this kind of issue would be to have a philanthropic society, where human values come before everything else,” Park said. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Park met with civic group members and parents of children with developmental disabilities who have been holding rallies for 42 days demanding direct dialogue with the mayor over ways to improve infrastructure for the disabled. “I am sorry to have you all wait for so long, I was not considerate enough to understand your and your children’s sufferings,” Park said as he met with the parents of the children in front of the city hall. Effectively upon the meeting, parents and members of the Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities ended their all-night sit-in protest at the back gate of Seoul City Hall on Tuesday. The groups and Seoul City agreed to review their proposals to support housing facilities for those with developmental disabilities, as well as a pension plan.Under the city-run task force team, parents and members of the civic groups will establish a master plan to support those with development disabilities living in Seoul.Seoul City had previously explained that it was difficult for the city to accept the group’s proposals, as supporting their proposal required a lot of funding as well as in-depth discussion with the central government.By Kim Da-sol","seoul mayor struggles in ,seoul mayor struggles ,mayor struggles in quagmire ,civic groups seoul mayor ,prolonged conflicts with civic","['Seoul', 'Park Won - soon']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.54332656  0.0072379

Even though he has refused to discuss such a possibility, he has never ruled out the possibility, either.Speculation about his presidential ambitions spiked in recent weeks as Ban said during a visit to South Korea that he would ""contemplate"" what he would do as a South Korean citizen when he returns to his home country after stepping down as U.N. chief.""I'd like to make one thing clear again today.

The booklet was developed as a number of news reports allegedly inflicted secondary victimization upon sex crime victims here, including violation of privacy. Some even endorsed distortion of sexual assault – such as how the extent of a woman’s resistance should be the major factor in determining if a rape has occurred. About two years have passed, and a series of media reports on the recent gang rape case which occurred in a remote island in the nation’s Sinan Country makes one question whether the guideline has simply been futile. It’s meaningless to describe what the reports have done in detail – in short, the reports exposed unnecessary information about the victim, such as her job, her age and other personal history while not doing the same about the suspects. It is as meaningless to question whether the reports had any intention to serve its very basic duty – to serve public interest. As journalists, those who work in the media get to move on after writing a story. But those who they write about will most likely be tied to the story for a long time, especially in Korea where stigma against sexual violence victims prevails. Rather than failing to recognize the professional duty to understand the impact of one’s story, and even inflict secondary victimization, it would be better not to publish any stories about any sexual assault at all. Journalism indeed is business, but making profit by exploiting some of the most traumatic and painful experiences of the vulnerable cannot be justified in any way. In 2012, when a 7-year-old child was raped by a man in his 20s in Naju, South Jeolla Province, many media outlets stressed that the door of the girl’s house wasn’t locked and she was left unattended by her parents. The victim was kidnapped while sleeping in the house alone and was raped under a bridge in the town. Her mother, who was at an Internet cafe at the time of the event, received public criticism for “not protecting her child properly” after some media reports portrayed her as a game addict while describing her spouse as an irresponsible father.Many TV reporters also filmed the victim’s house without the mother’s consent, and used electricity in the house without asking. After the footage of the property was broadcast nationwide, the family said they had “no choice but to move” as they felt their reputation was ruined and lost anonymity at the same time. One of the media outlets, in fact, found the wounded victim in the hospital before her parents arrived, photographed her injured body parts and published them without discussing it with her parents. Other reports also revealed the father’s monthly income, which he never agreed to share with the media. In 2011, a newspaper published inaccurate information about a sexual assault victim, after only interviewing the male suspect’s mother and getting her interpretation of what happened. The victim eventually filed a defamation suit against the media outlet, after the suspect was ruled guilty by the court. Many reports here have also been inappropriately labeling female victims of sexual assault, using such terms as the “luggage woman case” or the “gastrointestinal endoscopy woman case.” For example, the “luggage women case” refers to a case in which a 49-year-old man, named Kim Il-gon, killed a woman in her 30s after kidnapping her last year. He put her body in a luggage and eventually set fire to a vehicle with the luggage inside. Instead of calling the case the “Kim Il-gon case,” the media has been associating it with the victim’s gender.The “gastrointestinal endoscopy woman case,” refers to a case in which a woman was sexually assaulted by a physician while she was receiving her gastrointestinal endoscopy which required sedation. As it is a media culture far beyond the control of a simple guidebook, there should be stronger measures against news reports that inflict secondary victimization upon sex crime victims. It seems like no one is responsible for the media’s constant failure to fulfill its professional obligation to protect those it writes about. Perhaps what we need is a stronger legislation that guarantees one’s rights to privacy and dignity against irresponsible media coverages.

Airdre Mattner, who now teaches English in Japan, came forward as a rape victim in March through her campaign to raise funds on the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe. The case shed light on Korea’s justice system and its alleged failure to protect sexual assault victims. “I feel exhausted. I have absolutely no faith in the Korean justice system whatsoever. I was treated with complete and utter contempt. Police refused to accept what they had done wrong and apologize for secondary damage they had caused,” Mattner told The Korea Herald ahead of the first hearing. “I don’t feel optimistic .”Sydney Langford, a 28-year-old dance instructor, stages a protest in support of Airdre Mattner, the Australian who was allegedly raped in Seoul last year, in line with the case’s first hearing on Wednesday, in front of the Seoul Western District Court. She has claimed that the police failed to collect sufficient evidence and inform her of the investigation process, in what she saw as slipshod and careless handling of her case.Mattner did not appear for the first hearing held at Seoul Western District Court, during which her lawyers and the defendant went through the list of evidence including the CCTV footage and his DNA found on her body. The CCTV footage showed that two men took the victim to a motel in Itaewon, a multicultural district in central Seoul, where she said she was raped. She was in and out of consciousness at the time. But only one man, a 37-year-old Nigerian national illegally staying in the country, was indicted by the prosecution on the charge of semiforcible sexual molestation, not rape, which can carry a prison term of up to three years. He is expected to enter a plea at the next hearing. If he pleads not guilty and disapproves of the presented evidence, Mattner will be called in to testify in the courtroom. “According to the criminal law, the defendant was charged with semiforcible sexual molestation because only the DNA from the defendant’s saliva was found on the victim’s body,” said Joo Hyo-jung, a lawyer for Polaris & Partners representing Mattner. “A sexual crime is recognized as rape when the defendant penetrated the victim’s body.” Mattner, however, lamented that it is a sign of how the justice system is designed to believe and protect the suspect, not the victims. As her campaign drew international media attention, police sent an open letter addressed to Mattner on April 1 to “straighten misinformation” and refute the victim’s claims. The action immediately faced a wave of criticism for publicly humiliating the victim and revealing investigation details without consent. The police later took down the post and apologized for causing “unintended trouble.”Earlier in the morning prior to the first hearing, several people turned up in front of the court at around 9:30 a.m. to stage a protest and call for justice for Mattner. In unison, they blasted what they saw as the police’s inaction to bring justice to alleged offenders. Sydney Langford, a 28-year-old dance instructor from the United States, said that she had joined the protest to support Mattner and ensure police do their job. “I feel they just try to push our cases under the rug and make it go away,” she said of her own experience. She said she was sexually assaulted six years ago by a man in his 60s at a gym in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province. She was paid 1 million won  in return for dismissing the case. “I tried to take the man to the court and put him in jail, but police told me not to as he was old and  first-time offender,” she said, holding up the poster reading “Protect victims, not rapists. Believe victims, not rapists.” “There seems to be no change at all in the justice system failing sexual assault victims.”Lee Won-yun, a 25-year-old doctor who has closely followed Mattner’s case, noted that reporting of sexual assault is not an easy task for many women in the country due in part to the social atmosphere blaming and frowning upon rape victims. “Suspecting victims’ testimonies deters victims to report their cases to authorities, which is why I think there would be many rape cases remaining unreported,” she said. “Mattner was so brave to address the important issue on behalf of foreign as well as Korean victims here.” “These women are being failed by the very system which should be supporting them, protecting them and providing them with justice,” Mattner said. “It has taken an immense toll on me mentally, physically and emotionally. But as long as I am able, I will continue to fight for both my own justice and the change which is so desperately needed.” The next hearing is scheduled for June 15.

Her arrival took place amid “K-Culture Week in France,” a weeklong nationwide festival during which Korean arts, music, cuisine, handicrafts and other cultural aspects are to be showcased in Paris, Nantes and Nice.President Park Geun-hye arrives in Paris on Thursday. Yonhap.Despite her fully packed three-day schedule, Park allotted several hours on Thursday evening to attend KCON 2016 France, a cultural event embracing K-pop and business conventions, held in Accor Hotels Arena in Paris.All 12,000 tickets for the event sold out within three hours, with 40 percent of them being purchased from countries outside France, reflecting the extensive leverage of K-culture throughout the European continent, according to Cheong Wa Dae.The pop music concert, starring K-pop groups such as SHINee, BTS, Block B and F.T. Island, was the largest K-pop concert in Europe. It came as part of the government’s initiative to link the Korean culture with industries by combining concert and convention. This was first introduced in 2012 and has since been held in different parts of the world.Before attending the concert, Park stopped by convention booths operated by some 60 Korean companies, most of them small and medium-sized businesses involved in food, tourism, education and other cultural content.Park has emphasized the need for culture and industry to combine and create new values.“Our future growth will depend on how we industrialize the cultural sector and draw creative content out of it,” Park said last month at the groundbreaking ceremony for K-Culture Valley in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province.She also described France as an optimal partner for creative economy and cultural prosperity -- two of her leading policy buzz words.“The two states have been working together for the past 130 years to solve crucial agendas such as climate change and poverty, and thus to promote the happiness of humanity,” Park said through a written congratulatory address at a Korea-France leadership forum in March this year.“Each country is to the other  best partner in the economic and cultural sectors.”This year’s state visit, which was Park’s third trip to France during her term and her first as a state guest, was initiated by French President Francois Hollande amid a move to mark 2015-2016 as the “Year of Korea-France Bilateral Exchanges”As part of the project, the “Year of Korea in France” was designated from September 2015 to August 2016, and the reciprocating “Year of France in Korea” from January to December this year.“KCON will serve to further attract the European society’s interest in Korean culture and enhance the credibility of Korean companies,” said Kim Sang-ryul, senior presidential secretary for education and culture.“President Park’s visit  and participation in the event will add new momentum to the rise of hallyu.”Park also set out to promote educational exchanges with France, a country where she once had spent her younger days as a student.Marking Park’s state visit, the International University Campus in Paris said it will soon add a Korean Pavilion that may accommodate some 260 South Korean students. The extension, which is to be the first made at the campus over the past 40 years, will be at the South Korean government’s expense.To further encourage academic exchanges between the two countries, University of Paris VI, also known as the Pierre and Marie Curie University, is to confer on Friday an honorary doctorate for natural sciences to Park. The South Korean president previously majored in electronic engineering at Sogang University.She will then move on to Grenobles, in southeastern France, where she spent some six months as a postgraduate in 1974, before the sudden death of her mother Yuk Young-soo brought her back home.“The few days that I spent in Grenobles remain to this day one of the happiest memories of my life,” the president said in her memoirs, as well as in a meeting with Korean residents during her visit to France in 2013.By Bae Hyun-jung","of diplomacy president park ,130th anniversary of diplomatic ,diplomacy president park ,korean wave to foster ,president park geun hye","['Park Geun', 'korean', 'France', 'south korean', 'the Korean Wave', 'european']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28679526  0.70348138

The shrine, close in style to the traditional Korean house, or hanok, was founded to appease the spirit of Prince Geumseong , who was ordered a lethal dose of poison upon charges of trying to reinstate the deposed King Danjong. Shamans and a Korean traditional percussion band celebrate the opening of the Shamanism Museum in Eunpyeong-gu in northwestern Seoul on May 25. Eunpyeong-gu OfficeAs the one and only shamanic shrine in the country, it was designated an Important Folklore Cultural Heritage by the Cultural Heritage Administration in 2008. The shrine is estimated to have been built in the early 1880s. It exhibits well-preserved ritual goods and pictures of shaman gods typical of the Joseon era. Geumseongdang Shrine was to be demolished when the neighborhood was designated as “Eunpyeong New Town,” a residential area, in 2008. But after discussions between Seoul City and CHA, it was decided that the shrine would be repaired and preserved to pass on the history of folk religion to future generations. The unique relic from the past became the Shamanism Museum with the help of folklorist Yang Jong-seung.Yang has displayed more than 20,000 shamanic artifacts, paintings, documents and items of clothing that he collected from both inside and outside the country, including from the Himalayan region, Mongolia, China and other countries. “We hope this museum can work as a platform for folk religion as well as an experience zone for Korea’s traditional culture,” the Eunpyeong-gu Office said in a statement.Since last year, Eunpyeong-gu has been putting effort into developing the area into a national tourism asset.After it was designated by the government last April as the “Korean Culture Experience Specialized District,” Eunpyeong-gu launched six city development projects to revive the area’s local economy. The district recently began in earnest two of the proposals -- the Mount Bukhansan Development Project and the Traditional Culture Development Project, which both involve hanok neighborhoods.By Kim Da-sol","south korea first shamanism ,korea first shamanism museum ,northwestern seoul last week ,korea first shamanism ,deposed king danjong shamans","['South Korea ’s', 'Eunpyeong - gu', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'Geumseong', 'King Danjong', 'Shamans', 'korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.30729908  0.30140743

""While I lived there and watched the people closely, I realized we should separate ordinary North Koreans from the regime,"" he said during a press event in a church in central Seoul to mark the release of the Korean version of his evangelical memoir ""Not Forgotten."" The English version was published early last month by Thomas Nelson, a publishing company specializing in Christian books.The missionary who operated guided tours to North Korea from China was arrested on Nov. 3, 2012, on the first day of his 18th visit to the country, for allegedly trying to overthrow it.In April 2013, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and remained behind bars until he was released on Nov. 9, 2014.In the meeting with reporters, he introduced a few episodes that showed the total ignorance of the people about the outside world. Many people he met there believed the majority of South Koreans and Americans live in poverty, and few believe that the U.N. secretary-general is Korean, he said.""It was different from what we are hearing now that a lot of North Koreans have been already exposed to South Korean news,"" he said. ""Most people were kept in the total dark and didn't know anything about the outside world at all,"" he said, adding that the regime looked much firmer than he had previously thought.For the two years he remained in captivity, a sense of being remembered and people praying for him helped him immensely endure the difficult times, he said.Among the 735 days that he defined as ""hope,"" the most difficult day was Dec. 12, 2012, when North Korea fired a satellite in a veiled attempt to test a ballistic missile. ""I was devastated to see North Korean officials erupt in joy over the launch. A thought struck me that they weren't going to release me anytime soon,"" he said. Although he wouldn't be able to go back to his past missionary works in China and North Korea, he wants to help the North Korean people in any way possible.

China has joined the U.N. Security Council's move to slap tougher sanctions on North Korea over its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month.Ri's visit to China is mainly aimed at briefing CCP officials on the party congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea  in early May.But a diplomatic source said that he could meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday for possible discussions over Kim's future visit to China.Since taking office in late 2011, the North's leader has not held a summit with Xi, mainly because China has shunned the meeting in an apparent expression of anger over Pyongyang's nuclear aspirations.The CCP said in a statement posted on its website that Ri and Song agreed to ""strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the two parties.""South Korea's unification ministry said it hopes that Ri's visit to China prompts the North to give up its nuclear weapons program and bring peace to the divided peninsula.""Denuclearization of North Korea is a top priority ,"" Jeong Joon-hee, ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing. ""So we hope that Ri's visit to China contributes to making Pyongyang abandon its nukes.""Ri's trip to China comes amid speculation that North Korea could carry out its fifth nuclear test at any time in defiance of international condemnation.The communist country attempted to launch an intermediate-range ballistic missile Tuesday, but the launch ended in failure, according to the South Korean military. It was the fourth such unsuccessful attempt in two months.Experts said that the message Ri delivers on its nukes will be a critical yardstick in predicting how much Pyongyang and Beijing enhance their ties.""For North Korea, it is important to improve its ties with China for the purpose of easing the impacts of international sanctions,"" said Kim Heung-kyu, head of the China Policy Institute under Ajou University. ""But it is too early to say that Ri's visit will lead to the onset of an improvement of their strained relations.""Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, however, cast an optimistic view about Pyongyang-Beijing ties, predicting that a summit between the leaders of the two may be possible as early as August.","north korean party official ,top north korean party ,north korean ruling party ,wednesday ri vice chairman ,chinese party official pyongyang","['Ri Su - yong', 'north korean', 'chinese', 'Pyongyang', 'Ri', 'north korean', 'Song Tao']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23275959  0.54904073

Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldThe honorary professor at Sungshin Women’s University had presided over the first meeting of the 11-member committee before meeting with the press.Kim’s comments ran contrary to that of Seoul’s Foreign Ministry, which has been explaining that the 1 billion yen  fund pledged by the Japanese government in the Dec. 28 Korea-Japan “comfort women” deal could be interpreted as Tokyo’s “de facto compensation,” as the deal also included an apology from Japan. Many Korean victims and activists have protested the settlement, saying the victims had not been consulted and the deal did not clearly establish Tokyo’s legal responsibility for institutionalized wartime sex slavery. After the settlement, Tokyo also asked that the statue of a girl symbolizing victims be removed from outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.Kim said during the conference that the funds “have nothing to do” with the issues surrounding the statue. “I’ve also been to rallies by surviving victims that are being held every Wednesday in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul,” Kim said. “But I have to say those rallies are being held by nongovernmental organizations. The Korean government is not involved with the rallies or the statue. During the settlement, the Korean government agreed to speak to those NGOs, but that is not relevant to the funds for the foundation.”By the end of the conference and after a brief talk with a government official, Kim said there could be “many ways to define” the funds provided by the Japanese government. Many of the Korean slavery victims have already died of old age. There are only 42 registered survivors remaining in Korea and overseas. The committee includes government officials, former diplomats, lawyers, journalist and experts. It will be under the jurisdiction of the Gender Equality Ministry with active participation from the Foreign Ministry, organizers said.The preparatory committee members are also expected to automatically join the foundation once it launches sometime in June.The committee will for the time being continue to discuss future steps with the victims and their representative groups, Kim said.By Claire Lee","korean sex slavery victims ,victims formally began tuesday ,south korean sex slavery ,women foundation preparation launches ,committee chief saying japan","['south korean', 'Japan', 'Kim Tae - hyun', 'Tokyo']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25361148  0.5662905

The survey said24.9 percent started at age 6, 21.7 percent at age 5 and 14.8 percent at age 4. It also said 5.8 percent of the mothers started teaching English to their children, when they were still in the womb.When asked if the chosen age was appropriate, 68.5 percent said it was, but 28.1 percent thought it was too early. The survey found that the largest group of 21.7 percent said about 8 years old, the age children normally start primary school, is the right time to start English education.The same survey said 67.2 percent believed children should begin English education before starting school, but 26.2 percent said it wasn't necessary. For the former group, the biggest reason was to get their kids familiarized with a foreign language . For the latter group, the main argument was that starting early does not necessarily make their children better at English .Among those surveyed, the average appropriate age to start was 5.7.More than half  of the children started learning English through songs and animations. A similar 49.6 percent of the children took after-school classes at preschools, according to the survey in which respondents could choose more than one answer.As to how the mothers picked the starting age, 44.4 said they thought it was about the right time, while 39.9 percent said they landed on the idea when preschools offered after-school classes.Another 21.7 percent said they were pushed when other people's children started learning English.","five south korean mothers ,tuesday yoon english school ,korean children start english ,children start english education ,an online mothers community","['south korean', 'Yoon', 'English School']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36910209  0.56375408

The game refers to the match between the North's military Sobaeksu team and China's Olympic squad in the North Korean capital, although the agency did not specify when the match was held.   It's Kim's first activity related to China since he visited a cemetery for Chinese soldiers in the North Korean county of Hoechang, South Phyongan Province, in July 2013. The soldiers were killed during the 1950-53 Korean War while fighting for the North when it invaded South Korea.Kim's remark on the North Korea-China friendship also came less than a month after Chinese leader Xi Jinping sent him a congratulatory message on May 9 for his election as chairman of the North's ruling Workers' Party at the party congress earlier in the month.    In the message, Xi said he offers ""fervent"" congratulations to Kim on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and that the Chinese party and government ""highly cherish"" the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang.   Xi also described the two countries' traditional neighborly ties as a ""shared invaluable asset,"" saying that China will work together with the North to contribute to regional peace, stability and development.   The message was an unexpected departure from the Chinese government's years-long disdain of the North Korean regime in obstinate pursuit of nuclear weapons.   At that time, experts opined the congratulatory message might have come from China's need to improve ties with the North amid stepped-up efforts to strengthen security cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan in the region.    Therefore, the experts said now, the exchange of friendly messages between the leaders this time can serve as a momentum for the two communist allies to improve their ever-strained relations in recent years.    ""The latest indirect contact between Pyongyang and Beijing can be read as an act in which China sent a message showing its will to not abandon the North, and the North, in turn, sent a message expressing its will to better its ties with China,"" said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher of Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.    Kim Hong-gyu, director of Ajou University's Chinese policy research institute in Suwon, south of Seoul, said that the exchange of the friendly messages between Kim and Xi seem to have been made at a level of sounding out each other's real intentions for better relations.    However, most experts voice in unison that both the improvement of bilateral ties and Kim's visit to China still seems a long way off.    "", the North, for itself, should show a sincerity over denuclearization, or make a comment on nuclear freezing at least,"" Kim said.","chinese men basketball teams ,satisfaction over recent friendship ,and chinese men basketball ,chinese men basketball ,recent friendship game","['north korean', ""Kim Jong - un 's"", 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'KCNA', 'Kim Jong - un']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.36925858  0.48184878

In the series, she talks about how her mother would only provide dinner for her father and her brothers; she would have to either eat out by herself or make her own food. Another episode dealt with a traumatic experience in which she was beaten by her older brother as a child and how her mother did not stop him. “I had never really talked about my experiences with anyone in detail before working on this piece,” the 32-year-old told The Korea Herald. “It was very personal and very painful. I didn’t share because I thought I wouldn’t be able to bear it if someone listens to my story and doesn’t understand what I went through.”Dangi, a South Korean webtoon artist, tackles the theme of gender discrimination at home in her eponymous book by sharing her personal experiences growing up with two brothers and emotionally abusive parents. To Dangi’s surprise, the work has been well received by readers, many of whom reached out to her saying they had also been discriminated and abused by family members at home. Within the first 44 days of the series being published online, “Dangi” received more than 3 million hits, becoming the most-read webtoon in the shortest time frame on Lezhin Comics, one of the most popular online platforms for webtoons here. On Monday, the series topped Lezhin’s daily most-read chart for webtoons that belong to the “reality” genre, and ranked 14th place among webtoons of all genres, including romance, fantasy and action. “I was shocked at such enthusiastic response, but it also made me realize that I’m not alone in my experience,” she said. The series, which is also available in hard copy in bookstores, shares in detail what it is like to grow up as a Korean girl in an abusive, patriarchal home. As a child, she constantly faced sexism by her parents who openly favored her brothers over her. Before her younger brother was born, the author used to think her older brother was getting special treatment because he was the older one. Whenever her father returned from business trips, he would only bring gifts for her brother and she would get nothing. Whenever her older brother was sick, her mother would take care of him and give him medicine. When Dangi was sick, she would have to go visit a pharmacy herself and get her own medication. It was after her younger brother was born that everything became clear to Dangi: she was being discriminated against because she was a girl. “My mother would force me to give up my favorite things, such as toys and books, for my younger brother, because I was older,” the author writes in the book. “Then I realized, she would never say, ‘You should give up things because you’re older’ to my older brother.”“Dangi” explores the intersectionality of gender and age in her violence-filled family life as a young Korean and female child.The author said she has received responses from some readers who claimed that it is impossible for a young author like her to have experienced such intense gender discrimination at home. They questioned the credibility of her personal narrative. “One reader wrote on my Facebook page, and it was something like, ‘The author must have been born in the mid or late 1980s. Korean families didn’t have gender discrimination against children in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This webtoon cannot be true,’” the author said. “And it was kind of interesting because many female readers, who are even younger than I am, started responding to that post. One of them said, ‘I am younger than Dangi and I was discriminated against by my family members because I am a girl.’”Aside from sexism, Dangi said she was exposed to emotional abuse throughout her childhood. Her parents frequently fought violently in the presence of their children, at least three times a week. They often threatened to physically harm her, while verbally abusing her. The author said living in such a stressful environment severely affected her self-esteem during her teenage years. She was bullied by her classmates while attending middle school. A few years later, Dangi found out that her younger brother was also being bullied in school. A recent study by Sungkonghoe University found that children who are emotionally abused at home are more likely to develop depression and experience bullying in school. Meanwhile, according to a 2010 study by Cornell University in the U.S., siblings who sense that their mother consistently favors or rejects one child over others are more likely to show depressive symptoms as middle-aged adults. South Korea’s current child protection legislation as well as policies do not specifically include childhood exposure to marital conflicts and violence in its definition of child maltreatment. “I can totally relate to those studies,” the author said, adding that about 30 percent of all teenagers who write to her for help have experienced bullying on top of suffering emotional abuse by their parents at the same time. “Home is supposed to be your last resort when things fall apart in your life. It is the place where you return for comfort and support. I did not have such a place, and this made me even more vulnerable to other kinds of violence.” “Dangi” does not just deal with the author’s own experience. In her efforts to understand her parents, she also talks about her family history. Her mother, who had two brothers and three sisters, also experienced sexism while growing up in a country town in Gangwon Province. She and her sisters were not allowed to continue their studies after middle school and their parents only offered to finance their youngest son’s post-secondary education. She also suffered an unhappy marriage to her husband as well as a very turbulent relationship with her mother-in-law, who was overprotective of her son. The author said it is both ironic and sad that her mother internalized such sexism and discriminated her own daughter against her sons. Up until the author moved out two years ago, her mother would only make Dangi help her with chores, such as making kimchi and laundry. When she suggested asking her brothers for help, her mother would say, “Men are not supposed to do those things.”“I think I understand my mother, but I can’t forgive her,” she said. The author said she thinks her older brother is also a victim of sexism at home. “He’s so used to getting special treatment. He doesn’t know how to empathize with others,” she said. “He was exposed to marital conflicts just as much as I was. Our father was very patriarchal. I assume these things will affect his life if he decides to form his own  by marriage.”Since her first webtoon episode was published online last year, she has received at least 300 emails from her readers, who shared their experience of domestic violence. Therefore, season two of “Dangi” features the real-life stories shared by her readers, many of which are heartbreaking. One of them features a young man in his 20s who had to give up his dream to be a pianist because a violent incident triggered by his father, who was heavily drunk at the time, severely damaged his fingers. Dangi said she often does not know what to tell her teenage readers, who reach out to her for help. One of the young girls who wrote to Dangi called the police after finding it unbearable to watch her parents fight. When the police came, however, the officers simply said, “Oh, it’s another marital conflict. You should try to solve it yourselves,” before they left. Upon learning his daughter had contacted the police, the father beat his children even more that night. The best advice she can give to those in their 20s and above, she said, is that one should not try to please their abusers in the hopes of changing their behavior. “The chances are, they are probably not going to change,” she said, adding that she only speaks to her younger brother after moving out two years ago. She no longer talks to the rest of her family. “The most practical thing to do is to save money and move out. But I can’t give that advice to teenage boys and girls,” the author continued. “That’s when I feel completely helpless. And I guess this is where the government or other public authorities should intervene.”For more information on Dangi and her work, visit www.lezhin.com By Claire Lee","brothers and abusive parents ,dinner for her father ,south korean webtoon artist ,webtoon artist tackles sexism ,abusive parents she","['south korean', 'Dangi']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07176872  0.38046557

136,136,136,[Reporter’s column] Now it’s Abe’s turn to clear wartime legacy,"In the wake of U.S. President Barack Obama’s historic visit to Hiroshima last Friday, controversy continues to boil in Korea, with some begrudging him for crushing hopes that he would pay respects at a Korean memorial.

He lay a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial and embraced some survivors of the 1945 U.S. nuclear bombing, but Obama stopped short of visiting a monument set up within the park in dedication to Korean victims. He instead remarked at the onset of his speech that he had come to mourn not only the Japanese but also “thousands of Koreans” killed in and after the disaster. Obama should not be blamed for failing to make the stop at the monument. However, he did mistakenly estimate the number of Korean victims, which Seoul officials and historians put at between 30,000 and 40,000. As with the trip itself and the encounter with the survivors, it must have been a delicate decision to mention the Korean victims. Albeit for a brief moment, the world should have been reminded that Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula in the early years of last century. Some would recall that aside from the nuclear strike, many Koreans were also forced into sexual servitude on frontline brothels, slave labor for the Japanese war machine and other brutalities. The real failure in fact lies more with the absence of detailed action plans when Obama reiterated his vision for a world free of nuclear weapons. The world has become even more dangerous since he unveiled the initiative and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, on the back of North Korea’s unrelenting nuclear development and the ascent of transnational terrorist organizations including the Islamic State group. Despite a recent nuclear deal with Iran, other bomb-makers such as China, India and Pakistan continue to modernize and beef up their arsenals. It is undisputable that for some, Korean survivors in particular, it would have best soothed their torment if Obama had paid tribute at the monument. Their expression of regret is legitimate. As for most other Koreans, however, their concerns pivot around Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s unabated revisionist ambitions, to which critics say Obama offered a de facto indulgence. Standing side by side with Obama, the premier spoke of “tragedy” but nothing about the country’s imperialist past. Seoul’s Cheong Wa Dae and Foreign Ministry both refrained from making a statement following the Hiroshima outing. The diplomats could not have pressed hard for Obama’s exclusive message for Koreans. It would have taken the U.S. leader a farther 150-meter walk to see the monument, something that might be considered a distraction at an event designed as a milestone in bilateral U.S.-Japan ties. Now that Abe has scored high on the watershed visit, it is time for him to make his own bold decision to tackle persistent historical tension and bring Korea-Japan relations back on track in earnest. A chief source of sour public sentiment here is a Dec. 28 settlement between Seoul and Tokyo on the “comfort women” issue. It was an upshot of 20-months-long of grueling negotiations yet it failed to satisfy many of the victims. In a show of his sincerity, the prime minister can first provide written apologies in line with the agreement and then sit down with the former comfort women on his next trip to Seoul. If that happens, as the Hiroshima survivors did with Obama, the aging sex slavery victims may grip Abe’s hands, shake off ill feelings and finally regain their honor.By Shin Hyon-hee","hiroshima last friday controversy ,barack obama historic visit ,bombing but obama stopped ,nuclear bombing but obama ,president barack obama historic","['U.S.', 'Barack Obama ’s', 'Hiroshima', 'Korea', 'korean', 'U.S.', 'Obama', 'Kor']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42139018  0.66918844

Earlier this month, Jenson and his wife Debbie Kim had met Kim Deok-jong, whose 5-year-old son died in 2009 after battling a respiratory disease, in London. Kim was there to protest in front of Reckitt Benckiser headquarters in Slough, England. The couple helped Kim arrange meetings with authorities. “I was very moved by the story  and because I was already coming here for holiday, I wanted to join the protest,” Jenson told The Korea Herald. Several weeks later, Jenson arrived in Korea with his wife on May 14. Three days later, he held a picket that read, “The Environment Minister Out” in front of the government complex in Seoul, by himself. Andrew Jenson  protests with toxic humidifier disinfectant victims and a civic group in front of the British Embassy in Junggu, Seoul, Thursday. Kim Da-sol/The Korea HeraldOn Thursday morning, Jenson and members of a victims’ group staged a protest in front of the British Embassy in Junggu, as they delivered a letter calling for action against RB headquarters.Jenson then took the protest to Oxy Reckitt Benckiser in Yeouido in the afternoon with Choi Ye-yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health.“We are asking the company to apologize to the victims and make legal reparations,” said Jenson, who works at an international school in London. Along with his wife, a social activist, he has participated in various protests in London tackling Korea’s social issues including the Sewol ferry sinking.He said his wife has inspired him to lend a voice to social issues in her hme country and that he hoped his participation would help the victims. Adding that tragedies like this could happen in any country, including his own, Jenson said he hoped to shed light on companies with wrong values.Jenson said that he found similarities between the humidifier disinfectant tragedy and the Sewol ferry sinking in April 2014 which killed 304 people.“The reaction of the government and private companies  was chaotic, uncaring and unjust, and it added  the misery of ordinary people, who already suffered a huge personal tragedy, which just made their lives more miserable,” he said.He said the only way to break the shackles of such repetitive injustice is to boycott such companies’ products.A nationwide boycott movement against Oxy has been spreading offline and online in Korea. Last week, online malls and social commerce websites such as Auction banned sales of Oxy products. Major household distributors and convenience stores like CU also removed Oxy products from their shelves. “Victims and their families waited so long and suffered so much -- an unimaginable amount of suffering. ... I hope protests  happen here will shame the companies,” he said.By Kim Da-sol","korea with his wife ,2009 after battling respiratory ,son died in 2009 ,protests against the government ,holiday in south korea","['South Korea', 'Andrew Jenson', 'Jenson', 'Debbie Kim', 'Kim Deok - jong', 'London', 'Kim', 'Reckitt Benckiser']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20869051  0.17119777

They made an appeal in May 2014, asking the court to rule on the case.""Even though circumstances surrounding marriage have changed socially and internationally, a same-sex union cannot be accepted as a marriage only with a legal interpretation under the current legal system -- without any legislative step,"" Lee Tae-jong, chief judge of the Seoul Western District Court, said in his ruling.The judge pointed out that the country's current legal system stipulates a marriage as a union between people of different sexes.""In the related laws, such as the Constitution and civil law, the basic premise is that a marriage is a union between a male and a female,"" he said, noting that the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court have also declared marriage as a union between people of opposite sexes.""The interpretation of marriage cannot be extended to include a union for the purpose of living together for life based on the love between two people,"" he added.Lee also dismissed the argument that a refusal to accept a same-sex marriage contravenes the constitutional principle of equality.""Given that through the process of a marriage, child delivery and upbringing, a foundation is formed to continuously sustain and develop society, same-sex unions cannot be seen as the same as marriages between a man and a women,"" he said.

Africa has emerged as a continent of opportunity in recent years, though South Korea has yet to make significant foray into these markets. The country's outbound shipments to Africa accounted for just 1.4 percent of its total exports last year, according to government data.South Korea's chief executive is set to meet with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and President Mulatu Teshome during her trip to Addis Ababa from May 25 to 28.In Ethiopia, Park is also scheduled to deliver a speech at the headquarters of the African Union and meet with African Union Commission chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation between the two sides.The trip is then set to take the president to Kampala for talks with Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni on Sunday. This meeting will mark the first time that a South Korean president had visited Uganda since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1963.Seoul said the trip could serve as an important occasion to boost ties with major countries in Africa over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs, citing Uganda is a key hub of operations for North Korea in Africa.South Korea's leader is set to fly to Nairobi, the third stop on her swing through Africa for talks with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.Park plans to attend ceremonies for South Korea's official development assistance programs in the three African countries. The Korea Aid program is designed to provide health service, food and cultural contents to local people.South Korea -- which has become the first former aid recipient to join the ranks of official donors in a half century -- has so far concentrated its aid on Asia, but has recently expanded its assistance to African nations.Seoul has earmarked 2.43 trillion won  for its2016 ODA budget to be used on some 1,230 overseas aid projects.The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae said the latest trip is expected to assist economic and social development of the three African countries and pave the way for South Korean companies to make headway into these markets with good growth potential.Park could strengthen development cooperation with the African countries through the Korea Aid program and share South Korea’s economic development with the countries, a move that could deepen ties with the African countries. The tour is also set to take Park to France for a state visit on the occasion of the 130th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries.Park will meet with her French counterpart Francois Hollande to discuss a wide-range of issues, including economy and culture, as well as North Korea’s nuclear program and other global issues.The two leaders are scheduled to adopt a joint declaration to mark the long-standing establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.Last year, Park visited Paris to attend the U.N. climate change summit.","four nation tour president ,fourth largest economy yonhap ,tour president park geun ,for ethiopia on wednesday ,nation tour president park","['Park Geun', 'Ethiopia', 'France', 'Uganda', 'Kenya', 'south korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39098847  0.72607732

She further complained, however, that most turn a deaf ear to such requests.In the interview that followed, the female participants on the TV program strongly denounced men’s smoking habits.People familiar with North Korea said that it is quite unusual for North Korean TV to publicly carry out an anti-tobacco campaign using women to get men to quit.""This latest action can be seen as an expression of North Korea's desperate effort to reduce the smoking rate for men, which is believed to be over 50 percent,"" said professor Chun Young-sun of Konkuk University in Seoul.Reflecting this, the North's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried reports on the necessity of the nonsmoking movement on three different occasions in April and May. The North's official Korean Central News Agency  also reported last week on a nonsmoking campaign, while the government has set up research centers across the country to get people to stop smoking.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, known to be a chain smoker, has not been seen smoking for more than two months. He was last seen with a cigarette in hand in photographs released by state media on March 15. At the time he was overseeing a simulation of ballistic rocket re-entry technology that is key to a nuclear-armed ballistic missile hitting a faraway target.","anti smoking campaign pyongyang ,cast women in tv ,said tuesday north korea ,korea has cast women ,smoking campaign north korea","['North Korea', 'pyongyang', ""North Korea 's"", 'Central TV Station', 'North Korea']",8,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.64010018  0.08397493

Won Hee-ryong said hosting of the 11th Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity could not be more fitting.“Eco-friendly energy is a new and expanded concept of peace as it can overcome resource competition amongst nations and the global crisis of climate change,” said Won, governor of Jeju Special Self-governing Province and chairman of Jeju Forum’s organizing committee.“We must go beyond the simple notion of peace against war in order to creatively expand the scope of peace and level of cooperation.”As part of the efforts to transform Jejudo into a carbon-free island, Won has set out innovative plans since he took office in 2014.By year 2030, the province plans to replace all cars with electric vehicles and build large-scale sunlight generation facilities on unused farms and public land lots to promote new and renewable energy businesses to serve as new sources of income for the residents. By the same year, the province will also be producing a total of 6,605Gwh of wind power generation.“Right on Jejudo Island, we will be opening up a world of electric cars that are run by wind,” Won said.With these plans, the emission of greenhouse gas in the region is to be reduced by 90 percent and create some 50,000 new jobs, in addition to taking a lead in the world’s energy market.Already, as of 2015, 40 percent of South Korea’s eco-friendly electric cars run in the province -- a total of 2,366 units –- and 7,000 more will be on the roads by the end of 2016. Won said Jeju Forum will also amply address the issues of environment risks and new sources of energy during sessions such as the “Strategies and Global Cooperation for the Transition to a Low-Carbon Climate Resilient Economy” on May 25. He will also hold talks with JB Straubel, cofounder of Tesla Motors on the “revolutionary Changes Electric Vehicles Will Bring to Our Lives.”“Through Jeju Forum and other projects pertaining to energy and peace, Jejudo wishes to contribute to constructing a silk road of peace that enables coexistence and cooperation,” Won said.A former prosecutor and three-term lawmaker, Won was elected as governor of his hometown in June 2014. As a promising member of the ruling Saenuri Party, Won’s moves in and outside the National Assembly have garnered public attention, such as when he pushed the “hyeopchi” policy of maximizing citizen participation in policy and decision-making.Having entered the half-point of his tenure ending in 2018, Won said he was full of drive and optimism to accomplish key policies and mend accompanying conflicts amongst varying interest groups.The second international airport for the resort island -- where over 5 million locals and foreigners visited in just the first four months of this year -- is to be opened by 2025. “We will prepare realistic measures such as compensation, relocation and noise countermeasures for residents of the scheduled site of Seongsaneup,” he said. A comprehensive air city will also be designed and built near the airport to boost the local economy, he added.Other high-profile projects include launching a cruise tour at its landmark naval base in the southern town of Gangjeong, formally called the Jeju Civilian-Military Complex Port.The Korean Navy’s new base was completed after much delays in February this year to improve the coastal defense capability by accommodating 20 warships, three submarines and two 150,000-ton cruise vessels at the same time. Cruise liners will dock at the port from July 2017.The port is expected to boost the island’s tourism industry with more than 1 million cruise tourists expected to visit it annually from 2020.The plan, however, has also been opposed by many residents and environmentalists citing ecological damage and procedural errors. The Navy has moved to seek for a right to indemnity earlier this year citing extensive budget that arose from the delays due to protests.“I will be persuading  to withdraw the suit. It is the Navy that must reach out a hand of reconciliation first. The losses suffered by the Navy must be handled by the state and the Navy must offer the olive branch to the residents. I will fulfill my role to mediate and persuade in that aspect,” Won said.The veteran politician, who has been considered an outspoken and standout reformative member of the ruling party, also took time to lend his thoughts on the current politics. His Saenuri Party was pulled down from the majority and No. 1 status in the crushing April general election.“The Saenuri Party is immersed in its own power struggle while trying to be on the good side of the president. While such a way may be somewhat required in politics, an explicit showing of such manners without caring for the people and their livelihood has led to its supporters abandoning the party,” Won said.“The first thing the Saenuri Party must do is to find the people who voted for President Park Geun-hye in the presidential election  but did not vote for the party this time, and ask them the reason and ways for them to return.","jeju forum eco friendly ,climate change said won ,11th jeju forum for ,jeju forum for peace ,forum eco friendly energy","['Won Hee - ryong', 'Won', 'Jeju Special self - govern', 'Province', 'Je']",8,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.14428531 0.29982787 0.08890928],Kim Da-sol,Social affairs,5,2016,"climate change said won governor ,11th jeju forum for peace ,transform jejudo into carbon free ,climate resilient economy on may ,projects include launching cruise tour","['Won Hee - ryong', 'Won', 'Jeju Special self - govern', 'Province', 'Jeju Forum ’s', 'Won', 'Won', 'South Korea ’s', 'Jeju Forum', 'Straubel', 'Tesla Motors', 'Changes Electric Vehicles will bring', 'Jeju Forum', 'Won', 'Won', 'Saenuri Party', 'the National Assembly', 'Won', 'Seongsaneup', 'Gangjeong', 'the Jeju Civilian - Military', 'the Korean Navy ’s', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Navy', 'Won', 'Saenuri Party', 'Saenuri Party', 'Won', 'the Saenuri Party', 'Park Geun']",1,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.14428531 0.29982787 0.08890928]

Lee, a 48-year-old Korean-American who currently heads Google Korea, is suspected of not taking appropriate measures despite rising health complaints from users when he was leading the company from June 2005 to May 2010. Sales of Oxy Ssak Ssak reached a high during his term. Former CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser John Lee  appears for questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday. Yonhap“ is very heartbreaking,” Lee said in Korean as he appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. “My prayers and condolences go out to the victims and the families. I will cooperate with the investigation,” he added in English. Lee is the first foreign national to be questioned as a suspect in the sterilizer case that has resulted in at least 146 deaths recognized by the government. Last week, prosecutors questioned Ulrich Hosterbach, a finance director of Oxy – currently Reckitt Benckiser Korea – as a witness.The prosecution questioned Lee on whether he had known about the harmfulness of the product and the reasons for failing to take measures despite the health complaints. They also looked into what and how much of a role the U.K. headquarters played in decision-making over the product. The U.K. headquarters owns 100 percent of the Korean subsidiary.The investigators said they will decide on the charges against Lee based on the evidence and questioning. The prosecution also called in two officials each from Lotte Mart and Homeplus, who were in charge of developing their own humidifier disinfectant brands.Meanwhile, a group of victims and their families filed complaints with the prosecutors against 18 public officials for accidental manslaughter for neglecting their duties to ensure product safety. The accused include two former environment ministers -- Kim Myung-ja who served from 1999 to 2003 and Kang Hyun-wook who served from 1996 to 1997 --  and other Environment Ministry officials. They were in charge of the country’s chemical safety rules and giving permits to manufacturers for the use of PGH and PHMG, which were used in the toxic humidifier disinfectants. “ allowed the use of the toxic chemical without fully reviewing the toxicity according to the regulations. Even after the toxicity was confirmed, the  neglected the disinfectant users, leading to more deaths and injury,” said attorney Ha Joo-hee, who works as one of legal representatives for the group. “They violated their duties, not only morally but also legally. For the disinfectant toxicity review, the ministry did not receive any data about the inhalation-toxicity test, although the ministry was supposed to do so.”Under the rule, the general use and specific use of chemicals should be submitted to the ministry for toxicity review. For chemicals used in products related to inhalation, companies must submit additional safety test data. PHMG was first developed by a local company in 1996 and registered as an antimicrobial agent for carpets. In the U.S., the chemical has been classified as an agricultural pesticide. The victims argued that the ministry did not thoroughly review the chemicals’ toxicity and did not ask the company for a inhalation-toxicity test, however, the ministry has claimed that reviewing the chemical's inhalation toxicity was not necessary as the harmfulness of PHMG was low as long as it is used as a carpet treatment. PHG was also registered as an antimicrobial treatment for rubber, woods and fabrics, based on which it did not require an inhalation-toxicity test. The ministry did not comment on the complaint filed by the victims.

He was 62. Political sources said the main opposition party will seek to beef up the public's support through the commemorative event, as Roh's dramatic death has transformed him into an icon of the opposition factions.The People's Party, which failed to earn a single seat in South Gyeongsang Province and Busan, also seeks to embrace supporters of Roh through the commemorative event, they added.The Saenuri Party on the other hand is aiming to shore up its support base in the Gyeongsang region by participating in the symbolic gathering. The party suffered a setback in the April 13 polls by giving up seats in the Gyeongsang area, which traditionally has been its political stronghold.","ex president roh korean ,president roh korean politicians ,memory of ex president ,anniversary of former president ,2008 killed himself","['korean', ""Roh Moo - hyun 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party', ""People 's Party"", 'Roh', 'Bongha Village', 'Seoul', 'Roh']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48108438  0.54770297

But her concerns were soon eased by the subway, which she quickly found was easy to navigate. She said, “I was pleasantly surprised when I saw English signs in the stations. I thought that was very helpful and they put me at ease straightaway.”Layug, who studies at a language institute, was impressed by the subway’s extensive coverage. “In the Philippines, there is just the Metro Manila and it is very limited, with too few stations. In Seoul, the subway gets you where you want to go,” said Layug.Overall, foreign tourists and residents usually consider Korea’s subway accessible and user-friendly, although they are sometimes shocked by the etiquette on trains. Singaporean Yi Xian Wen, 27, who visited Seoul in May, said, “Many people tend to sit very close or shove unnecessarily to get off the train.” She also noticed that information booths in the subway did not seem to be manned, making it difficult to seek help. “In Singapore you can go immediately to the control stations and they will help you. In Seoul, I went to the wrong platform and had to go to the opposite side so I pressed a ‘help’ button on the fare gate and someone opened it for me -- I guess it happens often.” said Yi. Other bugbears highlighted by foreign tourists and residents include the long distance between platforms when transferring lines, the lack of escalators and the lengthy intervals between train arrivals, which can sometimes be up to 20 minutes on certain lines.As for the cost, those from Hong Kong and America said that the fare here is roughly similar to what they pay back home, with slight differences. “For mid-to-long distances, the cost is quite similar, but for short distances -- one or two stations -- it is super expensive compared to Hong Kong, where the fare is around 690 won  to 3,900 won,” said Cindy Li, a 29-year-old student who moved here in 2015. Amanda Sheffield, 27, an American teacher who moved here three months ago, agreed. She said, “The base price  can get you really far. However, it is the same base price for a short distance which can sometimes make it feel pricey if  frequently for a short distance.”In San Diego and near San Francisco, where Sheffield lived, the base subway fare is around $2.50 and $2.25 respectively, she added. Despite such differences, foreigners here were generally impressed by some features of Seoul’s subway, including the screens that show you the location of the next train. For some foreign residents, the subway is their preferred means of transport because of its convenience and comfortable journeys, although it seems to have grown more crowded over the years. Master’s graduate Emily Wang, 27, a Chinese who has lived here for eight years, said, “In the past, the trains were mostly crowded only during peak hours and it would be easy to get seats in the afternoons, but now there are fewer seats even then. Buses tend to be very bumpy and give me motion sickness -- especially because some bus drivers start moving almost immediately once you board.

But the switch has also come under fire as only the wealthy can afford the high tuition of law schools.It also failed to pass a bill related to class-action suits against corporations, which was sparked by the case of deadly humidifier disinfectant sold by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product, came to light after four pregnant women died from unknown lung problems in 2011.Korea confirmed 221 people as victims.

With hopes of constructing landmarks on par with those of New York, Seoul City kicked off a grand project last year. The city allocated about 700 million won  to building unique landmarks in Seoul. In January 2015, a 10-meter-high, 5-ton sculpture of the monster featured in the movie “The Host”  was unveiled at Yeouido Han River Park.A monster sculpture in Yeouido Hangang Park Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentLocated between Mapo and Wonhyo Bridge, the sculpture was modeled after the character in the film by director Bong Joon-ho, which features a monster created after researchers dump a toxic chemical into the Han River.Although Seoul City spent about 108 million won to build it, the public complained the statue looked “too ugly” and “too realistic,” with some even saying the statue has a negative impact on the atmosphere at the Han River.Another sculpture, “Fruit Tree,” was installed in front of the National Assembly in April 2015. The 7-meter, 2.5-ton tree has a mix of vegetables and fruits hanging on it -- including carrots, potatoes, apples and peaches -- and resembles the shape of a brain.“Fruit Tree” by Choi Jeong-hwa stands near the Memorial Hall inside the National Assembly. Kim Da-sol/The Korea Herald“The tree’s variety of colorful fruits and vegetables underlines a message of abundance, harmony, happiness and dream,” reads a signboard next to the statue.The tree first appeared as part of a cultural exhibition hosted last year. Then it was decided that it should remain inside the Assembly as an attraction for visitors, according to the National Assembly Secretariat. In December, the sculpture was moved to the far-east corner in front of the Memorial Hall of the Assembly. Its relocation cost 17 million won, in addition to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism’s 120 million won installation fee.A lawyer, who worked three years at the Assembly, said, “The statue itself does not contain any meaning related to the works of the parliament.”“It may look attractive to artists, but I think , the installation was just waste of public money,” he added, wishing to remain unnamed.In late April, a giant sculpture dedicated to the hit song “Gangnam Style” was unveiled in front of the multipurpose cultural venue Coex in Samseong-dong, southern Seoul.Modeled after the song’s signature “horse-riding” dance move, the 5-meter-tall bronze sculpture features two overlapping fists. When sensors below the statue detect movement, lights automatically turn on as “Gangnam Style” is played.“Gangnam Style” sculpture Gangnam-gu OfficeThe Gangnam-gu Office spent about 410 million won to build the two fists. In the district office’s day trip guide for Gangnam, the landmark is listed as a tour spot. But public reception has been lukewarm.“At first, I thought it was an advertisement for a watch,” said Park Seo-yeon, a resident in neighboring Samseong-dong.“I think it may attract some foreigners, but definitely not many locals. Although Psy’s ‘Gangnam Style’ song literally swept the globe, I think those two hands look grotesque and  really random  to be placed in the middle of the street,” she added. Seoul City said that it would review the current landmark statues by setting up an advisory panel on public art.“We have not had a supervising team that covers public art so far. So we were not able to review  such statues or discuss budgets,” said an official from Seoul City’s Design Policy department. “But we will continue to install more landmarks, so visitors can be reminded of Seoul through them, just like people flock to Paris to visit Eiffel Tower,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","york seoul city kicked ,seoul in january 2015 ,seoul city kicked off ,new york seoul city ,bronze sculpture charging bull","['Manhattan', 'Charging Bull', 'New York City', 'New York', 'Seoul City', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.06663149 -0.00498617

Pyongyang on Monday informed the British government that it has appointed the former vice foreign minister as the successor of Ri Su-yong through a diplomatic letter to its embassy in London, according to the Associated Press. Ri, 60, is a career diplomat with extensive experience in negotiations with Seoul and Washington, having served as the ambassador to the U.K. and chief nuclear negotiator. He is also the son of Ri Myong-je, a late former deputy director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Organization and Guidance Department and editor of the official Korean Central News Agency.  Ri Yong-ho Many Seoul officials remember him for his good negotiating skills, suave manners and fine command of the English language. The North’s current ties with Seoul and Washington remain icy in the wake of its latest atomic and missile tests. Yet, he could be a catalyst when the mood turns around and dialogue restarts, some observers say, pointing to his previous stint as the representative to the six-nation denuclearization talks also involving China, Russia and Japan. “He is known as a reasonable figure, with impressive capability as a diplomat, speaking skills and knowledge all in all. But he would have limited leeway as the minister, and be more like a typical technocrat,” a South Korean senior diplomat who has met with Ri before. “His appointment bears the message to the outside world: While continuing nuclear development, they can carry out negotiations in parallel, in line with the message that came out of the recent party congress.”Ri’s promotion essentially completed the foreign ministry’s lineup for North American affairs, with the American department being led by Han Song-ryol, with the support of two deputy directors -- Pak Song-il and Choe Son-hui, the daughter of late Premier Choe Yong-rim. With the appointment, Pyongyang could have a better balance of hawks and doves. Han was also in charge of the “New York channel” with Clifford Hart, who served as the U.S.’ special envoy for the six-party talks and is now consul general in Hong Kong.Concerns had grown after hard-line military commander Kim Yong-chol became the new director of the United Front Department and a secretary of the party’s central committee responsible for inter-Korean affairs, following the death of seasoned negotiator Kim Yang-gon. Kim Yong-chol is believed to have orchestrated Pyongyang’s deadly sinking of a South Korean corvette in 2010. But the prospects remain bleak for any resumption of denuclearization negotiations. During the congress early this month, leader Kim Jong-un declared the country a “responsible nuclear state” and reaffirmed its parallel pursuit of nuclear capability and development -- the “byungjin policy” -- though he proposed inter-Korean military talks and urged efforts to bring the cross-border relationship back on track. “Ri is likely to boost the North’s propaganda offensive with better English and in a shrewder manner than that of his predecessor, as it has claimed to be a strong nuclear power,” another Seoul diplomat said on anonymity.By Shin Hyon-hee","korea new foreign minister ,new foreign minister ,for new foreign minister ,new foreign minister the ,60 is career diplomat","['Ri Yong - ho', 'North Korea ’s', 'pyongyang', 'british', 'Ri Su - yong', 'London', 'the Associated Press', 'Ri']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49253005  0.53241771

Pyongyang has conducted a series of SLBM tests since last year, including one last month in which the missile flew about 30 kilometers.U.S. experts said that despite the short distance, the test shows the North is making progress.","submarine shows korea pursuit ,korea ballistic missile submarine ,over submarine shows korea ,netting over submarine shows ,slbm program 38 north","[""North Korea 's"", 'SLBM', 'U.S.', 'the Sinpo South Shipyard', 'Gorae']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.22934164  0.27526152

In an interview with The Korea Herald this week, the now-defunct company’s former CEO Frede Damgaard said that KeTox mainly imported PGH from Austria to Denmark for agricultural use.“We didn’t manufacture PGH, we only bought it,” Damgaard said. “ different purposes, but mainly for agricultural purposes,” he added.Lim Heung-kyu of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health told The Korea Herald said that evidence still suggested otherwise“Since  material safety data sheet mentions KeTox as the manufacturer, we still believe the company was engaged in PGH sales over the disputed humidifier sterilizer.” According to the material safety data sheet issued in November 2001 by the Danish government, its “manufacturer/supplier” is written as KeTox.  MSMD issued in November 2001 On his previous claim that Cefu humidifier sterilizer used PHMG from China, instead of PGH from Denmark’s KeTox, Damgaard said that he does not have any information about trade involving Chinese companies, saying it was his mere “guess.”“I have nothing to do with it, I don’t know anything about China. I only think that  might have been buying other products from China,” Damgaard added.On Thursday, a taped conversation with Choi Ye-yong of ACCEH showed that Damgaard had denied commercial sales of PGH to Korea. However, the firm had sent a 40-ml PGH sample for agricultural use, along with a material safety data sheet, to an unnamed Korean company in 2007. He had also argued that the chemicals used in Butterflyeffect’s brand Cefu -- one of the sterilizers blamed for the deaths since 2011 -- were from China.By Kim Da-Sol","former ceo danish chemical ,korean company butterflyeffect denied ,ceo danish chemical ketox ,company former ceo danish ,ceo danish chemical","['danish', 'KeTox', 'PGH', 'korean', 'PGH', 'danish', 'the Korea Herald', 'Frede Damgaard', 'KeTox', 'PGH', 'Austria', 'Denmark']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5416953   0.35087508

She was a labor rights activist. Over time, the song has taken on a symbolic meaning, representing and assuaging the grief of those who died fighting for their democratic rights in the May Uprising.

The patients wanted the procedure for wrinkles in their foreheads, not for dental conditions, according to the press release released by the Supreme Court of Korea. The dentist had been found guilty of practicing illegal medical procedures in his first and second trials and was sentenced to a suspended fine of 1 million won . In response to heated public debate on the case, the dentist’s upcoming hearing at the nation’s highest court, scheduled for Thursday, will be open to public and broadcast live.The Korean Medical Association, which represents 100,000 mainstream physicians, endorsed the previous rulings -- saying the government is “exposing its patients to danger” should it allow dentists to give Botox procedures as they are not properly trained in aesthetic medicine. Meanwhile, the Korean Dental Association, a representative body of Korea’s dentists, has been claiming that dentists are more than qualified to practice Botox procedures for the face. They have been arguing that dentists are experts in conditions related to structures and tissues in the jaw and facial area, on top of oral cavities. “We’ve decided to make this hearing a public one as there has been a lot of debate among medical professionals as well as patients about the case,” the Supreme Court said in a statement. “There is an ambiguity with the current Medical Service Act and its definition of duties of medical doctors and dentists.”Currently, article 2 of the nation’s Medical Service Act states that the duties of a dentist are “to engage in dental treatment and guidance for oral health,” while the duties of a medical doctor are to “engage in medical treatment and health guidance.” The Supreme Court said that these definitions are rather short and don’t provide specific and detailed explanation of what their responsibilities are according to their expertise. The KMA has been claiming that all dentists should be banned from practicing Botox procedures for cosmetic purposes. “Those who are not properly trained are also more likely to be incapable of giving the proper treatments should there be an emergency situation caused by side effects of Botox injections,” the organization said in a statement released prior to Thursday’s hearing.However, representative bodies of traditional Korean medicine doctors, pharmacists and nurses together released a statement in response to the KMA’s claims against dentists, arguing that KMA is being unreasonable and unnecessarily “territorial.” The KMA has been also in a feud with Korean traditional medical doctors, as they have been claiming that all traditional physicians should be banned from using modern-day medical equipment such as ultrasounds. “We believe that cosmetic procedures have been already performed by dental and maxillofacial surgeons in Korea for many years,” the medical professionals said in a statement. “Knowing this, all we can say is the KMA is being disrespectful toward other health care professionals.”By Claire Lee","physicians dentists in feud ,dentists in feud over ,dentists in feud ,south korean medical doctors ,trial involving dental surgeon","['south korean', 'Botox', 'Botox']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4103545   0.89410627

The KCNA said last week that Kim visited a machinery exhibition after the 7th congress of the WPK."" planned to turn the tree nursery into the one to be proud of in the world so that it might be presented as a gift to the Seventh Congress of the WPK,"" the KCNA reported. ""He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that a combined control system has been successfully built at the tree nursery to ensure the most suitable conditions and environment for cultivating tree saplings.""According to the report, Kim said that the yearly sapling production at the tree nursery is more than 20 million and if all provinces build such ""land-saving and manpower-saving"" tree nurseries like the No. 122 tree nursery, they will be able to produce 200 million saplings a year. Last December, Kim visited the facility and asked officials to modernize the tree nursery. He was satisfied that the KPA had carried out his order ""without an inch of deflection,"" the KCNA reported, adding that the leader thanked the officials from the designing unit, construction unit and the scientific research field for ""building the tree nursery of the world level.""

The site was reborn as a four-story complex, designed by Zaha Hadid, an award-winning architect who died in March.The ultramodern design of the plaza -- with a total floor area of 87,000 square meters -- marked a significant transformation of the image and characteristics of the area around Dongdaemun, or Heunginjimun, one of the eight old gates of Seoul.The DDP’s unique exterior has garnered international attention since it opened. Big fashion names such as Dior also showed interest. Held from June to August last year, Dior’s “Espirit Dior” exhibition attracted millions of visitors. Dongdaemun Design Plaza “I think the DDP’s unique exterior design appeals to global brands. We have been hosting Seoul Fashion Week since 2014 as well, which helped Seoul to be recognized as one of the stylish cities,” Lee told The Korea Herald. Lee’s foundation under Seoul City is responsible for overseeing various design projects of the capital as well as the operation of the DDP. The DDP currently serves as a multipurpose venue for performances and house businesses, stores and other recreational spaces.The renovation of the area was decided by the Dongdaemun district and Seoul City to replace the decades-old stadium that had lost its purpose and served as a temporary parking lot since 2003. The decision thus was also controversial, with the neighboring marketplaces complaining that the plaza would be out of place and would hurt their businesses. Since the 1980s, Dongdaemun has been a landmark destination for locals and tourists for its wide range of wholesalers and retailers in the garment, textile and fashion industries. “Vendors from shops across the street often said that it was better back in the day when sports games attracted swarms of people to the stadium. They regarded the DDP as an extremely fancy and luxurious building,” said Lee.Lee, a former industrial designer and professor at Hongik University, began to head the foundation in April last year.He received a master’s degree in vehicle design at the Royal College of Art in 1992 and worked as a vehicle design researcher at Daewoo Motor Company’s Design Center until 2001. He has been heading the Personal Mobility Research Center at Hongik University since 2013. He has also been heading the International Design School for Advanced Studies since 2012.Seoul Design Foundation CEO Lee Keun Lee said there was a need for the DDP to coexist with vendors in the area.“We just began hosting night markets in May that visitors can enjoy, with over 40 food trucks and 80 design product booths,” Lee said.”Last year alone, over 7 million visitors participated in the DDP’s variety of cultural programs, fairs and events.The DDP was also selected by The New York Times as one of 52 must-visit tourist attractions in 2015.“To be honest, I think urban renewals should be carefully done as pieces of the past can be lost in the newly built space. Redevelopment should be done with respect to history and residents,” Lee said.Lee also noted that urban architects should preserve the history of the areas they work in, citing Bukchon Hanok Village in northern Seoul and Cheonggyecheon stream, a 10.9 km-long modern public recreation space in downtown Seoul. In 2007, relics of the past were discovered during the construction of the DDP. Through a cultural properties’ investigation, a total of 5,200 relics are now preserved and showcased inside the DDP’s Dongdaemun History and Culture Park. “The spatial advantages that history gives cannot be replaced by urban architecture, because constructing a building also means that an atmosphere around it will be built. It is important to see the role of the architect as someone that can plant a memorable experience in Seoul,” he said.“The main idea will not be about what to build, but about what kind of atmosphere will be created with the coexistence of old and new architects.”Although DDP stands for Dongdaemun Design Plaza, it can also mean “Dream, Design and Play,” according to Lee.Lee has been dreaming of a place where art performances, exhibitions, shopping and dining can happen. “In Paris, popular arts and science museums such as the Pompidou Center are always open to public. Open-door arts which encourage participation from the public is something that we are aiming for,” said Lee.When asked about the Pompidou Center opening a branch in Seoul, Lee welcomed the idea and said that it would lead to synergized efforts in the arts industry.“Do we see it as a threatening rival in Korea’s art scene? No, in fact I really welcome the opening  and I am excited to experience the global arts trend.”Art is borderless, has no boundary or superiority, Lee said.“When hallyu first gained big attention in Japan, it was not something  because our culture was superior to that of other countries.“I would like to spread the idea that Korea is a country of developed arts and  ready for creative collaborations, with an open-minded public who enjoys collaborative efforts in the art scene here,” added Lee.By Kim Da-sol","winning architect who died ,ceo of the seoul ,an award winning architect ,award winning architect ,giant spaceship is the","['Lee Keun', 'the Seoul Design Foundation', 'Zaha Hadid']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4492988   0.71811831

Park is scheduled to meet with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn during her visit to Addis Ababa from May 25-28, before moving on to separate talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. She will then travel to France on June 1 for a four-day stay.Her visit to Uganda is to be the first one by a South Korean president. Her predecessors Chun Doo-hwan and Lee Myung-bak had visited Kenya and Ethiopia during their terms.YonhapIn Ethiopia, Park will also deliver a speech at the African Union headquarters, where she will meet with the union’s chairperson and South African anti-apartheid activist Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The African Union is the most influential intergovernmental organization in the African continent, based in Addis Ababa and comprising of 54 African states except Morocco.In all three African states, the president will attend the initiation ceremony for Korea Aid, the nation’s new official development assistance program to provide health care, food and cultural contents to local communities.The president’s rare trip to the African countries will lay the foundation for South Korean companies’ overseas expansion, and also secure international cooperation on dealing with North Korea’s nuclear issues, according to Cheong Wa Dae.Despite the rising importance of the continent as a market, South Korea’s exports to the region only accounted for 1.4 percent of its total exports as of last year, government data showed.After the African tour, Park will go to France to meet with her counterpart Francois Hollande, marking the 130th anniversary of the two countries’ diplomatic ties. The two state leaders are set to discuss economic and cultural agendas, as well as measures regarding North Korea’s nuclear armament.Park’s most recent visit to the European country was for the United Nations climate change summit in Paris last December.By Bae Hyun-jung","expand south korean companies ,her 12 day trip ,on business opportunities president ,business opportunities president park ,kenya the president will","['Park Geun', 'south korean', 'african', 'France', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'Ethiopia', 'Uganda', 'Kenya', 'south korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45599803  0.65060341

A presidential council on science and technology will also serve as a control tower for the country’s overall policies in the field.“Our country has achieved an astonishing growth, but now finds itself in a nutcracker position, trapped between developed and developing nations,” Park said during the council’s inaugural meeting held at Cheong Wa Dae.President Park Geun-hye speaks Thursday at the inaugural meeting of a presidential panel on science and technology. The panel was created upon the president’s move to improve South Korea’s R&D; efficiency and to map out a blueprint for the nation’s long-term technology policies.“We now face a new risk, pressed by Japan’s rebounding competitiveness backed by its weak yen and China’s technological advancement,” she added, referring to the phenomenon as “neo-nutcracker.”Strategy consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton first used the term “nutcracker” back in 1997 to describe South Korea’s disposition as being sandwiched between low-cost China and efficiency-focused Japan.To overcome such a crisis and to secure new momentum, the president stressed the need for the government to minimize its restrictions.“When it comes to core science technology policies, the government will adopt a top-down strategy, playing its role as control tower between departments and suggesting long-term visions,” she said.“But as for the rest, we will take a bottom-up approach so as to maximize the creativeness and autonomy of the private sector.”Under the strategy, government-led R&D; projects will be subsidized by up to 600 billion won in the budget next year, to be used for private projects. Also, the state-funded R&D; funds for universities will be increased from the current 1.1 trillion won to 1.5 trillion won by 2018, according to Cheong Wa Dae.Up-and-coming researchers will be offered a kick-off fund of up to 30 million won per year for a maximum of five years, while those picked as excellent practitioners may receive up to 100 million won.“I hope that researchers, with this expanded autonomy, endeavor further to produce the best results possible and to prevent illegalities,” Park added.”I will, in response, lead a state strategy project to expand the leverage of their technology.”By Bae Hyun-jung","pledged thursday to overhaul ,growth president park geun ,thursday to overhaul south ,to spur growth president ,overhaul south korea research","['Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43136546  0.61761659

His family told NRK that the 53-year-old coach had been in the communist state for two weeks.They said that North Korea had been looking for a German coach.Andersen, who was born in Fredrikstad, southern Norway, became a German citizen in 1993.If the move is confirmed, Andersen will replace North Korean-born Kim Chang-bok. North Korea, currently 112th in FIFA rankings, are already out for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.This will be the second time that North Korea have hired a foreigner to manage their men's national football team, after Hungarian boss Pal Csernai in 1991.Andersen was a prolific striker in the Bundesliga, where he became the first foreigner to lead the scoring with 18 goals for Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1989-1990 season. He also played FC Nurnberg and Hamburg in Germany, and for Swiss sides FC Zurich and FC Lugano.Since retirement, Andersen has managed FSV Mainz, Larissa and Karlsruher SC. His last coaching job was with SV Austria Salzburg in 2015.North Korea have appeared at the FIFA World Cup twice. Their best performance came in 1966 when they reached the quarterfinals, after beating Italy in the group stage.North Korea's last World Cup appearance was in 2010 where they finished last in their group with losses against Brazil, Portugal and Cote d'Ivoire.","football team norwegian media ,bundesliga top scorer jorn ,national football team norwegian ,lead their national football ,former bundesliga top scorer","['North Korea', 'Bundesliga', 'Jorn Andersen', 'norwegian', 'Norway', 'NRK', 'Andersen', 'North Korea', 'NRK', 'North Korea', 'german']",8,"[ 3.          0.          0.         ... -0.62067187  0.49544719

YonhapThe meeting -- which gathered heads of the country’s five largest business groups and some 300 business representatives -- was arranged at the last minute, amid Cheong Wa Dae’s move to capitalize on the business agreements signed during Park’s recent state visit to Iran.The presidential office has touted that Park’s historic visit to the sanction-freed country will result in an estimated economic effect of 52 trillion won, citing some 66 memorandums of understanding signed during the three-day stay.“Where there is no way, we should lay out a new way,” Park said, citing South Korea’s strengths such as its free trade relationships with each of the world’s top three economies.She thereby urged companies to come up with more innovative ideas and products so as to appeal to overseas markets.“Companies should not restrict themselves to either domestic sales or exports. ... An excellent product, service or system built on innovative ideas will attract attention everywhere, whether domestic or overseas.”The president largely lauded the role of the government-led business consultation session held during the Iran visit and the previous state visit to Mexico early last month.“The session proved to be a powerful export platform for SMEs that have sufficient technology but weak overseas network or brand recognition,” Park said.The president also encouraged South Korean companies to go beyond their conventional strengths, such as semiconductors, steel, and automobile, and look into new growth sectors.“The decades-long infrastructure capacities, combined with the newly rising energy development business, could lead to the export of a smart city management system.”At the end of her speech, Park expressed optimism regarding the nation’s economic outlooks and current achievements.“If we continue to see things in a negative light, we will never grasp the chance for change and growth. For instance, air pollution may be a serious problem but could also create a new market for energy development, which then may become a new growth opportunity for us.”By Bae Hyun-jung","for export diversification president ,export diversification president park ,new overseas markets underlining ,rapidly changing global trade ,export diversification president","['Park Geun', 'South Korea']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15068303  0.61315322

He is known for addresses in the Senate criticizing Japan's brutal 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea in the course of the Senate's 1919 rejection of the Treaty of Versailles.The late senator is also known to have provided support for Korean independence fighters Syngman Rhee and Soh Jaipil, living in Washington at the time. After Korea's independence and national division, Rhee later became first president of South Korea.The decision to confer the medal on Norris was made as part of South Korea's efforts to recognize foreign contributors to the country's independence, officials said.""It is a tremendous honor. It is a tremendous honor for my family. We thank the Korean ambassador in South Korea very much for recognizing my great-grandfather,"" said Rath, president of Saints Peter and Paul High School in Maryland.""If he were here today ... he would not want this ceremony.

It posted economic growth for the fourth straight year in 2014 after contracting in 2009 and 2010.Kim has defended his signature policy of developing nuclear weapons in tandem with boosting the country's moribund economy, commonly known as the ""byeongjin"" policy. Seoul and Washington have warned that the dual-track policy is a dead end.Analysts said that if tougher international sanctions are put in place for a long time, the North's economy is not likely to recover due to a shortage of dollars and products.The U.N. Security Council slapped its toughest sanctions to date on North Korea for its fourth nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February.","boost economy at party ,economy at party congress ,vision to boost economy ,congress north korean leader ,economy at party","['north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'U.N.']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43993452  0.58326459

Kim is the late father of the current leader Kim Jong-un whom North Korean state media described as ""the great sun of the 21st century.""Park went to a local theater in southern Seoul, along with her top aides and some 50 people, including North Korean defectors.Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office, said Park's move highlights her interest in the true lives of North Korean children and the human rights situation there.North Korea marks International Children's Day on June 1.North Korea's state propaganda claims North Korea is a paradise, but the communist country has long been accused of grave human rights abuses, ranging from holding political prisoners in concentration camps to committing torture and carrying out public executions.Also Thursday, Park met with about 300 children at the presidential garden of Nokjiwon as part of Children's Day celebrations.Park told the children to pursue their dreams as she introduced an innovation center and a test-free semester program.South Korea has set up a total of 17 innovation centers in major cities across the country to encourage creative and entrepreneurial people to turn their ideas into real businesses with the help of cutting-edge science and information technology.South Korea introduced a test-free semester program in 2013 to provide middle school students with chances to experience a wide range of learning activities for their future careers.Under the program, schools will shift the focus away from test scores and engage students through discussions, experiments, outdoor activities and team projects.The one-semester program represents a big change in a country where students tend to rely on rote learning that critics say is to blame for a lack of creativity and critical thinking.","children day russian documentary ,korean authorities the movie ,park watches russian documentary ,movie thursday about life ,day russian documentary maker","['Park Geun', 'North Korea', 'Park', 'north korean', 'South Korea', 'Children', 'russian', ""Vitaly Mansky 's"", 'Sun', 'north korean']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.47428375  0.68508351

According to organizers, the main agenda of Friday’s meeting will be to demand that the RB CEO makes an official apology in front of victims in Korea and provides them with concrete compensation measures in documented form. CEO Kapoor is one of the eight executive board members against whom humidifier sterilizer victims, joined by ACCH and liberal lawyers group Minbyun, filed a suit on Monday. They demanded that the prosecution summon all eight members to Korea for investigation.The victims’ protest will continue in Denmark, with visits to chemical manufacturer Ketox, Denmark’s Environment Ministry, Foreign Ministry and state prosecutor’s office.Meanwhile, the prosecution has stepped up its investigation into the sterilizer case by the raiding offices of professors at Seoul National University and Hoseo University who had led the product toxicity test requested by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- officially renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014. An SNU professor surnamed Cho was detained without warrant Wednesday in connection to the case.The prosecution suspects that the professors allegedly received money from RB Korea in exchange for omitting some of the product’s toxicity test results. In April, the prosecutors traced 250 million won  that was allegedly wired from RB Korea in 2011 to a personal bank account of the SNU professor in charge.The Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office’s special probe team has strengthened its probe by adding five more prosecutors to the original six. “We will henceforth break down the probe into two tracks, inquiring into RB’s responsibility on one hand and the toxicity test manipulation on the other,” a prosecutor from the special probe team was quoted as saying.By Kim Da-sol","benckiser ceo in protesters ,ceo in protesters ,ceo in protesters who ,compensation measures protest organizers ,2009 after battling respiratory","['the United Kingdom', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser ’s', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'Kim Deok - jong', 'Choi Ye - yong', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for Environment and Health']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31327626  0.25601202

Dogs participating in a pet festival held at Gangwon Province run toward their owners on May 10. It was in 1991 that the government first enacted the animal protection law, recognizing animals as those in need of protection and support. While the implementation of the law was relatively meager, it imposed penalties on those who physically abuse animals.The government has gradually toughened the punishment terms, imposing a one-year jail term or 10 million won  fine since 2007. The animal protection law has also allowed authorities to temporarily restrict abusive owners from contacting their pets. In 2013, the government widened the definition of “animal abuse” from “the act of killing animals” to “any act that leads to the animal’s death.” “The change of regulations does not happen in a single day. It takes time and efforts. Although more progress is still needed, the regulations have greatly improved, compared to the first year when the government introduced the animal protection law,” said Park So-yeon, president of civic group Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth. Along with the move to prevent animal abuse, the government initiated the pet dog registration scheme to curb the number of abandoned dogs. The scheme requires pet dog owners to either hang an identification card tag on their pets’ neck or insert a microchip that has the owner’s information. The scheme, which started on a trial basis in 2007, was officially launched across the country in 2014. As of late 2014, about 8.9 million pet dogs were registered, which is estimated to be around half of the total pet dogs in the country, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs’ report last year, To boost welfare in line with the booming pet industry, the ministry launched a special task force in January this year. Comprised of 11 public officials, experts and activists, the team will come up with various measures by October to foster pet-related markets.They include having some 3,200 vet nurses -- the first time this occupation is being introduced in Korea -- and installing more pet funeral facilities. The ministry expects that more facilities will lower the funeral cost.The task force will also draw up clear monitoring criteria for running “pet cafes” -- cafes where visitors can play with pets. Despite the rise of such businesses, there are no specific monitoring rules over the management of pets.Their role will also involve establishing a blood donation system among pets that currently has no regulations, leading to hygiene issues.Along with the central government’s efforts, municipalities are also better protecting animal rights. Seoul Metropolitan Government, for example, released a set of animal welfare measures last year.The city said it will appoint over 10,000 children and 1,000 adults to work as volunteers to monitor and report on animal abuse cases, while offering animal rights classes at schools.The city also said it would raise the number of pet playgrounds to five by 2020. Currently, only two are available in the city, with a new one slated to open early next year.

The economic achievement, for one, has been questioned by many here for allegedly being exaggerated, as often has been the case in past administrations and their sales diplomacy.The event had come amid heightening anticipation toward the promising Iranian market since international economic sanctions were lifted earlier this year from the Middle East country, following its earlier denuclearization deal.President Park Geun-hye talks to the press on her return flight from the Iran state visit on Wednesday. “Through an advanced strategic relationship with Iran, we hope to trigger a second Middle East boom and eventually create new momentum for our nation’s economy,” Park told reporters Tuesday, local time, on the plane back to Seoul from Tehran.“In my meetings with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, I have reconfirmed their strong will to cooperate with Korea in large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as new growth sectors such as medical care and energy.”In his briefing to the press, An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, had said on Monday, “The economic outcome triggered by the bilateral summit and the affiliated deals will amount to $45.6 billion in total,” Cheong Wa Dae had earlier set the figure at $39.1 billion, describing it as a “conservative” estimation, but later explained that the amount could rise higher when reflecting the potential deals to a fuller extent.But among the 30 state-level projects cited as profitable, only six so far carry legal binding force while the rest remain in the initial stage of contracting, mostly memorandums of understanding.Iran’s relatively placid attitude over the economic effects has added to the skepticism.“We should make attempts to achieve developed relations and increase cooperation  and remove the obstacles,” Iran’s official presidential website quoted its president as saying over the summit.While it described the two states’ consensus to boost their trade volume initially to $18 billion and then to $30 billion, the Iranian government mentioned neither the total amount nor the individual order volume based on the signed memorandums. Meanwhile, as Park wrapped up her three-day state visit to Iran -- the first of its kind to take place since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1962 -- the president also underscored the progress made in regard to North Korea.“Iran has traditionally held amicable relations with North Korea,” the president said.“The fact that it has clearly spoken out its stance  is an exceptional and significant move.”Her remarks came amid speculation that the reclusive communist regime may implement a fifth nuclear test on Friday to mark the nationwide congress of its ruling Worker’s Party.With the Iran summit behind her, President Park’s imminent task is to meet with the leadership of leading political parties, as per her earlier pledge.“I will meet with the leadership of the  three parties as soon as possible after my visit to Iran,” the president said late last month in a meeting with the chief editors of local press.The ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which has been suffering a leadership vacuum since its crushing defeat in the April 13 general election, inaugurated journalist-turned-politician Chung Jin-suk as its new floor leader on Tuesday.The Minjoo Party of Korea decided to uphold the current interim leadership of Kim Chong-in until its national convention slated for late August or early September.The second biggest opposition party, the People’s Party, has constituted its leadership, with former Minjoo senior Rep. Park Jie-won as floor leader.By displaying clout over the forthcoming legislature, President Park is hoping to pull up her approval ratings which hit a record-low in late April, in the weeks following the general election.According to local pollster Gallup Korea, Park’s approval ratings stood at 30 percent from April 26-28, bouncing back from a record low of 29 percent in the previous week.By Bae Hyun-jung","to spin iran summit ,political momentum president park ,iran summit into political ,landmark visit to iran ,park to spin iran","['Park Geun', 'Iran', 'Cheong', 'iranian']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3302801   0.2190914

YonhapBoth countries also echoed a need for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and eradicating terrorism from the Middle East.“President Rouhani and I have exchanged meaningful opinions on the common concerns of both countries,” said Park in a joint press conference following the bilateral summit held at Tehran’s Saa’dat abad Palace.The summit was the first since the two countries established diplomatic relations back in 1962.Her visit came some three months after the U.N. lifted its years-long sanctions on Iran in January in recognition of the latter’s consent to a restricted nuclear program.“As for regional issues, I have underlined the importance of Iran’s compliance of the U.N. resolution against North Korea’s nuclear activities,” Park said.The Iranian state leader upheld Park’s statements, placing much focus on regional peace.""It is our basic principle to eliminate all dangerous nuclear weapons both from the Korean Peninsula and the Middle East,” Rouhani said.The two state leaders also pledged cooperation in improving Iran‘s stalled economy and offering business opportunities to South Korean companies.“We will work to restore bilateral trade and investment, so that Iran may soon rebuild its economy and normalize its growth,” Park said.A meeting with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was scheduled later in the day.An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, said that the bilateral trade volume is likely to bounce back to the pre-sanction levels.The South Korea-Iran trade volume, which stood at $17.4 billion in 2011, plummeted by 65 percent to a $6.1 billion as of end-2015.Shoring up the government’s economic achievement were a series of massive infrastructure and energy deals.A notable infrastructure deal was the $5.3 billion provisional contract to lay a 541 kilometer-long inland railroad connecting Esfahan and Ahwaz.Besides the $11.6 billion worth of deals that were signed during the summit, Korea’s state-run and private companies expect to further expand their profits during the coming years.Citing the Iranian government’s five-year development map, which seeks to achieve an annual growth rate of 8 percent by year 2020, South Korea’s Land Ministry and Maritime Ministry offered their partnership in constructing railroads and harbors in Iran.The Land Ministry is also tapping into Iran’s water resources management sector, focusing on dealing with water scarcity in the Middle East state.With an annual precipitation of 300 mm, Iran was designated by the World Resources Institute as the world’s 16th water-stressed nation, leading to forecasts that its water management market size will soar to $4.4 billion won in 2018 from $2.9 billion in 2013.The Iranian president, too, repeatedly quoted water shortage as the country’s top four crises, along with unemployment, inflation, and drug abuse.But the most profitable sector by far is the energy reconstruction business, involving Iran’s rich content in natural energy resources.The country, ranked the world’s single-largest holder of natural gas and the fourth largest of crude oil, has pledged to invest $500 billion in energy development projects by year 2025.“Adding to its unrivaled amount of undeveloped resources, Iran is also marked for its distribution-optimized location, nestled in between Central Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe,” said An.The largest orders so far in the energy sector are the $10 billion worth Bahman oil refinery project and the $1.5 billion Iran-Oman submerged gas transportation pipeline construction, according to the senior Cheong Wa Dae official.By Bae Hyun-jung, Korea Herald correspondent","45 billion the highest ,korean president park geun ,energy worth 45 billion ,the largest ever econom ,6b business deals tehran","['TEHRAN', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'iranian', 'Hassan Rouhani']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.14654754  0.74304026

173,173,173,[Reporter’s column] Before thanking Sister Marianne,"Last week, a number of South Korean newspapers published articles featuring the visit of Sister Marianne Stoger, an Austrian nun who spent more than 40 years caring for Korean patients with Hansen’s disease in the nation’s remote island of Sorokdo from the 1960s to the mid-2000s.She had left Sorokdo and returned to Austria back in 2005 in secret, just leaving a hand-written letter to the staff and her patients.

Featuring her first visit to the island in 10 years, many papers here described Stoger as an “angel,” for, among other things, “touching the patients with bare hands even when their body fluids sprayed on her face.” On top of the reports, Health Minister Chung Chin-youb also publicly expressed gratitude for her work on behalf of the Korean government, in a meeting with Stoger on the island last week. Health Minister Chung Chin-youb shakes hands with Sister Marianne Stoger during their meeting in Sorokdo Island last week. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Sorokdo National Hospital, the national medical facility which was established as a leprosarium by the Japanese during colonial rule, but little is being written about the human rights abuse committed by medical staff at the institution. While there is no question that Stoger and her devotion deserve respect and acknowledgment, the reportage were seen to omit one glaring fact, that she was there when patients on the island were being forced to undergo abortions and sterilizations until the 1990s.While Health Minister Chung thanked Stoger in public, the event also brought back the issue of the South Korean government’s lack of apology to the Hansen’s disease patients who suffered abuse while staying at state-run medical facilities on the island. As of last year, some 560 people with Hansen’s disease -- also known as leprosy -- won a total of five compensation suits against the government for forced abortions and sterilizations that took place decades ago. The cases are, however, still ongoing as the government has appealed to the nation’s Supreme Court, claiming some patients “may have chosen to undergo the procedures on their own.” According to the ruling last year by the Seoul Central District Court, abortion and sterilization procedures were performed without patients’ consent in the 1960s. In 1945, 84 leprosy patients were slaughtered by hospital staff and security officers over a dispute on food and medicine, according to a 2006 report by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Although South Korea abolished its anti-leprosy segregation policy in 1963, male patients were required until the 1990s to undergo vasectomies if they wanted to live with their spouses in the facility. All pregnant female patients were asked to leave the hospital. Those who wanted to stay had no option but to abort the child. “As many  patients had no social networks or financial means to live outside the facility, they were practically forced to undergo abortion,” the ruling said. The ruling also pointed out that Hansen’s disease patients were systemically segregated until the 1970s, even after the anti-leprosy segregation policy was dropped in 1963. Hansen’s disease, a long-term, disabling bacterial infection which can cause disfiguring skin sores and nerve damage, is neither highly contagious nor fatal. According to the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S., the disease can be easily treated, especially with early diagnosis. Back in 1954, South Korea in fact included the disease under “Group 3 Infectious Diseases” in its Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, classifying it under a group of diseases that may “prevail intermittently” and does not have a high risk of mass breakout. Other diseases included in the same group include influenza and malaria. The government has known since the 1950s that the patients did not need to be isolated the way they had been. Knowing this, it is disturbing to read news reports that describe Stoger, who was also a certified nurse, as an “angel” for touching the patients with her bare hands. As proven by the WHO and the CDC, the disease is not highly contagious and therefore it is not out of the ordinary for a health care professional to touch patients with the particular disease. If the government had offered education and accurate information about the disease, more health care workers at the facility would have done the same. Such reports that praise Stoger as an angel perpetuate discrimination and prejudice against the patients, as they are based on the notion that their body fluids are dangerous. All patients have the right to be treated, regardless of the disease they have. The Korean government must acknowledge the patients’ rights, and apologize to those who suffered. This should have come before the minister’s expression of gratitude to Stoger and her work.

The 236 companies range from top conglomerates such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor to small and medium-sized enterprises.“We hope to pull up the Korea-Iran trade volume from the current $6.1 billion back to the pre-sanction level of $17.4 billion and more,” said An Chong-bum, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs.“This time, we could also diversify the fields of cooperation to medical, information technology and culture, stepping beyond the conventional construction-focused manufacturing sectors.”Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, too, encouraged the hopeful expectations by alluding to a high yield deal.“There is a possibility that  will win an order worth $10 billion or more during the presidential visit,” the minister told reporters early last week.“ appreciates the fact that many Korean companies chose to stay in Iran during the western world’s sanction period and we expect such positive sentiment to take shape in the form of economic cooperation.”In a move to enhance such bilateral exchanges, the Foreign Ministry signed an agreement with the Iranian traffic and policy agency earlier this week to allow their citizens to drive in both countries with a license obtained in either country.While Seoul remained upbeat over its anticipated partnership with Iran, some warned of the challenges, one of which is fierce competition with other aspiring investor countries.In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping headed to Iran, marking the first state visit there following the lifting of sanctions. Also, the Korea Customs Service data showed that the nation’s exports to Iran in the first quarter of the year stood at $660 million, down 44.7 percent on-year.By Bae Hyun-jung","park visit to iran ,historic visit to iran ,improve the diplomatic economic ,bilateral ties president park ,iranian market following the","['Park Geun - hye', 'Iran', 'south korean', 'iranian']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.52842081  0.54027253

Hanyang University said its study led by president Lee Young-moo on hydrocarbon fuel-cell membranes with surface nanocrack coatings was published in the latest issue of Nature. The study featured an innovative way to provide fuel cells, which are essential for hydrogen-fueled cars.Hanyang University president Lee Young-moo announces the results of his research at the college in Seoul on Thursday. The membrane is considered a core part of the hydrogen fuel cell that generates electricity through electrochemical reactions. So far, the membrane for hydrogen fuel cells have been made of fluorine-related materials. This has posed challenges as it involves significant cost and is not durable in temperatures of over 100 degrees Celsius. The Hanyang research team succeeded in making polymeric membranes through hydrocarbon. Water content in hydrocarbon polymer membranes is controlled through nanocracks in a hydrophobic surface coating. This not only allows the fuel cell to generate electricity in temperatures of over 120 degrees Celsius or in humidity of under 35 percent, but is also much cheaper, the school said.“The development of hydrogen fuel cells is urgent as a renewable energy alternative. The new technology will hopefully allow the common use of hydrogen energy-driven fuel cells,” the energy engineering expert said. Lee, inaugurated last year, is a leading expert in membrane study. Having obtained about 120 patents in the field, he has released more than 360 articles here and abroad, with two published in Science.The president has also served as one of editors of the Journal of Membrane published by Elsevier since 2004.By Lee Hyun-jeong","school officials said thursday ,weekly journal of science ,science nature school officials ,local college president ,in nature journal research","['Hanyang University', 'Lee Young - moo', 'Natur']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26212686  0.35181201

The sterilizers in question began reaching the local market in 2001.Two other former Oxy officials, including a head researcher, were also called in by the prosecutors to face questioning over the toxic chemicals.The prosecution alleges that the two chemicals used in the products -- PHMG Phosphate and PGH -- were responsible for severe illnesses and deaths. Two other chemicals used were PHMG hydrochloride and MIT/CMIT, which the prosecution found not as harmful as the other two.Companies that made and sold the sterilizers in question include market leader in sales of the disinfectant Oxy along with Lotte Mart and Homeplus, two of South Korea's largest retailers.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving consumer products using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems for unknown reasons in 2011.","by seoul prosecutors tuesday ,seoul prosecutors tuesday ,prosecutors tuesday to face ,seoul prosecutors tuesday to ,sterilizer probe former chief","['south korean', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Seoul', 'british']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.1488736   0.36355847

Prior to his arrival, he had been living alone with his maternal grandfather in China’s Fushun, Liaoning province, as his mother had moved to Korea by herself upon her marriage to a South Korean national.“My biological father died about five months after I was born,” the 22-year-old said in an interview with...","When Kim Eun-hyung arrived in South Korea from China in 2008, at age 14, he didn’t speak a word of Korean. Prior to his arrival, he had been living alone with his maternal grandfather in China’s Fushun, Liaoning province, as his mother had moved to Korea by herself upon her marriage to a South Korean national.“My biological father died about five months after I was born,” the 22-year-old said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “My mother and I moved a lot while living in China. As a result I couldn’t make a lot of friends. There’s not much to miss about China.”Yet his new life in Korea as a teenager wasn’t so easy, either. His Korean stepfather rarely spoke to him at home, treating him as if “he didn’t exist.” At school, it was difficult for him to follow classes that were entirely in Korean. He was often bullied by his classmates, who used anti-Chinese slurs against him. “For the first few months, I just slept through all of my classes,” Kim said.Overseas studies have shown that the immigration experience can have a profound impact on the social and emotional development of children, especially those separated from their families or facing an uncertain future. Kim, who now works as a bilingual retail worker at a department store in central Seoul, is one of many foreign-born immigrants born to non-South Koreans overseas who moved to Korea as children. From 2012-2014 alone, some 40,000 such children, including young North Korean defectors, arrived in Korea with their parents.A recent government study showed that a significant number of them are struggling here, especially with job searching, education and family problems. As of last year, more than 30 percent of such children aged 15-24 are not in school and out of work, while 58.3 percent experienced their biological parents’ divorce in their countries of origin before moving to Korea. Many of the children migrate to Korea after their mothers remarry. As of last year, more than 85 percent of all marriage migrants in Korea were women. The struggles are similar for young North Korean defectors, who not only face difficulties adjusting, but also social and political prejudices. Identity politics Even with her university degree in Chinese language, finding a job in Seoul was a challenge for Lee Min-jin, who arrived in Korea as a teenage North Korean defector. The 25-year-old lived in China with her mother from 1997 until her arrival in South Korea in 2009. Throughout their years in China as illegal residents, her mother had two live-in relationships with Chinese men. Both times, Lee considered them to be stepfathers. Her biological father, whom Lee and her mother briefly lived with in China, was repatriated to North Korea and died there in 2004.In spite of financial difficulties and her illegal status, Lee managed to master the Chinese language while living in China, which eventually enabled her to enroll in a prestigious university in Seoul known for its foreign language education. Still, Lee struggled to find part-time or full-time jobs during and after her university years, mainly because of her North Korean accent, she said. “Once, I called to inquire about this part-time job position,” she said. “As soon as I talked, the person who picked up the phone cut me off and just said, ‘we don’t hire foreigners.’ She hung up even before I could finish my sentence.”During her years in South Korea, she constantly struggled with her sense of identity. “In China, I think I was accepted as a Chinese person,” she said. “I spoke Chinese fluently and didn’t have a foreign accent. People assumed that I was one of the locals. But in South Korea, I’d constantly be asked where I was from, because I speak Korean with an accent and I don’t know how to get rid of it. And many times it didn’t feel safe to say I was from North Korea, as I knew it would only bring disadvantages in my life.”Lee, who now works as a Chinese interpreter at a cosmetic surgery clinic in Seoul, thought about moving back to China after being rejected a number of times by different clinics.  Lee said she is still careful when people ask her country of origin. “Unless I’m in a situation where I have to tell that I’m from North Korea, such as job interviews, I decide first whether or not I can trust this person,” she said. “To those whom I trust, I tell them honestly that I’m a North Korean defector. To those I don’t trust, I tell them I’ve lived in China for a long time.”As of last year, there are nearly 30,000 North Korean defectors living in the South and their average income is only two-thirds the national average. Seven out of 10 defectors are women and 58.4 percent of young defectors said in a 2014 survey that they do not wish to identify where they are from.Intergenerational cultural dissonanceSabahat Moon Javaid was 8 years old when he moved to South Korea with his family from Pakistan. His father brought his family here as he wanted to study Christian theology at a Korean institution. The 24-year-old recently applied for South Korean citizenship and plans to live here, though his father wishes to return to Pakistan.“I have all of my memories in Korea,” he said. “Although I was born in Pakistan, I wouldn’t know what I would do once I return.”Javaid said while he and his older sister enjoyed South Korean culture while growing up, his father would often get upset about them not keeping their Pakistani traditions and customs. “For example, my father would be upset about the length of my sister’s skirt, saying it’s inappropriately short. But really, most  people wouldn’t consider that skirt to be short,” he said. “There were many instances like that. And I’d tell him, if you are this unhappy about us following Korean ways of living, then why are we here? Why did you bring us here in the first place?”Shin Kuk-kyun, the chief of advocacy team of the Migrant Youth Foundation of Korea, said foreign-born immigrant children face unique challenges that are different from “multicultural children,” who are Korean-born children born to a Korean national and his or her foreign-born spouse. “There is so much loss involved in moving from one country to the next,” he said. “And this can be traumatic for both children and their parents. At the same time, the process of assimilation can be stressful for children as well as their parents. And most immigrant children move to another country because they have no option but to follow their parents’ decisions.”Increasing demand for support Overseas studies have shown that the immigrant experience can have a profound impact on the social and emotional development of children, especially those separated from their families or facing an uncertain future. According to a 2013 report by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, adjusting to a new home, language and culture can be difficult, and these changes can make children immigrants face difficulties talking about their feelings, misbehave, do poorly in school or have trouble fitting in and making friends.According to Shin from the MYF, the number of immigrant children who have requested mental health support from his institution has been increasing over the last few years. In 2015 alone, the MYF financed psychiatric and counselling treatments for 750 schoolchildren, with the support of Hyundai Motors. One of the students was a child of North Korean defectors. He had a turbulent relationship with his abusive father and was doing poorly in school. Another was living with his Chinese-born mother and his alcoholic Korean stepfather.  “I think having a stepparent who doesn’t speak your language can be stressful for many kids, especially if the parent does not make a lot of efforts to create a welcoming environment for the child, or learn about the child’s native language or culture,” said Kim Joong-hoon, another official at the MYF. “Also, when a parent is stressed as he or she struggles to adjust in a new country, the stress can affect their children. I think immigrant parents should be given educational classes on the unique challenges their children may face as young migrants.”Citizenship issue Lack of access to social resources while waiting for South Korean citizenship can also be difficult for many immigrant children. According to the Justice Ministry, it takes at least two years for children born to non-Korean citizens overseas to obtain their citizenship after arriving in the country. In order to do so, the child needs to be legally adopted by his or her Korean stepparent. For a child who does not have a South Korean stepparent, obtaining South Korean citizenship is not impossible, but it could take years. Kim Eun-hyung, who became a naturalized South Korean citizen about six months ago, said he was once rejected from a state-run job training program for multicultural teenagers because he was still waiting for his citizenship to be granted.  “Such programs should be given to all foreign-born immigrant children regardless of their citizenship status,” he said. “Two years is a long time for a teenager. They can’t just wait until they get the citizenship while missing out on all the opportunities.”When asked about how the government can do better to support young North Korean defectors, Lee Min-jin said there should be free voice coaching classes for them so they can get rid of their North Korean accent. “I still get questions and  comments about my accent,” she said. But another young North Korean defector, Jeong Eun-seon, said what should be changed is public perception, not their accent. “What we need is a society where people don’t get discriminated against because of certain accents, not voice coaching classes,” she said. “There are many regional accents in Korean. The North Korean accent should be considered just like any other regional accent here, such as the ones of Chungcheong or Gyeongsang provinces.”By Claire Lee Names of the interviewed migrants have been changed upon request --Ed.","maternal grandfather in china ,father died about five ,korean national my biological ,my biological father died ,marriage to south korean","['Kim Eun - hyung', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Korean', 'China', 'Fushun', 'Liaoning province', 'Korea', 'south korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.61375296  0.28411621

""There is broad bipartisan support in the U.S. for our efforts to press North Korea to improve its deplorable human rights record.""The communist regime has been accused of public executions, torture, and holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps, but Pyongyang rejects them all as a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.   The human rights violations have drawn renewed international attention in recent years since the U.N.

Wood had been living in Korea for four years prior to having her child here. But even to this day, her daughter cannot be legally recognized as a disabled person in the country because she is not a South Korean national. 123rfWithout recognition of her daughter’s status, Wood and her husband -- who is also a British national -- cannot get a parking permit, even though their child, now 6, is a wheelchair user. They cannot get government subsidies on essential assistive technologies such as Ankle Foot Orthoses, which are special shoes for children with cerebral palsy that cost about 500,000 won . The shoes need to be replaced every year. “It was so difficult for her to become certified as needing special education, since she is not ‘disabled,’” Wood told The Korea Herald. “We constantly have to fill out huge complicated forms in Korean, for which we need translation services. Really, it is very difficult for us.”Wood is one of presumably many foreign expat parents who cannot have their children legally recognized as a disabled person here. The Welfare Ministry currently has no statistics on disabled children born to foreign-born, non-Korean parents in South Korea.According to Yang Jong-su, an official from the Welfare Ministry’s Division of Policy for Persons with Disabilities, South Korea currently does not grant disabled status to F-3 visa holders, who are non-Koreans accompanying spouses or children of foreign-born residents  here. Only overseas Koreans , marriage immigrants  and permanent residents  are eligible to apply for disabled status and government benefits in Korea according to current laws, he added. Human rights experts said the current legislation goes against the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which South Korea signed onto in 1990. Its Article 23 states that state parties must recognize that “a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life, in conditions which ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate the child’s active participation in the community.”“I have to look into the situation more thoroughly in order to comment, but if children of F-2 visa holders are being denied from medical benefits, I’d say the current legislations are discriminatory,” said human rights lawyer Kim Jong-chul. Wood, who had been living in Korea as a temporary work visa  holder prior to her daughter’s diagnosis, only decided to obtain her F-2 visa in order to get her daughter recognized as a person with disability. But upon obtaining her F-2 visa after studying for months to pass the required Korean language proficiency test, she was told she still could not register her daughter as disabled. “I was rejected again, because she was only a dependent of a resident , and not technically a resident in her own right,” she said. “A child cannot apply for residency.”Currently, the only way for Wood to receive government aid for her child is to obtain an F-5 visa, which is permanent residency. “But this will be at the discretion of immigration,” she said. “The criteria for this visa revolves around how the applicant  give benefit to Korea. Therefore, the family of a disabled child is unlikely to be granted this visa.”Official Yang from the Health Ministry said the experience of Wood and her daughter is not a “common case” in South Korea. “I will have to research the current legislation in order to comment on the matter,” he said, when asked if he thinks the current practice goes against the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Kim argued that he had complied with the court ruling with his “brand new” restaurant name.Louis Vuitton sued Kim again and the court ordered Kim to pay the French company 14.5 million won for the 29 days that the “new” name was displayed.“Although he changed the name with different spelling and spacing, the previous one and the new one sound almost the same,” the court said.

The Database Center for North Korean Human Rights unveiled its findings after analyzing 52,735 cases included in its archive according to nine areas specified in the U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, seeking to find any development over the two years following the completion of the panel’s activities in 2012. The Database Center for North Korean Human Rights holds a press conference in Seoul on Monday. The organization has concluded that the Kim Jong-un regime had further contravened its people’s rights to life and carried out torture, inhumane treatment and public and clandestine executions, despite some signs of progress in such areas as food distribution and imprisonment.  The analyzed cases include: violations of the right to food; violations associated with prison camps; torture and inhuman treatment; arbitrary detention; discrimination; violations of freedom of expression; violations of the right to life; violations of the right to movement; and enforced disappearances including the abductions of foreign nationals. In total, more than 25,000, or 48.2 percent, of cases constituted arbitrary detention, followed by violations of the right to free movement with 13.7 percent and violations of the right to life with 11.5 percent. Between 2013 and 2014, violations of the right to life accounted for 22.1 percent, or 87 out of 394 cases, up 7.3 percentage points from the previous two years. Almost 18 percent marked violations of the right to movement over the same period, compared with 11.4 percent in 2011-12. “The shares have substantially increased for the rights to life and movement and enforced disappearances, while the Kim regime continues to commit mass executions of core elites by firing squad and their vanishings,” the analysis said.“The U.N. report and human rights regime has failed to significantly contribute to reducing such cases.” Amnesty International, a London-based rights watchdog, estimates that up to 200,000 people are locked in six sprawling prison camps across the communist country. The bulk of the inmates were incarcerated for minor political offenses, including singing and watching soap operas from South Korea, according to Seoul’s National Human Rights Commission and North Korean defectors here. The launch of the COI has been deemed a milestone in international discourse on North Korea human rights issues. The panel unveiled a comprehensive report in February 2013 detailing “systematic, widespread and gross” rights breaches there.Pyongyang has rebuffed accusations of its rights abuses, calling it an attempt to topple its system.By Shin Hyon-hee","have barely improved seoul ,unabated torture public executions ,barely improved seoul based ,barely improved seoul ,political oppression the database","['U.N.', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'the Database Center', 'the U.N.

Throughout the event, Park made little or no hint of her reaction to what is perceived as one of the biggest blows in her 18-years in politics and three years in the presidential office. The ruling Saenuri Party lost the majority and No. 1 party status in the incoming 20th parliamentary in Wednesday’s election, losing out to the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea by one seat after losing most of the metropolitan seats.Park had expressed her support for the party, such as by wearing red, the official color of the Saenuri Party, while casting her vote and making a number of regional visits ahead of the election. Local media and observers alike dubbed the latest election as a judgement of Park’s administration, which was generally criticized for being centralistic and authoritative.Sources said Park is most likely to officially relay her message regarding politics during a meeting of senior secretaries on Monday. The president is most likely to emphasize the need to charge through with her four major reforms in the labor, public, education and finance sectors regardless of the election results and ask for pan-partisan legislative support.“There is no specific plan on  message related to the election. Improving the fundamentals of the  through structural reform and creating jobs remain the prioritized administrative task,” a Cheong Wa Dae official said on customary condition of anonymity.The ruling camp now needs closer cooperation and comprise with the opposition that has seized the majority status in passing through deadlocked bills. The party had attempted to revise a National Assembly law that restricted legislative authority of the majority party in the outgoing Assembly. The Saenuri Party is now placed in the opposite position with regard to the envisioned revision, as the party would require wider leeway against the majority forces in endorsing their initiatives.Park’s approval ratings, meanwhile, dropped to 39 percent in the second week of April, according to pollster Gallup Korea. The ratings had recovered to above 40 percent after her U.S. and Mexico tours in the first week. Respondents critical of Park, on the other hand, surged by 2 percentage points to 48 percent.","since election debacle business ,first appearance since election ,norwegian prime minister erna ,geun hye on friday ,appearance since election debacle","['Park Geun - hye', 'Saenuri Party', 'norwegian', 'Erna Solberg', 'Park']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43922451  0.35569996

Ahn Cheol-soo reacts after winning in a Seoul district in the April 13 general election. The fledgling centrist minority People’s Party, founded in February mainly by main opposition defectors, claimed 38 parliamentary seats in total, 25 from regional districts and another 13 through party approval ballots.It thus crossed the 20-seat minimum required to gain a say in the National Assembly as well as its hopeful target of 35, surprising many pessimists.As neither of the two leading parties -- the ruling conservative Saenuri Party and main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea -- managed to win a parliamentary majority, it is the novice party that will hold a tie-breaking vote in the incoming legislature.Such success seemed to justify Ahn’s much-disputed decision earlier to defect from the Minjoo Party and set up a new party of his own, bearing the blame for further splitting the opposition ahead of the election.While steering his party during campaigning season, he also saved face by winning a consecutive term in his current Nowon-C constituency in northeastern Seoul.This double feat is likely to expand the political leverage for the minor opposition party, as well as for the Gwangju-Jeolla region in which it scored a sweeping victory.But it also means the party, especially leader Ahn Cheol-soo, will be facing increasing pressure to clarify its yet ambiguous policy disposition.Considering itself a balancing weight between the top two parties, the People’s Party has been fielding a “centrist” platform, calling for a conservative view on national security issues and progressive approach on economic ones.But so far, its detailed policies and statements have failed to differentiate themselves from those of conventional parties.For instance, the party has listed the fair growth principle at the top of its platform, but the idea has often been criticized of resembling the economic democratization fielded by the Minjoo Party chief Kim Chong-in.It also pledged zero-tolerance upon increasing North Korean threats and a resumption of six-party talks while arguing for the suspended inter-Korean industrial park to reopen, all of which sounded like a mishmash of positions held by the mainstream parties.Another major obstacle for Ahn in the upcoming months is his disparity with the rest of the leadership members, most of whom are former ranking Minjoo Party figures based in the Gwangju-Jeolla areas, dubbed the “Honam” region.When defecting from the Minjoo Party, Ahn swept along a number of Honam celebrities, rallying support from the region that has been showing signs of withdrawing its longtime support for the main opposition.But being born in Busan and having lived in the capital area all along, the party initiator had little personal connection to the region.It was for such reasons that he brought in Rep. Chung Jung-bae, a former justice minister and powerful figure in Gwangju, as the party’s cochief.During the campaigning season, the two strategically divided their roles, allocating Honam to Chun and the symbolic metropolitan belt to Ahn.Their partnership seems to have worked, going by the election results, but the two had earlier feuded over a possible reunion with the main opposition cluster.Ex-Minjoo figures, including Chun and Kim Han-gil, were inclined toward the idea, while Ahn sternly refused to merge for the sake of election interests.By Bae Hyun-jung","technology mogul turned politician ,his party surprising achieveme ,mogul turned politician at ,since stepping into politics ,mogul turned politician",['Ahn Cheol'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70976233  0.46823245

Their love had angered the heavenly king, as Jiknyeo, whose job was to weave clothes, and Gyeonwu, a cowherd, only wanted to spend time with each other and neglected their duties. “But of course, they were allowed to reunite once a year,” the 28-year-old office worker said. “A flock of magpies would generously form a bridge for them to cross the Milky Way. The reuniting scene still remains one of my all-time favorite scenes.”A Korean Jindo dog, a breed of hunting dog known for its bravery and loyalty. The legendary dog Baekgu was also a Jindo dog. “Gyeonwu and Jikneyo” is just one of many Korean folktales that feature the compassion and benevolence of animals. According to scholar Lee In-jae’s master’s thesis published this year, titled “A Study on the Animal Characters of Korean Traditional Fairy Tales,” 32.5 percent of some 400 Korean folk tales feature animal characters that play important roles in the narratives. Very often animals appear as kind, altruistic beings that help protagonists when they are in danger or difficult situations. “When we study traditional folklore, we can learn that Koreans had a very special relationship with the animals in their lives,” said Cheon Jin-gi, the director of the National Folk Museum of Korea. “Many believed tigers were the gods of mountains. Magpies were believed to bring good news. Turtles represented good fortune and fecundity. In folklore, they are often portrayed as good spirits in animal form, who help those who face injustice committed by fellow human beings.”One example is “Kongji and Patzzi,” a Korean folklore version of Cinderella. Kongji loses both her parents and lives with her stepmother and stepsister Patzzi. Whenever she is faced with impossible tasks, kind animals help her. “Such stories were partly written to encourage readers to be kind to one another,” wrote scholar Lee in his thesis, which was submitted to the Busan National University of Education. “Animal characters were often portrayed as role models for human beings to follow.”Cheon said Koreans paid close attention to animals and their characteristics. “For example, Koreans noticed that magpies start to lose their feathers in July,” he said. “That’s how they started imagining that magpies must be losing feathers because they are forming bridges for the star-crossed lovers.”In Korea, Magpies are traditionally believed to bring good news. Some of the most touching Korean folk stories involve dogs. During Korea’s Silla Dynasty , there was an old man named Kim Gae-in living in present-day Imsil, North Jeolla Province. He lived alone with his dog, whom he adored. One day, he visited a nearby town and drank a lot with friends. On his way home, he passed out on some grass. While he was unconscious, his dog noticed that a bushfire had started nearby. The dog could not wake his owner up, and so it soaked itself in water from a nearby stream and extinguished the fire with its wet body. The dog died of burns, but saved Kim’s life. When Kim woke up, he realized what his dog had done for him and cried bitterly. He buried the animal in a nearby sunny place, and stuck his walking staff in front of the grave. The wooden staff eventually turned into a large tree after a few years, which later inspired villagers to name the region Osu, meaning a dog and a tree. “I think Koreans shared much more space and time with animals in the old days,” said director Cheon. “They were more respectful of nature in general.”In modern times, there is the true story of Baekgu, the legendary dog who traveled 300 kilometers to return to his first owner on Jindo Island, South Jeolla Province. Baekgu, who was born in 1989 on Jindo Island, had been given away to someone else who lived in Daejeon in 1993. Yet the dog missed its initial owner too much and ran away, traveling for seven months by itself across Daejeon, Busan, Goseong and Haenam to finally reach Jindo Island. Baekgu lived happily with its initial owner until 2000, dying at the age of 12. Its owner, Park Bok-dan, died in 2010 at age 94. The touching story of Baekgu has been made into a number of children’s novels, as well as an animated film. In Jindo, there is a statue of Baekgu set up in 2009 to commemorate the dog’s bravery and loyalty. Animals continue to play a big part in the daily lives of modern Koreans, appearing even in pop culture. For example, public broadcaster SBS’ reality show “Animal Farm,” which features pet owners and their special bonds with their animals, has been popular since 2001. Some of its episodes feature dogs with behavioral problems who improve after therapy sessions with their owners. Other TV shows, such as JTBC’s “Marie and I,” and Channel A’s “A Man who Feeds his Dog” also feature celebrities and other individuals who spend time with animals. “Human beings show their real qualities when they are interacting with vulnerable and helpless animals,” said Lee Deok-geon, the director of “Animal Farm.” “A kind person’s good nature really gets exposed . And it’s the same for those with unkind nature.” Director Cheon said some Koreans still perform spiritual rites for animals. For example, Geumgang-sa, a Buddhist temple in Geojedo Island, South Gyeongsang Province, performs special religious ceremonies for spirits of dead animals who were killed by road accidents. “We Buddhists believe in reincarnation,” said Ven. Seongwon, who heads the temple. “The ceremonies are to help the souls of the animals acknowledge their death and give blessings for their next lives.”This is the second installment in a series of articles that look at South Korea’s pet culture and industry – Ed.By Claire Lee","child her favorite ,compassion altruism in korean ,mother read her gyeonwu ,their love had angered ,was child her favorite","['Kim Eun - ji', 'korean', 'Jiknyeo', 'Gyeonwu']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28716695  0.43792287

But the result was different. While the vocal young demographic showed their support for the liberal candidate, it was conservative Park who won.YonhapIn February this year, social media was filled with messages showing avid support for the opposition parties’ record-breaking filibuster against the government-led antiterrorism bills. Based on the number of likes, responses and shared stories encouraging the move, the opposition appeared to have won the war, although it lost the legislative battle against the majority Saenuri Party. The actual approval ratings released during the same time period, however, indicated otherwise, as more eligible voters continued to support the Saenuri Party.The party’s relatively conservative chief Kim Chong-in seemed aware of such phenomenon, as he reportedly urged the party members to end the 192-hour-long filibuster, saying, “Some party members believe that the more noise the social media makes, the more impact it would have on the political landscape. It just shows how unorganized our party is.”Such incidences show that public opinion expressed online does not accurately gauge the actual and overall electoral outcome.During the 2014 by-elections held in June, the Saenuri Party defeated the opposition even though various social media platforms were filled with comments denouncing the ruling party and the government’s handling of the Sewol ferry disaster just three months prior. “Social media’s role is limited to helping unite those who have already decided who they will support,” said Jun Kye-Wan, a political analyst at Korea’s Knowledge Center. “The platform is unlikely to hold sway over independents and undecided moderates,” Jun said. Lee Sae-hee, a researcher from Korea University, said in his research paper that social media is an “isolated” platform for like-minded groups because it grants much more access to young liberal voters than old conservative ones. According to statistics from his thesis titled “Comparative Analysis of Conventional and New Media’s Political Implication,” conservative voters were more exposed to conventional media such as newspaper and TV networks than social networks. Yet the use of social media on the campaign trail appeared to be popular among the candidates. Whether they were conservative candidates or liberal ones, the politicians filled their individual websites and Facebook accounts with comments and videos publicizing their political agendas and credentials. Some of them relied on text messages or closed methods of social networking services provided by firms such as Kakao Talk, a free messenger service provided by Daum Corp., or Naver Band, a social networking service from Naver Corp. “Compared to a platform that is more open to the public, closed platforms such as Naver Band and Kakao Talk are more likely to sway voters because they carry information between friends who trust one another,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a professor of cultural studies of Kyunghee University.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, but the spokesman's office said that no such meeting has been fixed.Ri last visited New York in September for the U.N. General Assembly.The trip could provide opportunities for Ri to hold talks with U.S. officials, though such chances are low considering the international community's ongoing efforts to increase pressure on Pyongyang.Seoul's Foreign Ministry refused to comment on Ri's reported plan to visit New York, saying that it is ""not in a position"" to discuss the issue.Experts raised the possibility that through Ri's visit to the U.N., the reclusive state may seek to create momentum for dialogue with the United States and find a way out of its deepening isolation and stringent international sanctions.""Wouldn't Ri's planned visit to the U.S. be a signal for dialogue?"" said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University. ""By raising the issue of dialogue, the North could move to turn the situation -- currently focusing on sanctions -- into one that is favorable for dialogue so as to cause a crack in the international cooperation over applying sanctions on the North,"" he added.A source familiar with North Korean affairs pointed out that after all, Ri's visit might be intended to show to the international community that the North is still faring well despite international sanctions and isolation.","new york next week ,next week for signing ,signing ceremony on april ,york next week for ,signing of climate deal","['north korean', 'Ri Su - yong', 'New York', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'U.N.', 'Paris Agreement', 'U.N.']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27266273  0.37986895

The organizers expect 90 percent will be sold, generating 174 billion won in revenue. The POCOG said that 70 percent of the tickets will be sold in South Korea.""We have been working on ticket prices since October 2014,"" the POCOG Secretary General Yeo Hyung-koo said in a press conference.""We have discussed with each federation and our government before receiving final approval from the International Olympic Committee .""The POCOG said ticket prices for its 15 disciplines will range from 20,000 won to 900,000 won. It added that half of the tickets are 80,000 won or less and the average price of tickets will be140,000 won, which is almost the same as the average ticket price for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games.The price of tickets to the opening and closing ceremonies will range from 220,000 won to 1.5 million won, which is similar to the Vancouver Games but less than the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games.Tickets for figure skating events will range from 150,000 won to 800,000 won.

""There have been many inquiries from North America about ice hockey tickets, and we see no problem with selling them.""Eom said that the organizers have set the ticket price after analyzing market surveys from eight countries. They decided to have cheap ticket prices for sports that are relatively unpopular in South Korea, such as biathlon and luge, in a bid to draw more local fans.Local war veterans and disabled people will receive 50 percent discounts, but Eom said that the organizers are not planning to give special discounts to others and there will be no free tickets because that is against the IOC policy. The organizers said that tickets will be sold on the POCOG's official website starting in October. Those in South Korea can go to the POCOG's official website and people overseas can purchase their tickets through an authorized ticket reseller  in their country.The PyeongChang organizers said that the ticket prices for the Paralympic Winter Games will be announced early next year.

Back then, in a rally focusing on youth rights in Seoul, she held a banner which she thought was both deeply personal and political. It said: “I’m not a virgin .”“Yes, it was a political statement,” she said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “When you live in a country where you can be punished at school for dating a fellow student, where you need to be 19 or older to get information about birth control online, nothing can be more political than what I said that day.”Activist Kang Min-jin poses with a banner that says “I‘m not a virgin” during a youth rights rally in central Seoul back in 2012. She was 17 at the time. Now 20, Kang is a college student and a member of an advocacy group that fights for teenagers’ rights, including their rights to birth control, privacy and quality sex education in South Korea. She and her colleagues also fight for teenagers’ rights not to be physically punished at school as well as to be able to dress freely, and actively -- and safely -- engage in sexual and romantic relationships as minors. As of 2014, only 39 percent of sexually active South Korean teenagers used birth control, while 66.1 percent of all teenagers who became pregnant had abortions. The nation’s sex education, which often discourages students from dating but does not provide enough information on birth control, is highlighted as one of the main reasons behind such statistics. “Korean teenagers are often seen as property belonging to their parents,” she said. “We want teenagers to be acknowledged as independent beings who can make their own decisions about their lives, their bodies and their relationships.” No-dating rule for students According to Kang’s organization, the Group for Youth Sexuality Rights, almost half of all Korean high schools nationwide have a policy that bans dating in school. At the same time, a lot of schools -- many in provincial areas -- separate boys and girls by placing them in different buildings or classes. Some of them even have different mealtimes so they will not run into each other during lunch breaks. They also ban students from dying their hair, wearing earrings as well as altering the hemline of school uniform skirts, according to the organization.“One of the students who reported her case to us said she and her boyfriend, a fellow student, were kicked out of her dorm after she was caught holding hands with him on a surveillance camera,” Kang said. Despite these measures, South Korean schoolchildren still date. According to research by the state-run Aha Sexuality Education and Counseling Center for Youth, about 60 percent of all South Korean teenagers have dated at least once from 2004-2013. As of 2014, 5.3 percent of all South Korean schoolchildren have had sex. While it is legal for minors aged 19 or under to purchase birth control, one needs to be 19 or older in South Korea to have full access to information regarding contraception such as condoms on the search engine Naver. “Developing romantic feelings for someone as a teenager is just a natural part of growing up,” said Park Hyun-ee from the ASECCY. “Instead of banning dating, it is necessary to educate them on what to expect and how to protect themselves when they engage in sexual relationships. They should be also educated on the responsibilities they have for their romantic partners as well as consequences of unprotected sex.”South Korea’s Gender Ministry last year made a controversial decision to ban teenagers from buying “specialized condoms,” such as those with studs. Naver banned those aged 19 or under from viewing the complete search results for the word “condoms” as the term inevitably collects information on such types of condoms as well. While there is no medical proof that such condoms can damage the health of minors, Kim Sung-byuk, a Gender Ministry official who oversees youth policies, said the products may trigger “abnormal and unhealthy views” on sex among schoolchildren. “As we have said many times before, all teenagers are allowed to purchase condoms as long as they are not the specialized kinds,” he said. “We have filed requests to Naver to allow teenagers to access more information on safe products.”‘Why I lied that I was raped’ Kang was 15 when she had her first sexual experience. She had quit middle school in Ulsan as she had become weary of the physical punishment that was occurring daily in her class. “I was a good student, as in I did well academically. So I was rarely punished. But I think witnessing your friends being punished was equally traumatizing,” she said. “We would be hit for reasons like being late, talking loudly in class, or dozing off while the teacher was talking. One of the teachers had a habit of choking children whenever she was angry.”She recalls the desire to be acknowledged as an independent human being -- “like an adult” -- when in school. “I think that’s why I became interested in sexual relationships,” she said. “That was the only kind of relationship in which I was treated like a grown-up, not a child or a property.” Yet during her first experience, she said she was not able to tell her partner, to use protection. “I just didn’t know when to say it, and how to say it.”At the time, as she was scared that she might become pregnant, Kang decided to purchase emergency contraceptive pills. While she had learned about the pills during sex education class in school, she had not been told where and how she could purchase them. “I didn’t know all teenagers were allowed to get a doctor’s prescription for the pills as long as they visit clinics and pay for it,” she said. “So I lied to my doctor that I had been raped. And really, no teenager nowadays should be as confused as I was when trying to get information on birth control.” Forced abortions, adoptions On top of lacking information on birth control, Kang said that pregnant teenagers are often forced to make decisions that they do not want to make, such as abortion or giving their babies up for adoption. One of the teens who reported her case to Kang’s organization was drugged by her mother when she was pregnant and was taken to a clinic where she underwent abortion illegally against her will. When she woke up, the procedure was already over.Choi Hyung-sook, who used to be an unwed single mother, witnessed a similar case while working as a sex education teacher for teens. When a high school student became pregnant with her boyfriend, a fellow student, the two ran away to the countryside, as her parents had tried to force her to have an abortion. The young couple wanted to keep the baby and had plans to raise the child together. Yet when she arrived in a hospital to give birth, health care workers contacted her parents. They were following laws that aim to protect minors. When the baby was born, the teen’s mother sent the child for adoption overseas without her daughter’s consent. “Many school teachers I met have repeatedly said students are supposed to study, and students are not supposed to date, as if teenagers don’t need to learn anything about birth control,” Choi told The Korea Herald. “Should teenage mothers – who were never fully educated on birth control options -- be forced by their own parents to give up their children just because they are minors? It’s something that we should really think about.”Abortion is illegal in South Korea except in certain circumstances, such as when the woman was impregnated by rape. Park Hye-young, the associate director of Sunflower Center, a state-run support institution for victims of sexual violence, said that the center receives many pregnant teenagers who claim to have been raped and ask the center to support the cost of their abortion procedures. “There have been cases where the young women were not raped,” she said. “They just became pregnant because they had unprotected sex and were not educated enough about birth control. They would visit our center after learning that only rape victims are eligible to receive government support for safe, legal abortion procedures.”Kang said teenagers who keep their pregnancies a secret from their parents, as well as those who ran away from homes, are especially vulnerable under the current legal system. “When you are a teenager and you don’t have the money and the right information, the chances are you may end up receiving an unsafe abortion procedure by an uncertified doctor,” she said. “The  sex education fails to educate teenagers on birth control, and the current laws fail to protect them from unsafe abortion. It’s like a vicious circle.”123rfTo protect or to be freeConservative activists, on the other hand, support the government’s method of restricting teenagers from being exposed to sex so as to minimize the risk that follows. Lee Kyung-ja, who heads Student First, a grouop of Korean parents, said public sex education should discourage students from having sex, instead of educating them on birth control options. “We’ve had students who were traumatized after attending such classes that taught about birth control options in detail. They’d come home and say they were scared and shocked,” she told The Korea Herald. “We think sex education should focus on responsibility and self-control. I believe all schoolchildren eventually learn about sex naturally. We don’t have to  provoke or shock them by informing them too much, by educating them on things like how to use condoms or homosexuality.”But advocates of liberal sex education contend that it is closely linked to protecting students’ basic rights.“The school system is very oppressive,” Kang said. “You are constantly competing against one another, while often separated from the other gender. You are not supposed to date or have sex. You are only supposed to study and your only goal should be achieving good grades. It’s almost inhumane.”The activist said she hopes to see more Korean teens making independent and educated choices on birth control and romantic relationships. “Even as adult women, we are told that it’s our right to say no ,” she said. “But we rarely get reminded that it is also our right to say yes -- and enjoy and exercise one’s sexual self-determination to the widest possible sense.” Meanwhile, Kang continues to hand out stickers with a message taken from a song to show that teenagers are also free to love. They say: “It’s really the best age to fall in love.”By Claire Lee","korean teens fight for ,sex life in 2012 ,youth rights in seoul ,teens fight for rights ,rally focusing on youth","['Kang Min - jin', 'Seoul', 'the Korea Herald']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.28455991  0.37581623

The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said 88-year-old Ha Sang-sook, the only Korean sexual slavery victim living in Wuhan, China, arrived at Chung-Ang University Medical Center in Seoul to treat her injured lungs.In early February, she broke a rib after she fell down the stairs from the second floor, leading to lung inflammation and rendering her unconsciousness. A Korean medical team was dispatched to China earlier this month to check her health condition and review the possibilities of bringing her to Seoul for long-term medical treatment. While she gradually recovered consciousness, she is still in a serious state, the medical staff said. Upon the medical team’s approval, Ha was moved to Seoul with her 63-year-old stepdaughter and granddaughter. At the age of 17 in 1944, Ha was taken to China by Japanese authorities and forced into sexual enslavement. Despite Korea’s liberation in 1945, she was unable to return to her home country and sustained her life as a factory worker in Wuhan. She later married a Chinese man who already had three daughters, but declined to become naturalized as a Chinese citizen, despite her stateless status. Although Ha recovered her Korean citizenship in 1999 and finally returned to Korea in 2003, she went back to China after 2 1/2 years upon the persuasion of her youngest stepdaughter. She also had difficulties in adjusting to her new life in Korea without any acquaintances here, the ministry said. Her medical trip was led and sponsored by both the public and private sectors.Korean Air offered a medium-size airplane to ensure enough space for Ha’s sickbed. Chinese authorities also allowed Ha’s ambulance to skip the check-in procedures for prompt transportation. Ha will immediately receive a medical check-up to find out whether surgery is necessary, the Seoul authorities said. The Korean government has provided a monthly stipend of 1.2 million won  for sexual slavery victims since 1993. After Ha’s case came to light, authorities and a local nonprofit organization have covered all her medical expenses since the injury. The victim is also not subject to the Chinese government’s medical benefits, due to her nationality. The ministry said it would support her permanent residence here, if she wishes, and cover all medical expenses. Ha has reportedly told her family consistently that she would like to spend the rest of her life in her home country.By Lee Hyun-jeong","medical treatment korean victim ,february she broke rib ,korean sexual slavery victim ,only korean sexual slavery ,seoul for medical treatment","['korean', 'japanese', 'China', 'Seoul', 'the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family', 'ha Sang - sook', 'korean', 'Wuhan', 'China', 'Chung - Ang University Medical Center', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22372061  0.07052123

The Ministry of Unification plans to transfer records of interviews and testimonies provided by North Korean defectors it has collected over the years to the justice ministry's new archive.The move comes as the North Korea Human Rights bill that was passed earlier in the year by parliament goes into effect in September. The bill had been a source of controversy for some time because liberals were concerned that its passage would further antagonize Pyongyang and hinder inter-Korean relations.In addition, a state prosecutor from the justice ministry will be assigned to work at the unification ministry's North Korea's human rights record center that is tasked with initially processing defectors from the communist country and compiling data on systematic abuses committed by Pyongyang.""The preannouncement of legislation for the enforcement decree will be made in the middle of this month outlining the changes that will take place and the creation of systematic record keeping,"" the justice ministry said.It said the human rights center will transfer data it has collected every three months to the record archive.""The prosecutor dispatched will not be present for interviews with defectors all the time but will take part if the need arises,""a government source said. ""If the prosecutor's presence is required, it will be because there is a need to document victims of criminal cases.""Others said that the creation of an archive will send a clear warning to North Korean officials that they will eventually be punished for their mistreatment of people and crimes against humanity.North Korea is often cited as one of the worst human rights violator states in the world. It has routinely been accused of deporting dissidents to concentration camps and carrying out state-sanctioned torture and summary executions of those that oppose the regime. Seoul has said that North Korea leader Kim Jong-un is included on the list of people who would be punished for human rights violations committed. It said cases involving North Korea's top leadership could be sent to the ICC, which could kick off legal proceedings.Officials, however, pointed out that for a case to be tried at the international court, it must be approved by the United Nations Security Council, which may not be an easy task.China and Russia are veto-wielding council members that in the past have been reluctant to put too much pressure on North Korea.","korea human rights archive ,rights violations after reunification ,tabs on north korea ,archive south korea ministry ,korea ministry of justice","[""South Korea 's"", 'Ministry of Justice', ""North Korea 's"", 'the International Criminal Court']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.31906915 -0.11825215

While the series garnered avid followers in Korea and abroad, even being cited as a tremendous economic and tourism booster, the enormous popularity of the military romance ironically reflects what today’s Korean society lacks, critics say.“I think the character played by Song Joong-ki is great. He’s capable, courageous and has a sense of integrity,” said activist Lim Tae-hun, who heads the Military Human Rights Center -- an advocacy group calling for human rights reforms in the Korean military. “The only thing is that it’s almost impossible for a soldier like him to exist in South Korea’s military system.”While the fictional character Yoo in the show enjoys special comradeship with his fellow soldiers, Lim said such military relationships were far from the reality, where suppressive military culture prevails and cases of abuse by soldiers are frequently reported. “I’d say there is just no sense of dignity in the Korean military,” Lim said. “You don’t have any privacy. There is a strict hierarchy within the system. You don’t have the option of quitting while serving your military duty, unless you are willing to become an ex-convict.”  An able-bodied man refusing to perform his service leads to a jail term of one year in South Korea. Military duty is often therefore perceived as an inevitable obligation rather than a heroic deed.Other experts pointed out that the series promotes patriarchal values and nationalism. The series even won praise from President Park Geun-hye, who recently said the show could help “instill patriotism” among young Koreans. Patriotism is the Park administration’s most prioritized value, with such high-ranking officials as Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn trumpeting all government-led policies as being based on the love for the country. Acerbic critics of the series also note that the dialogues often reflect deeply embedded discrimination, which in another language would likely sound downright offensive.In her column published last month, film critic Hwang Jin-mi pointed out that the character Yoo often makes sexist comments. “He says, ‘it is my duty as a solider to protect children, the elderly and pretty women,’” she writes in the column published in a local daily. “Why does it have to be ‘pretty women,’ instead of just ‘women’?”Hwang also addressed in the column that while the surgeon Kang is seemingly depicted as an independent, capable woman who offers medical relief to disaster victims in Uruk, she is always rescued by Yoo whenever she is in a life-threatening situation. To Hwang’s comments, culture critic Lee Moon-won said the series in fact specifically targets female viewers, not the other way around. “Most Korean men -- especially those who have served their military duties -- don’t want to watch TV drama series that feature men in military uniforms,” he said. “Most of them don’t find any joy in watching fellow men being trained in the military. It’s the kind of experience that they’d rather not be reminded of. I argue that the series fulfills fantasies of female viewers, especially the one of physically strong men in uniforms who are also extremely caring and romantic at the same time.”Critic Lee however said the show does reflect Korea’s situation of gender imbalance which makes women more vulnerable to financial insecurity and unemployment.“I think patriarchal men can be seen as attractive to female viewers when they are exceptionally capable, physically strong and responsible,” he said. “Given today’s sluggish economy and job market, it’s hard to find such  who have those qualities whether they are patriarchal or not. I think the popularity of such strong, male military characters in the show reflects women’s collective insecurity and anxiety.”By Claire Lee","ongoing korean drama series ,the ongoing korean drama ,office worker in seoul ,ongoing korean drama ,korean drama series that","['Lee Soo - yeon', 'Seoul', 'korean', 'the Korea Herald']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31281194  0.8851949

The scholarship provided by the military school was also a merit hard to pass up.However, eight months into her first year at military school, she decided to quit. As one of the two exclusive female cadets out of 30 cadets in her squad, she said she experienced implicit disadvantages during training and field operations.“We were often excluded from field operations, which I think was because we were women,” said Park.Korea’s military does not have a long history with female soldiers.Cadets attend an entrance ceremony at the Korea Military Academy in February, 2016. Ahn Hoon/The Korea HeraldIn 1997, Korea’s Air Force Academy allowed its first female cadet, while the Military Academy and the Naval Academy did so in 1998 and 1999. By regulation, just 10 percent of the total number of freshmen at military academy are allowed to be filled by women. This leads to fiercer competition to become one of the select few female candidates who makes it, as well as to be commissioned after four years of training.On top of such aggressive competition, a 28-year-old military officer surnamed Chung, who only has three more months left to be commissioned, said he often saw female colleagues struggle to get used to the military environment.“Due to the much smaller number of female soldiers, it is harder  to become accustomed to the environment here,” said Chung. According to the Ministry of National Defense evaluation report in 2013, the ministry rated the task of increasing female manpower and establishing infrastructure for female soldiers as “urgent.”“The evaluation report especially pointed out the lack of welfare  such as nursing facilities and counseling programs to deter sexual harassment or discrimination,” said an analyst at the Center for Freedom of Information and Transparent Society.In 2013, a female soldier who was 7 months pregnant died at a unit near the front line, and a lack of medical infrastructure and welfare programs in her unit was blamed for her death.The Defense Ministry’s regulation states, as of 2010, pregnant female soldiers can be exempted from training, and they can also ask for up to 90 days of leave.But it is actually not easy for female soldiers to do so, due to the possiblility they will face disadvantages in their roles.According to a female military insider who wished to be anonymous, “Female cadets are most likely to be dispatched to supporting roles when they are commissioned, such as the propaganda or education office, mainly due to their  weakness when they are out in the field.”But analysts also say that although limited roles were given to female soldiers in the past, the current military environment is going through a period of transition, with an effort to expand the quota of female soldiers and the roles they fulfill each year.“The number of female soldiers hit 10,000 last year, which implies change in the roles of female soldiers and that their welfare programs will slowly but steadily improve and expand,” said professor Park Sung-beom of military science at Seokyung University.In order to support volunteers for Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, Ewha Womans University decided to implement ROTC programs starting this year, following Sookmyung Women’s University and Sungshin Women’s University which begun ROTC programs in 2010 and 2011, he added.Women serving in the field said while they encounter prejudice both within and outside the military, it pushes them to work harder to prove themselves.A 35-year-old major serving in an aviation battalion said, “Because it was not an easy choice to become a female soldier, many of us live with a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility. All of us applied with a sense of duty and are working hard. It is hoped that people from outside would also view us simply as soldiers, not just out of curiosity for being women.”By Kim Da-sol","crossroads on female soldiers ,year old female student ,old female student ,female soldiers ,20 years military uniform",['Park Na - hyun'],8,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.0848721  0.03702585 0.54017365],Korea Herald,Defense,4,2016,"2010 pregnant female soldiers ,history with female soldiers cadets ,female cadets out of 30 ,2013 female soldier ,female soldiers cadets attend an","['Park Na - hyun', 'Park', 'Korea', 'the Korea Military Academy', 'Ahn Hoon', 'the Korea', 'Korea ’s', 'Air Force Academy', 'the Military Academy', 'the Naval Academy', 'Chung', 'Chung', 'the Ministry of National Defense', 'the Center for Freedom of Information and Transparent Society', 'the Defense Ministry ’s', 'Park Sung - beom', 'Seokyung University', 'Ewha Womans University', 'Sookmyung Women ’s University', 'Sungshin Women ’s University', 'Kim Da - sol']",19,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.0848721  0.03702585 0.54017365]

Security Council  sanctions in response to the North's most recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch, and has engaged in the EU's efforts to apply its standalone sanctions on the unruly regime.""We are not a member of the six-party talks, but we have a very strong interest in the security and stability here, and we do our part to support what is going on,"" he said, referring to the long-stalled multilateral aid-for-denuclearization talks involving the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia.""We have been a strong supporter of the  Korean government, and our foreign secretary was very loud and immediate in his condemnation of the recent provocations from North Korea,"" he added.Britain's dispatch of troops to the Seoul-based U.N. Command tasked with observing the Armistice Agreement that halted the 1950-53 Korean War attests to his country's interest in the security of its long-standing friend, South Korea, he noted.Britain's security support for the South dates back to the Korean War, the first major armed conflict of the Cold War. The faraway country sent more than 60,000 troops to fight under the banner of the United Nations following the North's invasion.""More than a thousand of the  died .

The challenge facing him as an ambassador is how to manage and further improve the hitherto successful partnership, he said.""When  go on a posting to a country either as an ambassador or any other jobs in the mission, you always have to worry about bilateral problems that you have with that country,"" he said.""However, I have to say with Korea, there are no bilateral problems at all. The question is and the challenge for me as an ambassador is how do we take a good relationship and make it even better.""Commenting on the increasing influence of ""hallyu,"" or the global spread of Korean pop culture, Hay said that knowledge about Korea has been growing in his country through Korean celebrities, such as singer Psy.

Who could take care of these little ones when I am gone?”“They are my family. I play with them and scold them, but at the end of the day, they make me smile and enrich my life,” said Cho, who recently adopted an abandoned dog in her neighborhood in Wonju, Gangwon Province. She said the dogs do not only serve as a source of comfort to her. They have helped unite her family, as the kids gather in the living room to play with them.Cho is one of a growing number of avid animal lovers in Korea who recognize pets as an important part of their lives and advocate broader rights for animals.The government estimates that about 10 million people in the country raise some 4 million pets. Exact figures are not available. According to a survey on 2,096 households by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 21.8 percent of households were living with pets as of 2015, a 25 percent increase from 2010. Awareness of animal rights was noticeable among the surveyed households, with 92.9 percent of them supporting stricter punishment for animal abuse. Citizens and their pets look at pet items at the K-Pet Fair 2016 held at Seoul’s SETEC from April 1-3. The next round of exhibition is slated to take place in Busan from April 30-May 1. Cho Hee-kyung, head of the Korean Animal Welfare Association, noted that the country has come a long way in raising public awareness of animal rights and expanding animal welfare.“The animal advocacy movement began around 1999, with animal rights groups addressing the issue of abandoned animals and dog meat trade,” Cho told The Korea Herald. “Many people started to sympathize with animals and refrained from viewing them as products.” “There are still owners irresponsibly raising pets, but now society has built a norm that people raise pets only when they can responsibly take care of them.” Several amendments made to the Animal Protection Act, which took effect in 1991, are a reminder of the maturing animal rights movement.  Korea enacted the Animal Protection Act to broadly define responsibility of animal caretakers and owners to feed, house and care for their pets. It also stipulated a ban on animal abuse or inhumane slaughter. After the bill was revised in 2011, the punishment for those violating the law increased from 5 million won  or a six-month jail term to 10 million won or a one-year prison term. In January, animals rights group Animal Arirang launched a petition on major web portal Daum to include clauses related to animal rights in the Constitution. “If rules about animal protection and welfare are added in the Constitution, it will prevent anti-animal actions such as abuse,” the group said. As of Wednesday, 1,801 individuals had signed the petition. In 2015, 12 out of 58 bills related to protecting animals passed through the National Assembly. Several bills for the expansion of the pet registration system and tougher punishments for animal abuse are pending in the parliament. Cho pointed out that one of the major achievements in Korea’s fight for animal rights was a passage of the anti-animal testing bill. The bill is to ban companies from testing cosmetics and other products on animals by 2018. “Korea began to talk about animal welfare in zoos and tougher penalties for those abusing animals,” she said. “Based on what we have achieved, society should move forward to better implement the law and institutions in reality. Pet lovers have spurred the pet industry, with the government estimating that the market was worth 1.8 trillion won in 2015. If it grows at the current pace, the market will be worth 5.8 billion won by 2020. These days, companies are scrambling to roll out services such as medical insurance, nursing system, funeral ceremonies and TV programs about animal welfare. A slew of events for families and their pets are also being hosted by municipalities. For instance, Gangwon Pet Festival, which will involve pets and their owners in activities such as running a race and a dancing class, will be held on Sunday. A similar event is scheduled for May 7 in Seongnam City. The government also founded a task force team encompassing relevant ministries and animal advocacy groups to lay out detailed plans and a budget to improve conditions for animals in the country. It plans to mandate training centers, animal cafes and beauty salons for dogs to register with the government before they open for business. It will also increase medical insurance coverage for animals and create more jobs to take care of animals.

213,213,213,[EXCLUSIVE] Racism prevalent in migrant education,"When Alaina Yildiz started taking her Korean language class at a state-run institute in Busan in February, she could not believe what her teacher told her and her classmates. 　The class, officially named the Korea Immigration and Integration Program, was offered by South Korea’s Justice Ministry and specifically targeted marriage immigrants who wish to obtain South Korean citizenship after marrying Korean nationals...","When Alaina Yildiz started taking her Korean language class at a state-run institute in Busan in February, she could not believe what her teacher told her and her classmates. The class, officially named the Korea Immigration and Integration Program, was offered by South Korea’s Justice Ministry and specifically targeted marriage immigrants who wish to obtain South Korean citizenship after marrying Korean nationals.“My Korean teacher said Vietnamese names aren’t beautiful so Vietnamese women should change their names to Korean ones once they obtain  citizenship,” Yildiz said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “Another time the instructor said in front of the class that Muslim people were dangerous. Although I’m not religious, I felt bad because my family is Muslim, and they aren’t dangerous people.”Yildiz, who comes from a western Asian country, has been living in South Korea with her Korean husband since last year. She decided to take the KIIP classes to improve her Korean and help her naturalization process. Currently, F-6 visa holders who take KIIP classes for up to two years are exempt from attending their naturalization interview and tests in South Korea. A textbook used in the KIIP program. Alaina YildizCivic groups and activists here have been calling for improvement in policies on immigrants, particularly the marriage immigrants who are mostly women. Immigrated women are required to receive official consent from the husband to extend their stay or apply for permanent residency.The naturalization interview and tests are notorious for their difficulty. Sample questions provided by the Justice Ministry’s website show that one needs to memorize the Korean national anthem word by word and be informed about former South Korean presidents and their achievements, among other things. Often, opting for the KIIP classes is considered easier for marriage expats, many of whom are women, Yildiz said. In spite of the benefits the KIIP courses offer, Yildiz decided to quit her classes due to her teacher’s racist and sexist remarks, saying that another instructor even offered advice on how to act as women in Korea, even giving cleaning tips or how to treat Korean husbands, such as by giving massages.When reached by The Korea Herald, the teacher denied making any racist remarks, saying that many of the allegations appear to have derived from the language barrier.“I’ve been teaching for the last 10 years and I’ve never faced such problems before,” the teacher told The Korea Herald. “I only said there was a terrorist attack in Paris and some Muslims were there.”The textbook used in the KIIP classes are also seen as sexist. The book is published by the Justice Ministry and the state-run National Institute of Korean Language.The books contain sections that generally suggest that women should stay indoors, and be interested in cooking and cleaning. In the introduction page of one of the textbooks, there are illustrations of fictional foreign-born expats living in South Korea. One of them is Elena, a woman in her 30s who is from Russia. She is portrayed as a blonde woman who initially moved to Korea to become an actress and ended up marrying a Korean. Another character, Eva, a young woman in her 20s from the Philippines, is portrayed as a dark-skinned marriage immigrant living with her Korean spouse.“The one thing that this curriculum encourages is thinking in terms of crude stereotypes, and it doesn‘t matter really whether or not they’re true,” said Michael Hurt, an American expat and research professor at Korea University who found the illustrations to be problematic. “To put it simply, imagine if American textbooks had all the Korean immigrant language learners as liquor store owners. There‘s some truth to that image, since many first-generation Korean immigrants in the United States own liquor stores and laundromats and such things, but do we have to be limited by that image?”Often, it is difficult for F-6 visa holders to complain as they don’t speak Korean fluently and fear that addressing the issue of racism may work against them during their naturalization process. “ just nodded. I was more surprised at them than at my teacher,” Yildiz said. “I think they don’t want to cause trouble.”Kim Chae-hwa, a former F-6 visa holder from China, said she also had an unpleasant experience while attending KIIP program in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. She said all of her classes were enjoyable, except the last interview with an instructor. Kim, who is now a South Korean national, had to pass the interview in order to be exempt for the citizenship interview and the written test.“The instructor asked me if I ever hoisted a national Korean flag before. When I said no, she asked me if I own a flag at home,” she told The Korea Herald. “I told her I never knew anyone could purchase the flag in stores in Korea. Then she abruptly told me that I should stop wanting things without paying for them in this country. I felt extremely insulted.”According to the Immigration and Social Integration Network website provided by the Justice Ministry, among all teachers who are hired for KIIP courses, only those who teach courses on Korean society are required to be educated on multiculturalism in order to be qualified for the job. Those who teach the Korean language and culture are government-certified school teachers who have at least two years of teaching experience at the nation’s elementary schools.The Korea Immigration Service in Busan refused to officially comment on the case, saying they plan to look further into whether there was any misconduct committed.Chung Ki-seon, a senior researcher at the Migration Research and Training Centre of the International Organization for Migration, said South Korea is not the only country that offers programs like KIIP. According to her, many countries in Europe, including Germany, encourages marriage immigrants to master their languages before entering the borders. The Common Basic Principles for Immigrant Integration Policy in the European Union states that “basic knowledge of the host society’s language, history and institutions is indispensable to integration of immigrants.”“I think programs like KIIP are necessary for practical reasons,” Chung told The Korea Herald. “Understanding the host country’s language and culture are crucial when you start a new life in a foreign country as an active citizen. It’s a practical need, and there should be support from the host countries for that.”While Chung acknowledged the necessity of programs like KIIP, she said racist and sexist remarks in such classes should never be tolerated. “The classes should be based on values such as gender equality, tolerance and respect,” she said. “And there should be educational programs for Koreans on human rights and anti-discrimination.

Robert King acknowledged the difficulties of tracking the flow of money from North Korean workers to the regime in Pyongyang.""It's very clear that North Korea uses a great deal of its resources for nuclear weapons, for missiles, for military equipment,"" he said at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. ""And to say that this dollar from this worker is going to a bomb, you don't have that kind of ability to account. It's a process that's happening and yes, we need to see what we can do to prevent it from happening.""Unofficial estimates put the number of North Korean workers abroad at 50,000, with most of them working in labor-intensive sectors in China and Russia, but also in Mongolia and the Middle East. The North Korean regime reportedly extorts between US$200 million and $300 million from these laborers annually.As part of wide-ranging sanctions that punish Pyongyang for its recent nuclear and missile tests, U.S. President Barack Obama issued an executive order last month that among other things calls for sanctions against people who have engaged in the exportation of North Korean workers.The measure has drawn attention as it could mean that Chinese and Russian firms hiring North Korean workers could be subject to the sanctions.""At this point, we're beginning a process, and one of the things we're doing is looking for additional information, trying to make sure we know what's happening and where the workers are, what companies they are working for,"" King said. ""We don't have a lot of information at this point. We're talking with the South Korean government and sharing information with them. We'll continue to consult with them.""Some of the information they need is which companies are hiring the workers, what goods they're producing and whether these products are being sold in the U.S.King highlighted the increased international pressure on North Korea to improve its human rights record, especially following the 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report that revealed atrocities amounting to ""crimes against humanity."" North Korea has been accused of holding hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps, torture, rape and public executions -- all of which Pyongyang rejects as a U.S.-led campaign to topple its regime.A key task that remains is pursuing accountability for those responsible for the crimes.""I think that it's very clear that's where the policies of North Korea begin,"" King said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. ""So I think it's very clear that he's very responsible for many of the actions that go on. That doesn't mean he's solely responsible. He certainly sets a tone, but there are a lot of North Korean officials of one kind or another who are responsible.""The envoy listed heads of ministries, directors of departments and soldiers guarding the borders who are often reported to fire at North Koreans trying to flee the regime.""All of them need to understand that these are violations of fundamental human rights, and we need to make an effort to hold them accountable,"" King said. ""It's not enough to hold just the person at the top accountable. We need to hold people accountable from top to bottom.""Last month, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a North Korea human rights resolution that centers on appointing up to two independent experts to pursue accountability for the North's human rights abuses.King arrived in Seoul Saturday and is scheduled to leave Wednesday after meetings with various senior officials at the Foreign and Unification Ministries and leaders of NGOs.","abuse of korean workers ,tuesday north korea exports ,korea exports of workers ,korean workers abroad envoy ,korea working to tackle","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'north korean', ""North Korea 's""]",8,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.14297551  0.22317597

Mexico held 33 crewmembers before releasing them last year.Mexico said it ""will continue to detain the ship,"" according to an official who is in a position to know about government policy.He asked not to be identified, citing policy.","mexican american war park ,to six mexican cadets ,six mexican cadets at ,six mexican cadets ,mexican cadets at monument","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'mexican', 'Mexico', 'Chapultepec Park', 'Mexico City']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26473504  0.05369227

In 2014, Japan wrote in the annual diplomatic report that ""South Korea and Japan share basic values and interests such as liberal democracy and basic human rights."" Last year the annual book again merely expressed the term ""South Korea is one of the most important neighbors.""But this year's draft contains the term ""sharing strategic interests"" with South Korea in a move to improve bilateral relations following the landmark deal on Dec. 28. Nuclear and missile development by North Korea remains a source of concern and threat to the international community, according to the draft, which said Japan will strongly urge the communist country to take concrete actions toward denuclearization.Tokyo will keep pressing Pyongyang to resolve the issue of North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s, it also said.","diplomatic bluebook for 2016 ,wartime japanese military brothels ,improvement in seoul tokyo ,korean women forced to ,tokyo annual foreign policy","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'South Korea', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Kyodo News Service']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25565729  0.18435748

217,217,217,[FEATURE INTERVIEW] Incest victims fight back against abusers in South Korea,"When Kim Mi-eun was in middle school, she accidentally read a story about an incest victim in a newspaper. That’s when she realized she had been constantly raped by her father, who had told her to keep their “playing sessions” a secret. 　“I’d been abused by my father since I was a first-grader, and it lasted for 12 years,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “During sex education classes at school, they teach you to r...","When Kim Mi-eun was in middle school, she accidentally read a story about an incest victim in a newspaper. That’s when she realized she had been constantly raped by her father, who had told her to keep their “playing sessions” a secret. “I’d been abused by my father since I was a first-grader, and it lasted for 12 years,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “During sex education classes at school, they teach you to run away when a stranger tries to sexually abuse you. But they don’t specifically tell you it’s abuse when your own father engages in sexual activities with you. I was confused, but I didn’t really get it until I read the news story.”Kim is one of many South Korean incest victims who received support at Sunflower Centers, government-affiliated support institutions for sexual violence victims.  123RFAfter receiving many years of therapy and psychiatric treatment, the college student now volunteers at the center to support other victims like her. Her mother, who is no longer with Kim’s assailant, has also formed a support group for incest victims and their families. “I wanted to break all the stereotypes,” Kim’s mother said. “I wanted to prove that incest victims and their families do survive post-abuse, and they indeed want the abusers to be punished.”While rarely a subject of public attention, incest against minors is not uncommon in South Korea. According to the Gender Ministry’s latest data, 17 percent of all reported rape cases against Koreans aged 19 or under in 2014 were committed by the victims’ biological parents or siblings. “We predict that the actual proportion would be higher, considering a lot of incest cases remain unreported,” said an official from the ministry.Alarmed by the statistics, the Sunflower Centers have begun offering therapy sessions for the victim’s parents -- the spouses of the abusers -- starting from this year. “Many times, the mothers don’t believe it when their children tell them they’ve been abused by their fathers,” said Park Hye-young, the associate director of the Sunflower Center’s Seoul branch. “And sometimes the mothers don’t want to report their spouse to the police because they are worried about losing the breadwinner of the family. The role of the spouse of the abuser is crucial for children who have been sexually abused by one of their parents, especially once they decide to file a complaint. This is why we’ve decided to run programs for the mothers.”Even for Kim and her mother, the process hasn’t been easy. While attending high school, Kim started experiencing both visual and auditory hallucinations resulting from enduring abuse. She would often see another version of herself in front of her, who would constantly tell her to leave for somewhere else.“I’d been always told  that if I told anyone about it, our family may not be able to live together. I was too afraid to hurt my mother, so I kept it to myself as long as I could,” she said. Finding her condition unbearable, while not wanting to reveal the truth to her mother, Kim secretly visited a youth support center to seek help. Her visits to the institution were discovered by her schoolteacher, who eventually reported the case to the Sunflower Center. “I was overwhelmed and I didn’t know what to do,” said Kim’s mother, recalling the moment she found out the truth at the center. “My ex-spouse would also physically abuse me in the presence of our children at home. Having watched me being abused by her father, I think my daughter instinctively thought I’d be incapable of helping her even if I found out the truth. And this still breaks my heart.”Upon learning the truth 12 years later, Kim’s mother began to take the fight immediately. She reported her husband to the police and filed for divorce. One of the toughest challenges was dealing with her in-laws, who tried to persuade her daughter to drop the case against her father. Even her friends suggested it’s more “practical” to settle the case and move overseas with her daughter using the settlement money. “The abuser’s father told my daughter, in my presence, ‘what kind of a daughter sues her own father and lets him serve a prison term?’” said Kim’s mother. “I told my daughter to get up and we left the house on the spot. There was nothing more to talk about.”Kim told The Korea Herald that her paternal grandmother once threatened to kill her for wanting to see her father punished. “It was traumatic,” she said. “I thought out of all people, my grandmother would understand.”Associate director Park said Kim’s experience with her father’s side of the family is common among incest victims, and many in fact end up dropping their cases after being guilt-tripped by their relatives. “I must say, not every victim’s mother protects their child the way Kim’s mother has done,” she told The Korea Herald. “Many times, the mothers are afraid to lose their spouses because they don’t want to lose that sense of financial and emotional security. We’ve had the victims’ relatives -- mostly the parents and siblings of the abuser -- storming into the center and screaming at the victims for being an ‘unfilial’ child for wanting to file a complaint against her or his own parent.”Kim’s father received a 10-year prison term about five years ago, which both Kim and her mother think is too light. “Even after he was jailed, I would see hallucinations of the abuser in front of me,” said Kim. “I knew that he was in jail physically, but the hallucination of him would say, ‘hey, come here. Dad is back.’”Still, the two are determined to prove that incest victims do survive and live fulfilling lives post-abuse. Now a college student majoring in cinema studies, Kim’s dream is to make a film featuring her own experiences as a survivor. “I want to prove to my fellow survivors that incest victims can make art, and openly share their stories,” she said. “And for those who are being pressured by their relatives not to file a complaint against their own parent, I want to tell them that by not reporting the abuser, you may be doing injustice to potential victims of sexual violence. When you report your abuser, you are not only doing it for yourself, but also for the world.”By Claire Lee  The name of the interviewed victim has been changed upon request. -- Ed.","raped by her father ,interview incest victims fight ,middle school she accidentally ,feature interview incest victims ,korea herald during sex","['Kim Mi - eun', 'Kim', 'the Korea Herald']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.20296407 -0.08259808

Kim Yong-chol has been appointed as the party secretary handling inter-Korean affairs, also doubling as the head of the United Front Department at the ruling party, following the death of his predecessor, Kim Yang-gon.Kim also appears to hold his original position as the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau head tasked with espionage operations against South Korea and cyberwarfare, according to a source familiar with North Korean affairs.""Kim is seen as leading the North's reconnaissance bureau as well,"" the source said.Kim, thought to be behind the North's deadly attacks on South Korea in 2010, has spearheaded the North's key organization since 2009. The bureau is known to be behind Pyongyang's alleged cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014.Kim, known as a hardliner, is believed to have orchestrated Pyongyang's two deadly attacks on the South in 2010 -- the sinking of the Cheonan warship and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. The two attacks killed a total of 50 South Koreans, including two civilians.He is also known for having masterminded the planting of land mines across the inter-Korean border that severely injured two South Korean staff sergeants in August last year.The appointment of Gen. Kim as a successor to Kim Yang-gon has spawned speculation that inter-Korean relations will likely remain strained for a long time.His name was on a list of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council as the 15-member council imposed tougher punitive measures on March 2 over the North's January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February. South Korea also blacklisted him in its own unilateral sanctions.A series of North Korea's recent provocations seem to support the view Kim is still spearheading the reconnaissance bureau, analysts say.North Korea launched several short-range projectiles and ballistic missiles this month in a show of defiance against the toughened international sanctions. It has also threatened to make a pre-emptive strike against Seoul and Washington.But others said that Kim may temporarily lead the bureau until his successor is appointed, given that the posts of a party secretary and the head of the reconnaissance organ have different status in the North.","doubling as spy agency ,new north korean official ,spy agency head new ,korean affairs also doubling ,to seoul spy agency","['north korean', 'inter - korean', 'Seoul', 'Kim Yong - chol', 'inter - korean', 'the United Front Department']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48213911  0.37516075

This year's meeting is to be the final summit.The summit will bring together the leaders of more than 50 countries, including China and Japan, as well as the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union.Park is expected to call for international efforts to deal with threats of nuclear terrorism and to make North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program during a working dinner on Thursday, the first day of the summit.International efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear ambition have gained further urgency in recent months as Pyongyang carried out its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and a long-range rocket launch on Feb. 7.The U.N. Security Council has slapped North Korea with tougher sanctions to punish the communist country for its latest provocations.North Korea has claimed breakthroughs in its missile and nuclear weapons programs in the latest clear sign that the communist country has no intention of giving up its nuclear and missile programs.South Korea believes the North can conduct a fifth nuclear test at any time. On Tuesday, North Korea fired a short-range projectile in the latest show of force against South Korea over its annual military drills with Washington. The North views the drills as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.In Washington, Park is also set to hold talks with Obama on Thursday before the two meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit.The trilateral summit is expected to focus on the common responses of the three countries to the threat posed by North Korea.Park is also scheduled to hold two separate talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Abe on North Korea. Obama is set to meet with Xi on Thursday.North Korea's nuclear issue is expected to be the key topic of discussion at Park's back-to-back meetings with the leaders. The trip also will take Park to Mexico for a summit with President Enrique Pena Nieto next Monday.The two leaders are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, as well as how to cooperate on the faithful and effective implementation of the U.N. sanctions.","nuclear security summit president ,obama hosted the inaugural ,on wednesday for summit ,nuclear security the biennial ,inaugural summit in 2010","['Park Geun - hye', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Obama']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48974201  0.4001362

This year's meeting is to be the final summit.The summit will bring together the leaders of more than 50 countries, including China and Japan, as well as the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union.Park is expected to call for international efforts to deal with the threats on nuclear terrorism and to make North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program during a working dinner on Thursday, the first day of the summit.International efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear ambition have gained further urgency in recent months as Pyongyang carried out its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and a long-range rocket launch on Feb. 7.The U.N. Security Council has slapped tougher sanctions on North Korea to punish the communist country for its latest provocations.North Korea has claimed breakthroughs in its missile and nuclear weapons programs in the latest clear sign that the communist country has no intention of giving up its nuclear and missile programs.South Korea believes the North can conduct a fifth nuclear test at any time.On Tuesday, North Korea fired a short-range projectile in the latest show of force against South Korea over its annual military drills with Washington. The North views the drills as a rehearsal for a nuclear war against it.In Washington, Park is also set to hold talks with Obama on Thursday before the two meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit.The trilateral summit is expected to focus on the common responses of the three countries to the threat posed by North Korea.Park is also scheduled to hold two separate talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Abe on North Korea. Obama is set to meet with Xi on Thursday.North Korea's nuclear issue is expected to be the key topic of discussions at Park's back-to-back meetings with the leaders.The trip also will take Park to Mexico for a summit with President Enrique Pena Nieto next Monday.The two leaders are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, as well as how to cooperate on the faithful and effective implementation of the U.N. sanctions.","nuclear security summit president ,on wednesday for summit ,obama hosted the inaugural ,nuclear security the biennial ,inaugural summit in 2010","['Park Geun', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Barack Obama', 'Obama']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41760242  0.52961683

The meeting comes as Pyongyang has been ratcheting up tensions with threats of attacks, claims of breakthroughs in its nuclear and missile programs, and a series of missile tests.""In the trilateral meeting that President Obama will have with President Park and Prime Minister Abe, I think the question of North Korea will be front and center,"" Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken said during a discussion at the Brookings Institution.""They will focus, in particular, on implementing the UN Security Council resolution, but they'll also be discussing any additional measures that we can take either individually, or collectively, or with other countries to, again, sharpen the choice for the regime in Pyongyang. So, that will be, I think, the No. 1 topic of discussion,"" he said.Blinken stressed the importance of ""real pressure"" on the North and urged Chinese cooperation.""Unfortunately, the most effective way to achieve that, because all other ways seem to so far have failed, is to exert real pressure on North Korea and to force it to make a choice,"" he said. ""A choice between continuing these actions, or choosing a course that allows it to actually provide for its own people and develop economically. It can't have it both ways, as much as it would like to.""China should work with Washington and use its influence and leverage over Pyongyang, he said, adding that Beijing has a ""unique relationship"" with the North.Otherwise, Blinken said that China should put up with the U.S.taking steps to assure its own security, as well as security of its partners and allies, such as the potential deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system that Beijing has strongly objected to.""We've also been very clear with Beijing that ... as long as North Korea continues to take these actions and to advance its nuclear and missile programs, and as long as that's not stopped and reversed, we will have to take steps to assure our own security and that of our partners and allies,"" he said. ""None of these steps are directed against China, but it's also no secret that many of these steps are not ones that China is enthusiastic about. But we've been very, very clear that we will have to do it. The best example of that recently is the conversation that's begun with the South Koreans about the deployment of the THAAD missile system,"" he said.Rose Gottemoeller, under secretary of state for arms control and international security, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction with the way China has been working with the U.S. to put together the U.N. Security Council sanctions and implement them.""I have been quite heartened in my interactions with my Chinese counterparts about the degree in which China joins us in a very strong and intensive focus on ensuring good, solid implementation of the U.N.

On Sunday, the tourists visited Seoksan in the international business district of Songdo in Incheon where ""My Love from the Star,"" a romantic comedy about a Korean actress and her extraterritorial boyfriend, was filmed.The SBS TV drama was a runaway hit in China, bringing forth a phenomenon where fans went crazy for ""chimek,"" where ""chi"" is short for chicken and ""mek"" for ""mekju,"" or beer in Korean, the popular combination of foods that the main actress enjoyed in the drama.""It is my first time to come to Korea.

For the event, 750 six-seat tables will be arranged and some 1,500 fried chickens will be served.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the group will hold a meeting in the Songdo Convensia to boost the morale of its employees.The city of Incheon expects the visit to produce 12 billion won worth of economic effects from spending in accommodations, food and shopping. An official from the city said the city would provide its full support so as to help the visitors enjoy this visit as much as they can.""We will try our best to make good impressions on them, so that they would want to come visit Incheon again in the future,"" the official said.","000 chinese tourists all ,chinese tourists all employees ,000 chinese tourists ,chinese tourists visits incheon ,seoul the single largest","['chinese', 'Incheon', 'korean', 'chinese', 'Aolan International Beauty Group', 'China', 'Guangzhou', 'Incheon', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45452526  0.51281494

It mostly included jobs that involve repetitive tasks or which require less human communication.Professional Go player Lee Se-dol attends a press conference after completing the five-game match against AlphaGo on March 15. According to the KEIS, concrete producer topped the list, followed by butcher, rubber or plastic producer, security guard and tax payment administrator.Street cleaner and courier were also among the top 10 occupations. In Korea, there are over 40,000 couriers as of 2015, amid soaring popularity of 24/7 free shipping services nationwide.Occupations that mostly require human emotions, such as artist, sculptor, music composer, conductor and musicians, showed relatively low probabilities of being replaced by AI robots.Makeup artist, fashion designer, singer and actor are also occupations that are least likely to be replaced. Park Ga-yeol, a researcher at KEIS said, “Jobs based on human perception, creativity, decision making and social intelligence will likely survive, while jobs of automated tasks may be shared by robots.” “Robots taking over jobs of repetitive tasks can increase efficiency in our society, but humans should first come up with an institutional strategy on how to efficiently use robots in each occupation,” he added.The data on the list was collected by the Korea Network for Occupations and Workers, which based it on research from Oxford University’s Frey and Osborne model in 2013.By Kim Da-sol","robots when google artificial ,ai robots by 2020 ,ai robots when google ,when google artificial ,robots when google","['Lee Se - dol', 'AI', 'the Korea Employment Information Service', 'AI']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65152264  0.53513348

Choo Yun-kyung, a 28-year-old office worker in Seoul, enjoys browsing through the latest collection of bags on overseas shopping websites such as shopbop.com.But she often uses Korean international shopping support services websites to actually purchase items sold only via international websites, due to the convenience of having product descriptions and payment details and methods provided in Korean. “A wider range of choices is easier to view on a Korean  website. Sometimes it’s cheaper and only a few clicks away,” said Choo. International shopping support services are Korean online retailers that sell items that are sold on international websites at international prices. There are currently 538 websites in operation registered with the city’s approval of e-commerce according to Seoul Electronic Commerce Center.But despite consumers’ convenience of ordering and paying on the go, the retail prices checked on the website often change due to exchange rate fluctuations. The easy payment method also usually does not apply when trying to get things returned or refunded.And the number of complaints from consumers have been on the rise, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Thursday.A total of 4,405 complaints against international shipping support services were reported in 2015. That number is more than a fivefold increase from 2013.Of the reported complaints, 2,283, or 51.8 percent, were about the complicated process for return or refund, while 1,670, or 37.9 percent, were about inconvenience on delayed deliveries.According to the SECC, consumers in their teens reached out for help, followed by those in their 30s and 20s.“Young students who opt for overseas purchasing are easily influenced by the clothing choices of celebrities, whose fashion items are normally expensive and hard to purchase in Korea,” SECC added in a statement. Consumers and industry insiders’ calls to implement related regulations are growing, since many of the users are not aware of follow-up steps when not satisfied with purchasing overseas.Another online shopper, Park Hye-jin, said she was confused when she first noticed that a website she frequently used offered different commission fees based on the language setting. “I didn’t know it was cheaper to order items when the website setting is in English,” she said, regretting that she hadn’t known the tip earlier.According to Seoul’s public economy division, for now, it is up to the consumers to check the terms and conditions on each website.“International shopping support websites are currently classified under domestic online shopping malls, which is not exactly in keeping with such services’ characteristics,” said Choi Eun-hee from public economy division.“Specific regulations related to refund processes or international shipping should be implemented since the city  has categorized them as that king of shopping mall under current law, making actual monitoring really difficult,” added Choi.In August 2015, the Fair Trade Commission probed terms and conditions of 23 international shopping support websites and ordered them to fix regulations that were unfair to consumers.Well-known shipping support services such as eHANEX, operated by Hanjin, and 17 other companies did not post regulations on their websites regarding returning consumers’ extra costs in case of foreign exchange or changes in customs tariffs.The commission revised relevant guidelines last summer to protect consumers, such as by recommending that the services automatically notify users of changes in payment and reward methods.By Kim Da-sol","korean international shopping ,office worker in seoul ,korean international shopping support ,uses korean international shopping ,bags on overseas shopping","['Malltail', 'New Jersey', 'the United States of America', 'Yun - kyung', 'Seoul', 'korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36966765  0.26563171

In an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that despite historical and language differences, the two countries have ""many things in common,"" which would help further cement their long-standing amicable ties.""The two nations established their diplomatic relations 130 years ago and have forged a strategic partnership based upon which they have bolstered their exchanges and trade volume,"" the minister said. ""I believe the bilateral relationship is at its peak.""Ayrault arrived here on Wednesday for a three-day visit. It is his first trip to an Asian country since he was inaugurated last month as the French minister of foreign affairs and international development.His schedule here was arranged as part of the two countries' efforts to mark the 130th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic ties, which falls on June 4 this year.Having designated the period from the latter part of 2015 to the end of 2016 as the ""2015-2016 Korea-France Year,"" the two countries have been celebrating the anniversary with some 350 events in various areas including culture, education, science-technology, economy and industry.Ayrault portrayed the celebratory events taking place in both nations as ""forward-looking,"" taking note of Seoul's ""strong"" resolve to develop the bilateral relationship.""The South Korean government with a strong resolve has been striving to develop the bilateral relationship as shown in its push for the series of the events ,"" he said.""I hope that bilateral exchanges in the economy, culture and science-technology will further be strengthened. To this end, I have come here to Korea.""The minister also said that he would like to capitalize on his trip to Korea to introduce France's culture, tradition and cuisines to Koreans, and to underscore that France has made many achievements in terms of technological innovation.As for the areas of future cooperation, the French minister pointed to language education, which would help students of the two nations better understand one another and deepen their friendship.On Thursday, Ayrault will hold the first ""strategic dialogue"" with his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues including North Korea's nuclear problem. The meeting is in line with an agreement reached at last year's summit that aims to strengthen the two countries' comprehensive partnership. Last year, two-way trade reached $8.7 billion with South Korea exporting $2.6 billion worth of ships, cars, cellular phones and other products to France and importing $6.1 billion worth of aircraft, cosmetics, medicine and other items.","seoul french foreign minister ,top diplomat said wednesday ,french minister says korea ,brisk exchanges in science ,the french top diplomat","['South Korea', 'France', 'french', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Seoul', 'french', 'Jean - Marc Ayrault']",8,"[ 0.          1.          0.         ... -0.82360607  0.54710472

Before the revisions, the textbooks said the victims were ""taken"" or ""dragged"" away.On Tuesday, the two sides held working-level talks in Tokyo to discuss the implementation of last year's agreement to settle their dispute over Japan's wartime sexual slavery.""We delivered our clear position by expressing our concern and demanding a correction,"" the official with knowledge of the talks said on condition of anonymity.Under the landmark deal, Tokyo apologized and acknowledged responsibility for the crime and offered to pay 1 billion yen into a foundation to be set up by Seoul to support the victims who are euphemistically called ""comfort women.""The official admitted that the establishment of the foundation has been delayed due to ongoing talks between relevant government departments and experts.""We should proceed quickly but there's no need to rush,"" he said, adding that it's hard to provide an exact time frame.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during the war. The Korean Peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.Tuesday's talks also touched upon the two countries' cooperation in the wake of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, but there was no discussion of a military intelligence pact Japan has been eager to forge with the South, the official said.","japanese history textbooks south ,updated high school textbooks ,wednesday last week tokyo ,sexual slavery for japanese ,of japanese history textbooks","['South Korea', 'Japan', 'korean', 'japanese', 'Seoul', 'Tokyo']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35890314  0.51088333

He'd spent the past six days here on vacation with his family.""I figured out AlphaGo to some degree during our last meeting,"" the 33-year-old added.AlphaGo defeated Lee, a ninth-dan with 18 international titles, in four out of five matches in the historic man-versus-computer showdown earlier this month. Lee had confidently predicted a 4-1 or 5-0 victory for himself, but lost the first three matches against the self-learning program.Lee, who turned pro at 12, admitted he'd lost a bit of drive in the ancient board game -- called ""baduk"" in Korea -- but playing AlphaGo has rekindled the fire in him.Immediately following the Lee-AlphaGo series, the Korea Baduk Association asked Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind which designed AlphaGo, for a rematch, but Hassabis said nothing had been decided regarding AlphaGo's next steps.While the officials were trying to decide when or if Lee and AlphaGo would square off again, the player himself took his mind off the board game.""Jeju is such a beautiful place that the whole island is a great tourist destination,"" Lee said. ""If I don't play baduk, I will have to find something that will allow me to be with my family all the time.""If Lee might have been recognizable to only avid Go fans before, his match against AlphaGo turned him into a household name, an almost iconic figure who represented mankind against the computer. His newfound fame apparently prevented him from seeing the island as much as he'd like -- he's said to have spent most of his time at his hotel -- but Lee said he still enjoyed being with his family.""I just loved spending time with my daughter here,"" Lee said.""I've been coming here to relax since I was young.

She has become the first Korean nominee for the prize. ""I'm really calm. I'm going to keep writing books just in a calm and serious manner as I do now,"" Han said during an interview with Yonhap News Agency on the sidelines of the Paris Book Fair on Friday.She was one of the 30 Korean writers invited to the book fair that took place from Thursday to Sunday. South Korea was the guest of honor to mark the 130th anniversary of diplomatic ties with France.Han said she never expected the book to be longlisted for the most authoritative literary award in the English-speaking world. ""The Vegetarian was completed 11 years ago. It was nine years ago that the book was out after spending two years resolving copyright problems. It's embarrassing because it's an old book; nothing has changed with the book and neither have I.""She ascribed the nomination to the book's translator and editor.""There are language barriers in literature, but I was luckily connected to a good translator and a good editor.""Among the 13 nominees, six books will be shortlisted on April 14, and the winner will be announced on May 16.Published in 2007 in South Korea, the novel is about a modern-day Korean woman haunted by violent dreams who becomes a vegetarian. But her family and husband, in shock and disbelief, try to change her mind in forceful ways. The book has received favorable reviews from the New York Times and other overseas media since it was translated into English last year.She carefully evaluated that behind the book's overseas success is its universal theme.""I think that's because the book has a story that everyone can empathize with."" Like her previous work, ""The Vegetarian"" is in line with her constant quest for an answer to the question of ""What is human.""She said the Man Booker-nominated novel is about human violence and whether man can be a perfect being.Despite the recent acclaim of the novel, Han said that she thinks ""Human Acts,"" her 2014 novel on the bloody Gwangju democratic people's uprising of May 1980, better represents her view of literature.  Translated recently in Britain and the Netherlands, the sixth full-length novel of the author has drawn as much attention as The Vegetarian.""I'm attached to the book the most because it's my latest and I felt personal changes while writing it.""The novelist-poet is scheduled to drop her next work in the first half of this year.""It's like a poem, a novel or an essay,"" she said. The book's translation was already begun by Deborah Smith, who translated ""The Vegetarian"" even before it was released in Korea.""It's a story about life and death and of a city,"" said the author who spent about four months in Warsaw in 2014 to write the novel set in Poland. ""I can't give further details because it's title has not yet been decided.""Han said she plans to remake her 2015 short novel, roughly translated into ""Until a Snowflake is Melted,"" into a three-volume full-length novel series by next year at the latest.""What matters to me is to keep writing stories,"" she said.

""This is the first time in history that Go has earned this much attention,"" said Park Chi-moon, the vice president of the Korea Baduk Association. ""We hope this event spreads the popularity of Go.""Go, known as ""baduk"" in Korea, is a board game that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. It involves two players alternately putting black and white stones on a checkerboard-like grid of 19 lines by 19 lines. The object is to claim larger territories than one's opponent by surrounding vacant areas of the board using one's own stones.It has been known as one of the most creative games, as Go's possible number of board configurations is larger than the number of atoms in the universe. For this reason, Go has been seen as an excellent mind sport especially for those who want to exercise their brains.""I love Go,"" said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind that designed AlphaGo. ""It's the most elegant game that humans have ever invented.""In South Korea, Go became more widespread among the public since the Korea Baduk Association , the national governing body of the ancient board game, was founded in 1954. Go had its heyday in the 1980s to 1990s with local professional players collecting good results at international tournaments.When Cho Hun-hyun won the inaugural Ing Cup in 1989, becoming the first South Korean to win an international title, he even had a vehicle parade for him in Seoul. His only pupil, Lee Chang-ho, then revolutionized the scene with his exceptional skills and prompted young students to learn Go.However, the rise of computer games and Internet has pushed South Koreans away from the time-consuming and complex board game.""When Lee Chang-ho was at his prime, there were about 300 Go schools alone in Seoul, and some had more than 100 students,"" Koo Ki-ho, a public relations director at the KBA, told Yonhap News Agency last Monday. ""But there are now fewer than 100 Go schools, and only 30 to 40 students at each one.""According to data from Gallup Korea, 36.5 percent of South Korean adults in 1992 knew how to play Go. But in 2004, it fell to20.3 percent. While Lee Se-dol received the torch from Lee Chang-ho in the mid-2000s and tried to keep the public interest in Go, the portion increased slightly to 25 percent in 2013, still low compared with the game's heyday. In recent years, Go started to regain the spotlight, thanks to popular TV series.In 2014, the TV series ""Misaeng"" was a national sensation. The cable drama, which was adapted from a webtoon series, depicted a man working as an intern at a large trading company after failing to become a professional Go player. Misaeng, which literally translates to ""an incomplete life"" and also a term used in Go, often explained the protagonist's situation through moves in the ancient board game, reminding people of a proverb that ""Go is a microcosm of human life."" From November to January, the TV series ""Reply 1988"" caused more people to take an interest in Go, as one of the main characters in the drama was a Go prodigy. In the series, Choi Taek, played by actor Park Bo-gum, is known to be a character based on legendary Go player Lee Chang-ho.While these hit TV series raised public interest in Go, the South Korean Go community was struggling to find ways to keep the vibe alive and make people actually watch and play the ancient board game.Then the landmark battle between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo, which was named the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, materialized.As the matchup of the AI and the South Korean ninth-dan Go player with 18 international titles was approaching, South Korea was already feeling the fever with rising sales of Go-related products.I'Park Department Store in Yongsan, Seoul, said its board game sales from March 1 to 9 surged 115.9 percent on-year, while the online shop Auction reported that Go-related product sales from Feb. 10 to March 9 surged 30 percent over previous months. The online bookshop Aladdin said that sales of Go-related books from March 1 to 8 increased 50 percent compared with a year earlier.And the Go contest turned out to be a massive hit.For the tournament opener, which was broadcast by public channel KBS 2 starting at 1 p.m. on March 9, the nationwide viewership marked 5.5 percent, according to Nielsen Korea. This was nearly five times higher than its usual rating in that time period.By the end of the event, all three national terrestrial TV networks -- KBS, MBC and SBS -- as well as cable channels, showed the match live, which the KBA said was the first time ever for a Go match in the country.""What really surprised me was that even young women started to pay attention to Go,"" said Kim Seong-ryong, a ninth-dan player who commentated on matches. ""There is no doubt that this tournament has renewed people's interest in Go.""The fever was so hot that it even led a legendary Go player into politics during the tournament. Cho Hun-hyun, who holds the South Korean record for most Go titles with 160, joined the ruling Saenuri Party on March 10, apparently hoping to get a proportional representation ticket in the April general elections.It also prompted the country to build a national Go museum.South Jeolla Governor Lee Nak-yeon said last Wednesday that its provincial government will build a Go museum since the region is where Kim In, Cho Hun-hyun, Lee Se-dol and other national Go champions are from.Though bringing Go back to the spotlight seems to be a success, the South Korean Go community doesn't want the Lee-Alpha Go match ending up as a one-hit wonder. It wants the event to lead to growth in the Go population in the country, especially among young students.Positive signs are already coming out. Schools across the nation are saying they will have a Go club.Cheomdan Middle School in Gwangju, some 330 kilometers south of Seoul, last week announced that it has founded a Go club for the first time in the region, while three schools in Cheongju, a city130 kilometers south of Seoul, said that they will also have Go clubs no later than the first half of this year.Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education said that it has been already giving financial aid to schools that create Go clubs and offer scholarships to players who win national events. Go was designated as the official sport of the National Junior Sports Festival starting last year.""Go helps students improve their concentration and calm them psychologically,"" an official from the Gwangju education office said. ""Because of Lee's performance, we expect more Go-related activities from schools.""In light of the special Lee-AlphaGo match, the Go community here would also like to see the globalization of Go. The board game has been bigger outside of Asia the last few years, but it is still mainly played by those in South Korea, Japan and China.""I think this event has allowed Westerners to find the essence of Oriental culture,"" said Hong Seok-hyun, the chairman of the KBA.""I expect to see many Go fans in Western countries after this event.""There has been a concern that the popularity of Go will plunge as Lee lost the tournament to AlphaGo 4-1, giving the impression that Go now has been ""conquered"" by machines. But insiders said this won't be a big problem, because it has nothing to do with humans falling behind computers.""People still do the Tour de France, even though we invented a motorcycle,"" said American Go Association President Andrew Okun, who was watching the whole tournament in Seoul.

Security Council's adoption of tough sanctions against Pyongyang earlier this month, it said.The allies have been pushing to tighten the screws on Pyongyang through a reinforcement of the U.N. sanctions, each country's unilateral sanctions and international pressure on the regime.The U.S. officials are also expected to explain Washington's overall policy on North Korea, including President Barack Obama's recently issued executive order authorizing additional sanctions on Pyongyang.Ahead of the high-level session, Sung Kim and Kim Hong-kyun plan to hold separate talks during which the South Korean envoy plans to share the results of his meeting with their Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei.Kim Hong-kyun is currently in Beijing for talks with Wu.It will be his second meeting with Sung Kim in less than two weeks.

This, they said, could further help spread Korea's cultural wave of ""hallyu"" in Europe.According to the local foundation, the Korean language school in Paris is expected to be an outpost of spreading the Korean paper folding art in Europe.The two organizations said they will jointly hold the paper folding festival in early October under the theme of wishing for the peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and the promotion of world peace.Since ancient times, Koreans made paper, called ""hanji,"" from mulberry trees and used it in a variety of ways in their daily life. Paper culture is deeply associated with the intimate aspects of daily life, with the material being used in artistic ways by folding, cutting and twisting it.During the forthcoming festival, lectures will also open to teachers of the Korean language school in Paris and teachers belonging to the Federation of Korean Schools in France.Specifically, paper folding skills will be offered to children and youngsters during the festival.In addition, the two organizations also agreed to hold contests to promote K-Jongie Jupgi and paper-related culture. Attending the MOU signing event were Korean and French dignitaries including Laurence Bidar, principal of the Gustave Flaubert Middle School in Paris. The French middle school has adopted Korean as its second foreign language, a first for a French school.In her congratulatory speech, Bidar said she hopes the forthcoming Paris festival will be an opportunity for Korean paper folding culture to spread across Europe as well as France.","in paris in october ,said thursday the seoul ,festival highlighting korea traditional ,inked on wednesday local ,school in paris signed","['Korea', 'Paris', 'Seoul', 'Korea Paper Culture Foundation - World Jongie Jupgi Organization', 'the korean language', 'Paris', 'MOU', 'french', 'MOU']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50646073  0.4660075

The two leaders are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, as well as how to cooperate for the faithful and effective implementation of the U.N. sanctions.","attend nuclear security summit ,park to attend nuclear ,security summit in president ,korea over its nuclear ,summit set for march","['Park Geun', 'Washington', 'Cheong Wa Dae', 'North Korea', 'south korean']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.27538809  0.66679662

Her goal is to get a score of over 900 out of 990 before May. “I would like to discard the TOEIC stress before the format changes. Even a little change to the test template will add more burden to job seekers like me, when having one or two questions wrong affects the overall score,” the 24-year-old said. The Educational Testing Service, which is in charge of the Test of English for International Communication program, announced late last year that it would include more complicated listening and reading question types, citing the changing use of English. This is the first format change since 2006. The changes will take effect in Seoul on May 29. Despite her busy internship schedule, Cho registered for a two-week course at a TOEIC preparation academy, which will start later this month. It costs about 100,000 won , she said.  Although the ETS said the number of questions, test time and level of difficulty would remain the same, many Koreans, who are obliged to submit their scores in the test for college graduation and job-hunting, expressed concerns over the new test.According to a survey conducted by Pagoda Academy last year, 95 percent of some 900 TOEIC class students responded that the new test format would add to their burdens. “Adjusting to the new test format will take not only more time but also more cost for academy courses and textbooks. This is too much for people like us, who have to prepare other things for job-hunting such as resume, various certificates and GPA,” said another 24-year-old job seeker surnamed Shin, who is to graduate this summer. The TOEIC score has served as an essential criteria for many Koreans for their university graduation or job-hunting. Of 202 local universities which are members of Korean Council for University Education, 99 schools require students to submit the TOEIC score for graduation. Of more than 260 public and private companies that recruited new employees in the first half of last year, a total of 187 companies used the TOEIC score as part of the recruitment process, according to YBM, a private education provider which also runs TOEIC in Korea. As concerns grow over the new exam, test takers are rushing to reach their target score in the test before May. According to YBM, the number of test takers in January rebounded by 10 percent to around 2 million. It hit a high with 2.11 million in 2011, but has been declining since to below 2 million until 2014. As more test-takers are rushing for help at private institutions, the industry has taken various promotional programs and benefits to attract students. Some offer free textbooks for the first 10,000 new students while others are running a “boarding school” style program that gathers all students in a dorm and runs intensive English classes all day in a tight schedule. Consequently, the private education industry has seen a rise in the number of students. “Compared to last year, the number of students rose by more than 10 percent in the first two months this year. The online class registration also jumped by 15 percent on-year, an official at YBM Education told The Korea Herald.By Lee Hyun-jeong","final year college student ,daily studying for toeic ,hours daily studying for ,college student in seoul ,jeong final year college","['Cho Hyeon', 'Seoul', 'TOEIC', 'TOEIC']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36564049  0.27058139

244,244,244,[HERALD INTERVIEW] ‘Business engagement key to conservation’,"It is not just up to individuals to conserve nature, industries have an important role to play too, says the Korean office of global conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature.

In an interview with The Korea Herald, WWF-Korea’s CEO Simon Yoon said, “About 1.2 billion of the 7 billion world population are major consumers who pollute the environment. Meanwhile, about 500 major global conglomerates make up 70 percent of the total priority commodity market. Which party do you think would be more effective and able to make changes faster? The 1.2 billion people or the 500 companies?”Both parties are crucial, however, motivating the 500 companies to step up would yield significantly faster results, he said. World Wide Fund for Nature Korea CEO Simon Yoon WWF, established in 1961, is one of the world’s largest independent conservation organizations, with over 5 million supporters and a global network active in more than 100 countries. WWF-Korea was established in March 2014. Yoon has been its CEO since August last year. The 56-year-old was a former Yahoo Korea COO and a former Overture Korea CEO. “WWF-Korea is a performance-driven and execution-focused organization. It is hard to succeed in the nature conservation campaign and bring about fruitful results without efficient operations through meticulous strategies,” he said. While the global organization mainly focuses on six areas -- oceans, water, forests, wildlife, food, and climate and energy -- the Korean office pays particular attention to oceans, climate and energy, he said. Yoon has put efforts into raising awareness about the importance of lifestyle changes to curb climate change and conserve nature. “If Koreans keep up their current lifestyles, we will need 2.5 earths to sustain it. Globally, we need 1.6 earths to regenerate the natural resources that we use now. It’s crucial to think about how we can change lifestyles and sustain our one and only earth,” Yoon said. To encourage the public to pursue an environmentally friendly way of life, the CEO first highlighted the need to persuade various industries to participate in the organization’s project called “Market Transformation Initiative.” “With science-based data that WWF has accumulated, I work to persuade priority commodities to pursue responsible management and to adopt an independent and credible certification system,” he added. Under this project, certification is given by independent non-profit organizations to businesses that follow sustainable and strict environment-friendly production rules. These include the Forest Stewardship Council  for the timber/paper industry, the Marine Stewardship Council  for seafood and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council .“Among the world’s overall supply, 55 percent of the recycled paper industry acquired certification and 53 percent of the white fish market gained certification too, making the industry more sustainable and enabling consumers to make smarter choices. The rate of such certification in Korea, however, is less than 5 percent in the market,” the CEO noted. Through various channels, Yoon has also been trying to spread awareness on the importance of making smart choices that lead to better lifestyles. Yoon has been pushing to launch “Living Planet Platform,” a digital platform that integrates massive research data and studies collected across all of WWF’s international offices for public use. So far, there has been no such platform that allows the public to view comprehensive data by the WWF, including its visual contents. “We are attempting to provide a ‘content journey’ for the public to see and think about how they can make changes. Rather than just saying ‘don’t waste resources’ through demonstrations, I believe it is more effective to have them realize the reality through contents.” WWF-Korea also released a full translated text of the WWF’s biannual Living Planet Report for the first time in Asia in 2014. To promote collective efforts in conservation, various events are also being held in Korea. The Seoul office will host the WWF CEO and Board Conference from March 6-8 to share its knowledge and experiences of seeking innovative sustainability strategies. Thirty-eight CEOs are planning to visit this event. Under the theme of “Innovation, Sustainable Cities and Green Growth,” the annual forum will offer a number of sharing sessions, including one by the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute Director-General Yvo de Boer. WWF’s signature lights-off event, “Earth Hour,” which is done annually, will also be held on March 19. Last year, about 1 billion people across 7,000 cities in 172 countries participated in the event which aims to raise awareness about saving energy, the office added. “Panda Talks,” an environmental version of TED, which is a non-profit organization that aims to promote ideas through talks, is also slated to be hosted by WWF Korea in September in Seoul. Besides public awareness, Yoon is also seeking to expand fundraising in Seoul. “We have about active 8,000 donors supporting our office, but we still have a long way to go. We are planning to encourage the noblesse oblige in various fields,” he said. All in all, his aim is simple -- to help society seek the “One-Planet Lifestyle.”“As the world’s seventh largest carbon emitter, Korea needs to collectively show responsibility for nature.

Human Rights Council in Geneva, Yun deplored the human rights situation in North Korea, saying many North Koreans are risking their lives in search of ""freedom and human dignity.""The speech was also expected to touch on the issue of the ""comfort women,"" a euphemistic term for the Korean women forced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II, as it came only months after the two countries reached an agreement to resolve the issue.Yun, however, stopped short of mentioning the victims, saying only that South Korea will continue efforts to tackle ""sexual violence against women during times of conflict.""The remarks were a sharp contrast to his speech before the same council two years ago, during which he accused Japan's Shinzo Abe administration of refusing to face up to its wartime atrocities.Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese troops during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.Speaking to Yonhap News Agency in Geneva, Yun said he aimed to highlight North Korea's human rights situation in this year's speech.""I approached the comfort women issue from the multilateral level of wartime sexual violence against women rather than the bilateral level, considering the speech was at the U.N.,"" he said.Under December's deal, South Korea and Japan agreed to refrain from criticizing each other over the comfort women issue at then U.N. and other international forums if the terms of the agreement are fully implemented.The verbal agreement included Japan's acknowledgment of responsibility for the crime, Abe's apology to the victims and Tokyo's pledge to pay 1 billion yen  into a fund that will support the South Korean women.The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, a progressive civic group campaigning for the victims' interests, expressed outrage at Yun's speech.""The government of the Republic of Korea, even though it's not a Japanese colony nor a U.S. colony, has no regard for the victims or the people but goes out of its way not to upset ,"" Yoon Mee-hyang, the council's co-chief, wrote in a Facebook posting.""Minister Yun should have at least told Japan to stop its reckless words and activities that damage the victims' human rights and honor.""In the months following the agreement, Japan has made repeated statements denying the forced nature of the sex slavery, leading some of the victims and their supporters to demand the deal be scrapped.The strong response highlights the division that the issue fuels in South Korea. Progressives have generally condemned the pact, while conservatives have countered that certain elements of society are using the sexual slavery issue to further their political agendas and stoke national discord.Conservative groups like the Citizens's United for Better Society said opponents of the South Korea-Japan accord should do more to look after the well-being of victims and try to help them find peace of mind. ""If people wanted to truly help the victims, they should not nudge them to carry out street protests,"" a group spokesman said.Only 44 South Korean survivors are currently known to be alive, with most suffering from poor health.","enslavement of korean women ,minister skips comfort women ,keynote speech on wednesday ,japan wartime sexual enslavement ,sexual enslavement of korean","['Yun Byung - se', 'Japan', 'korean', 'the United Nations', 'the U.N.

The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles delving into the reality and the country’s efforts to restrain the violence. This is the third installment. -- Ed.A police officer teaches children how to report child abuse cases at a school in Gwangju on Feb. 23. Child abuse counselor Lee Tae-ho remembers when he and other police officers were dispatched to an apartment in Seoul in October 2014 after a neighbor reported the sounds of a child being beaten on the floor below.They found a mother in her 40s hitting her 10-year-old daughter with a rice paddle for not getting a perfect score on a school exam. When Lee tried to intervene, the mother resisted, claiming it was her way of disciplining her child.Corporal punishment, or “rod of love,” remains the most common justification behind what escalates into child abuse, according to the counselor.“The mother, after several rounds of counseling, said she used to think of her daughter as her possession, not as an individual person. Her unrealistic expectations for her child led to child abuse in this case,” said Lee, who works for the National Child Protection Agency.A total of 10,027 cases of child abuse were reported in 2014, according to the latest statistics available at the Health and Welfare Ministry. From 2004 to 2013, a total of 95,622 child abuse cases were reported to child protect agencies, the Korean Institute of Criminology’s report shows, with more than 55,000 cases confirmed. This indicated that an average of 15.2 child maltreatment cases happened daily.Of abuse cases reported from 2004-2013, 83 percent were perpetrated by the parents. Such cases rose sharply, by 72 percent overall from 3,167 in 2004 to 5,454 in 2013. Separate data from the government also showed that a total of 148 children died of abuse from 2001 to the first half of last year. Discipline or child abuse?A 47-year-old pastor  and stepmother  are taken into custody for beating their 13-year-old daughter to death and hiding the body for 11 months in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 4. The deceased girl’s aunt  is also charged with abusing the child. Physical punishment is considered a traditional method of discipline in South Korea.While most municipalities have banned corporal punishment in schools since 2008, physical punishment at home is still debated here -- whether parents have the right or whether the form of discipline is even effective or constructive.“Traditional Confucian culture has emphasized the parents’ duty to teach and discipline their children for a better future, whereas the children’s rights as individuals have not been respected,” said Lee Bae-keun, president of the Korea Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.“Such social consensus over parents’ rights and duty to discipline their children has silently allowed them to physically punish the children with the so-called ‘rod of love,’” said Lee.Experts pointed out that despite the prevalent discipline culture, there is a clear difference between discipline and abuse.“Although the line may be ambiguous, child abuse is usually repetitive and persistent, unlike discipline. The intensity of the punishment is also much stronger. Children who get punished sense for themselves first whether they are being abused or disciplined,” said social welfare professor Kim Jun-hwan of Chung Cheong University.Lee of KAPCAN noted, “The discipline is only successful when empathy is shared first. Children must be persuaded as to why they are being punished.”This year, a series of extreme child abuse cases leading to the death of the children at the hands of their parents reignited the debate as to whether Korean society’s relatively lenient attitude toward physical discipline runs counter to the protection of the young from violence.Last month, a 42-year-old mother surnamed Park in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province, was arrested for allegedly beating her 7-year-old daughter to death and leaving the child tied to a chair overnight. The mother claimed she had attempted to discipline the child for damaging the furniture. Police decided to charge the mother for violating the child protection law, killing the victim and abandoning the body. Prosecutors are currently looking into adding a murder charge.“Many parents do not realize that small physical punishment is the start of child abuse. Once the abuse continues over three years, it is difficult to stop it,” said NCPA counselor Lee. Physical punishment at home has been banned in 48 countries, starting with Sweden in 1979, Finland in 1983 and Norway in 1987.As part of efforts to better protect children’s rights, the Korean government revised the Child Welfare Act in February last year and banned any kind of “physical, verbal or mental abuse against children.” “Although the regulation now legally prohibits physical punishment, civil law still leaves room for potential physical child abuse. There’s a social consensus that physical punishment is justifiable for ‘child discipline,’” said lawyer Sin Su-kyung of the NCPA. Article 915 of Korean civil law, which stipulates parental authority, allows for a person with parental authority to protect and educate children, or “take necessary disciplinary action” against children. Public obsession with parental rights Police officers recover the body of a 7-year-old who was beaten to death by her 42-year-old mother and buried in a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, on Feb. 15. It is only recently that the South Korean government has started acknowledging cases where children must be protected from their parents.In September 2014, the government allowed prosecutors to restrict or take away parental rights of parents if they habitually abuse their children or cause serious injury. It also strengthened the penalty for child abuse to a minimum five years of prison and up to life imprisonment if the abuse leads to death. Once child maltreatment is confirmed on the spot, police officers and child protection officials are allowed to separate children from their parents and temporarily restrict the parental rights. Public child protection agencies automatically become guardians for the children. The parental rights restriction, however, has seen very limited use due mainly to the cultural obsession with parental rights, experts pointed out. “Many Korean parents misunderstand ‘parental rights’ as their right to ‘possess’ their children. But it actually exists to mandate the parents to ‘protect’ their children. If parents fail to protect their children, it is reasonable to restrict the rights until they are ready to protect them. But many consider restricting parental rights as cutting the blood relationship,” Sin said. “As parental rights have been a symbol of the blood relationship, authorities have been cautious of strictly taking restriction measures.” According to the Supreme Court’s data in 2014, parental rights restrictions or separation measures were only imposed on 37 child abuse cases in the first year the measure was introduced. This accounted for 0.9 percent of the total child abuse cases of the year.“Koreans must abandon the ‘fantasy’ about parental rights. Parental rights restriction does not mean the end of their ties. Temporary restriction just means that public agencies will have the representative authority to protect the children,” Sin said.Limited anti-child abuse measures Amid growing awareness over child abuse upon a series of heinous crimes committed by parents against their children, the government has been toughening anti-child abuse measures.The police vowed last month to expand the number of child abuse investigators, while the Seoul Central District Court installed a new justice department dedicated to child abuse cases. To better uncover hidden child abuse cases, the Education Ministry mandated schools report whenever a student is absent for more than three days consecutively.To broaden the search for victims of child abuse in blind spots, the ministry also vowed to cooperate with district offices to find children who had never been registered for school.The Welfare Ministry announced Thursday it would conduct on-site monitoring of infants who do not have medical checkup records in order to look into cases of parents neglecting their health care duty. While the government has stepped up efforts to better expose and curb child abuse cases with tougher punishments, other steps must be carried out in conjunction in order to effectively root out child abuse, experts said. “Most of the state’s child abuse programs are victim-oriented, such as psychological counseling. As important as the treatment programs are for the victims, those for child abusers are crucial, as many offenders were once victims,” professor Kim said. According to the Welfare Ministry, 536 of 10,000 child abuse offenders in 2014 were previously victims of child abuse. About 33 percent of the offenders responded that they did not know correct parenting skills.“Other than physical punishment, most offenders are ignorant as to how to discipline their children. In terms of the whole society, there’s a need to have an education infrastructure to train proper parenting skills for all parents,” Sin added.

His visit is aimed at coordinating the countries' response to North Korea's recent provocations.""The two countries agreed to support the U.N. Security Council's adoption of a new resolution in response to the North's nuclear test and satellite launch,"" Wu told reporters after the meeting, adding Seoul and Beijing aim to make a joint effort for peace on the Korean Peninsula.The United States and China have put together the draft resolution that is expected to be circulated soon among the other U.N. Security Council members for review. Hwang also said after the meeting, ""We have reached a consensus that the North needs to make qualitative improvement in thoughts and actions.""The dialogue between the countries' chief negotiators for the long-stalled six-party talks on denuclearizing North Korea came after Washington and Beijing agreed on a set of stringent draft sanctions on North Korea for the recent tests.As strategic partners, China and South Korea could discuss any kinds of issues between us,"" Wu said after arriving at Incheon International Airport earlier in the day. On Jan. 6, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in defiance of United Nations resolutions and followed it up with a long-range rocket launch a month later.The North said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but the outside world regards it as a cover for testing its long-range missile technology.The planned talks between Hwang and Wu will likely touch upon some thorny issues between the neighbors, including how to jointly push North Korea into compliance with a fresh U.N. resolution.Following the two recent provocations by the North, Seoul has been determined to put more pressure on Pyongyang, but Beijing has stricken a slightly different tone, highlighting dialogue over pressure. The talks will likely be dominated by other salient issues, including the United States' push to deploy its advanced missile defense system, known as THAAD, in South Korea, which is strongly opposed by China.

Organized and published by the Seoul National University Hospital, the research only analyzed symptoms among menopausal women. It conducted research on 4,066 menopausal women who had been tested for bone density between 2008 and 2011. According to the study, those who drank less than a single cup of coffee daily had a 21 percent lower chance of developing osteoporosis compared to those who did not drink coffee at all. Notably, menopausal women who drank a single cup of coffee a day had a 33 percent lower chance of developing the condition. Those who drank two cups of the beverage had a 36 percent lower chance of developing the disease.Drinking too much coffee had previously been said to rob the body of necessary nutrients, such as calcium, needed to maintain bone health. But Dr. Park Sang-min, who organized the research, said drinking coffee can improve a woman’s bone health as long as she does not drink it too much. “It is unlikely that a woman would develop osteoporosis by drinking coffee unless she drinks more than three glasses  daily,” he said.Menopause is known to increase a woman’s risk of developing osteoporosis, as the drop in estrogen levels during and after menopause results in higher bone loss. Park explained that coffee contains phytoestrogens, which are chemicals found in plants that sometimes act like the hormone estrogen in the human body. This may help prevent a number of menopausal conditions including osteoporosis.","news coffee can reduce ,research on 066 menopausal ,korean study showed wednesday ,coffee can reduce risk ,two cups of coffee","['south korean', 'the Seoul National University Hospital']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45745447  0.44101784

Dubbed ""Little Lee Sang-hwa"" after the two-time reigning Olympic 500m champion and world record holder, Kim said she still has a lot to do to catch up to her role model.""There are more races coming up, and my goal this week is to experience what it's like to compete at an international event of this magnitude,"" Kim said at the pre-competition press conference at the rink. ""Though I am still young, I want to show people my potential for further development. I won't be trying to beat anyone in particular. I just want to post times that I can be satisfied with.""The teenager said she'd like to improve her power and her posture so she can follow in Lee's footsteps. Lee, who isn't competing this week after losing her national team eligibility, is the first South Korean female to win an Olympic speed skating gold, and recently captured her third 500m title at the ISU World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships in Russia.""Even up against the best of the best, Lee always records a really good split over the first 100m,"" Kim said. ""That's one of my weak areas, and I'd like to become as fast. She has also stayed at the top of her game for a long time, and I admire her longevity and consistency.""Kim Tae-yun, 21, hasn't quite garnered the spotlight that Kim Min-sun has, but his progress has been no less impressive. At the single distances championships, Kim finished sixth in the 500m and ninth in the 1,000m, both the best showings of his young career.If Kim Min-sun has the makings of a new Lee Sang-hwa, then Kim Tae-yun may just become the next Mo Tae-bum, who won the 2010 Olympic gold in the 500m and later added two world titles in the same distance.""I don't mind that moniker,"" Kim said of the veteran who pulled out of the competition with a back injury. ""I don't know if I can surpass his records, but I will do my best. I need to have more racing experience and keep working harder and harder.""Kim said he isn't realistically looking to win a medal on home ice this week, but he's eyeing ""a top-five finish.""""For this season, I've improved my agility and power,"" he added. ""I think I've gotten much better over the first 100m. But I am not feeling any pressure at this competition.""","most promising young skaters ,skating championships this weekend ,sprint speed skating championships ,world sprint speed skating ,world fastest on ice","['South Korea', 'the International Skating Union', 'Kim Min - sun', 'Kim Tae - yun', 'Taereung International Skating']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59402174  0.21433492

They were two of hundreds of thousands of girls and young women who were systematically raped in front-line brothels under the pretext of providing ""comfort"" to Japanese troops.Their stories, tragic and uncomfortable, are the theme of the War and Women's Human Rights Museum in western Seoul, which opened about four years ago to reflect and provide education on that unforgettable past.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were coerced into sexual servitude at ""comfort stations""across Asia. The Korean Peninsula, which was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45, was brutally victimized.The museum tour begins as you push open a heavy gray door to the sound of gunfire and marching troops. Transport yourself to the thick of the war as you step outside onto a narrow gravel path lined by two concrete walls -- one side, a silhouetted image of a row of girls apparently being dragged to their yet unknown fates, and the other, a grim display of protruding faces and handprints of some of the victims in their later years. Though the eyes and mouths are shut, the expressions, wrinkles and outstretched fingers seem to cry out for release -- both from the painful memories and the scarred bodies.Down a flight of stairs, another gray door opens up to a dark room in the basement, where visitors meet an onscreen victim.""I was standing at a station, and they took me away,"" says Hong Kang-lim, in a filmed interview. ""My older brother started to cry.They made me sell myself. I didn't get paid. You know how the Japanese beat people. If I didn't sell myself properly, they beat me.""Choking up, she adds, ""I have all kinds of illnesses."" She takes a drag from her cigarette.According to that day's admission ticket, Hong was born in Gimcheon, North Gyeongsang Province, in 1922. After being taken to China in 1938, she was subjected to sexual slavery in various cities across the country until the end of the war. Even then, she was unable to return home and later died in China.Although 238 former sex slaves registered with the government following the first public testimony in 1991, many others remained silent for fear of social discrimination and shame.The museum's admission tickets are printed with the photos and stories of different ""comfort women,"" whom visitors then get to meet through videos.From the basement, a flight of stairs leads up to the first and second floors. Mounted on the stairway walls are photos and quotes of the victims, some in English, others in Korean and some in Japanese.""How bitter a life I shall live. Bring my youth back!"" reads one message.""If I remembered all of it, I probably wouldn't be able to live,"" says another.The higher up you go, out of the darkness and into the light streaming in through the glass ceiling above, the messages become brighter too.""I want to become hope for the women who are suffering from the same pain as mine,"" says one.""Our children must live in a peaceful world,"" reads another.Stepping onto the second floor, visitors are guided to an exhibition of documents and artifacts dating back to the times the comfort stations were in operation.Among them are entrance tickets to a comfort station, a condom named ""Assault No. 1"" and a diary in which a Japanese soldier describes his experience of going to a comfort station with his friends.A large painting helps visitors visualize what a comfort station looked like, with cubicles for the sex slaves; rows of soldiers standing outside each door, waiting for their turn; and a row of girls waiting on one side to undergo a checkup for venereal diseases.""According to Japanese military documents, there was an order to mobilize one woman for every 100 soldiers,"" said Yoon Mee-hyang, co-chief of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. ""One person couldn't handle 100, so among the dealers, it became 29:1.""On the painting is a table dividing soldiers by rank -- privates got between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to use the comfort stations for 30 minutes at a time; noncommissioned officers from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., also for half an hour; and officers between 7 p.m. and midnight for an hour of ""entertainment time.""The issue of the comfort women has long been a thorn in relations between South Korea and Japan, with Seoul demanding an official apology, acknowledgment of responsibility and reparations for the victims.The two sides struck a deal in December to resolve the dispute once and for all if Tokyo meets all demands.Both sides hailed the agreement as a landmark deal, but some victims and their supporters have since demanded it be scrapped, arguing Tokyo did not take legal responsibility for the crime.Yoon said that the campaign will continue, especially as the Japanese government has already damaged the deal by again denying the forced nature of the sex slaves' mobilization.At the end of the tour, entering the first floor of the museum, a song plays in the background as if to soothe the souls of those already gone and offer hope to those still living. Only 44 known survivors remain.""Everything's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright.""","sex slaves die museum ,former sex slaves die ,sex for japanese soldiers ,sex slaves die ,two south korean women","['south korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26930371  0.22817814

On Feb.7, the two countries said that they would discuss the stationing of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in the country, in light of rising inter-Korea tension sparked by North Korea’s nuclear testing and a long-range rocket launch.“Discussions about the composition and operation  are in progress. We will inform  when it is completed,” said Moon Sang-kyun, the spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense on Monday.Earlier in the day, local media -- citing a government official -- reported that the allies plan to hold the first working group meeting by the end of this week. Last week, the military had announced that it was aiming to kick things off by the end of that week.  Such contradicting reports indicate the complicated nature of the talks over issues such as possible health hazards from THAAD’s radar and whether South Korea will shoulder some of the costs.Although the Defense Ministry has said that the U.S. will shoulder the operating costs of THAAD, rumors have emerged that the Seoul government is planning to buy the system.Defense Ministry spokesman Moon flatly denied it, and reiterated his denial of the allies hitting some bumps in the talks. Environment and health concerns have led to protestsin some areas where THAAD could be potentially deployed. Won Chang-muk, the mayor of Wonju, Gangwon Province, said Monday that he will “throw himself with citizens of Wonju” to ensure that THAAD is not deployed in his city.But some experts said that the late talks may simply be because the allies are waiting for an opportune time.Kim Yeol-su, a professor of international politics professor at Sungshin Women’s University, suspected that the delay was to avoid putting too much pressure on China, which is opposed to stationing THAAD here on concerns that the system is intended to target its mainland.By Yoon Min-sik","protracted preparation to launch ,two weeks after th ,south korean government officials ,talks reflect bumpy road ,negotiations over the deployment",['south korean'],8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16057551  0.46634623

But all of the agencies his interlocutors belong to are involved in the THAAD issue. That suggests the trip has something to do with the matter. On March 6, Rose will also lead the U.S. delegation in the U.S.-South Korea Space Policy Dialogue, it said.Shortly after North Korea's Feb. 7 long-range missile launch, South Korea and the U.S. jointly announced they would begin official discussions on the possible placement of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  missile defense system in South Korea. That ended more than a year of soul-searching by Seoul over how to deal with the issue amid Washington's desire to deploy the system and China's intense opposition to it. The North's twin provocations of its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and the missile test a month later gave Seoul justification for the decision. China has claimed THAAD can be used against it, despite repeated assurances from Washington that the system is aimed only at deterring North Korean threats. Beijing expressed regret after the South and the U.S. announced the decision to hold THAAD talks. Despite the decision to begin official consultations, the two countries have insisted that they have not launched those talks yet.","visit seoul next week ,diplomat to visit korea ,seoul next week for ,in seoul from march ,seoul next week","['U.S.', 'Seoul', 'american', 'the State Department', 'Frank Rose', 'Seoul']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.71963394  0.36611131

She was denied entry to a bar in Hongdae, Seoul, because she was a foreigner.  Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea HeraldThe bar named Green Light, infamous in the expat community for refusing foreign customers, is one of a rising number of Korean-style dating joints where people meet blind dates and one-night stands over beer and soju.“Only Koreans are allowed because our employees cannot communicate in English,” reads a sign at the door.“When I asked in Korean, not in English, whether I could get in if I spoke the language, I was still told I wasn’t allowed,” Stuckey told The Korea Herald. “It’s frustrating as someone who puts the time and effort into learning the language and culture of Korea to be denied entry just because I don’t look Korean,” said Stuckey, who can hold a basic conversation in Korean and teaches English in a public school. One of the bouncers guarding the door told The Korea Herald that it was not at all their intention to discriminate against foreigners. It was rather their business policy to attract Korean patrons only. Ock Hyun-ju/The Korea Herald“I know that some people think it is racist policy, we really do feel bad,” the 20-something bouncer said.Another English teacher, 24, from New Zealand, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the “weird” sign would be illegal and offensive back home. “Korea is vastly developed in technology and economic pursuits but still a little underdeveloped in cultural acceptance and knowledge of the outside world,” he said.According to several foreign residents The Korea Herald contacted, Korean-only bars are not a general trend, but they exist across the nation, creating perpetual controversy over racism.AU, the biggest club in Daegu, a city near one of the U.S. Army bases, said it decided to restrict foreign patrons’ entry after several cases of theft and sexual harassment by foreign patrons. “Once the club starts receiving foreign customers selectively, it could become really complicated,” a manager at the club said. “So we deny entry for all foreigners to the club as a preventive measure.”A manager of another club in Busan said that it enforced a ban because foreign customers did not respect club rules. “We refuse foreigners who do not respect the dress code. We also reject Koreans for the same reason. It is just that Koreans understand what we say and do not challenge the policy,” the manager said. “But foreigners who cannot speak Korean fail to get the point, get mad and keep resisting the rule. They just do not listen.” A 33-year-old American, who lived in Korea for eight years, said that the longer foreigners live here, the more they can understand it is not usually Koreans trying to discriminate.“Bars and clubs are a social business. They have a certain motivation to go after an atmosphere they want for their business,” he said. “I think when there’s something you want, but you cannot get it, it is much easier to say ‘racism’ than to understand why.” But a 30-year-old woman from the U.S., who was turned down at one of the dating bars around Konkuk University last December, berated the bars for generalizing. “On any given night of the week, I see Koreans behaving pretty badly as well,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that the entire race of Koreans should suffer the consequences.” Korea, a largely homogenous country until the recent rise in number of multicultural families, still lags in catching up to international standards in terms of racism and diversity. There is still no law mandating equal opportunity or preventing people from being discriminated against based on race, religion or sexuality.The bars and clubs excluding foreign patrons cite freedom of private businesses to decide which customers they serve at their venues.“I know that a few clubs in Hongdae refuse to accept foreigners, especially American soldiers, based on their past experiences. They have suffered from the U.S. soldiers getting into brawls and creating a ruckus,” said Kim Jung-hyun, head of the Hongdae Tourism and Culture Association. “But it is not a matter of racism. It is up to business owners to determine who to let in.” According to police data, the number of crimes committed by the U.S. soldiers in Hongdae stood at 19 in the first half of last year. In comparison, some 150 crimes were committed by Koreans against foreign visitors in Busan in a 10-day-period earlier this month, according to the district police. They included theft, fraud and assault.Ordinary Koreans were split over the decision by bars and clubs to keep foreigners out, with some calling it an embarrassment while others blamed it on cultural differences. “As someone who has seen foreign men getting into fights on the streets, I understand why some bars ban them from entering,” said a Lee Jin-hee, a 22-year-old student, looking for a bar in the clubbing area of Hongdae. “If they spoke Korean, or at least tried to learn Korean culture and manners, they would not be denied.”But many Koreans like a 29-year-old office worker, surnamed Choi, see such Korean-only policies as shameful. “I would feel bad if I was refused entry because of my race,” Choi said after seeing a group of foreigners being denied entry to the bar. “Under any circumstances, discrimination should not be allowed.” Some observers said such a policy may reflect intentional racism, but could also be simply out of ignorance.“Koreans are often not aware of what can amount to racial discrimination,” an official from National Human Rights Commission of Korea said.The state-run watchdog has received a few complaints about discriminatory practices in the nightlife scene and opened investigations into the cases. “Banning foreigners from a bar because of negative perceptions is not a reasonable reason for discrimination,” the NHRC official said. “Such discrimination could be considered a human rights violation and racism.” In 2014, a pub in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by foreigners, caused controversy after posting handwritten signs that read, “We apologize but due to the Ebola virus, we are not accepting Africans at the moment.” The signs went viral on Twitter and Facebook, drawing fury from the expat community.“Racial diversity is a relatively new concept in Korea and therefore xenophobia is not effectively punished,” the official said. “But when the businesses owners learn it could be seen as discrimination, they quickly correct themselves.” Bills such as an antidiscrimination law aimed at rooting out bigotry on such grounds as gender, disability, age, race, marital status and religion have been submitted to the National Assembly since 2007 to uphold the Korean Constitution’s value of equality. But they remain deadlocked in the face of Protestant groups’ fierce resistance to equal rights for sexual minorities.“Without an antidiscrimination act, the human rights commission only has restricted power to fix discriminatory practices based on race,” he said. “The enactment of the law could raise people’s awareness of racism.”As of December 2015, 1.47 million foreign nationals reside in Korea, about 2.9 percent of the entire population of 51 million. “Koreans get enraged about bars and clubs abroad discriminating against Asians. Somewhere else, we are also foreigners and outsiders. Everyone in Korea, whether poor or rich, Asian or white, is subject to freedom of choice,” said Yang Eun-sun, public engagement manager at the Korea office of Amnesty International. “But we should be careful with the enactment of the antidiscrimination law because its loopholes could end up offering grounds for ‘legal’ discrimination.” By Ock Hyun-ju","hurtful experiences in korea ,controversy on chilly friday ,people meet blind dates ,hongdae seoul because she ,chilly friday night last","['U.S.', 'Megan Stuckey', 'Korea', 'Hongdae', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Green Light', 'korean']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.44681105  0.30333582

Security Council, and discussed unilateral measures to take in addition to U.N. sanctions, the official said on the condition of anonymity.   For more than a month, since the North's Jan. 6 nuclear test, the Security Council has been struggling in negotiations to come up with a new sanctions resolution on the North because China has been reluctant to impose harsh measures on Pyongyang.   Amid the deadlock, the North flouted the Security Council again with a banned missile launch on Feb. 7.   Beijing has condemned the North's nuclear and missile tests but has been lukewarm about calls for a stern response. Analysts have long said Beijing fears that pushing Pyongyang too hard could lead to its collapse, instability on its border and ultimately the emergence of a pro-U.S. nation.    Chinese cooperation is key to implementing a meaningful sanctions resolution as it is one of the five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the main provider of food and fuel aid to the impoverished North.    ""We're now at a point of in-depth consultations where the possibility of adopting a resolution stronger than before is in sight,"" the official said.   Asked if Chinese cooperation in efforts to pressure the North is tied to the potential deployment of the U.S. THAAD missile defense system to the South, the official said the two matters are separate, and Seoul is considering THAAD according to its own security needs.   In an interview with PBS television on Wednesday, Blinken said that unless China uses its leverage over the North, the U.S. will take steps to ratchet up pressure in our own defense and in defense of our partners, such as deploying THAAD to the South.   The remark touched off speculation that the two issues are linked.   ""We have now entered into active consultations with our South Korean partners and allies on the deployment of a THAAD missile defense system, not directed at China. This actually won't affect China strategically,"" Blinken said.    ""They don't see it that way. They view it as a problem. We said, look, if you are not going to take responsibility for helping to deal with North Korea and getting them to change their behavior and engage in meaningful, denuclearization talks, we have to take these kinds of steps,"" he said.   Blinken also said the U.S. is focused on ""getting the strongest possible Security Council resolution but a resolution with real teeth."" He called for China to play a greater role, saying there are many areas where China could put the squeeze on the North Koreans and at least ""have a chance of getting them to rethink.""   ""We are making a little bit of progress but, look, I believe at the end of the day they will come around to a strong Security Council resolution,"" Blinken said.","of south korea presidential ,their north korea policies ,south korea presidential ,than dialogue south korea ,south korea presidential national","['South Korea', 'the United States', 'North Korea', 'Cho Tae - yong', ""South Korea 's"", 'State']",8,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.76133472  0.20509602

""These girls, McDougall recalls, were not Japanese but a multi ethnic group,"" the report said.Frederick Arblaster, an Australian translator who assisted the troops with post-surrender interrogations, once asked a Japanese officer about the women he encountered, only to hear that they were Red Cross and hospital nurses.Remembering the women's clothes and powdered faces, Arblaster regretted having failed to ask more about them, according to the report. The report is based on spoken, written and visual records left by allied troops and civilians on comfort women, held by the Imperial War Museum in Britain and the Australian War Memorial.""The material presented here is, I think, just the tip of an iceberg of third party testimony to the history of the comfort women',"" Morris-Suzuki wrote in the report. ""Much has surely been lost, or soon will be, as the generation with personal memories of the war disappears.""  The report, titled ""You Don't Want to Know About the Girls? The 'Comfort Women,' the Japanese Military and Allied Forces in the Asia-Pacific War,"" was published at the Asia-Pacific Journal in August 2015.Its Korean-translated version, the first of its kind to introduce testimonies by allied forces, will be available at a local quarterly journal at the end of this month.""The study on Japanese comfort women has relied heavily on the testimonies made by the victims so far,"" said Kim Min-cheol, a researcher at the Center for Historical Truth and Justice. ""As  report confirmed the existence of Japanese sex slaves in allied soldiers' testimonies, a follow-up study is important,"" he added.The issue of the ""comfort women,"" a euphemistic term for the former sex slaves, has been a major thorn in South Korea and Japan's relations.In December, Seoul and Tokyo reached a landmark accord to end their dispute with Japan's acknowledgment of responsibility, an apology from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japan's offer of 1 billion yen  in reparations to the victims.The deal sparked protests among some victims and their supporters, who said the government failed to hold Japan legally accountable in the deal and failed to consult with them beforehand.Historians estimate that more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945.","japanese army brothels in ,to japanese army brothels ,japanese army brothels ,sexually enslaved by tokyo ,professor of japanese history","['the Allied Forces', 'Tokyo', 'Tessa Morris - Suzuki', 'japanese', 'Australian National University', 'Angus McDougall', 'australian', 'japanese']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46221963  0.46846712

Yu Min-yeong “The readiness would determine your utility of the ‘golden hour’ and post crisis resilience, which are absolutely important, as well as the speed.” Yu picked wishful thinking and the hierarchy within organizations, both public and private, as two key culprits behind the recent series of nationwide crises, including the 2014 Sewol ferry tragedy and 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. “The two disasters raised alarm at the time, but as society returned to normal, the disasters did not lead to new preparations and rebuilding efforts. Instead there is the wishful thinking that it is possible to just get by even though another disaster might break out,” he said.  The 47-year-old expert made his foray into public affairs in the late 1990s as an aide to Kim Geun-tae, the late prominent democracy activist and liberal lawmaker. He also served the Roh Moo-hyun administration including as chief of the Cheong Wa Dae press center Chunchugwan. After working as the spokesperson of Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo in 2012, he cofounded the Seoul-based consultancy. Yu also taught at Hallym University of Graduate Studies in Seoul and coauthored the April 2015 book, “Reputation Society.”In recent years, the concoction of smartphones and social media has brought a fundamental shift to communication dynamics, imposing a fresh interpretation to the term “public,” he said. “I have learned about the world of public and political affairs from my previous careers especially at Cheong Wa Dae, but the influence of public opinion only continues to grow in the era of excess and unlimited connectivity,” Yu said. “For companies, their media strategies had principal meaning as an advertising and promotion tool in the past. Now public opinion is an absolute variable to strategic communication and crisis management, with consumers being the ‘subject,’ not the ‘object,’ in the supply chain.” Despite the prevalent numbness to potential crises, he has been sensing a subtle change in the views of corporate executives especially since Korean Air’s “nut rage” incident in December 2014, Yu noted. Cho Hyun-ah, a member of the flag carrier’s founding family and then its executive vice president, fanned a drumfire of nationwide criticism after being found to have ordered the pilot of her flight to return a taxiing plane to the gate to kick out the cabin crew chief at a New York airport for serving nuts in a way that she mistakenly insisted did not match the manual. The furor persisted despite her expressing her repeated regrets before cameras, and spilled over to the owner family, prompting her father and company chairman Cho Yang-ho to hold a news conference to apologize to the public and employees. The event highlighted South Koreans’ inimical feelings toward the family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, and some of its offspring’s “imperialistic” and arrogant behavior. “Giving a lecture during a meeting of Samsung Group presidents last July, I felt that they were really trying to pay attention. I think the Korean Air case had a substantial impact,” Yu said. “This area has previously been mainly in the interests of communication or public affairs staffs, but many of those at the top echelon are beginning to change since the incident, together with the explosive growth of smartphones, social networks and other areas that had not belonged to the realm of existing media.”To fend off crises and boost readiness, entities should make constant efforts to regularly update playbooks and carry out simulations, in which the resolve of top management and a consciousness change throughout society play a vital role, Yu stressed. “Crisis management is something that the system and your body naturally remember. In that aspect, the current situation is much retrogressive especially within an administration in which everyone relies on the president and her belief and willingness,” he said. “We are no longer living in a world where leaders chant ‘Follow me.’ They now should understand their audience first and try to appeal to their hearts.“ By Shin Hyon-hee","thursday in crisis management ,management consultant said thursday ,leading crisis management consultant ,management expert with disaster ,disaster risks social media","['Yu Min - yeong', 'acase']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.87935525  0.15826924

The silhouette of a scientist against a visualisation of gravitational waves pictured during a press conference by the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational쟑hysics  at the Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, 11 February. ""Up until now we have been deaf to gravitational waves, but today, we are able to hear them,"" said David Reitze, executive director of the LIGO Laboratory, at a packed press conference in the US capital.Reitze and colleagues compared the magnitude of the discovery to Galileo's use of the telescope four centuries ago to open the era of modern astronomy.""I think we are doing something equally important here today. I think we are opening a window on the universe,"" Reitze said.The phenomenon was observed by two US-based underground detectors, designed to pick up tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves, a project known as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO.It took scientists months to verify their data and put it through a process of peer-review before announcing it on Thursday, marking the culmination of decades of efforts by teams around the world including some 1,000 scientists from 16 countries, according to the National Science Foundation, which funded the research.Strain in spaceGravitational waves are a measure of strain in space, an effect of the motion of large masses that stretches the fabric of space-time -- a way of viewing space and time as a single, interweaved continuum.They travel at the speed of light and cannot be stopped or blocked by anything.As part of his theory of general relativity, Einstein said space-time could be compared to a net, bowing under the weight of an object. When objects with mass accelerate, such as when two black holes spiral towards each other, they send gravitational waves out around them at the speed of light, like ripples emanating from a pebble thrown in a pond.The strongest waves are caused by the most cataclysmic processes known to mankind -- black holes coalescing, massive stars exploding, or the very birth of the Universe some 13.8 billion years ago.While scientists have previously been able to calculate gravitational waves, they had never before seen one directly.According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's  David Shoemaker, the leader of the Advanced LIGO team, it looked just like physicists thought it would.Wobbling like jelly""The waveform that we can calculate based on Einstein's theory of 1916 matches exactly what we observed in 2015,"" Shoemaker told AFP.""It looked like a chirp, it looked at something that started at low frequencies -- for us low frequencies means 20 or 30 hertz, that's like the lowest note on a bass guitar, sweeping very rapidly up over just a fraction of a second... up to 150 hertz or so, sort of near middle C on a piano.""The chirp ""corresponded to the orbit of these two black holes getting smaller and smaller, and the speed of the two objects going faster and faster until the two became a single object,"" he explained.""And then right at the end of this waveform, we see the wobbling of the final black hole as if it were made of jelly as it settled into a static state.""Underground detectorsThe L-shaped LIGO detectors -- each about 2.5 miles  long-- were conceived and built by researchers at MIT and Caltech.One is located in Hanford, Washington, and the other is in Livingston, Louisiana. A third advanced detector, called VIRGO, is scheduled to open in Italy later this year. Others are planned for Japan and India in the coming years.Tuck Stebbins, head of the gravitational astrophysics laboratory at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center, described the LIGO detector as the ""one of the most complex machines built by humans.""Physicists said the gravitational wave detected at 1651 GMT on September 14 originated in the last fraction of a second before the fusion of two black holes somewhere in the southern sky, though they can't say precisely where.An analysis by the MIT and Caltech found that the black holes joined about1.3 billion years ago, and their mass was 29-36 times greater than the Sun.The wave arrived first at the Louisiana detector, then at the Washington instrument 7.1 milliseconds later.The two instruments are 1,800 miles  apart, and since both made the same reading, scientists consider their discovery confirmed.Accolades poured in from across the science world, as experts hailed a discovery that will help better understand the universe.""This is one of the major moments in astronomy. It's completely transformational,"" said Alberto Vecchio, professor of astrophysics at the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy.""This expands hugely the way we can observe the cosmos, and the kinds of physics and astrophysics we can do,"" said professor Sheila Rowan, Director of the University of Glasgow's Institute for Gravitational Research.Abhay Ashtekar, director of the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos at Penn State University, described the discovery as ""breathtaking"" and said it ""will stand out among the major achievements of 21st-century science.""Andrew Coates, professor of physics at University College London, said it was ""up there with the Higgs boson, the mass of the neutrino, discovery of the electron, electromagnetism, the Copernican revolution and Newton's laws.""""We can now listen to the universe rather than just look at it,"" said professor B S Sathyaprakash of Cardiff University. ""This window turns on the soundtrack for the universe.""Indirect proof of gravitational waves was found in 1974 through the study of a pulsar and a neutron star. Scientists Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor won the Nobel Prize for physics for that work in 1993.","scientists glimpse einstein gravitational ,scientists glimpse einstein ,landmark discovery for physics ,glimpse einstein gravitational waves ,einstein predicted century ago","['WASHINGTON', 'AFP', 'Albert Einstein']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31788534  0.54303044

Alerting the whole world of such an attempt, and pressuring Abe via public opinion, is important in preventing  from twisting history,” said Seo, a local professor. An excerpt from Seo’s advertisement The 45-second video advertisement shows comments by former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying that acknowledge the forced nature of the victims euphemistically called “comfort women."" The images are contrasted against Abe‘s statement that the claims of coerced sexual slavery by Japan is “groundless slander.” The Abe administration Friday submitted a report to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women that claimed that there is no evidence proving the “forceful taking away” of the victims into sexual servitude for the Japanese soldiers. The claim was echoed by Abe last month, who added that it was a “slander” to call the comfort women “sexual slaves.”Seoul on Sunday rebuked Japan’s denial of the comfort women being forced into sexual slavery, saying that it is an “indisputable historical fact” that there had been coercion in the comfort women‘s mobilization.Korea and Japan on Dec. 28 reached what they called a “final and irreversible” agreement over the comfort women issue, which included Tokyo providing 1 billion yen  for a foundation for the victims and an apology. The deal, however, was denounced by surviving comfort women and civil groups here for failing to recognize Japan’s legal responsibility.Japanese lawmakers’ demand to Abe last month to remove a bronze statue of a girl -- symbolizing the comfort women -- installed in the vicinity of the Japanese Embassy here had caused further furor, after news outlets in Tokyo had claimed that Korea gave a “positive reaction” to potentially moving the statue.A group of Korean university students have been staging an outdoor sit-in demonstration in front of the statue for 35 consecutive days since Dec. 30, guarding the statue.Seo’s advertisement has been linked by Twitter accounts of news outlets of 194 countries across the world.

Harry B. Harris Jr. made the remark in an interview with Yonhap News Agency, stressing that even though he personally supports the idea of putting a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit in the South, such a deployment won't be a unilateral decision.""I believe the decision to put THAAD on the Korean Peninsula or even the decision to think about it has to be an alliance decision,"" he said during the Jan. 25 interview. ""It has to be a decision that's made together between the U.S. and the ROK. It's not our decision to ask the South, and it's not the ROK decision to ask us to bring it. It's an alliance decision.""He is the first U.S. Pacific commander to hold an interview with South Korean media.North Korea's Jan. 6 nuclear test, the country's fourth, rekindled talk of more missile defense, including THAAD deployment to South Korea. President Park Geun-hye said earlier this month she would consider the issue in accordance with national interests.Seoul's Defense Ministry also said this week that THAAD will be helpful in defense against the North, a remark seen as a step forward, compared with previous statements that focused on denial of any discussions between the two countries on the issue.It is no secret that the U.S. also wants to deploy a THAAD battery to South Korea, where some 28,500 American troops are stationed, to better defend against ever-growing threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.But the issue has become one of the most sensitive for South Korea because China sees a potential THAAD deployment as a threat to their security interests, despite repeated assurances from Washington that the system is aimed only at deterring North Korean threats. Seoul and Washington have maintained they have never held any formal consultations on the issue.Asked about China's opposition, Harris said that any decision on the matter should be taken by Seoul and Washington and that ""China's opinions are simply interesting.""Since taking over as PACOM commander in late May, Harris has consistently expressed concerns about North Korea, calling it the ""greatest threat we face"" and saying that concerns about the provocative nation keep him awake at night.He reiterated such concerns during the interview.""North Korea is the biggest threat, which is visceral and real.North Korea will present a threat not only to the peninsula but a threat to Japan, Hawaii and the U.S. mainland,"" the commander said. Harris said the North's leader Kim Jong-un seeks to be a global player, but he has ended up ""a global pariah"" because of the nuclear test and other provocations. Asked whether he believes Pyongyang has mastered miniaturization technology, the commander said he has to be ready for all scenarios.""I don't play poker because I don't like to take risks and I'm not ready to risk the defense of our homeland against the possibility that North Korea might not be able to miniaturize or develop a long range weapon. I have to be ready for that,"" he said. ""My glass is always half empty. It's never half full because that's what I'm paid to do,"" he added.After the North's nuclear test, the U.S. sent a nuclear-capable B-52 strategic bomber to fly over South Korea in a show of its commitment to Seoul and a warning to Pyongyang. Harris said the U.S. is considering deploying more strategic assets, including the recent departure of the Navy's John C. Stennis Strike Group to the western Pacific.The commander also said that the Korea-U.S. alliance has contributed to the ""rules-based order"" in the region that has allowed South Korea and Japan to grow and flourish. He also called for greater three-way security cooperation between the Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.""If we face the same threat from North Korea, we have the same challenge from China and it's natural, operationally natural that the three countries work closely together,"" he said, adding that the three countries should conduct complex exercises as well by taking advantage of the systems they share, such as Aegis destroyers.Harris also said that the strength of the Korea-U.S. alliance is underscored by the ""quality of the people that we send to Korea,"" praising Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, as a ""tremendous leader.""""We're both lucky to have him on the peninsula,"" he said.Harris, who was born to an American father and Japanese mother, is the U.S. Navy's highest-ranking Asian American. His father was also a Navy sailor and served in the 1950-53 Korean War. After the war, his father lived in Korea from 1956 to 1958 to teach Korean sailors engineering.""He taught me deep appreciation for the Korean people,"" the commander said. ""So, I had this appreciation for Korea early on and I'm grateful to have this opportunity to have some impact, some effect on Koreans.""","korea to better defend ,interview with yonhap news ,alliance decision pacific commander ,south korea to better ,system to south korea","['U.S.', 'South Korea', 'the U.S. Pacific', 'Harry B.

The 2004 Olympic taekwondo gold medalist Moon Dae-sung will be running for his second term. Lee Elisa, former table tennis world champion and veteran sports administrator, is also going for her second term.Park Chan-ho, the first South Korean to play in Major League Baseball, and Jang Mi-ran, the 2008 Olympic weightlifting gold medalist, are also rumored to be seeking entry into politics, though they've denied such speculations.Former athletes have had mixed success in politics, but parties still reach out to them for an infusion of new blood, hoping their competitive streak would translate well in politics.Lee Man-gi was ssireum's biggest icon in the 1980s, winning 10 major titles to lead the heyday of the sport. In retirement, Lee, 52, has remained visible in the public eye through TV appearances and now teaches sports and leisure studies at a local university.Lee completed his preliminary registration last month for the ruling Saenuri Party. He failed to get a nomination in the 2000 general elections. Four years later, he came up short in a race for a seat in Masan, South Gyeongsang Province.In 2014, Lee lost the mayoral election for Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province.Moon Dae-sung, one of two South Korean members on the International Olympic Committee , is currently representing a district in Busan for Saenuri, but will be running for a seat in Incheon, his hometown, after an about-face.Last month, Moon, 39, announced he wouldn't run in the elections, saying he was fed up with politics -- a world full of liars, cowards and self-serving individuals, he said -- and he wanted to work in sports again.Then just last Thursday, Moon said he will be chasing his second term, on a recommendation by the Saenuri leader Kim Moo-sung. Moon was elected in 2012 running for Saenuri but was soon forced to leave the party while facing plagiarism charges over his Ph.D. thesis. Moon rejoined the ruling party in February 2014.Lee Elisa, 61, has been serving as a proportional representative since 2012, and will be competing for a seat in Daejeon, where she attended grade school.The 1973 world table tennis champion who also captured several international titles, Lee carved out a strong career as a coach and an administrator. She was the national women's table tennis head coach at the 1988 and 2004 Summer Olympics and was the head of the National Training Center, the top training facility for Olympic athletes, from 2005 to 2008, the first female to serve in the role.In the National Assembly, Lee has been working to improve the plight of retired athletes and develop physical education among youth.Elsewhere, former basketball player Kim Young-joo will be seeking her third term for the opposition Minjoo Party. Former baseball player Kim Yoo-dong, the MVP of the inaugural Korean Series -- the South Korean version of the World Series -- in 1982, will be taking his sixth swing at a parliamentary seat.","olympic taekwondo gold medalist ,traditional wrestling national champion ,olympic taekwondo gold ,2004 olympic taekwondo gold ,arena at upcoming elections","['Lee Man - gi', 'Moon Dae - sung', 'Lee Elisa']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24393593  0.23011537

One of Korea's key technologies now showing is the tiltrotor drone. Tiltrotor drones are capable of vertical takeoffs and landings like helicopters, but can shift their wings to fly like airplanes. The Korea Aerospace Research Institute  and Korean Air worked together to develop the tiltrotor ""KUS-VT"" drone. The Korea Electronics Technology Institute exhibits new drone technology in the combination of a drone and the Internet of Things , which refers to a communication network among various objects through the Internet.China's DJI, one of the world's largest drone manufacturers, shows its newest drone during the Busan exhibition, which is being held under the auspices of the commerce ministry and Busan municipal city.An official from the exhibition center said that drone markets will heat up in the future, with countries around the globe racing to roll out better performing unmanned aerial vehicles.On the military front, the Daejeon-based Agency for Defense Development  began delving into drone technology in the late 1970s, seeking to introduce a miniature air launch decoy codenamed Solgae  with technical assistance from the U.K. In 2000, the ADD and Korea Aerospace Industries  launched the country's first homegrown UAV -- nicknamed the Songgolmae, RQ-101 or Night Intruder-300 -- and its deployment started two years later.State-run think tanks and defense companies have since continued to study key technologies, including those for autonomous takeoff and landing, multiple drone control and collision detection and avoidance.Currently, the ADD with KAI and Korean Air are respectively carrying out projects to develop division-scale UAVs.Another major prospective program is underway by state-funded KAI and the national flag carrier, which has in recent years been expanding its forays into aircraft manufacturing, for a Predator-like surveillance and reconnaissance drone called the KUS-15.They have already completed development of a ""smart, next-generation"" UAV system consisting of tilt-rotor air vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing and sending real-time imagery information from distant places at all hours.But in Korea, most of the drones sold are for industrial use, or for rescue missions or fighting fires. As a result, Korea's drone market is worth only about 10 billion won , which is 0.5 percent of the total global market, according to drone industry sources.","asia largest drone festival ,largest drone festival opened ,largest drone festival ,asia largest drone show ,drone show korea 2016","['Busan', 'South Korea']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.15905371  0.53505409

After a series of negotiations, they reached a memorandum of understanding in May last year to push for the restoration project.The Seoul city government plans to use the sidewalk as a sightseeing destination to show the coexistence between the Korean and British cultures.Deoksu Palace is one of the capital's five palaces. The others are Gyeongbok, Gyeonghui, Changdeok and Changgyeong. Representing remarkable architectural achievements, the palaces were turned to near ruin during the Japanese invasion  and colonial occupation .In the late years of the Joseon Dynasty, Jeongdong, where the Deoksu Palace and its sidewalks are located, comprised the residences and embassies of Western powers and foreign missionaries.","seoul city to restore ,seoul will be restored ,palace in downtown seoul ,joseon dynasty 1392 1910 ,seoul city council member","['Seoul', 'the British Embassy', 'Korea', 'Seoul City Council', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33386999  0.2736305

283,283,283,Korea gears up for another top 10 Olympic,"As an age-old golf cliche goes, you can't win a tournament in the first round, but you can certainly lose one.A few weeks into 2016, South Korean athletes gearing up for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro are taking up the same mantra:that they may not be able to win a medal in January, but they can possibly lose one before they even get to Brazil.Such is the importance placed on the last winter training for the a...","As an age-old golf cliche goes, you can't win a tournament in the first round, but you can certainly lose one.A few weeks into 2016, South Korean athletes gearing up for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro are taking up the same mantra:that they may not be able to win a medal in January, but they can possibly lose one before they even get to Brazil.Such is the importance placed on the last winter training for the athletes before the first Summer Games in South America. Choi Jong-sam, head of the National Training Center in Seoul, said how the athletes prepare themselves in the next month or so will make or break their chances of reaching the podiums in Rio.""For our athletes to be able to compete at a high level, they have to be well-conditioned,"" Choi said. ""It will help them take the next step. Many of our forefathers in sports have emphasized conditioning over skills and techniques. We're trying to steer our athletes in that direction.""South Korea will be gunning for its fourth consecutive top 10 finish in the Summer Olympic medal table. Earlier this month, Infostrada Sports, a Dutch sports data analysis firm, unveiled its Virtual Medal Table  and projected South Korea to win 12 gold medals.It would fall just one shy of South Korea's all-time record of 13, set in Beijing in 2008 and matched in London in 2012.The projection may vary in the coming months with Olympic qualifications still under way in some sports.Archery, though, will almost certainly be a major goldmine for South Korea once again. South Korea has grabbed 19 gold medals since the start of modern archery competition in 1972, more than any other nation. It won three out of four archery gold medals in London, and the VMT predicts that South Korea will pull off a sweep of all four titles -- men's and women's individual and team events-- for the first time in Rio.Leading the way in London was Ki Bo-bae, who captured both the individual and team gold medals in the women's competition. The South Korean talent pool in archery is so deep that Ki actually missed the national team for the 2014 Asian Games -- the running joke in archery is that it's more difficult to make the national team than to win an Olympic medal -- but she has since found her groove again.Now she's attempting to make history -- becoming the first South Korean female archer to defend an Olympic individual gold medal.The 27-year-old said she won't look that far down the road just yet, knowing making the national team will be no easy task.""Four years have gone by fast, and Rio is just around the corner. But I think it's premature to talk about winning back-to-back gold medals,"" she said. ""I have to get on the team first at the Olympic team trials in March.""Moon Hyung-chul, head coach of the archery team, sounded decidedly more confident.""Our goal is always to win every gold medal at stake,"" he said before flying to Rio last week for an early training session with the current national team. ""When we came up short in international competitions before, it wasn't because we lacked skills. We failed to adjust to the local climate and other conditions. We have to closely analyze our reasons for those close calls and get ready for the Olympics.""Unlike Ki and other archers, Lee Dae-hoon in men's taekwondo won't have to worry about making the Olympic team. One of South Korea's projected gold medalists by VMT, Lee has been awarded an automatic berth based on his Olympic ranking position by the World Taekwondo Federation.The 23-year-old has won virtually every title a taekwondo fighter can win, except for an Olympic gold. He has two world titles, two Asian Games gold medals and two Asian championships under his belt but settled for silver in the 58-kilogram class at his Olympic debut four years ago.Lee will be competing in the 68-kilogram division in Rio, where he hopes to do one better on the podium.""In London, I don't think I competed the way I am capable of,"" he said. ""It wasn't that I was disappointed with the silver. I was more frustrated that I couldn't do what I'd prepared to do. I want to make sure things will be different this time.""Lee said he will be up against ""taller and stronger"" opponents in the heavier weight class, but added, ""I will study and analyze them closely and prepare the best I can.""Where Lee might have fallen short of expectations in London, South Korean fencers shocked the world with their monumental performance in the British capital, winning two gold, one silver and three bronze medals. Only Italy, with three gold, two silver and two bronze medals, picked up more fencing medals than South Korea.One of the South Korean gold medalists, Kim Ji-yeon in women's sabre, said she's trying to temper her own expectations, lest the pressure to repeat affect her preparations.""If I set my goal too high, there will just be too much pressure,"" she said. ""I was only trying to enjoy myself in London, and I am hoping to have the same mindset going into Rio.""She's battling some pains in her left hip area and said staying healthy is almost as important as conditioning and technical training.""Compared to four years ago, my rivals have improved a great deal in terms of their techniques and tactics,"" Kim said. ""I am studying their videos closely to get a better sense of the competition.""The other gold medal in London came from the men's sabre team event, with Gu Bon-gil leading the way. The 26-year-old said the Olympic gold has put a bull's-eye on the back of South Korean fencers.""Ever since London, other countries have been keeping an even closer eye on us,"" said the former world No. 1, who is now the third-ranked male sabre fencer. ""But it's business as usual for us, as we get ready for the Olympics by competing in World Cups and Grand Prix events.""In Rio, South Korean judokas will try to pull off some surprises of their own. South Korea has claimed at least one judo gold medal in each of the past three Olympics, and three up-and-comers will be looking to extend the winning tradition.An Ba-ul won his first world championship last August in the men's 66kg class, adding to his gold at the Summer Universiade a month earlier. The 21-year-old had earlier won the world junior championship in 2013, and an Olympic gold will cap off an impressive run of international victories.Gwak Dong-han also won both the world championship and the Summer Universiade gold last year in the men's 90kg class, climbing to the No. 1 spot in International Judo Federation's world rankings in his division. The 23-year-old also has an Asian championship to his credit.""People may be expecting big things because I've done well of late, but I don't think I am yet good enough to be ranked No. 1 in the world,"" Gwak said. ""I have to study my rivals closely and train hard to do well at the Olympics.""While An and Gwak both won their first world titles last summer, An Chang-rim in the men's 73kg class settled for bronze after bowing out to his main nemesis, Shohei Ono of Japan, in the semifinals.Ono has had An's numbers in recent meetings, having also beaten him at the Tokyo Grand Slam in December 2014 and at the Dusseldorf Grand Prix in May last year.An did win the Universiade gold and the Asian championship last year to rise to No. 2 in the world rankings, four spots ahead of Ono, but the South Korean said the rankings can be thrown out the window.""I was disappointed to walk away with only the bronze medal at the world championships,"" An said. ""Obviously, Ono will be a strong contender. I will try to do better at the Olympics. I just have to get better and prepare as if this will be my last Olympics.""","another top 10 olympic ,2016 south korean athletes ,last winter training for ,top 10 olympic ,top 10 olympic as","['south korean', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Brazil']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51004946  0.45775384

Among the things he wrote down were his age, monthly-income, job and that he’s a nonsmoker and teetotaler. It was his CV for the international marriage market. “I even had it translated into Uzbek,” the 55-year-old told The Korea Herald. “I asked my broker to give it to women who were interested. Later I found out that my wife, whom I only ended up living with for three months, never read the letter at all.” The broker also lied to both Ahn and the wife, who was 28 years his junior, saying that he would buy her a house, and she was from a well-off family. He had no such money, and the wife had run away from a broken home when she was 10.Their relationship ended badly. His wife asked him to help her return to Uzbekistan if he was not willing to buy her a house in Korea. After she slit her wrist in front of him and his mother in their living room, the couple agreed to live separately and she moved back to her home country. After several months, she claimed to be pregnant with his child, and he has been sending money for child support ever since.Ahn is one of many South Korean men who claim to be victims of international marriage scams and the nation’s policies on multiculturalism. He currently runs a help-center for victims like himself. He has met and helped more than 10,000 of them since opening the service in 2007. Members of an online website helping the victim of international marriage scams hold a rally calling for legal measures in Seoul in September 2013. YonhapAhn argued that the government fails to protect its own citizens from illegal brokers, who he claimed deliberately approached those who are socially marginalized.“The government should illegalize all private international marriage agencies,” he said. South Korea in 2010 introduced a new law on international marriage agencies with a strengthened screening process. All brokers are now required to translate their clients’ certified documents of legal marital status, health conditions and criminal records and provide them to their potential spouses.The number of such couples has dropped since then, from 35,098 in 2010 to 24,387 in 2014 -- the lowest since 2003. The proportion of Korean men who were at least 10 years senior to their foreign wives has also dropped. In 2014 they made up 37.5 percent of the total, down from 44.8 percent in 2012.Still, Korean men who married foreign brides through brokers took up 25 percent of all international marriages as of 2012, according to the latest Gender Equality Ministry data. Notably, 75.7 percent of those who married Cambodian women, and 65.8 percent of Korean husbands who married Vietnamese wives, and 40 percent of those who married women from Uzbekistan met their wives through matchmaking agencies. Over 85 percent of marriage migrants here are women, as of 2014.Statistics also show that international marriages ended more in divorce here. Korean couples on average stayed together for 14.3 years in 2014, compared to an average of 6.4 years among international couples. Half of the divorced Korean husbands said their foreign wives ran away from home, thereby ending the marriage, according to a 2012 government report.Jang Hee-jun , a 38-year-old school janitor, in 2014 pursued an international marriage through a now-defunct agency. It cost him 22 million won . On the first day he arrived in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on April 19, 2014, he met about 20 women who said they were interested.He finally married one of them at a local court the next day. It was just Jang and his wife and the judge. He was told that the bride’s family members were unable to attend.“I actually thought it was better that way,” he said. “I thought it was better because I heard some weddings get called off in the middle of the ceremony by the guests or relatives.”He returned to Korea alone first and registered the marriage certificate for him and his 24-year-old wife. His wife would take required Korean language classes in Kyrgyzstan and join him later. In June, his wife called from Bishkek. She said she’d been raped by a cab driver and became pregnant. From June until March 2015, Jang had wired her 5.37 million won for her Korean language classes, gifts for her mother’s birthday and living allowance. Throughout her pregnancy, his wife told many different things; at one point she said she’d leave the baby with her mother and live in Korea with Jang alone. A few days later, she said she’d given up the baby for adoption. At one point she claimed the baby was in fact Jang’s. And finally in March, she said she was sorry. She said the baby wasn’t his and she’s moving to Russia. Jang filed a request to the court to invalidate his marriage.Several studies show that most Korean husbands who pursue international marriages belong to the lower socioeconomic strata in the cities, or poorer rural areas. “Now I know how naive it is to believe you can build a successful marriage by marrying someone just a day after you meet her, and marrying someone who doesn’t even speak your language,” Ahn Jae-sung said.“But many don’t understand why some people, including myself, get tricked into this so easily.” Ahn said Korea’s marginalized men -- those who are poor, disabled, socially isolated and basically unattractive marriage material -- are being used by brokers who also trick financially struggling foreign women interested in escaping poverty in their home countries or obtaining South Korea citizenship.Korean men from broken arranged marriages claim that the Korean government is also responsible for unhappy international marriages. They argue that the government is putting both Korean men and foreign women at risk by not illegalizing private brokers. According to American attorney Douglas MacLean’s 2014 research, the Korean government has offered subsidies for families looking for a bride for their adult sons, or even supported “marriage tours” overseas -- where Korean men visit their potential brides in a meeting arranged by brokers.“The  government is well aware of both its rural population and overall fertility rate,” MacLean wrote in the paper. “In addition to macro-level policy and laws aimed at increasing the birth rate, the government has promoted support for ‘multicultural families’ … in a way not seen in countries facing similar demographic problems, such as Japan and Taiwan.”The abnormally high ratio of Korean men marrying foreigners through brokers has also been cited as one of the main reasons for human rights and domestic abuse against immigrant women here.In 2014, a 36-year-old Korean man strangled his 21-year-old Vietnamese wife to death before killing himself. In 2010, a 20-year-old Vietnamese woman was killed by her 47-year-old Korean husband, who had a mental health condition. The United States Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report on South Korea also addressed the problem last year. “Some women from China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Cambodia who are recruited for marriage to South Korean men through international marriage brokers are subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor after their arrival,” it said.The Korean Justice Ministry has been moving to tackle the issue, enacting a measure in 2014 to obligate all applicants applying for a resident-by-marriage visa to pass a Korean language proficiency test. It also requires couples who apply for such a visa to prove income of at least 14.8 million won a year.Yun Kang-mo, the director of Support for Multicultural Families division of the Gender Ministry, said the government was aware of the existing problems and has been making efforts to prevent marriage fraud.“We strongly encourage those who are seeking international marriages to only visit agencies that have been officially registered and approved by municipal governments,” Yun said.“Wanting to get married is a universal desire. And it’s questionable whether or not it is right for the government to ban one of the options for people to get married.”For Park Geun-su , whose Uzbek wife also never came to Korea after their wedding in 2014, it was his disability that drove him to seek an international marriage. The 36-year-old suffered a car accident in 1998 that disabled his left arm and has been living with his parents ever since.“I didn’t think a Korean woman would want to marry someone who has a disability. And most  women nowadays don’t want to live with their parents-in-law.”In spite of being scammed, Jang still wants to get married -- before he turns 60. “I’ve always wanted to have my own children,” he said. “I guess I just don’t want to grow old alone. Life is just too lonely like that.”By Claire Lee","marriage fraud in 2007 ,south korean men suckered ,international marriage fraud ,future wife he wrote ,international marriage fraud in","['Ahn Jae - sung', 'Uzbekistan', 'Seoul', 'Uzbek', 'the Korea Herald']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24547952  0.43665722

This photo shows one of the Memory Classrooms dedicated to the student victims. Ten classrooms in Danwon High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province have been left untouched in memory of 250 students who were killed or remain missing from the sinking of the ferry Sewol en route from Incheon to Jejudo Island. A total of 476 -- including 325 from Danwon on a field trip to the resort island -- were onboard when the ship plunged, left 304 dead or missing, and eventually divulged a gross incompetence in Korea’s disaster response and contingency planning.But two years removed from one of Korea’s worst maritime disasters of all time, the “memory classrooms” have become a source of dispute as education authorities and school officials remain at odds with bereaved families of student victims over whether or not to preserve them. Bereaved families of Sewol student victims at Danwon High School and citizens on Jan.12 march from the joint memorial for the victims in Ansan, Gyeong Province, to the school. The families adamantly say that the place should remain intact to ensure that the disaster would never be forgotten, while authorities hope to move on, citing the shortage of classrooms for new students.Memory classroomsThe classrooms, located on second and third floors of the school, are simultaneously a shrine and a reminder of one of the country’s most shameful tragedies.While the ship took well over two hours to submerge from when it initially started to list, lackluster rescue efforts coupled with moral hazard of the crew who fled the ship before any passengers resulted in the death of hundreds.The memory classrooms stand to represent the vivacious lives and promises of a future the students never got to fulfill.The “hall of fame” on the wall of classroom 2-1 -- which stands for room 1 of the second-year high schoolers -- showed that the students jokingly crowned their classmates champions in different categories, such as “champion of caring for friends, Yoo Mi-ji.” The champ beams back from the framed photo, flashing a beautiful smile. A doodled message on Kim Shi-yeon’s desk in classroom 2-3 reads, “Si-yeon  Jae-gwang. March.23,” hinting at puppy love between the teenagers.Unlike many of his classmates, Kim Sun-woo’s desk did not have a pile of snacks, but were abundant with letters and notes from his friends.The whiteboard in front of classroom 2-10 showed that the students had lab two days before the tragedy. A map of Seoul-based universities at the back marked out Dongguk University as a dream school for Kim Min-jung.“Field trip ” now written on the calendar of classroom 2-9 almost seemed like a cruel joke.A class project on a locker of classroom 2-2 demonstrated that Heo Da-yun wanted to be a kindergarten teacher. She and five others from Danwon -- students Nam Hyeon-cheol, Park Yeong-in and Cho Eun-hwa along with teachers Goh Chang-suk and Yang Seung-jin -- remain unaccounted for as of Monday.“Don’t!!! Mess with the calendar!!! Return September and October at once!!!” shouted a message on a calendar in 2-3, along with words of “Now we’re really high school seniors,” written in December, two months before they would go up a year.A posthumous letter on Yoo Ye-eun’s desk showed that she loved musicals and wanted to be a singer. She was supposed to have watched “Cats” on April 30.Yoo Kyung-geun, Ye-eun’s father and a spokesman for the bereaved families’ committee, refused to attend the graduation ceremony held last Tuesday for surviving 74 students -- one had transferred to another school -- on grounds that four students remain missing.“I always imagined attending my daughter’s graduation, but I became a dad who is just envious of the participating parents,” Yoo said while delivering his congratulatory speech for graduates at a joint memorial for victims in Ansan. “Now, I wish that you  will lead your lives. Because you are the friends with whom my daughter shared her dreams, ones who shared her last moments, and ones who will remember my child for longer than I will.”Conflict over preservationDanwon High School and the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education initially planned an honorary graduation ceremony for the victims, but it was indefinitely put on hold upon their families’ refusal.Victims’ families complained of losing trust in the government and school over their handling of the situation.“They  did not contact us, and did not give us passes to the ceremony or anything,” said Lee Nam-seok, father of late Chang-hyeon. In a bid to protect the surviving students from unwanted public attention, the school held a closed-door ceremony. The mother of a Danwon High School student who lost his life in the Sewol accident weeps in front of her son’s photo at a joint memorial in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. “We just want to have a graduation after all the students were brought out of the water. I am so saddened at the situation where we can no longer trust the Education Ministry, or the government in general,” he said.Despite the slew of technical problems caused by preserving nearly a quarter of a school as a shrine, regrets and memory of the victims’ families hinders them from letting go.“ Chang-hyeon was obsessed with smartphones, and I used to tell him to wait until graduation. Then I would let him live life as he wishes. It pains me to think that he cannot lead such a life.”The family committee has rejected the proposal by the GPOE to clear out the memory classrooms to create a separate memorial hall for the victims. The GPOE said they are continuing to hold talks to persuade the committee to accept the idea.“It’s not something that can be conducted forcibly, so we are hoping that they  will come to accept our proposal,” said a GPOE official. He pointed out that with the new batch of students entering Danwon in March, the shortage of classrooms is no longer tolerable.The official did not comment on the back-up plan if the parents ultimately refuse the plan. He also said that other students, their parents and teachers are opposing the preservation.Some have said keeping a memorial hall in the school was creating negative repercussions on current students and the overall morale. While there was a general consensus to preserve the classrooms after the accident, the prolonged situation and media attention slowly pushed many parents of attending students to turn against maintaining them. During the Tuesday graduation ceremony, Danwon students were seen trying to exit the school grounds via the front gates before stopping dead in their tracks at the sight of an army of reporters. All graduating students later exited through the back door.A father of a Danwon student, who refused to be named, said roughly 70 to 80 percent of the parents are against preserving the classrooms.But Yoo of the bereaved families’ committee argued that the memory classrooms should be preserved as a reminder of lessons taught by Sewol tragedy. He said the classrooms stand for more than just memories of the students.A subsequent probe on the Sewol tragedy has revealed a corrupt network of connections, ineffective chain of command and inept administration as the main reasons the accident led to such a high fatality rate.To the victims’ families, Sewol is an ongoing issue. They insist that the salvage operation and thorough investigation of the accident must be fully completed. A special investigative government-civilian committee for Sewol has also been established, although it had been embroiled in disputes ranging from accusation of being politically motivated to a leak of classified documents by insiders to the government and ruling Saenuri Party.Yoo has suggested to the GPOE a plan where the classrooms will be separated from the rest of the school, and visitors can enter via a separate entrance.“The classrooms stand for more than a tribute to victims. It symbolizes our hope that Korean education will open a new era after Sewol,” he said. “We are hoping such education will start at Danwon. I believe that the memory classrooms can play a role in education to stop such an accident from reoccurring.”The families of surviving students of Sewol remained relatively quiet in the dispute, citing concerns that it may lead to misunderstanding between them and families of victim students.Oh Ji-yeon, father of Yeon-ju who survived the tragedy, said it is imperative to put students first whatever the conclusion may be.“My youngest daughter will start attending Danwon this year. Both sides have reasons behind their argument, but the students are ultimately the ones being penalized by all this conflict. And they don’t even get a say in this,” he said. “I just hope it comes to an amicable ending. The students can’t study in the streets,” Oh said.By Yoon Min-sik A photo of Kim Seul-gi, one of the student victims is laid on her desk in her classroom at Danwon High School.  A photo of a student victim is hung on a box of gifts left at his desk. Below the photo is the message “Seongyun, I love you.

Thank you for always being with me.”  Whiteboard at a memory classroom has messages written by students before the Sewol sinking, and comments left by visitors. They include: “Emergency maintenance on school homepage,” “Erase the chalkboard,” “Do not skip remedial classes, after-school classes,” along with “I’m sorry for being a bad sister. I miss you,” “Come home class 8.”  Birthdays of all students from class 3 of second-year Danwon School students are displayed in this class project.  A photo of Yoo Mi-ji, one of student victims, is laid on her desk.  Gifts left by visitors are laid on the desk of Cho Eun-hwa, one of the four students of Danwon High School who remains missing.

The apartment was built by the group's construction arm of SK E&C;, and the consulting company is an affiliate of SK Singapore.""We will request the prosecution this week to open a probe into possible violations of local laws regarding the suspected real estate transaction,"" the Seoul-based Financial Consumer Agency said.A thorough probe into any unethical and unlawful actions by an owner of a conglomerate should be carried out to bring them to justice, it added.The woman is suspected of breaching the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act as she failed to report the deal to the Bank of Korea. Last week, the Financial Supervisory Service, the nation's financial watchdog, started a probe into the deal. The forex deal act stipulates that non-residents shall inform the central bank of any real estate transactions in Korea. The consumer group also plans to seek a probe into Chey over speculation that he might have embezzled corporate funds to purchase the house for Kim via the overseas affiliate.The apartment deal has come under media spotlight since late last year when the chairman admitted that he is in an extramarital relationship with the woman while going through divorce proceedings with his wife.","seoul for 55 billion ,kim bought luxury apartment ,apartment in southern seoul ,billion won in 2008 ,southern seoul for 55","['SK Group', 'Chey Tae - won', 'U.S.', 'Kim', 'Seoul', 'Singapore', 'Bergaya International']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33121485  0.02658605

Moon Jae-in’s leadership will lose Gwangju and Jeolla voters, who have for decades remained supportive of the opposition camp.“For the first time in my almost 60-year political life, I have decided to leave my party of my own will,” Kwon, who had been acting as the party’s senior adviser, said at a press conference Tuesday.“I have given my best efforts to achieve unity, but cannot hold out any more.” Kwon Rho-kapThe political veteran, who had served three parliamentary terms, is expected to be followed by 40 or more party members, including senior incumbent lawmakers such as former floor leader Rep. Park Jie-won.Kwon directly pointed his finger at the party chief for being “self-righteous and exclusive,” and for creating a “pro-Roh hegemony” within the party.Moon, who was chief secretary to late President Roh Moo-hyun, has often been blamed for excluding conventional key figures and acting against the Honam  voters’ sentiment.Honam voters, whose support is considered crucial for opposition victory in elections, have increasingly grown apathetic since Moon, who is considered a political heir to Roh, took the wheel.The New Politics Alliance for Democracy, the former incarnation of the Minjoo Party, had formerly enjoyed 48-55 percent approval ratings in the area, according to local pollster Gallup Korea. But this figure dropped down to the low 40 percent range upon Moon’s inauguration in February last year, and dipped further to around 30 percent amid escalating factional feuds late last year.“There is no hope or future for a party that does not take responsibility for consecutive election failures,” the senior politician said.Kwon had earlier demanded that Moon step down and give way to an emergency council. The demand for Moon’s resignation was one of the key sticking points between the colliding factions, eventually leading to former cochairman Ahn Cheol-soo’s defection in December. He, however, hinted that he would not join Ahn‘s forthcoming People’s Party and that he will remain a supporter of the opposition camp in general.“Kwon’s defection shows that the Minjoo Party has parted with the Honam region for good and slipped into a leftist activist group, short of political legitimacy,” said third-term lawmaker Park Joo-sun, who had earlier defected from the party.Leader Moon held himself together and accepted the breakup.“ reflects the public sentiment of the Honam region, and this we should accept with a humble heart,” Moon told reporters. “But with the help of new members, our party will advance into a whole new, young and capable political power.” Independent Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo  and professor Han Sang-jin , cochairman of the party preparatory committee, pay respects at the cemetery of late President Roh Moo-hyun in Bongha Village, South Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. YonhapWhile the main opposition camp remained divided over the pro-Roh clique dispute, Ahn visited the late president’s Bongha Village in South Gyeongsang Province on Tuesday and paid respects at his cemetery.During his visit, some Roh supporters held up signs protesting Ahn’s visit, blaming him for splitting the opposition.

An expert in gifted education agrees with the latter. Suh Ye-won, director of the state-run National Research Center for Gifted and Talented Education, says such education can achieve a true sense of equal opportunity by helping talented students reach their full potential.“Though the previous form of gifted education is only for those students who excel academically, it is now about encouraging students with different talents to achieve their full potential. We are working to find those students and give them a chance to develop those talents,” Suh said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald“The purpose of gifted education is to give tailored education to different people. Giving the same education to students with different gifts is not an equal education. According to the Constitution Article 31 Clause 1, everyone is entitled to equal education according to their talent,” she said.The director noted that the government’s involvement is the unique part of the nation’s gifted education. In 2000, lawmakers enacted the Promotion Act for the Gifted and Talented Education, a law that paved way for the government to build schools and programs dedicated to gifted students.The recruiting process for gifted students is another distinctive feature, Suh added. She noted that Korea’s gifted education involved tailored tests and teachers’ recommendations, different from those of other countries that use a cognitive test to determine the students’ advanced ability. Education for gifted children is provided in three forms: gifted classes, gifted education centers and gifted schools. The first two are similar to extracurricular activities while the third is a full-time high school.Suh also refuted criticisms that gifted schools fan public fervor over private education by compelling eager parents and students to undergo immense cramming to pass the schools’ admissions tests. “There is no mathematical evidence to supports the claim that gifted schools contributed to the soaring amount of private education. In Korea, private education is for college admission, not for gifted education,” said Suh, arguing that the school’s admission test is too creative for the crammers to catch up with. “The nation should focus more on gifted education’s positive aspects than the negative ones. It is absurd to abandon the education altogether out of fear that it might cater to a few free riders who could have received private education,” she said. Among the benefits of gifted education, she highlighted that it could discover marginalized but talented students with little access to the advanced education. The government regulation mandates that 10 percent of the gifted schools’ seats must be filled by underprivileged students.“There are many talented students with much potential who are deprived of opportunity for education. We need to find these kids and push them to reach their full potential,” she said.By Yeo Jun-suk","gifted education in korea ,debate over gifted education ,korea herald an expert ,expert in gifted education ,education in korea","['Korea', 'Chung Hee - cho', 'Korea Herald)An', 'Suh Ye - won']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29102474  0.42131257

Last year’s data by civil group World Without Worries About Private Education showed that parents spent 3.2 trillion won in a year on private education for their preschool children.When children excel at their given task, many parents send them off to schools for the gifted in the hope that they may be the next child prodigy.  “In addition to academic ability, we look at each children’s ability to motivate themselves, curiosity and creativity,” said Hong Kyeong-hee, an official from Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education who supervises these education centers. “In order to do so, we’ve implemented a system where the homeroom teacher recommends students to be accepted to education centers based on a year of observation, in addition to the existing interviews and tests.”According to the Education Ministry, there are currently some 2,524 classes for the gifted in schools across the country, and seven high schools which are built for the education of the gifted. In addition, education offices operate the education center for the gifted.But there has been criticism that the so-called “gifted” schools had deviated from their initial purpose of fostering talented students in their respective areas. Rep. Yoo Ki-hong of the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea analyzed the data from four science schools for the gifted, and found that 8.7 percent of their graduates went to study medicine in college.In addition, almost all of the schools for the gifted are based on students’ academic abilities, stoking complaints that they have turned into cookie-cutter elite schools, sitting atop the school pecking order.”The government enacted the law to foster child prodigies excelling in various fields, yet many of its students fall in line in a race to be accepted to prestigious colleges,“ said Kim Jeong-yeon, a researcher for the World Without Worries About Private Education.Kim’s group recently divulged that 66.4 percent of the math questions in the entrance exams for gifted high schools were not part of the middle school curriculum, accusing them of prompting students to receive private education in order to be accepted.What’s worse, Kim pointed out, is that contrary to their founding purposes, the gifted schools fail to provide education programs that allow students to foster creativity.“In order to conduct a creative education,  need to develop content and curriculum for them. But right now, teachers are largely responsible for creating programs. There is no actual guideline that they can abide by. Expanding just in quantity is not the priority,” she said. Park In-ho, formerly head of the Korea Society for the Gifted, wrote in his paper, “The System and Policy for the Education of the Gifted in Korea” that gifted education was initiated in the 1970s as a reaction to side effects deriving from the standardization of education that saw abolishment of elite secondary schools. “The driving idea behind the policy was to provide students with special abilities and talents an education that was compatible with such abilities, thus providing an equal learning opportunity,” he wrote. The idea took off when the comprehensive education plan for the gifted was devised 1982, which was succeeded by the research lab on gifted education at the state-run Korea Education Development Institute in 1987. In 2000, the country enacted the Act for Promoting Education for the Gifted. According to the bill, the term “gifted” refers to those with an outstanding talent that requires a specialized education to develop their full potential. Last year, the Education Ministry revised the law so that elementary and middle schools for the gifted could open.Since then, the government has worked to include as many students as it can in the education program. Roughly 1.8 percent of Korean students are currently receiving education for the gifted, according to the Education Ministry. Last year, the ministry said they aim to expand the percentage of students participating in the gifted programs to 3 percent.The government includes the number of classes for gifted students in its evaluation of 17 education offices, mandating them to match its quota.Experts, however, say that the education program for the gifted should shift its focus from quantity to quality. Lee Won-key, the vice chief of Seoul National University of Education and an expert in English education, said that the main issue hindering the education for the gifted is that the teachers did not have a full grasp on how to teach child prodigies. “Basically in Korea, child prodigies are placed under expectations to have certain level of knowledge. So the teachers give them complicated problems to solve instead of encouraging their inner drive to be curious and learn new things,” said Lee, who has helped advise on education policies in previous administrations. He said that the authorities must change their framework of education for the gifted. “The gifted children have the capacity to think outside the box, but existing programs for the gifted are based on lectures and question-solving. The gifted education must go back to the ‘basics,’ guiding students to look at things from a new perspective and encourage them to think rather than to instruct,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","educating gifted last month ,retracted his first academic ,science prodigy once dubbed ,youngest ever korean ph ,first academic paper axisymmetric","['Song Yoo', 'axisymmetric', 'korean ph.d.']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24001421  0.61287326

Suh Ye-won, director of the state-run National Research Center for Gifted and Talented Education says that the education can achieve a true sense of equal opportunity by helping talented students reach their full potential.“Though the previous form of gifted education is only for those students who excel academically, the education now is about encouraging students with different talents to achieve their full potential. We are working to find those students and give them a chance to develop those talents,” Suh said in an interview with The Korea Herald.“The purpose of gifted education is to give tailored education to different people. Giving the same education to students with different gifts is not an equal education. According to the Constitution Article 31 Clause 1, everyone is entitled to equal education according to their talent,” she said.Suh Ye-won, director of the state-run National Research Center for Gifted and Talented Education. Chung Hee-cho/ The Korea HeraldThe director noted that the government’s involvement is the unique part of the nation’s gifted education. In 2000, lawmakers enacted the Promotion Act for the Gifted and Talented Education, a law that paved way for the government to build schools and programs dedicated to gifted students.Following the legislation, the government built comprehensive plans to implement the policy. In 2003, the Ministry of Education announced “the first Master Plan” to give the policymaker specified guideline on the gifted education. Since then, the plan has been updated every five year.The recruiting process for gifted students is another distinctive feature, Suh added. She noted that Korea’s gifted education involved tailored tests and teachers’ recommendations, different from those of other countries that use a cognitive test to determine the students’ advanced ability. “It is quite unique system. If gifted kids feel that they have a talent for certain area, they can design their academic trajectory following the area. We split the students into different categories and educate them accordingly,” said Suh.     “In fact, the government had wanted to abolish the paper test altogether and relied mostly on teachers recommendation in recruiting the gifted students. But some parents questioned the objectiveness of teachers’ recommendation. So the ministry decided to use both the test and recommendation,” she said    The education system for the gifted students is broken into three parts: Gifted Class, Gifted Education Center and Gifted School. “Gifted Class” and “Gifted Education Center” are similar to extra-curricular activities where talented students gather to receive advanced education outside of their curriculum.     Unlike the two, the Gifted School is a full-time high school. They only admits the student having passed the government assessment – such as paper test, interview, teachers’ recommendation and among others. In 2015, a total of 1966 students attend the school, an equivalent of 0.03 percent of total students.     Suh Ye-won, director of the state-run National Research Center for Gifted and Talented Education. Chung Hee-cho/ The Korea Herald    Critics blamed the gifted schools for creating the public fervor over private education. They asserted that the schools’ admission tests, which is too difficult for the students they say, compel parents and students to undergo immense cramming to get into the schools.     For instance, Education civic group “A World Without Worries About Private Education” claimed in December that over 66 percent of the gifted schools’ admission test in math includes questions that is above the standard of the middle school and outside of the regular curriculum.      Seo disputed the argument. “There is no mathematical evidence to supports the claim that gifted schools contributed to the soaring amount of private education. In Korea, private education is for college admission, not for gifted education. And Getting into the schools does not guarantee college admission,” said Suh.     “The gifted schools’ admission tests are too creative and complex. Private school and immense cramming do not make the student past the test. Even if some students made it through, they would fail halfway through the curriculum because it is too challenging curriculum,” she said. The expert asserted that the nation should focus more on the gifted education’s positive aspect that the negative one. She noted that it is “absurd” to abandon the education altogether out of fear that it “might” cater to few free riders who could have received private education.  Among the benefits of the gifted education, she highlighted that it can discover marginalized talented students with little access to the advanced education. The government regulation mandates that the 10 percent of the gifted schools’ students must be filled with the underprivileged students. . She hoped that the gifted education would be expanded to the area outside of math and science. Among the eight gifted schools, six are science schools and the other two’s admission is eyeing on science minds. According to the KEDI statistics, more than 80 percent of pupils are gifted students in science. “There are many talented students with much potential who are deprived of opportunity for education. We need to find these kids and make them push to their full potential. In fact, some gifted schools’ teacher gather information about these kids and pay a visit to them to recruit,” she said. “Personally, I believe that the system should evolve in a way that it can educate every student with diverse talent. These days, talents artists and athletes are as much as important genius scientists as singer Psy and figure skater Kim Yuna did,” she said.By Yeo Jun-suk","gifted education in korea ,debate over gifted education ,expert in gifted education ,gifted education to help ,education in korea","['Korea', 'Suh Ye - won']",8,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23129264  0.52228826

In an editorial, the state-run Global Times newspaper appeared to defend North Korea's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons, saying there will be ""no hope"" for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions unless South Korea, the U.S. and Japan change their policy toward the North. All eyes are on the role of China, which keeps North Korea's moribund economy afloat, after Pyongyang announced it conducted a ""successful"" test of a hydrogen bomb that marked the isolated regime's fourth nuclear test since 2006. The Wednesday test is seen as a diplomatic failure by Chinese President Xi Jinping of trying to rein in the key ally. While China has said it is ""firmly opposed"" to the nuclear test, Beijing's leadership has been reluctant to use more leverage over Pyongyang because it could lead to the North's collapse and instability on its border. ""The root causes of the North Korean nuclear issue are very complicated. For one thing, the North Korean regime has chosen the wrong path for security, and for another, the U.S. has persistently stuck to a hostile policy toward North Korea,"" the editorial reads. ""There is no hope to put an end to the North Korean nuclear conundrum if the U.S., South Korea and Japan do not change their policies toward Pyongyang,"" it said. ""Solely depending on Beijing's pressure to force the North to give up its nuclear plan is an illusion."" During a telephone discussion on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, ""There cannot be business as usual"" after North Korea's fourth nuclear test. Kerry said he reached the agreement with Wang, after making clear to his Chinese counterpart that the latest nuclear test has proven that Beijing's approach to the North Korean nuclear issue ""has not worked.""In return, Wang stressed that China ""remains committed to achieving the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a brief statement.","korea nuclear test newspaper ,fourth nuclear test in ,nuclear test newspaper ,for korea nuclear test ,north fourth nuclear test","['China', 'Communist Party', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Global Times', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang']",8,[2.         0.         0.         ... 0.08027104 0.41988569 0.08825735],KH디지털2,International,1,2016,"north korea fourth nuclear test ,the nuclear test beijing leadership ,korea fourth nuclear test kerry ,nuclear ambitions unless south korea ,after north korea fourth nuclear","['China', 'Communist Party', 'South Korea', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'North Korea', 'Global Times', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'China', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'chinese', 'Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Pyongyang', 'north korean', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'North Korea', 'north korean', 'U.S.', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing', 'U.S.', 'State', 'John Kerry', 'chinese', 'Wang Yi', ""North Korea 's"", 'Kerry', 'Wang', 'chinese', 'Beijing', 'north korean', 'Wang', 'China', 'chinese']",1,[2.         0.         0.         ... 0.08027104 0.41988569 0.08825735]

Three years later, he moved to Seoul and began publishing a serial in a comic magazine under his pen name, Lee Sang-moo.The late cartoonist was best known for Dokgo Tak, an iconic baseball pitcher and a ""Little Engine That Could"" type of character.
