It would be hard to find a South Korean adult now who does not know who Choi Soon-sil is. The woman, once shrouded in secrecy, is President Park Geun-hye’s friend of 40 years and the central figure of a sweeping corruption and peddling of influence scandal that sparked massive protests in South Korea and eventually led to the president’s impeachment on Dec. 9. A daughter of Choi Tae-min, Park’s late mentor and a shamanistic cult leader, the 60-year-old Choi is now jailed awaiting trial, accused of using her ties to Park to gain influence and personal favors and help her 20-year-old daughter receive special treatment in her education and sporting career. Park Geun-hyePresident Park Geun-hye started 2016 on solid footing -- with job approval ratings over 40 percent -- and ended the year mired in a nightmare. Embroiled in a sweeping corruption scandal involving her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, Park is now impeached and suspended from office, pending an impeachment trial. The disgraced leader, however, insists the nation has not seen the last of her. Denying all accusations against her and despite abysmal support of just 4 percent, Park is gearing up for a tough fight at the Constitutional Court to save her job and reputation. Lee Jae-yongWhat would have been an ambitious year of the debut of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong became a year of tumult, from the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7, prone to fire, to a humiliating parliamentary hearing that intensified public outrage against the conglomerate’s alleged corruptive dealings with President Park Geun-hye and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. Despite Lee’s decision to join the boardroom in late October, widely seen as a modern-day coronation of the heir to the nation’s largest conglomerate, a series of complex problems emerged including suspicions surrounding last year’s merger between Samsung C&T; and Cheil industries. The developments also brought to the fore social debates on South Korean conglomerates’ hereditary succession and collusive ties through politics.Lee is expected to continue facing challenges in 2017, including the ongoing special investigations on Samsung’s alleged bribery, and the tech giant’s shaky position as the global leader amid deteriorating economy and intensifying market competition.Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho came under fire over lack of efforts to rescue cash-strapped Hanjin Shipping this year. While Cho belatedly offered to provide 500 billion won , including from his personal assets, creditors refused it, citing lack of funds to save the company. The ailing shipper finally filed for court receivership in September. Further controversy was raised in November after the chairman admitted to having been pressured from Cheong Wa Dae to step down from the top position in the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics Organizing Committee. Cho resigned from the post in May. Suspicion grew that President Park Geun-hye’s close confidante Choi Soon-Sil, who is under fire in the peddling of influence scandal, played a part in Cho’s resignation.Rising Star Song Joong-ki Actor Song Joong-ki holds the trophy for the Grand Prize at the 2016 Asia Pacific Actors Network Star Awards, held at broadcasting network MBC’s headquarters in northwestern Seoul on Sunday afternoon. Song Joong-ki has enjoyed huge popularity across Asia and even helped buoy the Korean economy.His portrayal of the dashing Army Capt. Yoo Shi-jin in the smash-hit series “Descendants of the Sun” was also streamed on Chinese video platform Iqiyi. This fueled tourism and sales of featured products, generating more than 3 trillion won  to the economy here. Song’s stardom came as his pretty-boy image was stripped away, a tag which had followed the actor since his 2008 debut. His on-screen roles have been diverse in comparison, including a half-human being in the movie “A Werewolf Boy” .Top golfer Park In-bee Park In-bee won her first Olympic gold medal in women’s golf in August. In the event, the first staged in 116 years as an official Olympic program at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, she shot a 16-under 268 for first place. Despite her thumb injury, which had sidelined her from major competitions in the lead-up to the Olympics, she beat world No. 1 Lydia Ko of New Zealand, at silver, by five shots. Park had rested from LPGA Tour events since June. She then entered a KLPGA event just two weeks before the opening of the Olympic Games, where she missed the cut. Many Koreans worried about her joining the Korean Olympic team, but she more than calmed the worries by winning the gold. Park received the annual presidential Sports award, the highest honor given by the government to athletes who have contributed to the development of Korea in athletics. The award recognizes her winning her first Olympic gold medal in golf and three consecutive majors in 2013.Anti-Park protestors Joint Press CorpHow South Korean protestors forced President Park Geun-hye out -- although not permanently, yet -- was the bright side of the political fiasco that has swept the country over the last two months of 2016. Starting off with about 20,000 participants in late October, shortly after President Park’s scandal broke, Saturday night’s candlelight vigils grew bigger week after week in turnout, peaking at a record 2.32 million on Dec. 3. Although the message was unforgiving and stern, demanding Park’s immediate ouster, the rallies were devoid of unruly scenes, such as violent clashes with police or loads of trash left behind on the street. Not a single protestor was booked for unlawful activities.Ex-top court judge Kim Young-ran Kim Young-ran, former Supreme Court Justice and Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission chief, who motioned the anti-graft bill to impose sanctions on public servants, journalists and teachers taking overpriced gifts, cash or service. A former Supreme Court justice, Kim Young-ran has been a lifelong champion of anti-corruption efforts in South Korea, where bribery often disguises itself in customs of gift-giving and hospitality. Her campaign for a fairer and more transparent society bore fruit on Sept. 28., when the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, more frequently referred to as the Kim Young-ran law, came into effect. The sweeping anti-graft law bans government officials, journalists and teachers from offering and receiving meals worth over 30,000 won , presents of over 50,000 won and monetary gifts of over 100,000 won.Go player Lee Se-dol Eighteen-time world champion Go player Lee Se-dol had a historic Go match with artificial intelligence in March after Google DeepMind’s AI system AlphaGo threw down the gauntlet for one of the most complex board games in history. After the second of the five Go games with AlphaGo, Lee said, “I could not find any weakness . It was completely my failure.”The 4-1 defeat of one of the world’s top human Go players in the $1 million match astonished the world, demonstrating dramatic advances in AI.K-pop revolutionary, BTSBoy band BTS ​Boy band BTS, short for Bangtan Boys, achieved a strange kind of popularity in the K-pop scene, captivating an international audience before coming to acclaim in Korea. The seven-member group’s first album “Wings,” released in October, was listed as the best K-pop album of 2016 by US Billboard. Three of its music videos -- “Fire,” “Blood, Sweat & Tears” and “Save Me” -- ranked among the 10 most-viewed music videos of 2016 on YouTube, surpassing groups like EXO and Twice who have a stronger presence in the local music scene.BTS was the only foreign artist on the most-searched list on Japanese Twitter, coming in at No. 7. It ranked fifth in the Philippines’ “Biggest Twitter Moment in 2016,” and came in seventh place in Singapore’s “Biggest Hashtag Trend of the Year.”","attends her first trial ,trial at the seoul ,scandal that sparked massive ,her first trial at ,find south korean adult","['Park Hae - mook', 'the Korea Herald)It', 'south korean', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun']",9,[1.         1.         1.         ... 0.01359577 0.56285143 0.01790981],KH디지털2,National,12,2016,"south korean protestors forced president ,korean olympic team but she ,president park scandal broke saturday ,korean protestors forced president park ,her joining the korean olympic","['Choi Soon - sil', 'south korean', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea', 'Choi Tae - min', 'Park', 'Choi', 'Park', 'Park Geun - hyePresident Park Geun - hye', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Park', 'Park', 'the Constitutional Court', 'Lee Jae - yongWhat', 'Samsung Electronics', 'Lee Jae - yong', 'Park Geun', 'Choi Soon - sil', 'Lee', 'Samsung C&T', 'south korean', 'Lee', 'Samsung', 'Hanjin Group', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Hanjin Group', 'Cho Yang - ho', 'Hanjin Shipping', 'Cho', 'Cheong', 'Cho', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Cho ’s', 'Song Joong - ki', 'MBC', 'Seoul', 'Song Joong - ki', 'korean', 'Army Capt', 'Yoo Shi - jin', 'chinese', 'Iqiyi', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Brazil', 'Lydia Ko', 'New Zealand', 'LPGA Tour', 'Koreans', 'korean', 'Korea', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'Kim Young - run', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Supreme Court', 'Anti - Corruption and Civil Rights Commission', 'Supreme Court', 'Kim Young - ran', 'South Korea', 'the Improper Solicitation', 'Kim Young - ran', 'Lee Se - dol', 'Lee Se - dol', 'Google DeepMind ’s', 'AlphaGo', 'AlphaGo', 'Lee', 'BTSBoy', 'BTS', 'Korea', 'US Billboard', 'YouTube', 'EXO', 'Twice', 'Japanese Twitter', 'Philippines', 'Singapore']",2,[1.         1.         1.         ... 0.01359577 0.56285143 0.01790981]

The National Assembly voted to impeach the president on Friday, suspending her from office pending a Constitutional Court decision.Winding up their months-long investigation, prosecutors said Cho conspired with President Park in compelling Sohn on the phone in July 2013. Cho allegedly told the conglomerate chief that the group will be prone to serious backlashes if the CJ vice chairman does not come down from her post. Since CJ ultimately refused Cho's request, prosecutors indicted Cho for attempted coercion.Prosecutors also announced the indictment of Kim Chong, a former vice culture minister, on charges of colluding with Choi and her niece Chang Si-ho to force conglomerates to donate billions of won to a winter sports foundation established by Chang.President Park and her former senior secretary Ahn Jong-beom were separately accused of colluding with Choi and her associates in forcing an affiliate of the Korea Tourism Organization to create a wheelchair fencing team and give special favors to Choi's company through an agency contract.The probe began in October when a civic group accused Park's confidante Choi and her associates of meddling in government affairs without holding any title in the administration and amassing wealth illegally by using their ties with those in power. Choi is currently awaiting trial for fraud and embezzlement.With the launch of an independent counsel team this week, the prosecutors raised the need for further investigations by special prosecutors into suspicions of Park's third-party bribery in forcing or attempting to force top conglomerates, such as Samsung and Lotte, to extend financial support worth tens of billions of won to the Choi family.Prosecutors also asked the independent counsel team to open investigations into former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo on suspicion of protecting Choi and her associates.Prosecutors made public details of Choi's alleged involvement in state affairs.Choi visited the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae at least 10 times illegally without going through the due identification process, prosecutors said, adding she mainly used a presidential secretary's vehicle to enter Cheong Wa Dae.Prosecutors said they will hand over Ahn's notebooks that contained Park's instructions from January 2015 and October this year, and transcripts of phone conversations between former secretary for private presidential affairs Jeong Ho-seong and the president, as well as those between Jeong and Choi, to the independent counsel team.In most conversations, Jeong listened to Choi's opinions about key state affairs after sending classified Cheong Wa Dae documents via Gmail from November 2012 to December 2014. They also held a total of 895 phone conversations and 1,197 text message exchanges from February 2013, when Park took office as president, to December 2014, prosecutors said.Prosecutors said they confirmed a tablet PC, key evidence in the snowballing scandal that contained hundreds of classified Cheong Wa Dae documents, belongs to Choi, noting, for instance, that some messages in the PC were sent to Germany in July 2012 and July-August 2013, when Choi was staying in the European country for a visit.Choi has been flatly denying ownership of the tablet, saying she does not even know how to use such a gadget.Prosecutors have countered, based on digital forensic analysis and Choi's immigration records, that much of the location information kept on the tablet PC coincides with where she has been. They have also cited testimony from many people around her who said they saw her using it.","park suspect in presidential ,2013 prosecutors said sunday ,district prosecutors office indicted ,sunday announcing their indictment ,presidential aide attempted coercion","['Park Geun', ""Cho Won - dong 's"", ""CJ Group 's"", 'Cho', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' office"", 'Cho']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22651212  0.39608318

He survived after having his stomach and intestines pumped.In court, he said he swallowed the methamphetamine to commit suicide out of fear that he would be put behind bars again after being imprisoned for a long time in China.The court accepted the man's claim, finding him not guilty of drug use because the charge requires drugs to be taken for one's pleasure.","drug trafficking 25 year ,prison for drug trafficking ,guilty of trafficking drugs ,for drug trafficking 25 ,in prison for drug","['chinese', 'South Korea', 'the Incheon District Court', 'chinese', 'Qingdao']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49497899  0.08360929

The special investigation team Sunday indicted Park’s confidante Choi Soon-sil and former presidential aide An Chong-bum for their involvement in coercing corporations to donate funds to the Mir and K-sports foundations, which are suspected of being a cover for channeling funds to Choi. But the prosecution left out bribery charges against the government, citing the lack of evidence. While the arraignment said the companies had “no choice” but to make the donations, it has been suspected that the 77.4 billion won  of donations were essentially bribes from the biggest and most powerful corporations in the country.The opposition has upped their calls for Park to be investigated for bribery.“The president had a private meeting with corporate chiefs and demanded that they make contributions to the foundations, and provided favors for them. ... How is  different from the bribery cases in the past of former Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo?” said Rep. Kim Boo-kyun of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea.Over 600,000 citizens gathered in Seoul for an anti-Park protest Saturday, calling for the corporations to be punished and saying they should not be viewed as victims of coercion.While Choi and An have been indicted for coercing money from corporations, it was termed “abuse of power.” Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong walks out of the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul on Monday after attending a hearing for his arrest warrant. The vice minister is accused of assisting Choi Soon-sil, President Park Geun-hye‘s friend, in getting local conglomerates to support projects of Choi or her close associates. “We were very concerned about the matter, but the principal of bribery is “illegal solicitation and it was vague,” said an official from the prosecution.One case involved Lotte Group donating 7 billion won to the K-Sports Foundation. It has been alleged that the money was meant to stop an investigation into the conglomerate, a suspicion further fueled by the fact that the foundation returned the money to Lotte just before the investigators commenced an all-out probe. Hyundai Motor Group, which donated 12.8 billion won and inked multibillion-won deals with companies controlled by Choi’s associates, is also suspected of receiving benefits last year. Under Korean criminal law, abuse of power can be punished by up to five years in prison while bribery is punishable by at least 10 years in prison if the bribe was 100 million won or more.Park has vowed not to cooperate with the investigation, claiming that the charges against her are baseless.Officials from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said Monday that it is realistically difficult to take Park into custody, as the Constitution does not allow Park to be prosecuted. With the investigation limited, the prosecution is expected to focus on proving the bribery charges. Prosecutor General Kim Soo-nam has reportedly ordered investigators to apply bribery charges to whoever necessary, if evidence is found.The investigators continued to close in on Park by requesting an arrest warrant for former Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Cho Won-dong.

The other offender was never caught. Airdre MattnerJoo Hyo-jung, a lawyer for Polaris & Partners representing Mattner, said it is an exceptionally strong punishment for an offender charged with semi-forcible sexual molestation. The case has shed light on problems faced by sexual assault victims under Korea‘s justice system, particularly for foreigners who may be more vulnerable due to language barriers and a lack of community support.Her case was initially closed by police without an arrest. But it was reopened amid media attention after Mattner publicly accused the police of failing to gather evidence and inform her of the probe process. Police issued an open letter to the victim to “straighten misinformation” and refuted the victim’s claims on Facebook, only to face a wave of criticism for publicly humiliating the victim. They later made an apology for “unintended troubles” and took down the post. Mattner said she is seeking to file for compensation against the police for secondary damage and professional negligence.  The defendant can file an appeal within a week. If the sentence is confirmed in higher courts, he will serve the prison term in Korea and be deported afterward. He will also be registered on a public list of sex offenders in Korea.

Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, lashed out at the prosecution Thursday, calling it “politically minded” and accusing it of “trumping up” criminal charges against her and other lawmakers.Her accusations came a day after state prosecutors indicted her and 13 other party lawmakers on charges of violating election rules during the April parliamentary election. “It is a false, concocted indictment,” the Minjoo chief said during an emergency session of her party’s decision-making Supreme Council. Choo said that prosecutors had leveled charges against her and her colleagues as a “retaliatory” step against the opposition party, which recently made a series of corruption allegations involving some of President Park Geun-hye’s close aides.Rep. Choo Mi-ae “I will never let it slip by should  capitalize on the law to conceal any corruption ,” she said. “We will definitely win in the presidential election , shore up justice and return the prosecution to the people.”Among Minjoo members indicted is Rep. Yun Ho-jung, the party’s top policymaker, and the chief campaign manager of National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. When convicted of an election law violation and sentenced to a fine of 1 million won  or more, a lawmaker automatically loses his or her parliamentary seat.The ruling Saenuri Party, meanwhile, said, “Everybody is equal before the law. “The opposition party says the prosecution’s measure was intended to repress it or retaliate against it,” Saenuri spokesman Kim Sung-won told reporters. “But this reaction shows its overbearing attitude to reign over the law.”Twelve Saenuri lawmakers were also indicted for election law violations, the party said.","bashes prosecution over indictment ,after state prosecutors indicted ,state prosecutors indicted her ,thursday calling it politically ,charges of violating election","['Choo Mi - ae', 'Minjoo Party', 'Korea']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.02320305  0.22763327

Instead of going back to university, he started to work at a third-tier mobile parts supplier for Samsung Electronics. “I had no idea how dangerous a job it would be. I was told that I would have to handle alcohol. There was no training on safety at all,” he told The Korea Herald. “On my first day at work, a manager there showed me how to work with machines for a few minutes and I got on with my job right away.”  Without protective gear, he worked for 12 hours in conditions where he was exposed to methanol without sufficient ventilation alongside 30 other workers. He chose to work the night shift to receive extra pay, which earned him about 2 million won  a month. Three weeks after he began to work for supplier Deokyong ENG, Kim began to have trouble in breathing and blurry vision in both eyes. He lost sight in the right eye and most vision in his left eye due to methanol poisoning, his doctor said. “I can only see big shapes of things, but cannot see the center. The doctor was not sure whether I could recover my vision,” said Kim, who dreamed of becoming a barista. “There is not much I can do on my own, from walking on the street to buying groceries.” “I came forward because I hope there will be no more victims like me,” he said, adding that workers like him dispatched through recruitment agencies are easy to exclude from protection. “There might be many other victims who don’t even know their blindness is due to dangerous working conditions.”While the government and big businesses appear to do little to monitor multi-layered supply chains in the manufacturing sector, seven irregular workers belonging to Samsung and LG’s lower-tier outsourced subcontractors, all in their 20s and 30s, suffered loss of vision and brain damage due to exposure to methanol at work. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, sight loss and even death. Ethanol is recommended over methanol because it is less toxic, but ethanol costs three times more.  According the Labor Ministry, there are 12,153 factories using methanol to produce goods, with the majority being small-scale employers with less than 50 employees.  Amid mounting concerns over safety of workers handling toxic chemicals, the ministry conducted an inspection of about 3,100 factories in February. It imposed penalties on 1,311 employers and ordered a full suspension of business on one company and a partial suspension on eight firms. As two more victims of alleged methanol poisoning came to light last week, lawmakers from opposition parties condemned the Labor Ministry for its lukewarm efforts to monitor the use of harmful substances at work and stop “preventable” occupational accidents. “There would have been no more cases of methanol poisoning if the government, subcontracted firms and recruitment agencies made efforts  when the case first surfaced in February 2015,” said Rep. Han Jeong-ae of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea during a press briefing Wednesday. “It is the result of the Labor Ministry’s failed monitoring of subcontractors and lax management of toxic substances used at work,” she said. “The government should tighten safety regulations and carry out a comprehensive inspection of factories using the toxic substance to find out possible victims.”Rep. Lee Jeong-mi of the minor Justice Party blamed conglomerates outsourcing tasks to subcontracted firms for neglecting dangerous working conditions through their supply chains. “Subcontractors for Samsung and LG used the toxic substance methanol only to save 700 won per kilogram,” she said. “Do lives of irregular workers deserve to be wasted like that?”An official from the Ministry of Employment and Labor said the ministry has “difficulties” in tracking all the victims but it tries to improve the monitoring system. “Some 300 inspectors across the nation regularly monitor safety of workplaces to prevent similar cases,” the official said. He also added that first-tier businesses have no legal obligation, but need to “make efforts” to enhance safety for workers at their subcontractors. Lee Sang-yoon, a doctor for occupational environment and health, said a series of methanol poisoning cases shed light on the vulnerability of irregular workers often excluded from the social safety net.“We are concerned that there are many others who just accept their illness without knowing it might be linked to working conditions,” said the head of Solidarity for Workers’ Health, urging the government to conduct a thorough inspection and promptly accept the victims’ application for industrial insurance funds. “Though we understand that first-tier manufacturers are not legally responsible, they are morally and socially responsible for laborers working to final goods,” he said, addressing the role of big businesses in enhancing safety for workers.

On April 19, the day of the murder, the victim fled as soon as she spotted Han, but he chased her down and stabbed her to death. Han claimed in court that the weapons he had carried were intended for him to commit suicide.However, the court said it is difficult to view the extensive array of knives and coils Han had, as well as a pair of gloves and a motorcycle, as tools to assist in his own suicide. The knife Han had in his shirt pocket as he ran after the victim had a taped handle for a better grip. The court looked over the contents of earlier text messages exchanged between Han and the victim and determined the latter had worried about Han even after they had ended their relationship. Despite the evidence presented, Han continued to put the blame on the victim, claiming he had a “soft heart.” The prosecution initially sought the death penalty for Han. However, the court handed down lifetime imprisonment, as the “death penalty should only be ruled in cases such as serial murder.” By Lim Jeong-yeo","for murdering ex girlfriend ,murdering ex girlfriend man ,murdering ex girlfriend ,brutally killing the victim ,murdered his ex girlfriend","['Seoul Dongbu District Court', 'Han', 'Han']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22849908 -0.06072895

The Jeju District Prosecutors' Office said the defendants are suspected of assaulting the 53-year-old owner of the restaurant, identified only by her last name Ahn, on the southern resort island on Sept. 9, causing a brain hemorrhage. They are also accused of beating three others who were attempting to stop the violence. The incident took place after Ahn prohibited the tourists from drinking alcohol they brought from outside the restaurant, according to prosecutors. They allegedly attacked her when she asked them to pay for the food they ordered before leaving.Police originally booked eight Chinese but one of them was later found not to have been at the site of the incident. The case has sparked intense public outcry along with a series of other crimes committed by Chinese tourists on the island. There have been growing calls to toughen border control and review the existing visa waiver program to prevent similar crimes.","indicted seven chinese tourists ,assaulting korean restaurant owner ,tourists indicted for assaulting ,indicted for assaulting korean ,for assaulting korean restaurant","['chinese', 'south korean', ""the Jeju District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Ahn']",9,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.25784609  0.12576881

Lee had not undergone a sex change procedure.The MMA said that Lee did not regularly receive hormone or other medicinal procedures and that it was difficult to deem that Lee was suffering from social and occupational difficulties due to her gender dysphoria.The High Court, however, said that it was still troubling to conclude that Lee did not experience difficulties. Lee was conscripted in September 2012 after a number of different physical examination results. But she was sent home soon after due to personality disorder, among other reasons.In a follow-up examination, Lee was again ordered to enlist in June 2014, even though the examination office judged that Lee had gender dysphoria.Lee filed a suit in January 2015 for a cancelation of the conscription order.The first ruling had said that Lee received consistent psychological treatment for over four years for gender dysphoria and that it was difficult to deem that Lee had lied about her condition for the sole purpose of evading military service.Human rights groups have accused the MMA of forcing transgendered women to undergo sex-change procedures without due regulations by refusing to recognize their dysphoria.","court upholds trans woman ,year old transgendered woman ,trans woman military service ,trans woman military ,friday upheld lower court","['the Military Manpower Administration', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Lee', 'MMA', 'MMA', 'Lee ’s']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.37423596 -0.06720664

The doctors reportedly said he will live. The relationship between the two students had soured since mid-July when they fought over a callous remark made on social media regarding an ex-girlfriend.The affronted ex-boyfriend began to bully the other, hitting him across the face, abdomen and legs at park and in the school washroom on a total of four counts.

The warrant is valid until Oct. 25, and one or two members of Baek’s family, one or two doctor recommended by the family and a lawyer can be allowed to observe. The police’s repeated attempts to examine the body of Baek against the wishes of his bereaved family has drawn nationwide criticism. Police have claimed the autopsy is necessary to figure out the exact cause of his death. The police -- currently facing a compensation suit by the bereaved families -- have not admitted to causing Baek’s death.Bereaved family members and protesters denounce the court’s issuance of a warrant to conduct an autopsy on Baek Nam-gi in a rally in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul on Thursday. During a massive rally on Nov. 14, Baek was targeted by a police water cannon and knocked unconscious by a water blast from it. He was taken to a hospital, but never regained consciousness before succumbing to death Sunday. His immediate cause of death was given as acute renal failure.Around 350 people, who defined themselves as a group against the state for Baek’s death, held a rally denouncing the police in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul.“Although Baek’s family does not want an autopsy, the prosecution, police and the court are trying to push ahead with the autopsy. We cannot but suspect an attempt to conceal or distort  cause of death,” the group said in a statement, which was signed by 3,000 citizens. During the rally, Baek Min-juhwa, the second daughter of the farmer, stated bluntly her family does not trust the police. “I do not understand how the murderer  can be responsible for uncovering the truth . ... We  are absolutely against leaving my father’s body to the police that killed him, when the cause of death is clear,” she said.Jeong Yeon-soon, leader of the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, contended police were intentionally disregarding existing evidence, including 10 months of medical records.The position taken by police on Baek’s death has also drawn concern from outside the country.Maina Kiai, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, said that the police’s use of the water cannon during the November rally had “unambiguously led to Mr. Baek’s death according to video footage available,” referring to a recording that shows the water cannon being blasted on a collapsed Baek.“The perpetrators should be held accountable and the family of Mr. Baek receive appropriate compensation. In addition, adequate measures must be taken to prevent a similar tragedy from happening in the future,” he added.No police or government official has issued an apology or accepted responsibility for Baek’s death. Kang Sin-myeong, who was the police chief last year, has refused to apologize or comment on the farmer’s death.Rep. Roh Hoe-chan, the floor leader of the minor opposition Justice Party, defined the autopsy as “a plot to cover up the state’s murder” and vowed to work toward designating a special prosecutor to look into Baek’s death. “Baek cannot be touched without his family’s consent. We will fight until the truth is out and those responsible are punished,” he said.By Yoon Min-sik","autopsy warrant on farmer ,farmer who died sunday ,thursday vowed to block ,knocked unconscious by police ,executing an autopsy warrant","['the Seoul Central District Court', 'Baek Nam - gi']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27204904  0.3264665

Kim Ki-jong Kim was also convicted for attacking a jail guard during his incarceration.“Based on the details, motivation, size and the knife used as the weapon, as well as the intensity and repetitiveness of the attack, the original ruling that there was an intent to murder, even if with willful negligence, is justified,” the ruling said.Kim had said he carried out the attack in a show of protest over the bilateral military drills that were being conducted at the time. At the moment of his attack, Kim had shouted “Stop the Korea-US joint military drill.”Kim received 12 years imprisonment in the first ruling and was assigned an additional 1 1/2 years after being convicted for attacking a prison officer. The top court, however, upheld the lower courts’ decision on another charge raised by prosecutors that Kim also violated National Security Law. The law prevents South Korean citizens from contacting North Koreans without state approval or leading activities in support of the communist regime.The courts have said that while Kim’s argument coincides with those made by North Korea, he cannot be seen as having engaged in anti-national activities to help the North.","12 year imprisonment for ,knife during breakfast seminar ,guilty of attacking ambassador ,year imprisonment for kim ,breakfast seminar in seoul","['the Supreme Court', 'Kim Ki - jong', 'US', 'South Korea', 'Kim', 'Mark Lippert', 'Seoul', 'Kim Ki - jong', 'yonhap)kim']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ...  0.13993987 -0.01807094

But police and the prosecutors have denied that being struck by the water cannon caused the elderly farmer’s death. Former police Chief Kang Sin-myeong has denied calls by the opposition and civic groups to apologize for Baek’s death, saying he should do so only after legal responsibility for the incident has been made clear.The parents-in-law of a daughter of the deceased farmer Baek Nam-gi from the Netherlands consoles his bereaved wife at his funeral at Seoul National University Hospital on Tuesday. The Seoul Central District Court turned down the prosecution’s first request Sunday for Baek’s autopsy.The court has demanded the prosecution to state reasons for the autopsy, specifically to clarify if it seeks to find an alternate cause behind Baek’s death.The court was expected to reach a decision on the prosecution’s second request by late Tuesday. National Police Agency chief Lee Cheol-seong said that as Baek’s immediate cause of death was heart failure, an autopsy is needed to find out exactly what caused the farmer’s death. Investigators have said it is possible to conduct the autopsy at Seoul National University Hospital, where Baek’s body is being kept, instead of moving the deceased to the National Forensic Service.The Association for Physicians for Humanism has attributed Baek’s death to a brain hemorrhage and skull fracture from being hit by the water cannon.The bereaved family of Baek and civic groups have opposed the autopsy, saying it is clear that his death was caused by the water cannon.“Inspection by the NFS officials and 10 months of medical records should suffice in determining the cause of death,” said Baek’s daughter at a press conference Tuesday. Woo Seok-gyun of the APH said that acute renal failure, Baek’s immediate cause of death, can be found in patients who have been hospitalized for an extended period of time for traumatic brain hemorrhage. He said an autopsy is unnecessary, as it is clear that the water cannon led to Baek’s death.The opposition parties held a joint press conference Tuesday to oppose the autopsy, saying they may call for special prosecution to investigate the case and find out who should be held accountable for the farmer’s death.By Yoon Min-sik","died after police water ,korean prosecution on tuesday ,sunday after being hospitalized ,cannon knocked him unconscious ,water cannon death again","['south korean', 'Baek Nam - gi']",9,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.33012325  0.49652395

Later, Roh and Choi joined in, taking the girl to a nearby motel to abuse her. The student had been reportedly going to school on one of the drivers’ buses.

The type of weapon used was not specified. The Chinese man entered the country as a tourist under the transit-without-visas program on Wednesday and was scheduled to leave on Thursday, next week.   Police were trying to investigate the motive behind the attack.Chen said, during the police questioning, that he came to have a deep hatred toward women after his first and second wives ran away from home, having extramarital affairs. ""When I saw a woman praying alone at a church, the thoughts of the wives suddenly flashed through my mind and I attacked her out of anger.""He also told the police that he visited the church to repent his sins because it was close to where he spent nights.But police say more investigation is needed to determine exactly what drove him to attack her because he already had the weapon in his bag when he infiltrated the church.They found that the man visited the same church two to three more times after purchasing the weapon in Jeju.Police also said they have secured a CCTV image of the suspect sneaking into the church at about 8:45 a.m. and running out of it three minutes later.Police said they had narrowed their dragnet to Chinese nationals since finding a pair of Chinese-brand shoes and pants at the scene. They also found the weapon used in the crime there.""We're looking into whether the attack was accidental or premeditated because he came to the church carrying a lethal weapon,"" said Park Gi-nam, chief of the Jeju Seobu Police Station.

""The defendant lived 19 years of life that the victim was deprived of but still did not show any attitude of seeking pardon from the victim or the bereaved family,"" the court said. The 36-year-old defendant has been denying the charges and pointed to the Korean-American named Edward Lee, who he was with at the site of the homicide, as the culprit.Though Lee was acknowledged as an accomplice, he cannot be punished due to the prohibition against double jeopardy. A local court found Lee guilty of murder and sentenced him to life in prison in 1998, but he was acquitted by the Supreme Court the following year on a lack of evidence.At the time, the half-Korean Patterson was in Seoul as the dependent of a civilian worker with the US military. He fled the country in 1999.His departure was possible because law enforcement authorities failed to extend his foreign travel ban.Patterson was indicted for murder in December 2011 and was extradited to South Korea in September 2015.","murdering south korean college ,delivering 20 year prison ,tuesday convicted us citizen ,who murdered korean student ,court on tuesday convicted","['US', 'south korean', 'the Seoul High Court', 'Arthur Patterson', 'Cho Joong - pil', 'Burger King']",9,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.16737585  0.15251067

Prosecutors had sought seven years in prison for the 41-year-old woman surnamed Shim. In the first day of trial Friday, the court determined it was “difficult to accept that the defendant had forcefully performed intercourse against the will of the plaintiff.” The court, based on evidence presented, concluded that while the husband had not entirely been willing, the couple’s conversation preceding the intercourse could have sufficiently led Shim to believe she was having consensual sex. Though officially married, the couple had separated and were seeking divorce. The court also said that despite him having been bound, the plaintiff could move the lower half his arm and could have resisted had he so desired. While Shim’s rape charge was nullified, she was found guilty of tying up the plaintiff and confining him for 29 hours in a studio flat in Jongno, Seoul, in May 2015. At the time, she coerced him to give statements on record in her favor, should she need them for their impending divorce suit. Shim was given a probationary sentence with no actual jail time likely to be served, while Shim’s male friend, a 42-year-old surnamed Kim who had helped in binding the plaintiff, was also given a probationary term.

Yoon Seung-mo, who delivered the money to Hong on behalf of Sung, was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for a year.  South Gyeongsang Gov. Hong Joon-pyo The Seoul Central District Court said in the ruling that Hong’s crime is not light considering the governor has seriously damaged public trust, democracy and the rule of law by accepting illegal political funds. “Testimonies of those involved in the case correspond to Sung’s claims. Yoon has given consistent testimonies from the investigation to the court hearing ,” the court said. The court decided not to put Hong behind bars immediately, citing his current status as a governor.The veteran politician was indicted in July last year for violating the Political Fund Act as part of the prosecution’s investigation into a high-profile graft scandal involving President Park Geun-hye’s top aides. The scandal surfaced after Sung took his life in April 2015 with a handwritten note in his pocket. It listed eight names of politicians, including Hong and ex-Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, and the bribe sums he claimed to have handed over. Hong, who has denied all the accusations, expressed discomfort over the verdict. “I want to ask Sung Woan-jong why he framed me after giving money to other people. I feel like I was robbed,” Hong said as he stepped out of the courtroom. “I did not expect such a result at all. The judiciary accepted all the unconvincing claims. I will correct it at a higher court.”Meanwhile, ex-Prime Minister Lee’s case is pending at an appeals court.

The railroad bridge near subway line No. 2 Seongsu Station, where a maintenance employee fell off in accident and died on Saturday. A team of five workers from “3s Engineering,” a subcontracted company for railroad bridge reinforcement construction, were working on removing the supporting fixtures, according to Seoul Metro.The operator said that it is currently examining the exact cause of the accident, adding that there has been no error in operating subway line No. 2 trains.Saturday’s accident came three months after the death of 19-year-old employee Kim of Eunsung PSD, a company that had been subcontracted by Seoul Metro for screen door maintenance. Kim, who was working on his own to repair a malfunctioning door, died after being hit by an incoming subway train at subway line No. 2. Guui Station on May 28.In June, Seoul Metro admitted that it was due to lax safety standards and flawed management system. It vowed to implement preventive measures by operating strengthened safety requirements and supervising systems through surveillance cameras while workers are on the track.According to statistics, about 40 percent of a total number of workers who died from industrial accidents last year were from subcontracted companies. Experts voiced concerns that there should be fundamental measures to guarantee the safety of subcontracted employees, such as imposing penalties for safety violations at construction or installation maintenance sites.“While the current law is not enough to secure the safety of workers from subcontracted companies from industrial accidents, the entire system of the labor environment will not easily improve,” said professor Lee Byung-hun of sociology from Chungang University.“There should be stronger measures by law with regard to penalties for safety violations at certain environments such as construction or maintenance sites,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","subway maintenance worker dies ,subway maintenance worker died ,worker dies during repairs ,weekend while repairing subway ,died in an accident","['Seoul Metro', 'Gwangjin Fire Station']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41191554 -0.11762967

The Seoul Suseo police said that two women who were behind Instagram accounts Gangnam Patch and Hannam Patch had been arrested for online defamation.  The now-defunct account of Gangnam Patch. The 24-year-old Gangnam Patch operator, surnamed Jeong, and the 28-year-old Hannam Patch operator surnamed Yang knew each other through online correspondence but were not personally acquainted.The Gangnam Patch account had gathered some 100 photos of luxuriously clad women since early May and claimed they gave sexual services in return for expensive gifts. The wild reports quickly caught fire as some of the claims included celebrities and sports players. Hannam Patch, with “han” being short for “Hanguk,” or Korea, and “nam” being short for “namja,” man, echoed Gangnam Patch except that it posted about men. The “patch” in the account names is meant to echo Dispatch, a news site in Korea famous for celebrity exposes.The victims’ real names and addresses were hunted down and included in the postings. When Instagram moved to shut down the account, Gangnam Patch came up with 30 other similar but different account names and continued its activities. Victims, who said they were not associated with escort work, complained of psychological stress that rendered daily life impossible. Despite pleas and threats, Jeong and Yang refused to take down the photos, and told the victims to prove them wrong or brace for more exposure.The police said they were able to track down Jeong and Yang with help of Instagram. In the investigation that followed, Jeong reportedly told the police that she began the social media account out of jealousy for a corporate heiress that she often saw from afar in a nightclub in Gangnam.Yang reportedly began to post malicious contents targeting men following a botched plastic surgery performed by a male surgeon. She then started to receive various anonymous reports and spread them over social media. Another 28-year-old, surnamed Kim, was also arrested for taking Instagram photos to another online platform and attempting to extort 2 million won  from a victim.

Under Korean law, the teacher would only serve the prison term if she ran afoul of the law again within two years.  The instructor, 32, was indicted for having sex with the teenager on four counts from Oct. 9-25, 2015. In court, she claimed their sexual relationship was mutual and they were in a romantic relationship. However, the court determined the victim had yet to form a sexual identity and autonomy, and the accused had abused the sexual innocence of the victim to her unilateral sexual satisfaction. The victim admitted to having felt “confused and ashamed” during their intercourse. However, he said he did love the accused, not wishing her to be penalized.The court said it handed down a lenient sentence as the accused had no past criminal record and confessed the crime without holding back details.Apart from the probation, she was also ordered to 120 hours of social service.

Shim, 41, is being tried in Seoul Central District Court for confining her husband for 29 hours in a flat in Jongno-gu, Seoul, in May 2015. She is also accused of duct-taping the victim’s limbs and raping him. The verdict is due Sept. 9.The two were reportedly going through a divorce suit.  The victim was allegedly pressured to speak into a voice recorder that the reason he was seeking divorce was because he had an extramarital affair. It is thought that Shim’s actions were intended to gain an upper ground in their divorce proceedings. The victim was rescued after he managed to call for help by phone.Prosecutors argued that “The accused has not expressed any remorse for her actions nor has she gained pardon from the victim,” and that therefore a stern punishment is unavoidable. Shim is the first woman to be accused of raping her husband. Prosecutors are seeking 3 years in prison for Shim’s accomplice, Kim, 42, who helped in the incarceration of the victim.Shim admits having locked up the victim but denies the rape charges, claiming the sex was by mutual consent. She said in her final statement that, “Although there is much that I personally want to say, I only ask the court to reach a sage decision.” Shim’s legal representative pleaded in her defense that “The couple’s actions before and after the sex shows that there had been consent,” and that “Shim had no intentions to rape.” By Lim Jeong-yeo","rape prosecutors on wednesday ,wife accused of rape ,prison for woman charged ,with raping her husband ,seven years in prison","['Seoul Central District Court', 'Seoul']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27214071 -0.08322087

Autopsy revealed he had died of a nicotine overdose. Sleep-inducing zolpidem was also found in his system.In the following investigations, the police learned that the first action the deceased man’s wife took upon discovery of his abrupt death was calling a funeral hall for procedure details. She did not contact the police or the emergency medical service as is normally expected of people who face the sudden death of a family member. Her actions, according to the police, were “sufficiently suspicious” and that it was “as if she had been waiting for it to happen.”Following her husband’s death, the woman took the late man’s assets worth 1 billion won  and put it in her name. She also tried to collect the death insurance money worth 80 million won , however, the insurance company withheld the settlement based on the allegations of murder against the woman. Four months after the man’s death, the Namyangju police said on Monday they had recently retrieved a closed circuit TV recording of the couple returning home on the fateful day around 7 p.m. Due to work-related reasons the couple only reunited at weekends. On the day which was Friday, they had dined out for the occasion together with the woman’s daughter from her first marriage. Roughly four hours after returning home, at around 11:10 p.m., her husband was found dead in his room. Liquid nicotine In the police interrogation the suspect testified that the man had had beer before retreating to his room and that she found him dead when she went in to the room later to give him his eye drops.The police said she then immediately dialed a funeral hall to make enquiries regarding funeral procedures. The hall advised her to contact the police first, after which she reported the case to the authorities. The autopsy showed the suspect’s testimony that her husband had drunk beer to be false. No alcohol was detected in the deceased’s body. The cause of his death, as determined by the National Forensic Service, was nicotine overdose. The husband was not a smoker, and his work colleagues added questions to his sudden death as the late man was known for his healthy habits. Prosecutors so far have tracked down the case to a man named Hwang, 46, who was intimately acquainted with the woman.  Electronic cigarettes Hwang is accused of purchasing large amounts of liquid nicotine, some of which is thought to have been used in the killing. The woman and Hwang were arrested on Aug. 19 on homicide charges, which both of them deny.They are exercising their right to remain silent to police questions regarding their relationship. As for the nicotine purchase, Hwang is reiterating that he was trying to switch to electronic cigarettes. The police are currently trying to discern how the deceased took the lethal dose of nicotine.By Lim Jeong-yeo","wife charged with murder ,died of nicotine overdose ,found dead on april ,her late husband police ,murder by nicotine overdose","['Namyangju', 'Gyeonggi Province']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47240493 -0.11484787

The agency’s deputy chief Lee has been grilled over his drunk driving history and attempt to hide his identity as a police officer at the time of the accident. He is to succeed retiring NPA chief Kang Sin-myeong, who steps down Monday. Lee Chul-sung, nominee for the National Police Agency chief post, answers questions at the parliamentary hearing on Friday. YonhapAccording to the NPA, Lee was found guilty of violating the Road Traffic Act after driving home under the influence of alcohol and causing an accident in 1993, when he was inspector at the Gangwon Provincial Police Agency. He was fined 1 million won. Lee admitted during a parliamentary hearing that he had failed to disclose his occupation out of shame when he was caught driving under the influence, which supposedly helped him dodge disciplinary action within the police force. The nation’s police chief can be nominated by the president without parliamentary approval and regardless of the results of the Assembly hearing.Kim was pardoned in the general amnesty by the Kim Young-sam administration in 1995, a measure which acquitted those convicted of some 35 crimes including drunk driving.His offense nevertheless led to criticism of his ethical standards during the hearing held by the parliamentary Security and Public Administration Committee, with opposition lawmakers accusing him of being “unfit for the post.” Their protest also targeted Cheong Wa Dae and the scandal-ridden senior presidential secretary Woo Byung-woo for failing to screen out “unqualified officials” such as Lee.Woo, a senior civil affairs aide in charge of selecting candidates for the government’s key posts, has been under investigation as part of a probe into key figures of a high-profile corruption case. He is also suspected of abusing his status to help his son get assigned to a relatively easy military post during his national service.By Ock Hyun-ju","pardoned for drunk driving ,1995 for drunk driving ,for drunk driving police ,driving police said sunday ,his drunk driving history","['the National Police Agency', 'Lee Chul - sung', 'Lee', 'Kang']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22548774  0.16201496

Authorities said there were no legal methods to discover the driver’s condition in advance.There has been constant debate over oversimplified driver’s license rules. The National Police Agency announced in January that it had revised the Road Traffic Act to improve the exams for driver’s licenses. The revised rules will take effect in November.  A driver’s license examination office in southern Seoul. The total cost to register and take mandatory classes for the exam will be raised to around 480,000 won  from the current 400,000 won.More questionnaires will also be added to the written exams and difficult driving courses such as curved roads will be incorporated into the driving course test to enhance the capabilities of novice drivers, according to the NPA. In 2011, the government eased driver’s license rules to allow would-be drivers to save time and money.Since July 2011, citizens here have been able to obtain the license in 4-5 days by taking 13 hours of classes and passing a set of driving tests including driving on the roads. The number of hours for mandatory classes was cut down from 60 hours to 13 hours. Evaluation criteria was also reduced to six from the original 13 items.In contrast, in other countries, it takes at least 2-3 years to obtain a driver’s license.In Australia, drivers receive temporary driver’s license after they pass exams. After two years of authority supervision, drivers can obtain the official license. It takes at least three years in France and two years in Germany and both countries provide drivers with temporary licenses at the beginning.Experts voiced concerns that the revised driver’s license exam still fails to test and prove if a driver is qualified.Instead of making driver’s license exams more difficult, an institutional system to regularly evaluate one’s ability to drive safety should come first, said Kwon Ho-kyeong an associate researcher at Hyundai Motors.“Just like what other developed countries are enforcing with temporary licenses, South Korea should adopt legal methods to regularly test and prove driver’s qualification to drive with safe manners,” Kwon told The Korea Herald.By Kim Da-sol","neurological disorder killed four ,driving tests an accident ,driver license in july ,disorder killed four ,killed four and injured",['Busan'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68503094  0.19326241

Prior to the diagnosis, she had been working at a pediatric unit at the hospital, specifically caring for patients with blood cancers. A total of 86 children who have been treated at the unit, as well as 43 health care workers who spent time with the nurse, are being tested for TB, the KCDC said. So far, 37 of the 43 health care workers have tested negative. Results are still pending for the other six.Last month, a 32-year-old nurse, who was also working at a pediatric unit at the Ewha Womans University Medical Center, was diagnosed with TB through a regular health checkup. She had been working at the hospital’s intensive care unit for newborns. Following her diagnosis, 166 babies and 50 health care workers were tested. Among them, two infants were diagnosed with latent TB -- a condition in which the TB bacteria is in the body but inactive and causing no symptoms. Without treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of latent TB patients are known to develop TB at some point in their lives. South Korea has recently seen a number of TB cases at facilities with a large number of people, such as schools and postpartum centers. Last year, TB cases were reported in 974 schools, 332 military bases and 91 day care centers and postpartum care facilities.To tackle the issue, the Health Ministry announced in March that all Koreans would be required to be tested for latent TB at least twice in their lifetime, at age 15 and 40, starting next year. TB treatments became free for all patients in Korea last month. South Korea currently has the highest incidence rate of TB among nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, partly due to the lack of epidemiological research of the disease since the 1950-53 Korean War. Those who have visited the Samsung Medical Center and would like to get tested for TB can contact the hospital at  3410-2227 or the state-run health center in southern Seoul at  3423-7133.

He had also argued that the government measure violates his right to pursue happiness by constraining his choices in operating his own restaurant.The court said the smoking ban does not violate the cited rights since it does not require the owner to change or remove equipment and facilities of the restaurant. The ban also serves the measure's intended purpose of promoting public health by protecting clients at the restaurant from secondhand smoke, it said.Three other similar cases were previously reviewed by the Constitutional Court, and all of them were rejected.

The farmer, identified as Kim, is suspected of holding the 47-year-old man identified as Goh at his farm in Ochang, North Chungcheong Province, forcing him to work without pay and abusing him.Kim, 68, was questioned by police last week as a witness. He is most likely to face charges of violating laws on welfare for those with disabilities and labor standards, according to the police.The farm that Goh had allegedly been held captive in Ochang, North Chungcheong Province. The alleged victim was discovered by the police on July 1, after he ran away from the shed at night and went into a nearby factory to take shelter from the rain. Police found him when they were responding to the factory’s security alarm going off. The police said Kim had bruises and scars all over his body.He told the police that he had been abused and enslaved by the farmer, and did not want to go back. He was allegedly never paid for years of forced labor, which included clearing cow dung, doing laundry and taking care of the cattle, according to the police investigation. He stayed in a small room near the shed and might have been confined there by his boss, the police added. The farmer first reportedly met Goh through a “broker” who brought the alleged victim to his farm in 1997. Goh, who reportedly has the intellectual ability of a kindergartener, was last seen at a dairy farm in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, where he was working at the time. It remains unclear how he ended up being trafficked into forced labor at Kim’s farm in Ochang as the “broker” was found to have died in a car accident 10 years ago, the police said.During his meeting with the police as a witness last week, Kim reportedly told the authorities that although it is true that he never paid Goh for his work, he never confined him or abused him. He also reportedly told the police, “Not checking the identity of your workers and not paying them was not a problem in the old days. It’s only being considered a problem nowadays.”According to Korea’s Act on Welfare of Persons with Disabilities, abusing a person with disabilities, including not providing basic needs such as food and hygiene, can result in imprisonment of up to five years or a fine up to 30 million won . Also, an employer who fails to provide monthly wages to his full-time workers can face imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to 20 million won, according to Korea’s current Labor Standard Act.In spite of the existing legislations, a number of human rights abuse cases against people with disabilities have been reported in Korea in the last decade. In 2009, it was revealed that a man in his 70s had enslaved a person with intellectual disabilities for 25 years at his farm. The victim, who was in his 60s when first discovered by local TV reporters, was trafficked by the abuser while spending time alone at a mountain in 1985. In 2014, it was revealed that 92 people with intellectual disabilities were trafficked into forced and unpaid labor at salt farms in Shinan, South Jeolla Province. The case was revealed after one of the victims secretly sent a letter to his mother asking for help.  According to the police, Goh’s mother, 77, and older sister, 51, were living in Cheongju, North Chungchong Province, only about 20 minutes away by car from the cattle shed. They had kept his resident registration number on record as they hoped that he was still alive, the police said. They were reunited, and Goh returned to his mother’s home on July 14.By Claire Lee","file charges against farmer ,enslaving disabled man police ,man police said sunday ,farmer to be charged ,police last week","['Kim', 'Goh', 'Ochang', 'North Chungcheong Province', 'Kim']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31785861  0.07861862

The victim...,"A Seoul appeals court on Thursday upheld a lower court’s decision to order disciplinary action against a male sergeant for sexually harassing his female superior in 2014. The sergeant had claimed the decision was unfair and asked the disciplinary order to be revoked. The case is one of the relatively rare sexual harassment cases in Korea in which the victim was harassed by someone of a lower rank at work. The victim, an army captain and one of the sergeant’s superiors at his unit, filed a complaint against him in September 2014.According to court documents, the sergeant would ask her to “hold, or touch, his hand” in front of other soldiers on several occasions. When she told him to stop, he told her, “What’s wrong with a captain shaking hands with a sergeant?”  In the same month, the sergeant had said to his superior, “If you have a fiancee, isn’t it better  at an expensive motel room?” “I felt sexually violated by both his behavior and his remarks about the motel room,” the victim wrote in her complaint against him, which was submitted to the commanding officer of the unit. The sergeant eventually received disciplinary action -- a suspension of three days -- but appealed against the court decision. He claimed he was simply asking for a “handshake” and had no intention of harassing his superior.The appeals court, however, concluded that asking to hold his hand is not behavior that is generally accepted as appropriate in the military, especially from someone of a lower rank to his or her superior. “We also conclude that his remarks on motels had sexual connotations that could make the female feel uncomfortable.”Sexual harassment is largely considered as an abuse of power, rather than an issue involving sex. Yet in South Korea, 21.9 percent of all reported perpetuators of workplace sexual harassment from 2012-2015 were those who were of a lower rank than the victims, according to a study by the Gender Ministry. While 42.9 percent of the attackers were the victims’ superiors, 98 percent of all perpetuators were male, while 73.9 percent of them were in their 40s or older. A 1989 study of 100 female factory workers in the U.S. said that “no matter how many men they encounter in the workplace, women who hold jobs traditionally held by men are far more likely  harassed by men” than women who do “women’s jobs.” As of last year in Korea, female commissioned officers in the South Korean military only accounted for 7 percent of all officers in the country. Also as of last year, women physicians accounted for only 24.7 percent of all doctors here.Lee Mi-jeong, a researcher at the Women’s Development Institute, said the specific case is similar to previously reported cases where female teachers were sexually harassed by their male students, especially those who teach in all-boys schools.“In most cases sexual harassment in the workplace takes a form of power abuse,” she said. “But I think the work culture -- and whether or not women are majority or minority within the group – matters as well. The fact that the female captain was harassed in spite of her higher rank just reflects how male-dominated  the military is as a workplace.” By Claire Lee","sergeant for sexually harassing ,sexually harassing superior seoul ,rare sexual harassment cases ,female superior in 2014 ,harassing his female superior","['Seoul', 'Korea']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.32801539  0.00450632

Jang and the victim had been in a 15-year-long adulterous relationship. The incident took place at Jang’s bar in Dongdaemun, central Seoul, in August 2013.The victim was hospitalized for five days before dying of second-to third-degree burns on 66 percent of his body. Jang appealed the charges brought against her, claiming that although she poured kerosene and thrusted a piece of paper lit with fire toward the victim, she did not actually set the victim on fire. The appeals court upheld the original verdict of 12 years’ imprisonment based on statements the victim had made before his death.

Kim, who had no prior contact with the victim, allegedly said during the police probe that he had decided to commit the crime upon anger toward another woman who had thrown a cigarette butt on his shoes two days prior to the incident.“It is not confirmed whether Kim had despised and discriminated against women based on prejudice or belief,” said an official from the prosecution, adding that the hatred and aggressive attitude Kim had shown in general were a part of symptoms of his mental disorder. Kim has been hospitalized for schizophrenia six times since 2008. But he had not taken medication since he was discharged from hospital in January. He had left home then and lived in public bathrooms and the stairways of buildings. Kim was arrested in May on suspicion of stabbing a woman to death at a public bathroom near Gangnam Station on May 17. He allegedly waited for about 50 minutes, during which six men used and left the toilet, and killed the first woman who entered, according to CCTV footage.The prosecution cited Kim’s experiences of dating a woman, enjoying adult videos and attempting to meet women at adult establishments as the reasons why they had concluded that the murder suspect was not misogynist. Citizens on Sunday hold street campaigns, calling for reinforced safety measures in public toilets, especially for female users. YonhapThe prosecution, however, is likely to face criticism among the public and civic groups who have called the case a hate crime against women and called for safety measures. The murder of the young woman had prompted nationwide mourning as well as debate over gender discrimination in the country.  “Kim made defensive statements after learning that his crime had become socially controversial. He superficially expressed apology, but we did not see him feeling guilty or showing remorse,” the prosecution said, adding that he had remained calm and impassive. Prosecutors requested the court to order Kim to wear an electronic anklet and receive medical treatment in custody. Meanwhile, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office laid out measures to reinforce punishment for heavy crimes against the socially marginalized including children, women, the disabled and the elderly. According to the measures, it will require longer medical treatment for up to 21 years in custody for mentally disturbed criminals who have committed murder or robbery, or those who are prone to commit second crimes. It said it will also detain first-time offenders who commit crimes under the influence of alcohol or against the socially marginalized.

Daejeon High Court said “our society cannot take the atrocious nature of the convict’s crimes more gravely.”  The court found the 36-year-old guilty of abusing and extorting money and valuables worth 76 million won  from four women he concurrently dated between June 2012 and June 2015.One victim, who dated the convict up to February 2014 and was accused of aiding him in his crimes by providing a vehicle, took her own life during the police investigation.Under the probe, the deceased had testified the convict was “frightening and atrocious” and had “deliberately approached her to extract money out of her until she had not a penny left to give him.” At the time of her death she had been paying off debts incurred from a loan she took out for the convict. Another victim, who dated the man between August 2014 and July 2015, was met with a violent response when she asked to end their relationship.The convict threatened to release “revenge porn” and extorted 10 million won from her. He locked up and raped the victim, force-fed her hallucinatory drugs and threatened to sell her into prostitution. The victim managed to escape eventually, whereupon the man then attempted to extort an additional 30 million won from her family.The initial court sentenced the man to 10 years, but the Daejeon court hiked up the final verdict to 17 years. The convict’s information will be available online for 10 years upon his release. He will wear a GPS tracking device for the same period.

According to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, the accused are being charged for hitting and inflicting injuries as well as sexually harassing disabled students at the facility. The NHRCK discovered the gross negligence of human rights after an inspection of the institute since October 2015, following the regional government’s request. As of December 2015, the facility had 68 disabled residents, 75 percent of whom had intellectual disabilities. The rest suffered brain lesions. Thirty-nine people were in charge of looking after them.In another subsidiary facility within the institute, 78 inhabitants, half of them below 18 years old, resided under the care of 47 caregivers. Sixty percent of inhabitants suffered brain lesions, 20 percent were intellectually disabled and the remaining 20 percent had other disabilities. The NHRCK said that in the five years since 2010, 14 disabled students at the institute had been severely abused. Victims were found to have been struck with iron pipes or pointed weapons for reasons such as not following instructions or not sleeping at night. Four victims were found to have been sexually harassed. The NHRCK pressed charges on the accused to prosecutors and advised the regional government to replace the institute’s head, penalize the staff as well as conduct a human rights advisory program within the institute.

According to Gangwon Province Chuncheon Police, the 33-year-old, surnamed Jeong, impulsively committed the murder as he was cleaning up after the baby.  Jeong told police, “I was angry that the feces overflowed out of the diapers on to the floor. And then the baby wouldn’t stop crying after I cleaned him.” He threw the toddler twice, at the wall and wardrobe, after which the baby’s pulse and breathing stopped. Jeong was drunk at the time of his crime, however, police decided he had enough discernment to know his actions could result in life-threatening consequences for the baby. Jeong reportedly attempted CPR, but to no avail. Instead of reporting the case to emergency services or to police, Jeong texted a friend that he “killed the baby.” Jeong was arrested at his home on Saturday around 8 a.m., following the friend’s report to police. The baby’s body had been left neglected for 31 hours.The mother, a 23-year-old whom Jeong had met over a smartphone chatting application, worked mostly at nighttime and did not realize the baby was dead until Jeong informed her a day later. He reportedly told her he was sorry, saying he “made a grave mistake after getting drunk.” The two had lived together for a month. While the woman went out for work, Jeong, who was injured while working odd jobs, stayed home and looked after the child. Although there appears to have been no direct abuse inflicted on the dead child previous to the incident that caused his death, police will further investigate the case to find if there had been any condemnable negligence in the couple‘s rearing of the child. Jeong’s warrant hearing was set to take place Monday.By Lim Jeong-yeo","man kills baby because ,warrant for murder sunday ,murder sunday for man ,arrest warrant for murder ,impulsively committed the murder","['Gangwon Province Chuncheon Police', 'Jeong', 'Yonhap News Youtube']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.19132647  0.08195302

The NEC accused the network of holding a de facto rally under the guise of a press conference the day before the election day, and accused them of conducting illegitimate public polls without making due reports to the required watchdog. The NEC said such actions were in violation of the Public Official Election Act.Police stand in front of the office of the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy in Jongno, Seoul, during a search and seizure operation on Thursday. The watchdog also took issue with the group using an amplifier system on the street and setting up a banner with names of certain candidates written on them, as well as attaching a self-made “anti-campaign registration” in front of their offices.Performing an anti-campaign against a candidate in the form of expressing an individual’s opinion or civic groups releasing names of subjected candidates is legal. But distributing anti-campaign leaflets offline and holding public rallies against candidates are both banned.The police’ White Collar Crime Investigation Police Unit said they will search and seize computer hard disks, documents and other materials, and question relevant officials in their investigation.The 2016 network had selected the top 10 worst candidates running in the parliamentary election for the 20th National Assembly and conducted anti-campaigns against them. The move was also criticized by some for lacking in objectivity as it mainly included candidates of the ruling Saenuri Party. The PSPD said the NEC’s claims are an arbitrary interpretation of their activities and vowed to fight the charges.","election violation charges police ,groups over election violation ,raiding about 10 offices ,police raids civic groups ,over election violation charges","['the National Election Commission', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency', 'the People ’s Solidarity']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25254831 -0.08573178

The suspect, a 45-year-old man surnamed Jeong, had previously been indicted under charges of robbery and murder.The police continued their investigation to discern whether Jeong had also attempted sexual assault, as the victim, a 55-year-old lone female hiker, had been found partly naked.  Jeong initially insisted that he had only been after money, and that he had not realized the victim had died from his strangling. He said he undressed the victim to prevent her from chasing him.However, after further police interrogation involving a lie detector, analysis of his telephone records and an extensive search of the crime scene, Jeong confessed to having attempted sexual assault.  Evidences found in the case investigation are placed on the table. Jeong’s claims that “When the victim stopped moving I ran, pulling her clothes off partly to keep her from chasing me,” and that “The brassiere became unhooked when I was pulling up her top,” all came out false in lie detector test. Jeong’s telephone had a built-up record of obscene material searches. Jeong admitted to approaching to rape and rob her, but that he ran with the money, without completing the sexual assault, once she stopped moving after he strangled and hit her on the head. The police will file additional charges of attempted rape against Jeong.

He said the suspect exchanged gunfire with an officer working at the club around 2 a.m., then went back inside and took hostages. Around 5 a.m., authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages, and the suspect then died in a gunfight with those officers. Mina said police have not determined an exact number of casualties, but that “approximately 20'' people were dead inside the club. FBI spokesman Danny Banks said during a news conference that the mass shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism. He says authorities are looking into whether this was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the shooter was a lone wolf. Police had said previously on Twitter that there was a “controlled explosion'' at the scene of the shooting at Pulse Orlando. Mina said that noise was caused by a device intended to distract the shooter.Mina Justice was outside the club early Sunday trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: “He's coming.'' “The next text said: `He has us, and he's in here with us,''' she said. “That was the last conversation.'' Dozens of police vehicles, including a SWAT team, swarmed the area around the club. At least two police pickup trucks were seen taking what appeared to be shooting victims to the Orlando Regional Medical Center. Pulse Orlando posted on its own Facebook page around 2 a.m.: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.'' Just before 6 a.m., the club posted an update: “As soon as we have any information we will update everyone. Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.'' Police said local, state and federal agencies were investigating. The incident follows the fatal shooting late Friday of 22-year-old singer Christina Grimmie, who was killed after her concert in Orlando by a 27-year-old Florida man who later killed himself. Grimmie was a YouTube sensation and former contestant on “The Voice.'' Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon came into the front of the room. I heard 20, 40, 50 shots,'' Alamo said. “The music stopped.''  Club-goer Rob Rick said it happened around, 2 a.m., just before closing time.  “Everybody was drinking their last sip,'' he said.  He estimated more than 100 people were still inside when he heard shots, got on the ground and crawled toward a DJ booth. A bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and an area in the back where only workers are allowed. People inside were able to then escape through the back of the club. Christopher Hansen said he was in the VIP lounge when he started hearing gunshots. He continued to hear shooting even after he emerged, where police were telling people to back away from the club. He saw injured people being tended to across the street. “I was thinking, are you kidding me? So I just dropped down. I just said please, please, please, I want to make it out,'' he said. “And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood. You hope and pray you don't get shot.''","crowded florida nightclub killing ,nightclub killing approximately 20 ,florida nightclub killing approximately ,club shooting orlando gunman ,20 killed in florida","['Florida', 'SWAT', 'John Mina']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56658089 -0.02534261

Nexson, currently listed on the Japanese stock market, had up to that point tightened its lips on details as to how Jin came to buy its stocks.But according to Nexson, it lent 420 million won to Jin in 2005, and the ex-prosecutor paid back the money in 2006.The case came to light early this year as Jin, who quit in April of this year, reported a whopping increase in his personal wealth last year. All ranking government officials and lawmakers are required to disclose changes in their personal wealth annually.Jin sold all his 801,500 shares of Nexon for about 12.6 billion won  in 2015, which helped jack up his wealth by 3.8 billion won last year from the previous year.With just a 400 million won investment, the ex-prosecutor pocketed some 12 billion won in return in just a decade.Jin has said he bought then-unlisted shares of Nexon in the early 2000s, claiming that the stock purchase was financed with his own money.","money to former prosecutor ,prosecutor for stock purchase ,local online game developer ,money to ex prosecutor ,former prosecutor to buy","['Nexson Corp.', 'Nexson', 'Jin Kyung - joon', 'Nexson']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.22561082  0.18787079

The 57-year-old has been indicted under charges of summoning a 14-year-old to his office and later stroking her face and kissing her on the lips. The student had returned to school during the vacation period for an extracurricular baking class.  Another victim said he had patted female students’ derrieres, touched their backs and sometimes touched the nametags on their chest. Some of the victims’ parents had raised complaints about his inappropriate behavior, however, the principal had denied all accusations. The case was surfaced to the authorities after a student from the school posted an open complaint on social media. According to the Incheon District Court, the principal had claimed that his touching and kissing of students had stemmed from an educator’s love for them. He held the principal position between August 2013 and July 2015.

The suspected killer, identified only by his surname Kim, was not included in the police’s monitoring list of ex-convicts for the past four months, which allegedly allowed him to dodge them and commit the crime. The victim was found dead in the early hours of Sunday, with stab wounds on her neck and stomach near the entrance of the Mount Suraksan trail in northeastern Seoul. In South Korea, the Justice Ministry notifies local police in the district where ex-convicts had lived before serving a prison term, upon their release. Local police then classify the offenders into three groups, trace and monitor them to prevent second crimes. In 2014, 45.3 percent of the crimes that took place in Korea were committed by those who were already convicted of other charges, according to the Institute of Justice. The figure stood at 46.2 percent in 2013 and 45.7 percent in 2012.Kim, 61, who completed serving his 15-year jail term in January on charges of robbery and murder, was supposed to be included on the list of monitoring by Gwanak Police Station as he had lived at an apartment in Sillim-dong, southern Seoul. But police reportedly failed to register him in its database after being unable to confirm his address with the local community center. Police later learned that Kim had moved to Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-Province, but did not inform Danwon Police Station in the city of his relocation. Police admitted to their error but said, “There are no ways  such system as GPS, nor do we have the right to review his communication records.” Lee Yung-hyeock, a police administration professor at Konkuk University, pointed to the absence of a law behind police’ lax monitoring of ex-offenders.  “Police manage ex-criminals in accordance with its internal rules, with no law in place. Without enough legal basis, it is practically difficult for police officers to track offenders every day,” Lee said. The National Police Agency was already slammed for its poor management of ex-convicts last year in light of the murder of a woman at a mall in Asan, South Chungcheong Province, by Kim Il-gon, who had committed 22 crimes. “The society reached a point where it needs to decide between safety and freedom,” said Kwack Dae-kyung, who teaches police administration at Dongkuk University. “The enhanced monitoring of ex-criminals violates human rights, so the government needs to seek a social consensus about the level of safety we need and how much freedom can be sacrificed.”   Kim, meanwhile, was taken to the Seoul Northern District Court, to attend a court’s review of a detention warrant earlier in the day. He did not answer any questions and entered straight into the court building.

The man, surnamed Kim, 61, turned up at the Seoul Nowon police station around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday and claimed he killed the victim. He said he had no connection to the victim.  Following his directions, police retrieved a 15-centimeter bloodied knife from a mound of trash at a residential area in Sanggye-dong, Nowon-gu. The police are currently discerning if the blood on the knife is a match with the victim. The National Forensic Service will return the DNA test results in two to three days. Kim, appearing sober and apparently psychological sound, prompted police to decide his claims were believable. However, apart from the fact that he claims to be the murderer and knew where the weapon was, there is not yet definite evidence that links him to the crime.Police refrained from further revealing Kim’s testimony, as he has yet to be booked as a suspect. A profiler is to be invited to analyze the motivation of the possible crime. Kim had recently been released from prison, having served for robbery and murder.  The victim was found dead in the early hours of Sunday at 5:32 a.m. with stab wounds in her neck and abdomen near the entrance of the Suraksan Mountain trail at the far northeastern tip of Seoul. She had been walking the path by herself.In April, a megalomaniac man stabbed a trekker to death at Eodeungsan Mountain in Gwangju.

The man, identified by his surname Choi, saw an advertisement for “Conditional hook-up, 18 years-old” in a smartphone chatting application, last September. This is a stock image. He contacted and met the girl that same day at a motel in Dongnae-gu, Busan, and paid her 300,000 won  for intercourse. The girl turned out to be 15 years old. The Busan Eastern District Court gave the man a six-month prison term and a rehabilitation program of 40 hours for violation of the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles Against Sexual Abuse. The judge who presided over the case said, “Underage prostitution severely distorts the sexual identity of minors and degrades sex as tradable merchandise.” “As an adult, Choi had the responsibility to protect the young. Sexual abuse experienced during adolescence can cause the memory to influence the next generation. Therefore, a stern punishment is necessary to cut out the demand for underage prostitution.” This ruling was viewed as comparatively harsh, as previous cases of prostitution saw male patrons punished with suspended sentences of fines.

The daughter had reported her father’s abuse to the authorities. According to her testimony, the father first made inappropriate physical contact in the summer of 2009 in the backseat of his car. In autumn of the same year, he forcefully “checked whether she was pregnant.” On another occasion, he made her sit on his lap while he watched pornography.  This is a stock image. The accused denied all charges, claiming his daughter was a pathological liar, however the Incheon district court dismissed his plea as “the victim could specifically describe the time, place and the method of the abuse” and “it was difficult to imagine she conjured the story out of thin air.”One of the victim’s detailed accounts took place in 2012 when she was a middle school student. When she came out to see her father during school recess as he had promised to give her a chocolate pie, she was groped in his car. The accused claimed his daughter was an unstoppable teenage delinquent and that she had made false reports against him because she did not want to stay at home.Regarding the “pregnancy test” he told the court that his daughter had stayed out the night before and that he had been genuinely worried of her possibly having been sexually assaulted. His continued efforts to blame his daughter prompted the court to determine his attitude as unrepentant and shameless, leading to the ruling of the 5-year jail term. The victim grew up without her biological mother, who ran away upon giving birth. She grew up under her grandfather’s care and at an orphanage, before finally moving in with her father when she was in primary school. She has a stepmother to whom she confided about her father’s sexual misdemeanors. The father’s personal information will be made public online during the five years at http://www.sexoffender.go.kr/index.nsc. He will also receive 40 hours of rehabilitation program.

She was 20 at the time, enrolled in her first-year at a university, and it was just a day before her final exam. 　“He started beating me for smoking at home,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “He first slapped me in the face, and I fell on the floor.

She was 20 at the time, enrolled in her first-year at a university, and it was just a day before her final exam. “He started beating me for smoking at home,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “He first slapped me in the face, and I fell on the floor. Then he started violently stomping on my stomach and my head.”The incident severely damaged Kim’s uterus, as her mother did not offer to pay for her required hospital treatment. Just a year earlier, her brother had sexually harassed her at home. “My mother didn’t want my father to know about my injuries,” the 25-year-old said. She has since been told by a doctor that she may not be able to get pregnant as she missed timely treatment.123RFKim is one of some hundreds of Korean women who paid tribute to the 23-year-old woman who was stabbed to death by a man with a history of schizophrenia who said he killed because he hated women.While the police officially announced on Sunday that the case cannot be classified as a hate crime against women, as the suspect suffers from a serious level of mental illness, the case regardless has triggered widespread public debate on gender-based violence and women’s safety here. Many women started sharing their experience of violence online, calling for systemic change against the country’s relatively high tolerance of crimes against women and gender disparity.According to lawmaker Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party, 87.2 percent of all reported victims of violent crimes in the country in 2014 were women, a significant increase from 72.2 percent back in 1995. The nation was also ranked 117 out of 142 countries in gender equality by the World Economic Forum back in 2014, alongside Qatar, Nigeria and Zambia.  “I think patriarchal values still prevails in South Korea,” said Lee Soo-yeon, a researcher from the Korean Women’s Development Institute. “Rather than seeing them as independent beings, women are still viewed as men’s dependents who should be protected by men. This, in turn, makes it difficult when women  try to voice their opinions or ask to be treated as an equal. I think there is a huge clash between the old patriarchal ideology and the changed status of women.”In Kim’s experience, gender disparity was arguably the most rampant at home. Her brother constantly invaded her privacy in the name of a “protector.” He made her report to him on her dating life, what time she returns home every day, and constantly monitored her in case she smoked. When she tried to move out and live by herself as life with her family became unbearable, her father told her “young women who live on their own look too easy ,” and pressured her to stay home instead. Kim eventually managed to move out, but her bother kept texting her – asking her to move back in – until she changed her number recently. “I survived only because I was lucky. Anything could have happened,” she said. “I had to live with an attempted rapist for two years in the same house. It’s all because I was a woman.” Park Hyeon-jin, a 37-year-old woman, said she experienced sexual harassment when she was 17. That day, she was lying down on a bench at a park in the daytime, with her eyes closed. That’s when a man, whom she’d never met before, approached her and touched her breasts. She ran away from the park and managed to escape in a cab.Since that day, Park said she can never lie down on a bench at any park. “I couldn’t tell my mother what happened that day,” she said. “I knew she would’ve said something like, ‘Why on earth did you lie down on a bench like that?’”Being exposed to sexual harassment has been a common thing since she was a girl. When she was in high school, she was asked by a male stranger on the street whether she had ever slept with a man before. Another time, she was almost dragged off to an unknown place by a group of elderly men, who insisted she should drink with them. They only stopped and left when other male pedestrians intervened. “Whenever I tell my male friends about such instances, they would say something like, ‘Why is it that you encounter such situations so frequently?’ looking puzzled,” she said. “When I first heard such responses, I was sort of confused, too, thinking maybe there was something wrong with me.” She said she now realized she was not the only one. “It was because I’m a woman.” Lee Jeong-eun also said she has experienced gender-based violence throughout her life. Her teachers would touch her and her female classmates’ body parts without their consent. At work, male superiors would make jokes about breasts. Cab drivers have cursed at her or made sexually explicit jokes. Ever since she learned of a site that posted secretly taken pictures of women in public spaces, she stopped going to public bathrooms.“It seems like men can endure being ‘belittled’ by their fellow men, but cannot bear being ‘belittled’ by women,” she said. If they considered us as an equal, this wouldn’t have been an issue.”According to a 2013 study by the Gender Ministry, 78.5 percent of the surveyed women said they don’t feel safe taking a cab late at night, as they are worried about possible verbal and physical attacks.Kim said her parents were equally as abusive as her brother after her brother sexually harassed her when she was 19. Instead of filing a complaint to the police, her parents blamed Kim instead. She said what her parents said during those times also traumatized her. Among the things they said include: “Why didn’t you lock the door?” “Why didn’t you wake us up?” “Do you want your brother to be punished?” “Don’t tell others what happened” and “You are such a disgrace to our family.” Her mother, especially, would often tell Kim that violence by men are in fact “worse in other families” and that “all men are the same.” “I think for someone to tell me to understand them is to tell me to die,” she said.Her school teachers were no better. They told her “all men are naturally violent” so she should just try to avoid spending time at home as much as possible. Ahn Sang-soo, another researcher at KWDI, said such victim blaming exists worldwide, but tends to be more prevalent in societies where stereotypes against women prevail. “Victim blaming is based on this desire to believe that horrible things can’t happen to me or those close to me,” he said. “So you make yourself feel better by thinking such violence only happens to a certain group of people, who may have done something to deserve what happened to them. This happens everywhere across the globe, which often silences the victims. In Korea, women are more pressured to behave in certain ways than other countries, and therefore it’s easier to blame those who don’t belong to the ‘normal’ category.”Jang Ji-hee, a date abuse survivor, also experienced victim blaming after ending the abusive relationship. The 23-year-old dated her ex-boyfriend, who is 8 years her senior, for about three months back in 2014. She said he was a well-respected figure in the professional field she still hopes to break into. She had no idea about his violent side before their romantic relationship began. “It started with what I thought were jokes,” she told The Korea Herald. “He said things like, ‘You’re fat,’ ‘You’re ugly,’ ‘Your breasts are too small’ in a joking manner. And then he eventually started screaming and cursing at me. He kept saying I needed plastic surgery.”The abuse culminated in rape, which she could not resist because of fear, Jang said. She wanted to break up with him, but a number of things made her hesitant. “He is an influential figure in this professional field I was interested in, so I was afraid that I may face career disadvantages if I broke up with him,” she said, adding that she also feared he would seriously physically harm her if she ended the relationship.When her story went viral, the comments that were left further mortified her. The posts accused Jang of being a gold digger, and kept questioning why she did not say no. “The experience gave me depression and I still have to take drugs,” she said.

The suspect had testified that he committed the murder out of hatred toward women. The 34-year-old man, only identified by his surname Kim, stabbed the victim -- with whom he had no prior acquaintance -- to death at a public bathroom in the southern district of Seoul on May 17. The case was soon amplified into a social campaign mostly among young Koreans against gender-based violence, with people holding rallies and setting up makeshift tributes for the victim.The man surnamed Kim caught for stabbing a woman to death in Gangnam on May 17 is taken for an arrest warrant hearing at Seocho Police Station on May 19. Rep. Nam In-soon of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea vowed to draft a new legislation that would impose stricter punishment on criminals convicted for crimes against minority sections. “The crime against minorities should be subject to aggravated punishment,” said the feminism activist-turned lawmaker. Progressive Justice Party leader Rep. Sim Sang-jeung said she would seek “comprehensive and specific” measures against the increasing number of hate crimes during the 20th National Assembly. The four-year parliamentary session is scheduled to kick off on May 30. Alongside the stricter punishment, safety measures to prevent random crimes in a public space will be pursued. Rep. Shim Jea-chul of the ruling Saenuri Party pledged to implement a regulation to mandate that public bathrooms for men and women should be separated. “Public bathroom for both sexes are a common place for serious crimes,” said Sim, referring to the fact that the murder took place at a gender-neutral public toilet. By law, unisex public bathrooms can be constructed inside a building that either has a total floor area of 3,000 square meters or was built before Jan. 29, 2004. If the law clears the Assembly, unisex public bathrooms are required to be renovated into those that separate men and women. Unlike advanced democracies such as the United States where hate crime laws are applied to the cases targeting gender and racial minorities, South Korea has yet to implement the measure due to objections from religious groups led by big churches. They claim that the law would create favorable opinion toward homosexuals. Under draft versions of pending bills designed to prevent social discrimination, pastors would also face punishment if they make hate speech against sexual minorities. The vehement pushback by church leaders has torpedoed attempts to pass the bills banning discrimination based on age, gender and sexual orientation. Since the government introduced the bill for the first time in 2007, the religious groups have protested and prevented it from being signed into law. For instance, the “antidiscrimination” bills proposed by liberal lawmakers Rep. Kim Jae-yeon in 2012 and Rep. Kim Han-gil in 2013 drew outrage among the big churches and their supporters. Eventually, they gave up their bid to enact the laws. The same goes for legislative attempts to impose tougher punishment against hate crimes. Minjoo Party Rep. Lee Jong-kul and Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Ahn Hyo-dae proposed bills in 2013 to allow harsher punishment for crimes motivated by prejudice, only to be scrapped in the 19th Assembly. Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities said that they would grant the police authority to immediately hospitalize persons with mental illness who are deemed to pose a danger to the general public. The police officers will be provided with a checklist to objectively evaluate a person’s potential to commit crimes. “If the police spot mentally-ill individuals who are likely to harm people, they can take them to a psychiatric hospital,” chief commissioner of the Korean Police Kang Shin-myung said in a press conference on Monday.By Yeo Jun-suk","gangnam murder spurs calls ,gangnam murder spurs ,crimes following the murder ,murder spurs calls for ,murder of 23 year",['Gangnam'],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40823913  0.27314594

The man entered Korea on a three-month visa in July 2015, with global nongovernmental organization UNESCO’s International Workcamp project. Just before his visa expired, in August 2015, he applied for refugee status based on financial situation and remained in Korea while undergoing screening. After his plea to return to his home country was rejected by the immigration office, the man brutally murdered a 38-year-old man who worked at a computer cafe using spoons and chopsticks that he stuck inside the victim’s mouth. He later damaged the dead victim’s body and took 184,000 won  from his wallet. The murder took place in Yongbong-dong, Buk-gu in the city of Gwangju in March. He stayed at the cafe for another hour and also stole a customer’s cellphone and jacket before running away. He was arrested later in the day in the same neighborhood by police.The police said the man displayed irrational behavior at the time he was held under police custody, such as screaming and vandalizing the jail cell and bulletproof glass door. He was contained with handcuffs and belts. At the courtroom, where he showed a contrasting calmness, the man claimed he had been hallucinating when he committed the crime. However, psychological tests revealed nothing out of the ordinary in the man’s mental state. Computer cafes, or “PC rooms,” are where people can rent computers to play games or surf the Internet with friends. These cafes often boast super-fast Internet connections as well as high-tech facilities and software programs. The man confessed to his crimes but did not clarify why he killed the employee. Prosecutors had sought lifetime imprisonment for the man, but the court handed down 25 years.  Meanwhile, a Korean pastor and his wife who beat the pastor’s daughter to death were respectively sentenced to 20 years and 15 years Friday.By Lim Jeong-yeo","prison friday for murdering ,25 years for murder ,friday for murdering computer ,years in prison friday ,murder 28 year old","['Kenyan', 'Korea']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60237557  0.10951237

The delivered sentences were five and three years higher, respectively, than the prosecution had initially sought. The Incheon district court on Thursday said the 47-year-old pastor and his 40-year-old wife, admitted to their crimes and showed remorse, however, they continued to blame the victim’s alleged theft of church offerings as triggering the crime, casting doubt over the sincerity of their repentance. On March 17, 2015, the couple raised a wooden stick against the victim. They testified to having beaten her for roughly seven hours between 5:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., planting some 50-70 strikes on her palms, the back of her calves and thighs. The stick snapped amid the violent beating. An autopsy carried out by the National Forensic Services determined the victim died of hypovolemic shock. The victim’s body was discovered 11 months after her death in February in a mummified state inside a small room in the pastor’s house, covered by a thin blanket. The couple told the police they believed she would be resurrected with sufficient prayers.

According to the prosecution, Oxy – which was formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea -- had initially used a chemical called Priventol R80 as the main ingredient for Oxy Ssak Ssak until the late ’90s. The inhalation-toxicity test for the chemical proved that it was safe. However, in 2000, the company reportedly decided to change the main ingredient to PHMG after Priventol R80 drew some complaints from customers for producing white substances and for its lack of cleaning power. It was reportedly a raw material wholesaler named CDI that first recommended that Oxy use PHMG. CDI allegedly purchased the ingredient from SK Chemicals and handed them over to Oxy’s subcontractor manufacturing company Hanvit Chemical.Oxy had reportedly asked CDI whether it had data for PHMG’s inhalation-toxicity test. Although PHMH was confirmed to be safe for physical contact, there had been no proof of its inhalation safety then. Despite there being no data available, Oxy allegedly skipped the inhalation-safety test, launching sales of Oxy Ssak Ssak from October 2000, with the use of the phrase “safe for children” in its advertising. The prosecution suspects that former Oxy CEO Shin Hyun-woo had known of such procedures and skipped the safety test to allegedly save money amid efforts to cut cost. The test cost about 300 million won . The total size of the local humidifier disinfectant market amounted to around 1.5 billion won. Former CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser of Korea Shin Hyun-woo appears for questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday. Oxy was also found to have injected at least 10 billion won into product advertisement every year. According to the Financial Supervisory Service’s records, Oxy spent 1.08 billion won and 1.42 billion won in 1999 and 2000, respectively, around the time the company developed and unveiled the product. Oxy continued to sink about 10 billion won every year into advertisement and promotion, according to the data.Meanwhile, the government is also in the hot seat after the environment minister attended a parliamentary meeting on Wednesday.Minister Yoon Seong-kyu said that current regulations are enough to cover financial support for the victims and to ask for accountability from the involved companies. “The special laws for the victims  would require  taxes paid by the citizens. This needs ample public discussion and approval,” Yoon said during the National Assembly’s Environment and Labor Committee. Current regulations for the victims, enacted in 2014, has covered the medical expenses and funeral service costs for victims. This amounts to around 2 billion won a year. The current rule, however, is only applicable for those whose health damages are officially recognized as “Category 1 and 2.” The compensation is currently paid by the government, which is in trial against 13 involved companies for reimbursement.Civic groups and the main opposition parties have called for special regulations to allow financial support including medical expenses and the cost of care for those classified under “Category 3 and 4.”Although those in Category 3 and 4 are known to have symptoms that are relatively lighter, many of them have died or received lung transplants, just like those classified in Category 1 and 2, argued the civic group Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health. “The government’s premise for covering the medical expenses is that it will claim the cost after it exercises the right to indemnity to the companies later. In order to do so, the government must file a lawsuit and win the case,” ACCEH director Lim Heung-kyu told The Korea Herald, calling for the government to step up and guarantee wider financial help.The main opposition party urged the government to publicly offer an apology on Thursday.“ requests the administration to offer a public apology along with profound self-reflection.  demand that President Park Geun-hye express her stance over the case and reprimand the officials involved in the case,” said The Minjoo Party of Korea floor leader Rep.

The father had allegedly spent his wife’s government subsidies on another woman, and did not attend his wife’s funeral in 2009.  The 47-year-old daughter had reported the victim on four occasions for assault, between 2010 and 2011. She had also twice acquired court injunctions to keep him away in 2011.The siblings are being accused of murdering their father at his apartment in Ochi-dong, Gwangju, South Jeolla Province. While the two have expressed evident hatred toward their father, they reverted to exerting their right to remain silent when asked if they had killed their father and about their motives, at the arrest warrant hearing on Thursday at Gwangju district court.Although they have made no direct confessions, the police have decided that the evidence gathered is enough to issue an arrest warrant.  Surveillance camera footage showed the two entering their father’s house on May 6, 7 and 8. The crime took place on the third day, which happened to be Parents’ Day in Korea, as the father finally returned home from a female friend’s place that morning.The victim’s body was discovered at the bottom of a giant rubber basket beneath 10 layers of blanket that had been used to mask the smell. He had been brutally mutilated and crushed with sharp and blunt weapons. The two siblings, who are both unmarried, had planned to move out from the flat where they live together. They had requested that their landlord return them their deposit money and had reserved a date with a moving company. Those who knew the victim said his son had visited him in April to demand for his house deed which is valued at 105 million won . The siblings are jobless. The brother had been studying for the Korean Bar Examination for a long time, while his sister had worked as an evangelist at a church until 2011.

When he told them that the U.N. secretary-general is a South Korean, their reaction was, ""No way.It's not possible. How can a South Korean become a secretary-general of the U.N.? South Korea is supposed to be a puppet country of the United States.""""People are totally cut off from the outside world,"" Bae said.""We need to remember the people like North Koreans were cut off from society.

Cefu is blamed for the loss of 14 lives and 27 victims with health damages.Meanwhile, a Seoul National University professor surnamed Cho, who allegedly received money from Oxy -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 -- in exchange for fabricating a product safety report in 2011, denied the allegations Monday after he was arrested Saturday.According to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, however, another SNU researcher who was involved in the toxicity test testified Monday that Cho ordered to delete the part where it mentions lung damage was detected in a mouse exposed to the humidifier sterilizer during an experiment.In 2011, Oxy had requested SNU to experiment on the disputed humidifier sterilizer and write a product safety report, after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the causality between chemicals contained in humidifier sterilizer and lung damages through an animal test.On Sunday, the father of a deceased victim of Oxy humidifier disinfectant continued his weeklong protest in Denmark with visits to organizations in Europe.Kim Deok-jong, whose 5-year-old son died in 2009 after battling a respiratory disease, staged a protest Sunday in front of KeTox, the manufacturer of the chemical in question, in Denmark. He is demanding the Danish government offers an “official apology over the tragedy involving a Danish company and comprehensive and thorough survey on all biocide products,” according to the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health.Kim is set to file a damage suit against the RB headquarters in England and CEO Rakesh Kapoor.Political parties here also continued to speak out on the burgeoning case.On Monday, the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea’s newly appointed whip Rep. Woo Sang-ho said there was a need to launch a task force to conduct fact-finding on the humidifier sterilizer tragedy and compensation method for victims. But he added that the task force should commence work after the 20th National Assembly starts later this month.“We need to correct the wrongful companies that are indifferent to their consumers and the damages suffered by them, and we will find out whether there was any kind of ‘moral hazard’ among related institutes,” he added.Rep. Kwon Seong-dong of the ruling Saenuri Party’s said Monday that current law can punish companies with compensation for damages, while exemplary damages will be difficult to be applied except for exceptional cases.“Although the statistics tell that up to 530 victims suffered from using toxic humidifier sterilizers, it is more urgent to find out the mechanism between health damage of victims and use of disputed humidifier sterilizer,” Rep. Kwon said. “Laws cannot be altered every time an issue surfaces, but rather an in-depth review should come first,” he added. The Saenuri Party vowed to launch a hearing and possibly their own investigation into the case after holding talks with government officials Sunday.By Kim Da-sol","the prosecution resummoned monday ,hour long prosecution investigation ,ceo resummoned in oxy ,prosecution resummoned monday ,warrant for his arrest","['Shin Hyun - woo', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'Shin']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17820275  0.37600824

His 5-year-old son died in 2009 after battling a respiratory disease.His legal representative will notify Oxy of his intention to file for a compensation claim next week, a preliminary process needed to proceed with a formal suit.Kim Deok-jong, who lost his son after using Oxy Reckitt Benckiser's humidifier sterilizer, stages a protest in front of the British firm's headquarters in Slough, U.K., on Saturday. ""We will lodge a complaint with the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court when the three-week preliminary period ends,"" Kim In-soo, a lawyer of British law firm KG Solicitors, said. If filed, it will be the first civil suit to go on trial in a British court against Oxy Reckitt Benckiser over sales of the toxic humidifier sterilizer.The father said he is also considering handing over the case to British police in consultation with South Korean prosecutors currently investigating it.A criminal suit will be possible after South Korean prosecutors announce its investigation results, which would provide the legal grounds that Oxy headquarters approved sales of the harmful product in the Korean market.""We will be able to  after Korean prosecutors conclude the ongoing investigation into the case,"" the father Kim said.Korean prosecutors have expanded their investigation into the Korean unit, summoning former Korean CEO Shin Hyun-woo and two other senior officials earlier this month.The humidifier disinfectant case, one of the worst scandals involving a consumer product using chemicals, came to light after four pregnant women died of lung problems for unknown reasons in 2011. A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than 100 people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.The focus of the investigation will be on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Last week, the chief of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser's Korean unit made a formal apology and vowed to fully cooperate with South Korean authorities and conduct its own investigation to get to the bottom of the case.","victim father to sue ,father to sue headquarters ,oxy sterilizer victim father ,south korean father who ,father to sue","['south korean', 'Oxy Reckitt Benckiser', 'british', 'Kim Deok - jong', 'british', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'South Korea']",9,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.43157688  0.1088211

The teenager had just been admitted to the hospital’s emergency unit after cutting her wrist in an attempt to end her own life.And it wasn’t the teen’s first attempt. She was reportedly suffering from depression after being constantly bullied by her classmates at school. Her mother also had mental health issues, while her father was physically abusive whenever he was drunk. Her younger brother, too, was in need of attention as he was autistic. “I heard the first time she tried to end her life was when she was an elementary school student,” Lee told The Korea Herald. “She was admitted to our hospital for suicide attempts at least 10 times.”The teenager, however, was able to receive help as South Korea’s Health Ministry started offering special support programs for suicide attempt victims who get admitted to emergency units of hospitals nationwide starting June 2013. YonhapThe service, which consists of mental health and welfare support, was introduced partly in response to the result of a government survey, which showed Koreans who have attempted to take their own lives are 25 times more likely to die of suicide than those who have never attempted it.Suicide has become the most common cause of death among school children in South Korea -- fourth most common cause of all citizens -- with up to 40 children and adults ending their own lives every day.“When you talk to those who have attempted suicide, you learn about all the problems that our society has,” Lee said. “Most of them -- especially teenagers -- have more than one reason. There’s domestic violence, financial difficulties and the lack of support network. All problems are connected to one another.”Ever since the service was launched, some 13,643 Koreans who have attempted suicide were admitted to emergency facilities nationwide. A total of 597 patients died while being treated. Among the survivors, 6,129 agreed to receive help. While 7.5 percent of those who chose not to use the service ended up committing suicide later, the number was lower at 3.7 percent among those who chose to take the program from 2013-2015.The service includes regular phone calls and home-visits from social workers, as well as counseling sessions. Patients will be also referred to different state-run agencies according to their needs. For example, a man who tried to take his own life after learning that he was going to lose his vision due to a rare disease, was introduced to a special support center where he could learn about how to read braille and receive mobility training, on top of psychiatric treatment. Another man, who had been struggling financially, was referred to a social worker at the nearest regional district office, who helped him apply for welfare programs that were available for him. Of all general hospitals in Seoul, Asan Medical Center is the only medical facility that offers hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the medical use of oxygen at an ambient pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, which is often used to treat those who attempt suicide by inhaling coal fumes. “As a result, the largest number of those brought in after attempting suicide are those who ingested coal fumes,” said Kim Min-ju, a social worker who works for suicide attempt cases in the hospital. In 2013, Kim met an 80-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital for drug overdose. He tried to end this life by taking a large number of sleeping pills on the first anniversary of his late wife’s death. After spending many days at the hospital’s critical unit, the man told Kim that he has no desire to live as he no longer has a spouse to live with and his age doesn’t allow him to live an active life. He was also struggling with the relationship with his grown-up children.Kim said most of her patients have dysfunctional relationships with their family members, or don’t speak to them at all. Her observation correlates with last year’s data released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which showed that 28 percent of Koreans felt they have no meaningful social support network at all -- not a single person they can speak to or rely on -- in times of crisis. This was the highest among the OECD countries. Kim offered the man a counseling program in which he was asked to write his autobiography, and talk honestly about his personal history. Both his health condition and relationship with his children improved after the counseling sessions, she said. But not all cases end in positive results, Kim said. “The worst is to see someone die at the hospital after attempting suicide, and see his or her family member taking their own lives shortly thereafter,” she said.According to the Welfare Ministry’s latest data, the largest cause of suicide deaths in Korea is financial difficulties. Among the 121 suicide victims researched for the report, 54.5 percent of them had been unemployed for at least three months before taking their own lives. Also, 73.6 percent were struggling with their job prospects and income. Also, 40 percent of them had been having a hard time paying off their debts while alive. Kim from Asan Medical Center said the largest number of attempted suicide victims who get treated at her hospital tried to take their own lives because of financial problems. “This is where I feel somewhat powerless as a social worker,” she said. “In order for a depression patient who developed the condition because of financial problems to get better, he or she needs to have that problem fixed. But social workers and psychiatrists can’t really help them with that.” By Claire Lee","suicide attempts in 2013 ,bullied by her classmates ,the hospital emergency ,15 year old patient ,after cutting her wrist","['Lee Eun - byeol', 'Mokpo Jung - Ang Hospital', 'Mokpo', 'South Jeolla Province']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.03241384 -0.15202305

From this year, however, the Army, Navy and the Air Force Academies have eased their rules to allow cadets to drink outside the schools, as the policy was criticized for being out-of-date. Drinking on campus and in uniform is still banned. The rule was revised last year and has been in effect since this March. “The decision reflects the public perception toward drinking culture. Cadets would also need to have drinking experience  before becoming an officer and leading his own subordinates,” a military official told reporters on Monday on customary condition of anonymity. The previous regulation prohibits students from drinking alcohol without permission from their superintendents.  The Army Academy`s cadets have conversation with their alumi at the school`s graduating ceremony. YonhapBut the ban on marriage and smoking remains unchanged, said the official. The military has claimed that marriage would conflict with the values of military education and that smoking would compromise the ability to operate delicate military equipment such as jet fighters and submarines.The decision reflected changes in the strict abstinence regulations in military academies for almost 60 years. Critics have called their policies “antiquated” and accused them of violating an individual’s right to pursue happiness. A 25-year-old cadet filed a lawsuit in 2013 against the Army Academy over its decision to expel him for having sex with his girlfriend at his house. The court ruled in favor of the cadet, saying that the school’s decision violates his constitutional right because having a sexual relationship is a personal business. Faced with mounting calls for changes since the ruling, the Army announced in 2014 a plan to review and overhaul, if necessary, the controversial regulation. The Army implemented the policy in 1951 and has never revised it until now.By Yeo Jun-suk","academies end cadets drinking ,military academies were banned ,military academies end cadets ,end cadets drinking bans ,banned from getting married","['South Korea ’s', 'Army', 'Navy', 'the Air Force Academies']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.29116216 -0.12560412

In the final trial held at the Bucheon Branch of Incheon District Court, the prosecution said, “The defendants failed to carry out their due responsibility as parents to look after their child.” “They severely abused the victim and beat her to death, even as they had no proof that she stole from the church offerings as they claim.”The two were demanded prison terms according to the level of abuse they had inflicted on the victim. They had both been indicted in February for brutally beating their then-13-year-old daughter to death. According to the prosecution, the abuse had gone on for seven hours from around 5:30 a.m. to half-past-noon on March 17, 2015. Investigation revealed the girl had been hit up to 70 beatings on palms, calves and thighs, respectively, with a wooden stick that broke during the violent strikes. The National Forensic Service said the autopsy revealed the victim died from hypovolemic shock.Her mummified body had been found by the police during a search through the house on Feb. 3, in a small room covered with a blanket.  The pastor and his wife had testified that they believed the daughter would resurrect if they continued to pray.

The bank ended up tending to the man for an hour as he continuously asked the tellers to recount the money he withdrew.“There is no person in the world that has the right to demand another to smile. ... There is a problem with Huh’s perception that a worker in the service industry must cater to all the customers’ needs,” the ruling said.It is rare for the summary court to order a detention. The ruling came amid increasing reports of cases in which customers wrongfully demand special treatment from service people in South Korea.One prominent case involved a department store in Incheon in October last year. A video went viral showing two customers forcing the store’s workers to kneel down on the floor, demanding better service. A report by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute showed last month that 35.1 percent of 11.98 million workers in the service industry said they were exposed to emotional or sexual violence.","detained for forcing bank ,five days of detention ,visiting bank in seoul ,for forcing bank tellers ,tellers at local bank","['the Seoul Central District Court', 'Seoul']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.05622366 -0.39786655

The men smuggled in 4.5 liters of the drug disguised as hand sanitizer over eight international mail deliveries between August and December 2015. Each 4-milliliter vial was later sold for 350,000 won at nightclubs in Gangnam and on the Internet, raking in 120 million won over five months. The smuggled drug, called “Tear of God” or “TG,” is a synthetic marijuana with the XLR-11 compound to make more potent. It is scentless, tasteless and colorless and can be easily consumed without detection by sprinkling four to five drops on a cigarette. The giddying effect quickly wears off in just 15 minutes, allowing minimum interruption to daily life. Users who bought from the men testified to having smoked the substance at their work places and on the streets without concerns of being caught.As the business grew, the smugglers ambitiously attempted to expand their sales net by hosting a business seminar to attract more accomplices. The event, however, became the key leading police to them. The police raided the apartment of the group’s leader in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, and found the drug encapsulated in eye drop vials ready for sale. Further investigation revealed that these men befriended each other 10 years ago while working at the same English academy. Most of them had received overseas schooling in their youth and had connections in the U.S. They hatched the smuggling scheme after seeing a photo of an American drug trafficker at his grand mansion. Thinking they would get nowhere near as rich as this man with their salary, they decided to emulate the criminal. According to the police, the men sought to maintain the trade for three years, in which time they believed they would save enough money to start a whole new life in the U.S.The police confiscated the remaining 960 milliliters of the drug the men had, along with their illegally made profits. The whereabouts of the rest of the drug was accounted for.“Tear of God” was classified as illegal in 2014, though this was the first time it was found in liquid form. Police said they have requested a joint investigation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to identify and arrest the manufacturer of the drug, who is presumed to be a Korean-American living in California in the U.S. By Lim Jeong-yeo","hallucinogenic drugs worth 400 ,illegally trafficking hallucinogenic drugs ,w400m in drugs smuggled ,drugs worth 400 million ,wednesday the men smuggled","['korean', 'U.S.', 'Seoul', 'Gangnam']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70068181  0.55927014

The death of a person close to him with an intellectual disability in 1979 was a turning point for the Irish priest who flew to Korea on a mission decades ago. Chun Noel Chun came to Seoul as a missionary in 1957 when the country was still suffering the wounds of the 1950-53 Korean War. He was only 24 years old and had just finished his missionary school Columban Fathers. After six months of studying Korean in Seoul, the priest was dispatched to parishes in several cities in South Jeolla Province. While he was in Gwangju, he came cross a public rehabilitation center where 600 people in need lived, including orphans, the disabled and the elderly. Somehow, he said he felt the closest bond with the disabled. “Unlike others, the disabled would only smile, not asking for anything. They were not able to express or fight for what they wanted,” he recalled.It was at this rehabilitation center that he met the 19-year-old girl. He was the only one by her side when she died of pneumonia in 1979. The hospital offered a funeral service on condition of donating the body for research. But Chun refused. “If she had not been treated with respect while she was living, I thought decent treatment was needed at least for the burial.” Chun offered to cover all costs for her funeral service and gravestone, and it was then he decided to dedicate his life to helping the disabled.“I didn’t know anything about the disabled. I needed to study on how I could help them in an effective way,” the priest said. He traveled around different countries to see how they provided services for the disabled. It was during this time the United Nations designated the year 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons.As the global attention turned toward the need to embrace and help those with disabilities, he was able to reach various opportunities to attend workshops abroad and draw the blueprints of his path. “As I went to the seminars, I realized that a sense of guilt was prevalent over the way people have generally treated the disabled. They also shared the need of community-based services for the disabled, rather than the traditional way of isolating them from the nondisabled community,” he said. Soon after returning to Korea in Gwangju, he started a “group home” service -- living with an acquaintance with an intellectual disability and a volunteer. From grocery shopping to working out, all activities were done together just as he would do with ordinary roommates.The aim was simple: to incorporate the disabled into the community so that they could interact naturally with neighbors. It was the first group home in Korea as Koreans then tended to keep the disabled segregated or hidden. “At first, the neighbors were astonished to see the intellectually disabled in their community, as they were not used to seeing them around,” he said. “But more and more, neighbors started to confess to me that they also had a disabled family member at home but never told anyone. They said they had never tried going out with them.”Chun Noel Along with the tenuous start of running the group home service, he established “Rainbow Community” in the same year, which he continues to run to this day.“Each color of the rainbow is unique. When the colors get together, it is beautiful. This is the same as the people. Each person is unique. When people get together, they can make the community more beautiful,” he explained. With his dedication and unyielding efforts, Chun began to see changes, both in the perception and the system.In 1985, Chun was able to receive financial support from his alma mater Columban Fathers and Germany’s largest Catholic welfare organization Caritas Germany. He used the subsidies to purchase land in the southwestern city and establish a welfare facility Emmaus Welfare Center in 1985, where about 100 intellectually disabled currently visit for daily activities. Thanks to the welfare support regulation changes throughout the years, the organization has also become eligible to receive public subsidies for the group home operation since 1989. The government covers about 80 percent of the operation cost, he said. The Rainbow Community gradually expanded its support to running eight sub-organizations from a disabled children center to special workplaces for those with intellectual disability. Depending on the severity of the disability, the disabled are provided with self-support opportunities through the organization that gained its incorporated association status in 1993. They range from working at a factory that produces toilet paper and candles to working at a general factory. More than 200 disabled people are now working at various factories. In the meantime, he also increased the number of group homes to 14, with each residence housing four disabled people. His initiative also inspired other similar operations, leading to about 600 group homes running nationwide. In the recognition of his decades-long contribution to the welfare of the disabled, the Korean government allowed the “special naturalization” of Chun in February this year. The government has permitted special naturalization of foreigners who have made particular contributions to the country since 2012. He was the sixth foreigner granted Korean citizenship so far. Chun said his mission for the disabled never ceases.“I’m thinking of building a nursing home for the old disabled in the Rainbow Community once the average age of the residents here becomes older. The nursing home would be only for those aged 65 or older,” he said. Chun said he has seen visible improvement of the public perception toward the disabled here, although prejudice is still something that imposes the greatest hurdle to the disabled. “Even last week, two disabled folks and I tried to join a community badminton club. Although they had no physical problems, the club members refused to accept them,” he said. “My Emmaus friends do not ask me whether I’m American, Korean or Irish. They do not ask me whether I’m a Buddhist, a Protestant or a Catholic. They have not been contaminated with the pollution of prejudice or bigotry. They ask me only one question; do you love me? Love is the fundamental question we all ask and seek.” By Lee Hyun-jeong","gravestone of disabled girl ,rainbow community the death ,disabled girl deceased ,of disabled girl deceased ,disabled girl deceased at","['irish', 'Chun Noel', 'Chun', 'Rainbow Community']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17194538 -0.09655277

He claimed toes had no relevance to sexual humiliation and that he had only touched them for a split second. He had appealed for a retrial, but the appeals court dismissed his plea and upheld the original court’s decision, saying, “A sexually indecent act, at its core, cannot be separately regarded per body part. Kim’s actions towards a woman he had no acquaintance with was enough to bring disturbance to an average person.” The court said Kim’s confession during the police investigation that he “intentionally went in the cafe to touch the victim after seeing no one else was around” was also proof of his guilt.

However, it appears that he impulsively committed the act under the influence of alcohol.”The man appealed for a retrial, but the appeals court upheld the decision of the original court.

The Seoul Central District Court jailed the 58-year-old, identified only by his surname Oh, on charges of obstruction of government affairs after he ignored a guard’s request to stop the car and rushed the car into Cheong Wa Dae on March 10. Before he attempted to drive into the presidential office, Oh was stopped by the police while shouting and threatening to explode the presidential office in front of the building, the court said. “Oh seems to regret his behavior, but his crime is not light,” the judge said in the ruling. “Given his history and other circumstances, it is likely that he would commit such a crime again.” Oh has been notorious for attempting to break into the presidential office and the building of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on multiple occasions over the past years, according to the court. Oh created a stir earlier this year after revealing that a public official from the Maritime Ministry had suggested he sue the deceased families of those who died in the Sewol ferry sinking on April 16, 2014. Oh claimed that the official had taken issue with the families criticizing President Park Geun-hye.

The taxi was carrying the man from Andong in North Gyeongsang Province to Daegu -- roughly an hour and a half’s ride -- when the man who had gradually become incapable of clear communication failed to give his final desired destination to the driver.  After a number of attempts at getting a proper response from the drunk passenger, the frustrated taxi driver left the intoxicated man on the highway near the tollgate on the southern side of Daegu, at around 3:40 a.m. The drunk passenger, unable to find his way down from the highway, was hit by two cars in succession and died of brain damage. The appeals court tried the taxi driver and determined, “Despite the duty to safely drive a passenger to his destination, the driver left him on a dangerous highway, which resulted in his death.” The court, however, also acknowledged that the “victim appears to have voluntarily left the vehicle prior to reaching his destination. He wandered the highway for over 30 minutes before the accident, showing that he led himself to an adverse location.” By Lim Jeong-yeo","driver sentenced for abandoning ,two years in prison ,cab driver sentenced ,years probation for abandoning ,cab driver sentenced for","['Daegu High Court', 'North Gyeongsang Province', 'Daegu']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46189129 -0.02026839

The man had been given a month’s suspension by his fire station after it was made known that he and his girlfriend had two abortions. The man has been a firefighter for 10 years, and had been common-law married since 2014 with a woman he had met online following his divorce. Court reports say the woman became pregnant four months into their cohabitation, but the man decided they could not raise the child nor continue the relationship. After breaking off the relationship, the woman aborted the baby with money he supplied. The two later reunited, however, and she soon became pregnant for a second time. Once again, she aborted the baby. The woman’s father reported the case to the man’s fire station. The station then suspended him from working for violation of his duty as a public officer to maintain dignity. The firefighter objected to decision, claiming matters regarding his relationship were in the private realm and unrelated to his job. He said the abortion was never coerced, but was done under mutual agreement and acknowledgement that the woman’s state of health made it difficult for the two of them to maintain the marriage or dive into child-rearing. The court took into consideration that the man had successfully fulfilled his duties as a public officer for a considerable duration of time and that the woman did not wish for the man to be penalized. The appeals court ultimately decided a month’s suspension from work went beyond the scope of the fire station, and ruled it unlawful.

According to the court, Kwon threatened his victim with a bayonet, tied him up with cables, beat him and grabbed the victim’s chest, calling them big, on separate occasions between May and July 2014. The original court had deemed the accused could not be blamed fully for his actions, citing the hierarchical and closed nature of the military. However, the appeals court determined that “Kwon’s actions were enough to bring sexual humiliation and disgust to an average person” and “Kwon infringed on the victim’s sexual freedom.” Taking into account that lower ranking soldiers were unable to stand up to superior officers in the Army, and that assailing a sentry with a weapon disrupted military discipline, the appeals court called for the need to apply stern punitive measures.

The pilot has been under the disciplinary committee review since he allegedly refused to fly an airplane back to Seoul from Manila in mid-February after a delayed arrival. He said that it would run against the company's working regulations that prevent more than 12 hours of non-stop work within 24 hours. The company accused the pilot of refusing to fly by ""arbitrarily"" interpreting the regulations, which created an administrative hassle and potentially threatened the safety of passengers. It claims that an extra 2-hour flight is possible under some ""abnormal"" circumstances. Park has claimed that he did not intentionally refuse to work, adding that he arranged for his own replacement to avoid any service disruptions. He reportedly plans to appeal the dismissal decision.This is the latest in a series of clashes between labor and management at Korean Air, which has been mired in protracted labor disputes since they failed to iron out differences on wage and working conditions.Both sides have been at odds over by how much the salary of pilots should be increased, as pilots are currently demanding a 37-percent hike. The company proposed a 1.9-percent increase, which it said is on par with the wage growth rate for other non-pilot workers.Apparently adding fuel to the antipathy towards each other, Korean Air recently reprimanded or suspended 20 pilots for carrying a sticker on their bags that the company saw as disparaging its reputation with groundless rumors. Labor disputes at Korean Air received unwanted public attention recently when Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho posted a comment on a social networking service last month, ridiculing the pilots' claim that they are faced with tight flight schedules and other harsh working conditions. Hanjin Group holds the airline company under its wing.","dismissed pilot for allegedly ,fires pilot for refusing ,the company disciplinary committee ,co has dismissed pilot ,the company disciplinary","['Korean Air Lines Co.', 'Park', 'Tuesda']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.07550601  0.13360508

The case came to public attention after one of the many chauffeurs Lee had hired and replaced stood up to expose his  misdeeds.  Cho Hyun-ah, former Korean Air executive In December, 2014, the case of former Korean Air executive Cho Hyun-ah gained worldwide notoriety, demonstrating the unchallenged supremacy enjoyed by some corporate scions in Korea. Cho had demanded that her flight – which was departing from New York to Incheon and carrying roughly 250 passengers -- return to the gate to evict a flight attendant who had failed to serve her macadamia nuts in the right way. Cho was charged and brought to court in both Korea and New York for verbally degrading the attendant and pushing her in the chest.  Kang Tae-sun, Black Yak's CEO In September, 2013, outdoor clothing brand Black Yak’s CEO Kang Tae-sun hit an airline employee with a newspaper for delaying his boarding.

In December 2015, a sexually suggestive offer was posted to controversial online hook-up site and den of sexual deviancies Sora.net. “Swear at me. I like being talked down to. I’ll sleep with those who send me their naked photos, ‘first-come, first-served.’ If you have any wits you’ll figure out how to reach me,” a post written from an account there read. The woman in this photograph is not related to the contents of this article. A matching account name was easily found on Korea’s most commonly used mobile messenger KakaoTalk. The profile photo for the account showed an attractive woman.Members from Sora.net hurriedly inundated the user with vulgar messages and sent personal sexually explicit photos. They were in for a surprise, however, when the “woman” replied with indignation, “Who is this? I’m reporting you to the police for sexual harassment.”The KakaoTalk user then extorted sizable sums of money from the flustered men in return for not pressing charges. It was only when one of the men reported the user to police for blackmail that the case took a swerve.An investigation uncovered the identity of the KakaoTalk user to be a 25-year-old man using the photograph of an attractive woman to bait his victims.Police said a total of 14 men fell prey to the blackmail scheme, surrendering some 4.6 million won . “Because so many out-of-the-ordinary and perverted things happen on Sora.net, these men failed to take basic precautions to check the identity of who they were talking to,” a representative from the police said, giving caution to other would-be online lotharios.

He took part in a bungled robbery at a Western Union office in which a police officer was injured in the leg.Media reports said he was stationed as a lookout in the attempted theft when police surprised the six assailants.But the picture that emerges from a confused and scared message left on an abandoned computer is a very different image from that of Brussels gangster.""Hunted everywhere ... no longer safe,"" Ibrahim said, according to the federal prosecutor, adding that ""I don't know what to do"".Carjacker to suicide bomberMeanwhile, brother Khalid, 27, who blew himself at the Maalbeek metro station in the heart of the European district in Brussels, is a convicted carjacker, receiving a five-year sentence 2011, according to daily La Derniere Heure.Federal prosecutors revealed at a dramatic briefing on Wednesday that both brothers were Belgian citizens with convictions ""not linked to terrorism.""The pair burst into the public eye on March 15 when police raided an apartment in the Forest district of Brussels, as part of the investigation into the Paris attacks.Belgian media reports said a joint squad of Belgian and French police approached the property because it was rented under a false name used by Khalid to secure a hideout months earlier for the Paris attackers.Belgium filed an Interpol search for Khalid, who is suspected of renting other properties used to prepare the November tragedy in Paris, including one in the southern Belgian city of Charleroi from where ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud set off to spearhead the assault.The police last week fully expected to find an abandoned property, as utilities in the Brussels apartment had been shut off for weeks.Instead they came under heavy gunfire, with one assailant killed and two men fleeing -- including, it is thought, Salah Abdeslam, the top Paris fugitive who would be arrested three days later.The brothers are not believed to have been present but their connection to Islamic State jihadism was established.    'Typical' student    Another possible participant in the Brussels attack is suspected IS jihadist Najim Laachraoui, who could be the man dressed in a light jacket seen in CCTV images at the airport.Moroccan-born Laachraoui is suspected of being the bombmaker for the Paris attacks that killed 130 people.Investigators have found traces of his DNA on explosives used in the Paris bomb and gun assaults, including at the Bataclan rock venue where 80 people died.DNA traces were also found in a rural Belgian hideout used on the eve of the Paris attacks, as well as in a suspected bomb factory in the Schaerbeek district of Brussels.Laachraoui grew up in the multi-cultural Schaerbeek neighbourhood of Brussels and has been wanted by police in connection with the Paris attacks since December 4, though by a false identity that was only unmasked last week.Laachraoui attended Schaerbeek's Sainte-Famille Catholic school for six years where a school official told AFP he was a ""typical"" student.He received his baccalaureat, the equivalent of a high-school diploma, there in 2009.A newsletter posted on the school's website indicated that he studied electronics, but the official would not confirm this.Laachraoui left for Syria in September 2013 in one of the first waves of jihadists to leave Belgium for Syria, where he fought under the Islamic State nom de guerre Abu Idriss, according to media reports.In February, a Belgian court convicted Laachraoui in absentia for his involvement with IS.He is known to have returned to Europe in September when he was checked by police under a false identity in a Mercedes driven by Abdeslam, who now sits behind bars in Belgium.Also in the car was the Algerian Mohamed Belkaid, 35, shot dead during the March 15 search and gun battle in Brussels that eventually led to Abdeslam's capture.","suicide brothers abandoned crime ,brussels hoodlum carjackings robberies ,his computer suicide bomber ,hoodlum carjackings robberies and ,hoodlum carjackings robberies","['Ibrahim El Bakraoui', 'Khalid', 'Brussels', 'Brussels']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67012477  0.21865904

According to the revision, teenage children who are abused by their parents will be able to file a suit against parents to demand the state invalidate their parental authority. Up until now, children have had limited rights in family-related trials, which experts cited as one of the reasons for persistent child abuse cases. Underage children were only able to wage a suit through their legal representatives such as prosecutors and relatives. Ahn being taken in for questioning at the Chungbuk Police Agency on March 22. The procedures will become more child-friendly to allow young victims to be better represented in family-related trials. The act will stipulate the court’s duty to match underage children with counsellors or legal experts who can assist them with the legal procedures. It will become mandatory for the court to listen to children’s testimonies in family-related cases. Since February last year, the Ministry of Justice has run a committee, consisting of judges, lawyers and law professors, to reform the Family Litigation Act, which took effect in 1991. The final review is underway, with its draft to be completed in September. The move comes amid criticism that the act has failed to reflect the shifting social atmosphere. Some parents were found to have exercised their parental rights to abuse children and refuse governmental intervention, citing “family affairs.”A recent survey by the National Child Protection Agency, showed that more than 80 percent of child victims were abused by their parents in 2014. When the children returned home, 87.2 percent of them became subject to child abuse again. Last year, the court issued protection orders for 205 children, but parental rights were halted in only 43 cases. This year, a series of deaths of children at the hands of their parents shocked the nation, the latest being the case involving Ahn Seung-ah. Investigation is underway to find the body of the 4-year-old child killed by her 36-year-old mother, surnamed Han. Han was found dead in an apparent suicide after police began to probe the case. By interrogating the child’s stepfather, identified as Ahn, police found that Han pushed the girl into a bathtub filled with water several times until she lost consciousness in December 2011. Her body was left outside in the corner of a veranda for three days before it was buried on a hill in Cheongju, Chungcheong Province. Ahn was arrested for aiding and abetting the murder, and abandoning the body. Five child abuse cases were uncovered in recent months since the government launched a nationwide inspection in January on children who have been absent from school for a long period of time or not enrolled in school on time. It is also tracking down those who have no record of receiving medical checkups and vaccinations at hospitals.The Education Ministry said last week that it had confirmed the whereabouts of thousands of long-term absentees from schools, but 19 children still remain unaccounted for. Most recently, police opened a probe on Tuesday into a 4-year-old child, surnamed Park. He is believed to have been born in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, and was sent to Gunsan, Jeolla Province 10 days later. His whereabouts have remained unknown since then. The Welfare Ministry said earlier in the day in a meeting with child protection agencies that it would release extensive measures on March 29 to prevent child abuse.By Ock Hyun-ju","abused by their parents ,file suit against parents ,effectively deprive unqualified parents ,revision to family litigation ,deprive unqualified parents",[],9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47531763 -0.2624898

She had three children from her previous marriage and had broken up with the newborn’s father, several months before the delivery. Still, she did not think that her single parenthood would prevent her from receiving the government allowance, which is given to all new parents as part of the efforts to tackle the nation’s low birthrate. When she visited the city hall in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, to apply for the allowance, Han was told that she needed to submit a document to prove that she is in a de-facto relationship with the baby’s father. “It was just absurd,” Han told The Korea Herald. “I was not in a de-facto relationship with the baby’s father. He and I had lost contact. When I explained this, the public servant told me to ‘fake’ a common-law marriage certificate, using a male friend or an acquaintance’s ID number and his legal address. Who on earth would let me use such personal information for a fake document? I couldn’t believe what I was told.” 123RFHan is one of many unwed or divorced single mothers who have been denied government welfare allowance and services which all new parents in Korea are eligible to apply for and guaranteed to benefit from. She eventually received the allowance after a women’s rights group, the Korean Unwed Mothers’ Families Association, spoke to the city government on her behalf. “The government has been saying that it is serious about raising the low birth rate,” said Kim Eun-hee, head of the KUMFA in Daegu. “But single mothers are being excluded from its policies and welfare programs. About 90 percent of the single mothers  are in a situation where the father of the baby does not acknowledge the child as his. Why can’t single mothers benefit from the services without submitting any information about the baby’s father?”The specific allowance, officially named the “Fertility Encouragement Allowance,” is given by each municipal government nationwide without the Welfare Ministry’s guidance and funding. The amount differs according to each regional government and it can be up to 20 million won . Parents are eligible to receive larger allowances for their third or fourth child.  Yangpyeong doles out the largest allowance at 20 million for the sixth child.Yet Kim has spoken to single mothers who were denied from receiving the allowance in Daegu, Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province and the Jung-gu district of Seoul. They were all asked to provide information on the baby’s biological father’s income level as well as their resident registration number.Kim has also met unwed single mothers who were told they are unable to apply for the government service in which a certified-personal care worker visits a mother’s home during the first 10 days after delivery. The care worker helps the mother with breastfeeding as well as caring for the newborn. This service is jointly funded and provided by the Health Ministry and municipal governments. It is mainly offered to those who make less than half of the average national income. The unwed mothers were told that they need to provide information on the baby’s biological father’s income in order to find out whether they are eligible for the service or not, while some were simply told that they were not eligible because they were unwed, single women.Jeon Ha-eun , an unwed, single woman who is scheduled to give birth without the baby’s father next month, said her experience at the public health center in Daegu while applying for the postpartum service had disheartened her.“I was simply told that without a husband one cannot apply for this service at first. And then I was told I need to submit the latest medical insurance premium receipt of the baby’s father so the city government can review his income status,” Jeon told The Korea Herald. “ I was told babies can’t be made alone and that he must be out there somewhere.”Kim from KUMFA said many city governments have an ordinance that states that in order to receive parental social benefits, both the mother and the father of the baby must submit documents that show their income status. “It does not say ‘do not give the allowance to unwed, single mothers,’ but it does not have any guidelines on what to do when a single parent does not have information on the other parent’s income,” she said. “We are asking the National Assembly to introduce a legislation that guarantees all single mothers their rights to parental social benefits.”Choi Jong-hee, the head of the Social Welfare Policy Division of the Welfare Ministry, said the central government’s policies do not require single mothers to submit any information about the child’s biological father when applying for social benefits. “Single mothers are considered as those with special needs, so in some cases, they are eligible for certain services even without providing information on their own income status,” she said. Choi said the ministry would inquire about the current policies of municipal governments for single mothers and welfare policies. A public official who oversees welfare programs for new mothers in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, said they have decided to give Han the full allowance after speaking to a number of legal and welfare experts. “Han was the first single woman who applied for this particular allowance in our region,” said an official, who refused to be named, to The Korea Herald. “So we weren’t sure what to do at first but we’ve done everything we can to assist Han.”Yet Han said she still had to give her child’s biological father’s resident registration number in order to receive the allowance, although she was exempt from submitting any formal documents about him. “I still don’t understand,” she said. “I was just lucky that I had his registration number written down . But a lot of women don’t memorize such information. The city government said it was just for record purposes.

Wonju Police said that the 59-year-old doctor surnamed Noh was found at his home in Gwangwon Province. He was pronounced dead after he was moved to a nearby hospital. No suicide note was found, they said. The doctor, who ran an orthopedic clinic, was under investigation on suspicion of reusing syringes for platelet-rich plasma injections and infecting hundreds of patients with hepatitis C.The Welfare Ministry is currently conducting a virus test for the outpatients who had received injections from the clinic. As of late last month, a total of 217 patients were found to have contracted the virus. The number of infection may well be much larger, as only 10 percent of some 15,400 patients who had been treated with injections at the clinic since its opening in September 2004 have been tested, the health authorities said. Investigators had banned the doctor from leaving the country and expanded the probe to about 30 clinic nurses. Noh was summoned to appear for a second time soon. The investigation was launched after patients reported contracting hepatitis C after having the platelet-rich plasma injections injections in April last year. A month later, he closed his clinic and opened a new one in another area, while denying the allegations.Meanwhile, two other clinics are also under investigation for reusing syringes. More than 60 outpatients at a Seoul clinic were found to have been infected with hepatitis C from injections. Another clinic in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, was also confirmed to have had one infected patient. Virus testing is still underway for patients of both clinics, they added.

Goseong police said a 42-year-old woman surnamed Park was sent to the prosecutor’s office on charges of child abuse, accidental homicide and abandonment of a corpse.She is suspected of tying her daughter to a chair and hitting her with a stick for damaging home furniture in October 2011. Park left the child tied up overnight, which led to her death. Prior to that, she also allegedly provided only one meal a day for a fortnight, the police said. Investigators are considered adding murder charges, but have not yet made a decision due to the arrest time constraint. The charges will be determined during the prosecutorial probe, officials said.Three accomplices who allegedly helped bury Park’s daughter in a mountain in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, have also been arrested. One of the accomplices, surnamed Lee, who was her landlady, was also charged with accidental homicide as she had purportedly pressured Park to abuse the child for “disciplinary purposes.”Park and her accomplices lived together from January 2009 along with their respective children after she fled her previous home over domestic troubles. The investigators found Park following a nationwide search into the whereabouts of students who had been reported absent from school for a long time, or those who were never admitted to school. The move came as part of the government’s efforts to curb child abuse amid growing public concerns over a recent series of high-profile crimes.  Choi Chang-weol, the criminal investigation chief at Goseong Police Station, briefs the public on the “homicidal mother” case Friday. The police questioned Park as they found that her second daughter, now 9 years old, was never registered to school, while the first child was missing, but never reported. Park initially claimed that she lost her daughter at a playground in 2009.

The National Election Committee said that of the 1,448 candidates registered to run in the upcoming race, roughly 37 percent of political aspirants were found to have a total of 973 criminal counts on their prior records. The number was based on the agency’s data as of Tuesday. While most of the convicted candidates were punished for driving under the influence, some left-leaning candidates were found guilty in violation of laws prohibiting illegal protests and rallies. A candidate running from a constituency in Seoul was sentenced to three years for attempted murder.  Ruling Saenuri Party officials Tuesday receive applications from preliminary candidates seeking nominations to run in the April 13 general elections. Though first-time offenders constituted a majority of the group, one candidate was convicted of 10 counts, including violations of traffic rules, environmental regulations and the antidemonstration law. Compared to the previous 2012 election, the upcoming one saw a roughly 17 percent increase in candidates with convictions. Observers attributed the increase to a new law that mandates candidates list even minor offenses. The election law revised in 2014 stipulates that those fined more than 1 million won  file with authorities. Beforehand, candidates were only required to submit offenses involving imprisonment and more serious penalties.The ratio of the convicted candidates to the general prospective candidates varied across party lines. While the Saenuri Party had 32 percent of its candidates with a criminal record, The Minjoo Party of Korea, the People’s Party, Justice Party and other minor parties claimed 46, 33, 63 and 67 percent, respectively.

Reinhold Hanning maintains that he served in a part of the Auschwitz camp complex where no gassings were taking place.

Reinhold Hanning maintains that he served in a part of the Auschwitz camp complex where no gassings were taking place. Prosecutors argue that all guards helped the camp function, and that during the so-called ""Hungarian action"" in 1944 -- when hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were shipped to the camp -- almost all were called upon to help deal with the vast numbers of people arriving at the killing complex in Nazi-occupied Poland.The trial in Detmold was moved to the city's chamber of industry and commerce to accommodate the large number of observers and reporters. There was also a heavy police presence in the city.Leon Schwarzbaum, a 94-year-old Auschwitz survivor from Berlin, was scheduled to testify Thursday, the opening day of the trial. It is unclear whether Hanning will first make a statement.Schwarzbaum, who was taken to the camp in 1943, told The Associated Press ahead of the trial that even though higher-ranking Nazis had escaped punishment in the decades after the war, going ahead with Hanning's prosecution was the right thing to do.""I think the people responsible for helping make the whole apparatus function, even if they were a tiny gear in the machine, should be convicted,"" he said.The trial for Hanning, a retiree from a town near the western city of Detmold, is one of the latest that follow a precedent set in 2011, when former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk became the first person to be convicted in Germany solely for serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of involvement in a specific killing.Hanning's attorney, Johannes Salmen, says that his client acknowledges serving at the Auschwitz I part of the camp complex in Nazi-occupied Poland, but denies serving at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau section, where most of the 1.1 million victims were killed.Prosecutor Andreas Brendel told the AP, however, that guards in the main camp were also used as on-call guards to augment those in Birkenau when trainloads of Jews were brought in.""We believe that these auxiliaries were used in particular during the so-called Hungarian action in support of Birkenau,"" he said.","old former auschwitz guard ,trial in germany detmold ,former auschwitz guard ,year old former auschwitz ,murder in western germany","['DETMOLD', 'Germany', 'AP', 'Auschwitz', 'Germany', 'hungarian', 'Auschwitz']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.47617179  0.54400015

He fled the country in 1999 after he was pardoned and released on charges of destruction of evidence and weapon possession.His departure was possible because law enforcement authorities failed to extend his foreign travel ban.Legal sources say the appeals trial will mainly cover the legitimacy of evidence that was accepted by the justice department and possible errors in applying legal principles. Patterson was indicted for murder in December 2011 and was extradited to South Korea in September 2015.","murdering korean student appeals ,convicted of murdering korean ,last week for murdering ,murdering south korean student ,of murdering korean student","['U.S.', 'south korean', 'Arthur Patterson', 'Cho Joong - pil', 'Burger King', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul High Court']",9,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.00637038 0.00526703 0.12385143],KH디지털2,Social affairs,2,2016,"week for murdering south korean ,last week for murdering south ,term last week for murdering ,convicted of stabbing then college ,for murdering south korean student","['U.S.', 'south korean', 'Arthur Patterson', 'Cho Joong - pil', 'Burger King', 'Seoul', 'the Seoul High Court', 'the Seoul Central District Court', 'korean - American', 'Edward Lee', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'the Supreme Court', 'Patterson', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'South Korea']",3,[0.         0.         1.         ... 0.00637038 0.00526703 0.12385143]

The Seoul Central District Court found Arthur John Patterson, 37, guilty of stabbing Cho Joong-pil, 22, to death in 1997 at a Burger King outlet in Itaewon, a multicultural district frequented by expats. Arthur Patterson The court recognized Edward Lee, 37, as an accomplice for the murder, but did not convict him according to Korea’s double jeopardy rule. The rule prevents a defendant from standing trial over the same charge for a second time, barring appeals, even if new evidence comes to light.“Lee’s testimonies that he saw Patterson stabbing the victim are more credible,” the judge said in the ruling. “Lee incited Patterson to murder the victim and led the way into the bathroom.” Patterson said that he would appeal the verdict.In what many viewed as a botched investigation in 1998, Prosecutors indicted Lee, who was then 17 years old, for murdering Cho. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was later cleared of the charge for lack of evidence. At the time, Patterson, who was also 17 years old, was indicted on lesser charges, including elimination of evidence and possession of a dangerous weapon. He received an 18-month jail term, but was soon freed in an annual amnesty. As prosecutors failed to renew his travel ban, he returned to the U.S. in 1999. The victim, Patterson and Lee were the only three people who were present at the crime scene. But neither Patterson nor Lee were legally held accountable for the murder, leaving the case unresolved for almost two decades. The prosecution opened a fresh investigation into the murder in 2009. This time, prosecutors charged Patterson as the prime suspect of the murder. The U.S. citizen was arrested in Los Angeles in 2011 and was extradited to Korea on Sept. 23 to face a trial on charges of killing Cho, who was found dead on the restroom floor with several wounds to his neck and chest. Cho died on the way to a hospital. During the four-month trial, Patterson insisted on his innocence, accusing Lee of killing Cho. Lee, who appeared at the court as a witness this time in the reopened trial, testified that he clearly saw Patterson turn to Cho to stab him. Earlier in the month, the prosecution sought 20 years in jail for Patterson ― the maximum term for the suspects aged 18 or younger at the time of the murder ― in the final hearing, citing the brutality of the crime and his lack of remorse.

He was allegedly strangled and threatened with a tear gas gun. Training is held to sustain a case of commotion at Cheongju Detention Center as part of the regular nationwide safety drill in August last year. Yonhap“They swore at me and said I should go back home. They then pushed me down the stairs and aimed a gun at me, asking me whether I wanted to be killed,” Komil said. “I sustained bruises and scars on my neck and arms.”The immigration officers have denied the charges, according to police. The Justice Ministry said it also doubted the victim’s testimonies, but said it would take measures in accordance with the result of police investigation. Allegations of physical and verbal abuses at detention centers and during deportation process have been made in the past by former and current detainees.“Guards beat detainees, but not very often. However, it is really common for guards to use abusive language toward the detainees,” said a former Pakistani detainee, wishing to remain anonymous. “Detainees are isolated in a separate room, and then verbally and physically abused there when we disobey the guards,” he said, looking back on his nearly two-year experience at Hwasong Detention Center. “We called the room a torture cell.” In 2014, the Human Rights Commission imposed recommendations on the detention center after it found out that a foreign detainee suffered several fractures to his body due repeated assaults by three guards. In South Korea, there are three detention centers, in Hwaseong, Cheongju and Yeosu, for holding foreign nationals who are found to have illegally resided in the country or committed other crimes. They are temporarily taken into custody there until they are deported.As of July last year, the estimated number of illegal migrants had reached 213,565, according to the Justice Ministry, marking a 27 percent increase from 167,780 in 2011. Police have talked of the difficulty in keeping track of those who often enter the country legally, but turn into illegal residents after their visas expire.  The detention facilities have often been accused of inhumane treatment and living conditions. YonhapAccording to a report by the Korean Bar Association based on on-site inspections conducted in 2014, some 16 detainees were locked in one room with one toilet and iron bars on windows. They are only allowed to go outside the building twice a week for 20 minutes each, when guards search their cells. On average, 1,300 won  is spent on a meal for them, which is composed of a bowl of rice and soup with two side dishes.While the facilities were originally designed to hold foreign nationals for a short term, most of the detainees end up staying there for a longer period. In Hwaseong, 26 detainees spent an average of 314 days from January 2010 to August 2013. Some 12 detainees in Cheongju were held for 140 days while five in Yeosu were detained for 267 days during the same period. In terms of medical services for the detainees, the detention centers are equipped with in-house medical facilities, two doctors and one nurse, with medical checkups twice a week. According to the Justice Ministry, the center held 101 medical checkups and treated patients 4,810 times in 2015 alone. But activists claimed that even those in need of special medical care are forced to live on the insufficient medicine and treatment offered by the in-house doctors. “It is extremely difficult for detainees to receive proper medical treatment inside, and the immigration officers are reluctant to grant them a permit to go to hospitals outside the facilities,” human rights lawyer Go Ji-woon told The Korea Herald. “They cite a lack of budget and staff members to monitor and guard the detainees outside the facilities.”“The in-house doctors and guards tend to assume that detainees are pretending to be severely ill only to be allowed to get out of the facilities,” said Go, who represented more than 10 migrant workers detained at the Cheongju facilities. “But many of them are really ill after months of stay at the center.” “The problem is that there are no clear guidelines to prevent human rights violations from taking place inside the facilities.”Enraged by the alleged violence against foreign detainee Komil, six migrant workers’ rights groups based in Cheongju, Chungcheong Province, held a press conference on Jan. 7 calling for a thorough police probe and measures to prevent recurrences of abuses inside the detention centers. “The details of the abuse case should be clarified and the government should punish those responsible for the wrongdoing,” the groups said in a statement. “We demand a formal apology for the victim and human rights education for all the staff members at the facilities.” Lee Kyung, an activist for Human Rights Center for Migrant Workers, raised speculation over the Justice Ministry’s sudden action to deport one of the witnesses. “I suspect that the Justice Ministry hastily deported the Chinese witness to erase evidence.”“Most of the detained might have been caught illegally staying in the country, but they are not criminals. They came to Korea to earn money and contribute to the nation's economy,” he said. “Their basic human rights should also be protected.” By Ock Hyun-ju","assaulted by three detention ,jan three immigration officers ,three detention center guards ,assaulting foreign detainee at ,three immigration officers","['Cheongju Detention Center', 'Korea', 'Uzbek']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09378899 -0.05890404

The Seoul Central District Court convicted Kim Yang, former head of the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, of lobbying senior military officers to pick the Anglo-Italian AW159 Wildcat as the country’s new multimission maritime helicopter, while receiving some 1.4 billion won  from the helicopter manufacturer from 2011 to 2014. The court ordered Kim to forfeit 1.38 billion won. The 63-year-old was hired at AgustaWestland, the multinational helicopter design and manufacturing company in 2011, right after South Korea decided to purchase 20 helicopters to boost antisubmarine capabilities, prosecutors said.“The contract Kim had with the defense firm included peddling influence to decision-makers so that the purchase decision would be made in a way favorable to the firm,” the court said.The Anglo-Italian AW159 Wildcat was selected as the Navy’s new helicopter in 2013.Kim claimed that the money received was legitimate wages according to his contract as the company’s adviser. The indictment was part of the prosecution’s investigation into widespread corruption in the defense industry. A special investigation team ― composed of government, military and prosecution officials ― has cracked down on corruption in the defense industry after a series of shady deals came to light over the last year. Kim is the grandson of Kim Koo, a famous freedom fighter during Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea who was assassinated by an ultra-right-wing military officer in 1949.","for bribery former veterans ,jail term for bribery ,bribery former veterans minister ,year prison sentence monday ,four year prison sentence","['the Seoul Central District Court', 'Kim Yang', 'the Ministry of Patriots', 'Veterans Affairs', 'anglo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17826338 -0.16646875

He was the gold medalist in the men's 77kg class at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He suffered a dislocated elbow in his title defense in London in 2012, but he was back by the following year. Though he hasn't been nearly as effective after moving up a weight class in 2014, Sa has remained one of the biggest names in South Korean weightlifting and was seeking a chance at redemption at this year's Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.Earlier Monday, Chuncheon police said they had interrogated Sa for about two hours Sunday evening over assault allegations.Hwang, 21, has been hospitalized with an injury to his cheekbone. He has alleged that Sa hit him during their night out together at a Chuncheon bar around 11 p.m. on Dec. 31, and that he will require up to six weeks to heal.According to police, Sa testified that he met Hwang to clear up some misunderstanding over an incident last February, in which Sa slapped the younger lifter in the face, and that he became outraged while talking with Hwang and ""accidentally"" hit him.In response to Sa's claims, Hwang said Sa didn't show any intention to clear the air between them. According to Hwang, Sa was angry that Hwang had been telling others about their February incident and told the younger lifter that he was being ungrateful for what senior teammates had done for him.Hwang also said others present at the bar on New Year's Eve invited him without Sa's knowledge.Sa visited Hwang in the hospital each of the past three days to apologize, but Hwang and his family have questioned Sa's sincerity and have not agreed to settle with him.The Chuncheon police will further question Sa to decide whether they will file for a warrant to arrest him.Hwang also appears unlikely to compete in Rio as he will miss substantial training time with his injury. He won the silver medal at the 2014 junior world championships in the men's over-105kg division, the heaviest class. The prospect appeared to have stalled in 2015, and the national team officials have said he remains a work in progress who could reach his prime by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.An official at the KWF said it had initially planned to finalize the national team this week and open a training camp next Monday, but Sa's assault case has forced the federation to postpone its training schedule.","olympic weightlifting champion questioned ,monday over assault charges ,assault charges former olympic ,ex olympic weightlifting champion ,charges former olympic weightlifting","['Sa Jae - hyouk', 'the Korea Weightlifting Federation', 'Chuncheon', 'Gangwon Province', 'Hwang Woo']",9,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.23628077  0.19917656
