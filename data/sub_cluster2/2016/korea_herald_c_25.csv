Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Friday for rooting out the practice of spreading unfounded accusations in the name of vetting, flatly rejecting allegations that he took money from a South Korean businessman about a decade ago.Ban, who has recently declared his desire to run for president of his home country, made the remark to South Korean reporters after issuing a New Year's message at the U.N. headquarters on his last day as U.N. chief. ""I think we have to root out such people who enjoy seeing other people suffering and try to win their own political gains by spreading these rumors,"" Ban said. ""We have to make sure to root out the practice of spreading mysterious allegations in the name of vetting.""Ban spoke in response to a question about allegations raised by a South Korean magazine that he received about US$230,000 from Park Yeon-cha, a scandal-ridden local businessman, on two occasions: in 2005 and 2007. Ban's office strongly rejected the report as ""completely false and groundless."" Park also dismissed the report as ""nonsense."" A former senior prosecutor, who investigated Park over a bribery scandal, also said he hadn't heard of the allegations.Ban said he was dumbfounded by the allegations, which he denounced as ""absurd and not worth a single thought.""""We should bring an end to the ill practice of seeking one's political gains through slandering,"" he said.Ban said he does not intend to evade vetting, ""I agree on the need for vetting. I'm not going to evade it. I will abide by the process,"" he said. ""We should conduct vetting when electing a leader regardless of whether it's about morality, qualifications or policy. That's what I hope for.""But he stressed that he has been thoroughly vetted through 46 years of public service. ""I've gone through all vetting processes except a National Assembly hearing,"" he said. ""The U.N. secretary-general is a post that 7 billion people around the world are watching.""Ban said he became upset and saddened to see the unfounded allegations against him, and emphasized again that unfounded allegations should not be spread in the name of vetting.""If we continue to do that, we cannot get out of political backwardness,"" he said.    Ban also said he has seen such malicious political manipulations ahead of presidential elections in the past.""At that time, I wondered how painful it would be, but now I am feeling that. My family is feeling that. My wife and son are all feeling that,"" he said. ""I have no speck of shame in conscience.""Ban also said everything must be revealed clearly about the allegations against him.Criticizing anonymous sources cited in the magazine report, Ban said he hopes such people would come forward with what they consider evidence.

The unruly man also spat at a Korean Air aircraft mechanic who happened to be aboard the flight and tried to restrain him.Other passengers, including American pop singer Richard Marx, helped overpower the unruly passenger, who is known to have consumed 2 1/2 shots of liquor and got drunk during the flight. He is the son of the chairman of a Seoul-based trading company.Photographs of the violence were posted by the 53-year-old singer and his wife, Daisy Fuentes, on the photo and video sharing website Instagram.Under related laws, Lim could face up to five years in prison for his acts that put airplane navigation in jeopardy.","man thursday on charges ,flight violence police arrested ,police arrested south korean ,south korean man thursday ,violence police arrested south","['south korean', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Lim Beom - joon']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.1690262   0.24352805

According to the Defense Agency for Technology and Quality, a recent simulation by the Pentagon showed that a full-blown cyberattack by Pyongyang has the capacity to “paralyze” the control center for the USPACOM while inflicting damage upon the power grid in US mainland.The USPACOM, one of six geographic combatant commands of the US military, is supported by four component commands: the US Pacific Fleet, US Pacific Air Forces, US Army Pacific and US Marine Forces, Pacific. The DATQ report said Pyongyang’s cyberattack capabilities have gained a reputation among experts, following its 2013 mass attack that hit three major South Korean banks, their affiliates, three TV broadcasters, and infected some 48,000 computers with malicious codes. The attack was estimated to have caused some 900 billion won  of damage.The hermit kingdom was also pinpointed by the US authorities as the culprit behind the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Earlier in the month, it was revealed that the South Korean military’s intranet was breached by what appeared to be acts by North Korean hackers. This resulted in an unspecified number of military secrets being leaked. North Korea has been making strides in its cyberattack capacity, with the South Korean Ministry of National Defense estimating the North has around 6,800 specialists on cyber terrorism. Some experts believe the actual number might range from 10,000 to 30,000 Local cyber expert Lim Jong-in, a professor at the graduate school of information security at Korea University, said cyber terrorism appeals to poorer countries like North Korea, as it can be done on a relatively small budget but still has a large impact. However, the South Korean military-run cyber command consists only of around 600 personnel, raising concerns over the country’s vulnerability toward cyberattacks from Pyongyang, with whom Seoul is still technically at war.  The DATQ report assessed the technological aspects of Seoul’s cybersecurity to be under 80 percent of those of developed countries. It said that it is necessary for the authorities to foster capabilities to counter the communist state’s cyberthreats.“The enemy  will seek to disable our cyber capacity at a critical point via an all-out cyberattack. ... It is crucial  to establish an asymmetrical cyber warfare capacity to overwhelm that of the North,” the report said.By Yoon Min-sik","hackers could disable us ,cyberattack by north koreans ,nk hackers could disable ,blown cyberattack by pyongyang ,hackers could disable","['North Koreans', 'the US Pacific Command', 'the Defense Agency for Technology', 'Quality', 'Pentagon', 'Pyongyang', 'USPACOM']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68617535  0.75583684

The lawmakers originally planned to air the questioning, but after hours of quarreling with the correctional office, instead carried out the interrogation in private. Other members of the committee visited former presidential aides An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong at another detention center as the two had also refused to attend a hearing at the National Assembly. Choi and An are suspected of forcing conglomerates to donate77.4 billion won  to the Mir and K-Sports Foundations, which she virtually controlled. Jeong is accused of leaking government secrets to Choi. The three have been claiming that their testimonies could affect an on-going investigation by independent prosecutors. There are no legal grounds to force witnesses to attend the parliamentary hearing. During the two and a half-hour-long questioning, Choi denied most of the allegations raised against her, according to the lawmakers. Lawmakers exit a detention centera fter a private hearing with Choi Soon-sil. ""She said she is sorry for causing confusion in the country but declined to specifically comment on what she did wrong,"" said Rep. Kim Han-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party.The committee earlier said it decided to file complaints against the three defendants on charges of contempt of the National Assembly.Choi's lawyer Lee Kyung-jae said in a press release that such an attempt to interrogate Choi in the detention facility goes against the law and the Constitution. ""The committee does not have the authority to question a witness who did not attend the hearing,"" he said. ""If they wanted to question the defendant, they should have sent a request seeking her appearance at least seven days earlier, according to the law.""A justice ministry official, who asked not to be named, meanwhile said an interrogation in a detention center is possible under the law and other rules.The panel has held five sessions of inquiry, summoning presidential staff members, business tycoons and other figures involved in the influence-peddling scandal.During an interrogation by special prosecutors Sunday, Choi denied new allegations that she stashed around 10 trillion won abroad. She told investigators that she would donate all the money to the state, if there were any such money, according to the independent counsel team.Local media reported Choi may have hidden 800 billion won in Germany and more in other European countries via her ghost companies.The independent counsel on the scandal said the team has hired a former state tax agency official to trace Choi's assets at home and abroad.Sources said that the team will also track down dubious assets Choi's family has amassed over the past 40 years.Choi is the fifth daughter of Park's late mentor Choi Tae-min. The late Choi, who used to lead a religious cult, had reportedly advised Park since her mother, Yook Young-soo, was assassinated by a North Korea sympathizer in 1974.","korean lawmakers on monday ,president impeachment at detention ,lawmakers grill woman ,lawmakers on monday questioned ,south korean lawmakers","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Seoul', 'Park']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.52736521  0.57115996

North Koreans in the capital city of Pyongyang are three times as rich as those in other areas, South Korea's state-run think tank said Thursday, in the latest sign of the deepening economic divide in the communist country.Pyongyang's per capita gross domestic product is estimated to be at between $2,658 and $2,715 as of 2008, compared with a range of $791 and $1,213 in the South Hwanghae Province in the country's southwest, the Korea Development Institute  said in a report.Since 2008, North Korea has been one of the poorest countries with a per capita GDP of only $1,000 on the purchasing power parity basis, the report said.The KDI said its findings were based on estimates of the share of solid fuel used in cooking in North Korea as that type of energy is closely linked to the public's income level and is considered a relatively significant method in gauging the real income in underdeveloped countries with little statistical infrastructure.Children in a North Korean rural area. As of 2008, North Korean households who use firewood to cook account for 47 percent, while coal-using households make up 46 percent, the KDI said, adding that it means that almost all North Koreans are given no access to modern energy sources, such as electricity, gas and oil.The KDI also said about 88 percent of North Koreans aged 20-59 are officially employed in socialist sectors.Still, the actual share of the employed population who can afford a decent living is estimated at between 31 percent and 62 percent, the KDI said, citing North Korea's 2008 census.In comparison, the share of the officially employed population aged 20-59 in Pyongyang is 85 percent, while the real employed population stands at between 61 percent and 85 percent.The KDI said its findings imply that Pyongyang holds a very special position in North Korea in terms of income, as well as real employment.","pro north korean newspaper ,korea has economic polarization ,coffee bar in pyongyang ,three times as rich ,sinbo pro north korean","['Pyongyang', 'Chosun Sinbo', 'north korean', 'Japan', 'Koreans', 'Pyongyang', ""South Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64350271  0.855317

According to the Hankook Ilbo, German prosecutors are investigating Choi and her daughter Chung Yoo-ra for having created some 500 paper companies using the names of 10 affiliates, including Chung’s horseback riding coach and another associate in Europe, mainly in Germany. The newspaper cited unnamed sources at South Korea’s Justice Ministry and the independent counsel team which is currently investigating the scandal.Park’s friend, Choi, is suspected of meddling in state affairs and using her close ties to the president for personal gains. Her 20-year-old daughter was unfairly accepted into a prestigious university in Seoul and received special treatment in her academic records, a separate probe found.  German police in Hessen found out about the shell companies during their investigation into the 280,000 euros  sent four different times since last September by Korean conglomerate Samsung to one of Choi’s companies, Core Sports, in Germany. As it is difficult for nonnatives to create companies in the country, the two are thought to have used local associates’ names and later acquired all the shares of the companies after their establishment. It is suspected that the 10 affiliates include Chung’s equestrian coach Christian Kamplade in Germany and David Yoon who has known the family for 17 years.  Choi first created the asset management company Mainsee 959, then changed its name two times, to Core Sports, later settling on Widec Sports. She is suspected of coercing funds from conglomerates, including Samsung which is also under investigation for donating large amounts of money to Choi.Chung, whose whereabouts are not known, has repeatedly refused to attend the parliamentary hearing over the scandal. Besides trying to secure a court warrant to detain her, the independent counsel team has requested German authorities to extradite Chung and to freeze her assets, while also asking for the transaction and phone records of the affiliates. Korea’s Foreign Ministry also decided to seize the passport of Chung and possibly invalidate it if she does not turn it in soon. The special investigation team has put her on its wanted list. Hankook Ilbo reported that Choi has been forming relationships with acquaintances in Germany for over 30 years. She was also found to have spent summer last year in Germany amid an ongoing prosecutorial probe.Regarding the 800 billion won of assets, the authorities said they are considering confiscating the money.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office charged the man, identified only by his last name Kim, with assisting in the murder of two men and one woman and abandoning their bodies.The victims were found with gunshot wounds to the head in a sugar cane field in Bacolor, some 70 kilometers northwest of Manila, on Oct. 11.Kim's 38-year-old accomplice, identified only by his last name Park, is in custody in the Philippines. He has been running various businesses in the Philippines since 2010, police said. This photo provided by the National Police Agency on Nov. 18, 2016, shows a sugar cane field in Bacolor, the Philippines, where three South Koreans were found shot to death on Oct. 11. According to prosecutors, Kim left for the Philippines in early October after Park, who he got to know through one of his acquaintances, asked him to kill the victims in return for 100 million won .Park allegedly plotted the murder to siphon off some hundreds of millions of won they had invested in a casino business. The three had fled to the Southeast Asian country in August after illegally raising some 15 billion won in funds.Kim returned to South Korea on Oct. 13, as local authorities accelerated the probe. He was arrested by police last month. South Korean authorities are planning to repatriate Park after he is finished with all the judicial proceedings in the Philippines.The three victims are among eight South Korean nationals killed in the Philippines so far this year, according to the foreign ministry.Last year, a total of 11 South Koreans were killed in the Southeast Asian country, nearly doubling from the six tallied in 2012, the ministry said.","shooting death of koreans ,indicted prosecutors said wednesday ,shooting deaths of three ,koreans in philippines indicted ,in philippines indicted prosecutors","['south Korean', 'Philippines', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office"", 'Kim']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16336811  0.74518257

But they said firmly that the impeachment was not the end of their fight. Many of the protesters vowed to hold up candles until Park resigns and those who assisted her in committing wrongdoings are held accountable. Citizens march towards Cheong Wa Dae or the presidential office in the 7th rally in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul on Saturday after the impeachment vote passed Friday. “I was so excited when I heard the president was impeached. I clapped with my colleagues at work. I think it was a rational decision,” Kang Hoon, 37, who came with his 3-year-old child, told The Korea Herald. “But we cannot call it a victory until President Park steps down.”""I will continue to holda candle until she resigns.""South Korean lawmakers on Friday voted to impeach the embattled leader over her involvement in an influence-peddling and corruption scandal, with the approval of 234 lawmakers from the 300-seat National Assembly.This was the first rally since lawmakers impeached her and the seventh straight Saturday rally to demand President Park Geun-hye step down. Across the nation, more than a million people took to the streets.   Now, the fate of her presidency is left up to the Constitutional Court as it requires final approval from it, which could take up to 180 days.“The Constitutional Court should make a decision as quickly as possible to uphold the public calls,” said 62-year-old Cho Min-koo, who came with his family. “I am here today to enjoy the festivities. I have been surprised and proud to see how mature my fellow Korean citizens are.”Until the court makes its ruling, Park is stripped of presidential authority and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn will serve as acting president. But she retains the title of president and is immune from criminal investigation. Protestors march towards the presidential office during the seventh rally against President Park Geun-hye held in central Seoul, Saturday. On Saturday evening, the boulevards surrounding the Gwanghwamun Square turned into a festive outdoor concert venue, with citizens taking to the stage to make speeches and local singers performing. At the peak of the event, fireworks were displayed, participants hugged strangers next to them and waved candles.Fireworks are displayed to celebrate the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye during the seventh rally against President Park Geun-hye in central Seoul, Saturday. Following the main event, some 30,000 marched to three locations, as close as 100 meters from the presidential office, to surround it. They chanted “President Park Geun-hye, resign!” “Arrest Park Geun-hye” and “We cannot stand another day!”Protestors hold a placard ""President Park Geun-hye, step down!"" and a candle during the seventh anti-Park rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. “It is a triumph of the people. We have fought hard to defend our democracy,” said Kim Yool-gu, 47, while taking a selfie with his family at the square.  “But we are only halfway through until she steps down.We need to keep raising our voices to root out corrupt political and economic systems.”Many protesters also said the outcome taught them what democracy means.“I cannot believe that we made this impeachment happen. I am so touched and excited. I learned that I can change society if I participate,” said 18-year-old student Kwon So-yoon. “I am not even cold, because of the people around me.” Some 800,000 protestors pack the Gwanghwamun Square during the rally against President Park Geun-hye on Saturday. Some expressed hope for a fairer society through structural reforms. “I am happy, but it is not the end to making a society that can be ruled by the people. We need to take this as an opportunity to remove corrupt links between the prosecution, family-owned conglomerates and powerful politicians,” said Cho jong-joo, who was giving out free coffee and tea at the squareOthers demanded a thorough probe and stern punishment of Park, her friend Choi Soon-sil and ex-presidential aides such as Woo Byung-woo and Kim Ki-choon, who are also implicated in the scandal.“Park Geun-hye and her friends in the political and economic circles who assisted her to commit crimes should all be arrested and punished so that such corruption can never happen again,” said 21-year-old student Kim Na-jin. Earlier in the day, a variety of civic organizations, farmers groups, students groups and labor unions gathered for a rally at various locations in central Seoul to call for an end to controversial policies such as the reinstatement of the state-issued text books, deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, and labor market reforms. Three hundred and four life jackets are placed on the ground of Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul, Saturday, each commemorating one of the victims who died in the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster. One of the key remaining issues is to reveal what happened on the day of the Sewol ferry disaster, which cost the lives of more than 300 people in April in 2014. The president has come under fire for the administration’s botched rescue efforts to save the victims, with questions growing over what she did for seven hours while the ferry sank. Citizens stick yellow ribbons to a wall in Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul, Saturday to pay respect to the victims of the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster. “If the president did her job properly, this tragedy could have not taken place,” said Lee Young-jin, 39, attaching a yellow ribbon to an installment in front of the memorial altar for the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. “The cause behind the ferry sinking should be clearly revealed to prevent a recurrence of such a tragedy.” Avid fans of President Park Geun-hye gathered to call for a cancellation of the impeachment in a counter rally held in central Seoul, Saturday. Some 15,000 people, mostly in their 60s or older, from right-wing civic groups and President Park’s fan club staged a rally near Gwanghwamun Square, calling for the impeachment to be canceled. They carried banners reading, “Don’t cry. Don’t be sad. Be confident,” slamming the parliament for passing the impeachment motion. South Koreans have taken to the streets and lit candles across the nation for the past six weeks to call for Park’s ouster, with cumulative participation standing at about 6 million, according to the rally organizers.President Park has been criticized for colluding with Choi Soon-sil, who has neither an official government post nor policy background, to extort money from conglomerates and let her meddle in state affairs. While an independent counsel continues to investigate the scandal, Choi is set to stand trial for fraud and embezzlement on Dec. 19. By Ock Hyun-ju","koreans celebrate park impeachment ,korean lawmakers impeached scandal ,south korean lawmakers impeached ,park impeachment in rally ,korean lawmakers impeached","['south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'South Koreans', 'Seoul']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.47283536  0.27265975

This came after Rep. Pyo Chang-won of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea unveiled a list of the lawmakers opposing the impeachment. Rep. Pyo Chang-won of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea  argues with lawmakers of Saenuri Party at the National Assembly on Thursday. Mobile phone numbers of the Saenuri lawmakers uploaded by an unknown source soon started to circulate online. “I get phone calls even at 3 a.m.,” Rep. Jung Byung-kuk said in a meeting of Saenuri lawmakers. Fellow Saneuri Rep. Rep. Oh Sin-hwan complained about receiving hundreds of text messages. Rep. Lee Eun-jae said: “It is too much. Do we need to change our phone numbers?” On Wednesday, Rep. Pyo released a list categorizing the 300 lawmakers in the National Assembly into three groups -- one favoring the impeachment, others clearly against the plan and the rest who seem reluctant to impeach her. “You  will be distressed by a barrage of calls. Blame me. I will take it. But you should make your stance clear. People cannot endure the situation even for a second,” he said in a Facebook and Twitter post. The Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk called Rep. Pyo’s actions “regrettable,” while vowing to ask for an investigation to find the person who first revealed the list of phone numbers online. Other Saenuri lawmakers denounced Pyo’s actions as an act of “political terrorism.”The phone calls and text messages reveal a thinning public patience toward politicians who can’t quite decide what to do with President Park, despite an overwhelming display of public anger toward the embattled president. A sixth massive rally against Park is to take place Saturday, which will be a yardstick to gauge the public sentiment before the impeachment vote. The opposition parties have scheduled the crucial vote for next Friday, hoping the upcoming protest adds weight to their campaign to oust Park. They need at least 28 votes from Saenuri to impeach Park. On Saturday, protesters plan to gather in front of Saenuri’s headquarters in southwestern Seoul from 2 p.m. to show their anger at the party, rally organizers said. Then from 4 p.m., they plan to march toward the presidential office in central Seoul. Like last week, the march will have12 routes across central Seoul and completely surround Cheong Wa Dae from several directions. The main event is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Gwanghwamun Square.President Park Geun-hye’s approval rating remained at record-low 4 percent this week, a Gallup Korea poll showed Friday, while 91 percent disapproved of her. So far, the cumulative number of Koreans who took to the streets to demand President Park step down, has exceeded 4 million, according to the rally organizers. Last Saturday alone, up to 1.9 million people participated in the rally, with 1.5 million in Seoul. President Park’s loyalists plan to stage a counter rally in front of Dongdaemun Design Plaza in central Seoul to blast protestors calling for Park’s resignation.

the southwestern island of Jindo, leaving 295 dead and nine missing.South Korea still remembers the trauma of the Sewol ferry disaster, not only due to the number of victims -- most of whom were young students on a school trip -- but also because their deaths may have been prevented or at least minimized if due measures had been taken in time.Now, with a political scandal unfolding at the highest office of the country, the attention of the public is returning to the day of the accident, as there are suspicions President Park Geun-hye’s incompetence or negligence of duty may have led to the lax rescue actions. ‘Seven-hour mystery’On the day of the tragedy, the National Security Office sent a message to the Blue House at 9:24 a.m., some 30 minutes after the initial report on the incident, confirming a reported sinking of a ferry with 474 passengers aboard.This text message was soon followed by an official report, upon which President Park supposedly made a call back to the NSO, ordering it “not to allow a single death to happen.” She also was said to have called the Coast Guard chief at 10:30 a.m., demanding that all available forces be mobilized for rescue operations.These two phone calls, which were only confirmed by Cheong Wa Dae and the two respective offices, were the last actions to be heard from the nation’s top chief until she finally appeared at the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters at 5:15 p.m.Even after her appearance, Park came under fire for her apparent lack of awareness of the situation, her first question being, “The students are wearing life vests, so why aren‘t they found yet?”Since 11:30 a.m., the ferry had been fully submerged with only its bow remaining above water, with most of the passengers trapped in the capsized vessel.Such disconnection from the urgency of the matter later convinced many that Park’s unexplained hours of silence had not been spent on catching up with the accident.But despite persistent calls for the president to clarify her whereabouts and actions during that time, the seven-hour mystery has never been fully explained.For all these years, the Blue House‘s official stance has been that it could not offer details due to “national security.”Escalating rumors that Park was having a secret rendezvous or that she was undergoing cosmetic surgery on the day have not been enough to unseal the silence.It was amid such unanswered speculations that Tatsuya Kato, a former Seoul bureau chief of the Japanese Sankei Shimbun, faced defamation charges over his column alleging a romantic relationship between Park and her former adviser Jeong Yoon-hoe.‘Choi scandal’ kindles scorn toward ParkBut following the recent series of revelations -- that the president has long been manipulated by her confidante Choi Soon-sil and abetted her corruption -- new light has been shone on those seven hours, suggesting that Park’s absence then may have indeed had nothing to do with national security.With mounting circumstantial evidence that the presidential office abused its authority for the sake of the president’s private acquaintances, it has become easier for a skeptical public to suspect Park of neglecting her duty or carrying out irregularities on the day of the ferry accident.The Choi Soon-sil scandal first started off with the allegation that the president leaked a number of confidential documents, including her key speeches, to her civilian friend Choi.That a nation’s president was under the control of a private acquaintance, who is also strongly suspected of cult connections and corrupt acts, was in itself a shock to the nation, even to those most loyal to her.But what really sparked the public’s fury was Park’s consistent reluctance to acknowledge the seriousness of her actions, clarify the suggested suspicions and take due measures.Since her second address to the nation delivered on Nov. 4, her approval rating has remained at a record-low level, ranging from 5-9.6 percent, depending on the pollster.This record fall, which reflected the resentment felt even in her previous stronghold of supporters, came in line with weekslong candlelight protests held in central Seoul and throughout the country demanding Park’s immediate ouster.Also, burgeoning evidence that seemed to show that Park was indeed involved in some shady activity -- be it cosmetic surgery or a romantic encounter during working hours -- at the time of the Sewol disaster has led to scornful responses from the already disappointed crowd.Reports that the president visited a local medical center in secrecy to receive illicit stem cell injections, or that the Blue House purchased a list of dubious drugs including erectile dysfunction pills, do not seem so irrelevant any more. They, in fact, are considered as possible clues to the yearslong mystery of the president’s actual whereabouts on the tragic day. Sewol ferry capsizing. YonhapSnowballing doubts create flashback to SewolThe Blue House’s recent explanations of the seven hours, delivered hurriedly in a self-defensive tone, have boosted the public‘s suspicion further.Last Saturday, Cheong Wa Dae uploaded on its official blog a posting titled “These are the facts,” listing the president’s location and schedule on the day of the ferry sinking.The upload took place just hours before a popular documentary program by SBS aired, having pledged to dig into the president’s whereabouts on the Sewol sinking day.The gist of the long post was that the president was at her residence, instead of her office, and that she received reports on the rescue procedures on a real-time basis.But such a stance only pushed liberal Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung to charge Park with negligence of duty, calling her liable for the deaths of the Sewol victims.“The president is admitting that she only spent some two hours on official operations, and in the privacy of her residence,” Lee said Tuesday, upon submitting the charge.“As chief of the administration, the president has the duty to give orders and receive urgent reports on a real-time basis for the sake of the people’s safety, so Park’s actions clearly constitute a serious breach of duty.”The presidential house also shifted the blame to the media, claiming that Park’s delayed visit to the headquarters was based on false reports that had earlier overestimated the number of those rescued.In an attempt to dismiss all the rumors of her unexplained seven hours, the Blue House went as far as stating the rumors suggested so far -- ranging from Park’s alleged rendezvous with Jeong to a drug injection or even absence from office due to cosmetic surgery -- were false.Such an extensive statement, however, largely led to the inevitable question: Why would Cheong Wa Dae have refused to reveal these “facts” for all these years, if this is all there really was?Ironically, the apparently loyal statement by former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-choon only seemed to back the rampant rumors Cheong Wa Dae is struggling to deny.“I believe in the president’s words when she says she did not receive surgery , but I could not possibly ask her the question,” he said in an interview.“I considered it a discourtesy to ask such a thing to a female president.”His words echoed those of Yoo Yeong-ha, the legal representative speaking for Park in the ongoing prosecutorial probe and in the upcoming independent counsel investigation.“Please show respect for her private life as a woman, not just as president,” the lawyer said last week in the press briefing following the announcement of his appointment.Their common reference to the president’s “privacy as a woman” only added weight to speculation the president was either receiving a cosmetic procedure or involved in a romantic relationship during the “lost seven hours.”By Bae Hyun-jung","when passenger ferry sank ,nine missing south korea ,jindo leaving 295 dead ,passenger ferry sank in ,passenger ferry sank","['Jindo', 'South Korea']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26254448  0.14339064

More than 130 North Koreans were also reportedly dead and about 400 missing in the North's worst-ever flood.

"", the North Korean authorities recently set up ways to make use of its workforce, and keeps trying to make contacts with the Mongolian side,"" the Radio Free Asia cited a Mongolian construction official as saying over the phone. As Mongolia is currently recruiting foreign laborers as miners, North Korea workers are likely to aggressively apply, the official said.  A photo taken on July 11, 2016, shows North Korean workers returning to their construction site after smoking at a university in Ulan Bator. The mining work will go on full scale in March next year, he added. Mongolia began to hire North Korean workers en masse in 2008, and such employment peaked with 5,000 in 2013. At present, however, the number of North Korean workers working in Mongolia has decreased to some 1,000 due to an economic slump that hit the central Asian nation in 2014. More than 50,000 North Koreans are believed to be forced to work overseas, mainly in China and Russia, sending substantial amounts of their salaries to the Pyongyang regime. The North reportedly earns more than $200 million per year through labor exports.","its workers to mongolia ,cited mongolian construction official ,workers to mongolia ,labor export to mongolia ,mongolian construction official","['North Korea', 'asian', 'U.S.', 'north korean', 'mongolian', 'mongolian']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.75859463  0.85360384

The scandal is South Korea’s biggest political crisis in years, with citizens demanding Park’s removal from office. Here’s what we know so far. Q. Who is Choi Soon-sil?A. She is a 60-year-old woman who has never held a government post. She has been a close friend of President Park for 40 years. She has changed her name at least twice. Her current legal name is Choi Seo-won. Choi is also the fifth daughter of President Park’s late mentor Choi Tae-min. Her ex-husband Jeong Yun-hoe was one of Park’s longest-serving aides. He assisted Park when she entered politics in 1998 and was her chief secretary in 2002 when Park founded her own political party. Choi Soon-sil enters the Seoul Central District Court for questioning, with her glasses and hat removed, amid a horde of reporters Monday. Q. What did Choi do?A. Choi is being investigated for a wide range of influence-peddling allegations. One is that she used her ties with Park to solicit some tens of billions of won in donations from conglomerates -- including Samsung and Hyundai -- to set up two nonprofit foundations in the name of supporting cultural and sports projects. She is also accused of meddling in state affairs and receiving regular reports on confidential information. Choi denies all of the accusations, except that she had access to presidential speeches before they were delivered. She insists she helped Park with her speeches “out of pure intentions.” The president also admitted to having asked for Choi’s feedback. Q: Is there evidence of wrongdoing?A: Aside from testimonies by Choi’s acquaintances and suspicious circumstances, there is not much hard evidence to prove Park’s acted illegally. A tablet PC, recovered by cable TV network JTBC, could be a key piece of evidence, as it was found to have about 200 presidential documents containing classified information about a presidential staff reshuffle, diplomacy and security. It also held photos of Choi -- which appear to be selfies -- and her family. However, Choi denies the device is hers. Q. Is Choi a shaman?A. This is not certain. What we know is that Choi’s father, Choi Tae-min, was an unconventional religious figure who approached President Park claiming he had been sent by her late mother. He later founded his own cult -- the Church of Eternal Life -- and a volunteer corps in which Choi Soon-sil held a post as a university student leader. Park was its honorary leader. Of his children, Choi Tae-min is said to have loved Choi Soon-sil most for her “spiritual and intelligent” capabilities. Q: Why did Park keep Choi close? A: Theories abound, but Park’s description of Choi may be self-explanatory. In a nationally televised apology last week, she called Choi “someone who helped her when she went through difficult times.” For Park, who grew up at Cheong Wa Dae and lost both of her parents to assassinations at a young age, the Chois -- Choi Tae-min and Choi Soon-sil -- may have been like family. Park has never been married and is said to be estranged from her siblings. Some suspect that Park’s unyielding reliance on the Chois may even be religious, and therefore more about faith than logic. Q. Can Park be prosecuted?A: No. South Korea’s Constitution exempts the president from prosecution, except in cases of insurrection or treason. While the president is exempt from criminal liability, there are mixed interpretations in legal circles as to whether she is also exempt from investigation. A local bar association argues she is not. Q: Is Park’s presidency over?A: It is likely over -- one way or another.Park’s five-year presidency ends in February 2018, but polls show that a majority of the public want her to resign immediately -- an option Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling Saenuri Party are reluctant to pursue. A more plausible alternative is for the president to step aside from state affairs, making way for a new, reinforced Cabinet led by the prime minister. Observers say that with Park’s approval rating dipping around the 10 percent range -- a figure indicating even her core supporters have turned their back on her -- the current situation may already be deemed an “impeachment by public sentiment.” The personnel vacuum created after Park sent away most of her key aides in a gesture of reform has also left the presidential office in a state of management paralysis. By Korea Herald staff /","korea biggest political crisis ,scandal dominating south korean ,south korea biggest political ,korea biggest political ,biggest political crisis","['Choi Soon - sil', 'south korean', 'Park Geun', 'South Korea ’s', 'Park ’s', 'Choi Soon']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.74673533  0.67725807

If it is blacklisted, its assets in South Korea will be subject to oversight and any financial deals with South Koreans will be banned.""Detailed and effective unilateral sanctions measures, including that , are under consideration,"" Cho June-hyuck, foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press briefing. He declined to elaborate further. In September, the US blacklisted the Chinese company along with its owner and three other company officials in the first move ever to impose sanctions on a Chinese entity over Pyongyang's weapons programs.Currently, the United Nations Security Council is working on a fresh resolution against the North following its fifth nuclear test in September.The efforts are reportedly focused on covering the ""loopholes"" through which the North is suspected of getting its hands on money needed for its nuclear and missile programs.Blacklisting Dandong Honxiang is seen as a loosened form of the ""secondary boycott"" aimed at penalizing any third-country entities involved in business dealings with Pyongyang. Last month, Japan's Kyodo News reported that the Tokyo government is considering blacklisting companies based in China and other countries found to have deals with the North, and employ workers from the reclusive country.","korea mulls blacklisting chinese ,korea is considering blacklisting ,considering blacklisting chinese firm ,is considering blacklisting chinese ,korea mulls blacklisting","['South Korea', 'chinese', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'China', 'Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co.']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51438183  0.08411193

North Korean news outlets said the typhoon that affected the country from Aug. 29 through Sept. 2 caused 68,900 people to abandon their homes.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, said his claim is based on a reliable source who frequently visits the reclusive country.""The North's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, recently reported that work is still under way to repair the damage caused two months after the flooding,"" the scholar told Yonhap News Agency. ""This is a clear indication that the damage is much more serious than the initial assessment."" The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Sept. 16 that the flooding that hit North Korea was the worst in 50-60 years. It said the natural disaster affected not only homes but schools, kindergartens and child care centers.An image captured from a Korean Central Television broadcast on Sept. 19, North Korean workers engage in flood repair in North Hamgyong Province. Reflecting this, numerous photos obtained by Yonhap showed large scale devastation and ongoing efforts to repair damaged infrastructure. Pictures also showed signboards urging the people to join the ongoing campaign to repair damage caused by the flooding.Elaborating on the conditions in the North, Cheong speculated that Pyeongyang probably exercised ""restraint"" on Oct. 10 because of the damage caused by the flooding. He suggested that if the country was not reeling from the flooding, Pyongyang would have detonated another nuclear device or fired off a long-range missile.","caused heavy rainfall landslides ,flooding north korean news ,koreans displaced by flooding ,displaced by devastating floods ,floods that ravaged northeastern","['North Koreans', 'Pyongyang', 'Typhoon Lionrock', 'north korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38755417  0.3869684

We’re looking into this,” regional military command spokesman, Major Filemon Tan, told the ABS CBN television channel.The ship, a heavy load carrier called Dong Bang Giant 2, was en route to South Korea from Australia, when it was attacked.The 11,400-tonne vessel was allowed to continue on its course after the abductions, Tan said, adding that authorities had interviewed witnesses on board, with the military now in “hot pursuit” of the kidnappers.Tan said Thursday’s abduction marked the first time that kidnappers in the area have targeted a large ship, with previous attempts usually focusing on smaller vessels.The Abu Sayyaf is a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network, and has earned millions of dollars from kidnappings-for-ransom.The group began abducting sailors in border waters between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines early this year, taking several dozen Indonesian and Malaysian hostages.The militants also beheaded two Canadian hostages and released a Norwegian man along with a number of Indonesian and Malaysian sailors.Military sources say the militants are still holding a Dutch hostage, five Malaysians, two Indonesians and four Filipinos in their jungle stronghold in the southern Philippines.While its leaders have in recent years pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, analysts say the Abu Sayyaf is mainly focused on a lucrative kidnapping business rather than religious ideology.","militants kidnapped the captain ,korean ship captain snatched ,suspected islamist militants kidnapped ,islamist militants kidnapped the ,islamist militants kidnapped","['MANILA', 'AFP', 'islamist', 'filipino', 'south korean', 'Philippines', 'Abu Sayyaf', 'south korean', 'philippine', 'korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.58991915  0.86015469

The fake explosive was later found to have been made with two butane canisters taped to a water bottle.At the first trial, the suspect was sentenced to eight months in prison. The appeal's department, however, dismissed the suspect's claim that he was mentally incompetent when he committed the crime and ruled in favor of the prosecution which said the original ruling was too light.The court said due to his criminal act, one of the airport's arrivals halls was cordoned off for two hours, leading to a delay in arrivals and handling of some 3,000 passengers from 17 planes that had to be diverted elsewhere.The suspect was arrested five days after the incident took place. The man said he harbored discontent towards the society as he had not been employed for a long time.","court sentenced 35 year ,airport local court sentenced ,local court sentenced 35 ,old south korean man ,blow up incheon airport","['south korean', 'the Incheon District Court', 'Seoul']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.16473189  0.51511729

Male patients appear to have felt a sense of confusion, humiliation, fear and loss while undergoing an operation,” the court said in the ruling. But the court lowered the amount of the compensation to 20 million won equally for male and female patients, citing a principle of equality under the Constitution. Last year, the Seoul Central District Court ordered the country to pay women 40 million and men 30 million.  Human rights groups hold a press conference at the Seoul Central District Court gate Friday, ahead of the Seoul High Court’s ruling on state liability of compensation for leprosy patients’ sterilizations and abortions. YonhapEarlier in June, officials of the appeals court visited Sorokdo to listen to the Hansen disease victims and witnesses, and to conduct an on-site inspection for the first time since the victims filed for a suit against the government. The hearing was held at a makeshift courtroom at the Sorokdo National Hospital, Goheung county, South Jeolla Province, where victims underwent abortion and sterilization until the 1990s based on the belief that the disease they had could be passed on to the children. The disease, however, turned out to be curable and only mildly contagious.Some 500 patients have filed for a total of six suits since 2011. The government set up a committee to find facts about the alleged state-led abuse of leprosy patients under the Prime Minister in 2007. A total of five cases are pending at the nation’s courts. The government has appealed the decision, saying that the disputed operations had not been forced upon the patients.By Ock Hyun-ju","abortions upholding lower court ,childbirth policies in violation ,korean appeals court friday ,in implementing childbirth policies ,offer 20 million won","['south korean', 'the Seoul High Court']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ...  0.08565677  0.34966403

The suspect was nabbed a few hours later some 40 kilometers from the scene of the incident.Police said they have requested the investigative authorities of China's Hebei Province, where he is from, to provide information on the suspect's profession, family relations and criminal records. They are planning to verify if Chen has a history of mental illness, as well as his statement that he committed the crime because the victim reminded him of his former wives who ran away after having extramarital affairs.  Police officers take a Chinese man, suspected of fatally stabbing a 61-year-old Korean woman who was praying at a local church, to the Jeju Seobu Police Station on the country's resort island of Jeju on Sept. 17. Chen entered the country as a tourist under the visa-free program last week and was scheduled to leave this week, police said.A local court on Monday issued a warrant to formally arrest the Chinese man, citing the possibility he would flee.The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital after the attacker fled the scene, but she was later pronounced dead Sunday.","china over jeju murder ,killing south korean woman ,jeju murder case police ,of killing south korean ,church alone on saturday","['chinese', 'chinese', 'south korean', 'catholic', 'Jeju', 'Chen']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37175679  0.44031194

In a July letter sent to Suwon Mayor Yeom Tae-young, Mayor Dietor Salomon of Freiburg, Germany, notified that his city had accepted Yeom's earlier proposal to build the statue in the German city. Following that, 75 public and civic organizations in Suwon jointly staged a campaign to raise funds for the project.""But Mayor Salomon notified Yeom over the phone on Monday that it's become hard to put the accord into practice,"" Lee Joo-hyon, head of a Suwon civic organization, said during a weekly rally calling for an apology from Tokyo in front of the Japanese Embassy here.  The German city's change in position stems from organized interruption and pressure from the Japanese government and rightists, Lee claimed. The Japanese ambassador to Berlin and consul general in Frankfurt recently visited the Freiburg city government to lodge a strong protest against the statue, Lee said.Japan's Matsuyama in Ehime Prefecture, which has a 27-year-old sisterhood with Freiburg, has also threatened to sever the ties if the German city continues the project, according Lee. ""I've come to know how immense the symbolic meaning of the statue is and how sensitive Japan is to the issue,"" Lee said. The statue, if built, would be the first of its kind in Europe.Up until now, four such statues have been set up abroad -- two in the United States, one in Canada and one in Australia. Some 200,000 Asian women, mostly Korean, are estimated to have been forcibly taken to front-line brothels for the Japanese army during the war.

""By one estimate, this amount would have been almost enough to both fund North Korea's uranium enrichment facilities, and design, make and test its nuclear weapons.""Moreover, the subsidiary sent at least two shipments of aluminum oxide to the North as recently as September last year, the report said. Aluminum oxide is considered a ""dual-use"" item that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.""According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, aluminum oxide is a component used to resist corrosion in gas centrifuges during uranium enrichment,"" the report said, adding that in 2013, a British firm discovered that the aluminum oxide it had been sending to an Iranian company was used for the country's nuclear program.In 2009, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. also partnered with the North's Korea National Insurance Corporation to form a joint venture engaged in the wholesale trade of textiles, stationery, electrical equipment and other goods, the report said.KNIC is one of the sanctioned North Korean entities. In 2015, the European Commission imposed sanctions on KNIC's German branch and six company officials, saying the firm is a government entity generating substantial foreign exchange revenue that was used to support the North Korean regime, according to the report.Chinese firms associated with the Liaoning Hongxiang Group also provide ""services that are critical"" to the underlying cyber architecture of the North, including the country's primary email relay service, facilities from which ""hackers are alleged to operate,"" and IT firms producing software with possible military and regime applicability, the report said.The report also said that the Chilbosan Hotel, a joint venture between the Liaoning Hongxiang Group and the North, is ""alleged to be the staging area for Bureau 121, a group of North Korean hackers"" accused of involvement in the 2014 hacking attack on Sony Pictures.""Going after the DPRK's alternative income sources is likely to be the surest means for the international community to coerce the Kim Jong-un regime into abandoning its nuclear weapons program,"" the report said. ""Getting there, however, will require significantly expanded efforts to continually investigate, monitor and act against DPRK entities evading sanctions.""The report also made a series of recommendations aimed at improving the enforcement of sanctions on the North, including shortening the time required from the point of identifying a sanctions-violating entity and its blacklisting, proactively monitoring the North's foreign-flagged ships and reaffirming China's enforcement of sanctions.","illicit dealings with korea ,report chinese conglomerate trading ,conglomerate suspected of illicit ,chinese conglomerate trading heavily ,chinese conglomerate suspected","['chinese', 'North Korea', 'South Korea', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Liaoning Hongxiang Group', 'Burmese', 'north korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40394226  0.48256624

What cannot be resolved in such a way should then be brought to a dedicated arbitration committee comprised of the two countries' representatives and one from a third country.The court, however, like previous rulings in similar cases, said it is hard to say the government failed to perform its duty to start the arbitration procedure when it has made efforts to resolve the dispute.","rejects korean bomb victims ,bombings seeking 10 million ,again rejects korean bomb ,atomic bombings seeking 10 ,korean bomb victims suit","['Seoul', 'South Koreans', 'US', 'Japan', 'the Seoul Northern District Court', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33306333  0.61407346

It also said that 25 percent of the prisoners are reportedly women and some 80 percent of the female prisoners are North Korean nationals forcibly repatriated from China.""Their detention highlights the illegality of China's forcible repatriation of North Korean refugees to conditions of danger, despite overwhelming and justified fear of persecution, in direct violation of the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, to which China is a party,"" HRNK Executive Director Greg Scarlatoiu said.China does not recognize North Korean defectors as refugees and regularly repatriates them to their home country, where they can face harsh punishment. But Beijing has allowed North Korean defectors involved in high-profile cases or those who sought refuge at foreign diplomatic missions to travel to South Korea to avoid international opprobrium.Tens of thousands of North Koreans are believed to be in hiding in China, hoping to travel to Thailand or another Southeast Asian country before resettling in South Korea, which is now home to about 27,000 North Korean defectors.","korean prison camp expands ,china has expanded detention ,women report north korean ,prison camp expands detention ,report north korean prison","['north korean', 'China', 'Hoeryong', 'China']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65770376  0.08269309

""Given the recent defection of a high-level North Korean official and North Korea's threats of provocations, there seem to be high possibilities of terrorist attacks and abductions of our citizens,"" the embassy message said. ""South Koreans are advised to pay special attention to their personal safety,"" it said.  South Koreans in China are also advised to abstain from trips to the border areas and meeting with any suspected North Koreans, the message also said, urging them to constantly check safety information updates from the embassy. The latest message was the second of its kind which has been issued since a similar warning was made on July 22. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reportedly ordered retaliatory terrorist attacks on South Korea at that time in response to the group defection of13 North Korean restaurant workers based in China in April.The second warning was made following the defection of Thae Yong-ho, a minister of the North Korean Embassy in London, and his family to South Korea. Pyongyang blamed Thae's defection on South Korea’s ""anti-North Korean smear campaign."" North Korea has reportedly been seeking to dispatch agents to China or Southeast Asian countries as part of malicious operations against South Koreans. Sources said such signs have resurfaced following Thae's defection.","china about possible terrorist ,china warns against possible ,korea terror attacks abduction ,in china warns against ,against possible korea terror","['the south Korean Embassy', 'Beijing', 'South Koreans', 'China', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'China', 'North Korea', 'China', 'North Koreans']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.78615242 -0.00241117

Originally only sung in South Korea, it was popularized in the North after then-university student Lim Su-kyung’s controversial 1989 visit to the North.The song was sung during the landmark first inter-Korea Summit in 2000 by then-leaders of South and North Korea Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il, the father of Pyongyang’s incumbent leader. Sources said that North Korean citizens are having doubts about young Kim’s will toward reunification. Both governments have emphasized reunification as one of their main goals, each having a government branch devoted to the purpose.While the latest news puts the North’s resolve for unification under questions, reports have indicated that the citizen’s desire for reunification may be diminishing in the South as well.Last year’s survey by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University showed that 51 percent of the respondents said was unification was necessary, down 55.8 percent from the year before. Among 20-somethings and 30-somethings, just 30.7 percent and 36.2 percent saw the need for a united Korea.The report also showed an overall negative perception of the Kim regime, with 71.3 percent saying that negotiations with Pyongyang were unfeasible. By Yoon Min-sik","koreas has been banned ,bans popular unification anthem ,banned in north korea ,old popular korean song ,north korea radio free","['korean', 'Koreas', 'North Korea', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Kim Jong - un', 'Kim']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50289249  0.38565513

The victims were students from The University of Oxford having a summer retreat at a private villa.According to the Gyeonggi Yangpyeong Police, a speedboat carrying four students crashed into the pier on Saturday around 4:50 p.m. as it was making a sharp turn. Nine people on the pier were swept-up in the collision.  The deceased, Kim, 24, was one of the nine on the pier. He fell into the water during the chaotic crash unnoticed by his friends and drowned.The police presumed he was hit by one of the passengers who flew out from the boat from the impact. The group immediately reported the accident to the police but only belatedly realized Kim’s disappearance and reported him as missing. The police found Kim’s body near the pier on Sunday around 3:20 a.m.Kim is presumed to have lost consciousness in the fall, which made him unable to call for help.Seventeen Oxford students were staying at the villa in Yangpyeong belonging to one of the students’ father, who is reportedly a president at a Korean conglomerate. The accident occurred at a villaside pier along the Bukhan River in Seojong-myeon, Yangpyeong-gun.The police booked the motorboat operator Jeon, 55, on Tuesday under charges of professional negligence. Jeon reportedly told the police he made an honest misjudgment in calculating the angle of the boat’s turn. He is a certified motorboat operator with seven years’ experience.The police said neither Jeon nor the students were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident and said that they plan to pass Jeon’s case to the prosecutors for opinion on indictment.By Lim Jeong-yeo","yangpyeong motorboat accident killed ,motorboat knocks oxford student ,motorboat accident killed ,injured four on saturday ,in yangpyeong motorboat accident","['Yangpyeong', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'the University of Oxford', 'the Gyeonggi Yangpyeong Police', 'YTN']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.09313215  0.1616715

The cyberattacks consequently exposed passwords to the private accounts of 56 of the officials. The targets included officials working at the ministries of defense, foreign affairs and unification, as well as journalists covering the ministries and professors belonging to North Korea-related research institutes, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office said. Korea Internet and Security Agency officials check the joint measures system against cyberattacks aimed at private entities in June 2016. They said they confirmed the hackers utilized 27 phishing sites to lure officials into revealing their passwords. An investigation is underway to figure out whether any confidential information was leaked. “It is important to avoid using personal emails for work and to consistently change the password,” prosecutors said.Both the unification and foreign affairs ministries said the hacked email accounts were private and that the officials do not use the accounts for work.“North Korea must immediately halt such actions,” said a Unification Ministry official speaking on customary condition of anonymity. The South Korean government has been stepping up measures against cyberattacks such as by attempting to pass the Anti-Cyberterrorism Act, which is being pushed by the government but is opposed by opposition parties, citing excessive government control on citizens.","north korea latest hacking ,korea latest hacking ,korean hackers attempted ,korea latest hacking into ,north korean hackers attempted","['Seoul', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'north korean', 'south korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.46884525  0.57299721

They are presumed to have defected to the South, according to local residents of the island nation and the intelligence community. The defection, if true, may indicate that a growing number of North Koreans working in restaurants and companies set up by the communist country to earn hard currency abroad are defecting and seeking new lives in the South. Thirteen North Koreans working at a Pyongyang-run restaurant in the Chinese eastern port city of Ningbo defected to the South en masse in April.   ""I've heard one of the three defectors called his acquaintance  to say he  has entered the education program that helps him  get accustomed to life in the South,"" a Malta resident who keeps in contact with the defector said.

Meanwhile, the government of Malta has effectively deported some 20 North Korean workers amid international concern the regime in Pyongyang is abusing such workers to earn hard currency, government sources said.Malta is the first European Union nation to take such a measure.Sources said that Malta has sent North Korean workers back home in the form of denying an extension of their expiring visas. Under the measure, some 20 North Koreans, who had worked at construction sites and garment factories, have all returned to the North, according to the sources.Local construction firm Rite Mix and garment firm Leisure Clothing confirmed to Yonhap News Agency that all North Korean workers have left.An official of Rite Mix said that about 15 North Koreans had worked for the company, but all of them left en masse around late May. A Leisure Clothing official also said that the company is no longer hiring North Korean workers.Malta is considered having the closest relations with North Korea among EU members.A source said that there have been continued media reports in Malta that North Korea workers have been suffering from long working hours and other abuses while getting only one third of their wages with the rest sent to their government.Another diplomatic source said that it is meaningful in that Malta, even though it's the smallest country in the EU, has taken such a measure for the first time as a EU nation.

Radio Free Asia said the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances also requested the Pyongyang regime confirm whether the five North Korean defectors who were forcibly taken back to North from China and six people who were arrested in North Korea for their anti-state activities are still alive. According to RFA, the U.N. group asked the North to provide information about the fate of two other South Koreans who were kidnapped during the 1950-53 Korean War. The request comes as a South Korean politician said recently that North Korea is still holding more than 500 South Koreans abducted since the end of the Korean War in 1953, including 11 from a Korean Air Lines  passenger aircraft.On Dec. 11, 1969, 50 South Korean passengers and crew members were abducted when their YS-11 domestic flight that departed Gangneung for Gimpo was diverted to North Korea. A North Korean spy, named Cho Chang-hee, hijacked the airplane and forced the captain to fly to Pyongyang. With demands from international communities and South Korea, the North returned 39 passengers a year later through the cross-border village Panmunjom, minus seven passengers and four crewmembers.","korean plane crew kidnapped ,five north korean defectors ,fate of 14 abductees ,of 14 abductees including ,plane crew kidnapped 47","['the United Nations', 'North Korea', 'south korean', 'Radio Free Asia', 'the U.N.

The 57-year-old victim surnamed Baek was found unconscious 4 meters from the building exit after a six-hour rescue effort, according to the Seodaemun-gu Fire Department. Baek was taken to hospital but did not survive.  Seodaemun-gu Fire Department had deployed 175 rescue operators to save Baek. However, the operation only began after cutting off the electricity in the adjacent area. Baek was trapped under heavy debris which delayed work to free him, according to the fire department.  A three-story building in Hongeun-dong, Seodaemun-gu, collapsed around 2:05 p.m. on Monday while undergoing reconstruction work. That morning, three construction workers had worked on gutting the first floor bathroom.They were on standby for work in the afternoon when the building suddenly caved in. Workers Kim, 56, and Park, 46, survived the incident except for some abrasions. Surveillance camera footage of the moment the building collapsed was circulated by media.The clip showed a group of elementary school children gathered just next to the building seconds before it crashed. Seodaemun-gu Office has tentatively concluded the accident occurred due to an unauthorized alteration to the building’s core pillars. The police are investigating whether safety regulations were being properly observed at the construction site.If lax maintenance is found to be the reason behind the accident, those who are responsible will face legal action, the police said.By Lim Jeong-yeo","collapse construction worker died ,worker killed in seoul ,killed in seoul building ,construction worker killed in ,construction worker died in","['Seoul', 'Baek', 'Fire Department', 'Baek', 'YTN News', 'YouTube', 'Fire Department', 'Baek']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5157758   0.10112704

Such an act constitutes a serious offense in the country.In addition to photos, the Washington-based radio station said there was a considerable amount of material exulting the virtues of Kim Jong-un.""The first page of the English textbook published in mid-2013 has the script 'Let's Become True Sons and Daughters of Respected General Kim Jong-un!' in it,"" the report picked up in Seoul said.

Jennifer Dyrcz.In five days of fighting in the capital, President Salva Kiir's forces ousted those loyal to First Vice President Riek Machar, the former rebel leader in the country's recent civil war, from one of their bases.The fighting left hundreds dead in the capital, and aid workers said bodies remained in the streets. The U.S. Embassy in Juba said it was organizing flights to evacuate non-essential staff and for all U.S. citizens wishing to leave South Sudan. Commercial flights to Juba remained cancelled, though charter flights were evacuating hundreds of aid workers and other foreign citizens.The U.N. said 36,000 South Sudanese civilians have fled their homes due to the fighting.Some tried to reach neighboring Uganda by road, but an Associated Press reporter spoke to people who had been wounded in attacks by armed men as they tried to flee. Many cars had been shot at or burned. Government forces had erected roadblocks to demand money from those fleeing. Some people were sent back to Juba. In Juba, others took shelter in churches, U.N. bases and aid workers' compounds, but there were reports of government soldiers blocking aid workers from moving to areas where civilians need assistance.""There is hardly any food in the market, and people are starving. As a result, they are turning to coping mechanisms like looting to survive,'' said Jeremiah Young, policy adviser for World Vision. Relief workers should be given freedom of movement, said the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, Eugene Owusu.""We urgently call on all concerned to guarantee safe and unhindered access for humanitarian organizations to ensure that we are able to reach all people in need, including in locations hardest-hit by the fighting,'' he said.Meanwhile, fighting continued to spread to other parts of South Sudan. Shantal Persaud, the spokeswoman for the U.N. mission there, said it had received a report of small-arms fire in Leer town in Unity state Wednesday morning. The town is Machar's birthplace.","marines to south sudan ,sent 40 additional soldiers ,additional soldiers to south ,robberies by armed men ,soldiers to south sudan","['NAIROBI', 'Kenya', 'AP', 'U.S.', ""South Sudan 's"", 'Juba', 'american', 'South Sudanese', 'U.S.']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43828061  0.43579173

It also gives heart to small countries in Asia that have helplessly chafed at China's expansionism, backed by its military and economic power. “The Philippines strongly affirms its respect for this milestone decision as an important contribution to ongoing efforts in addressing disputes in the South China Sea,” Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said in Manila, calling on “all those concerned to exercise restraint and sobriety.”Former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who helped oversee the filing of the case, said the ruling underscored “our collective belief that right is might and that international law is the great equalizer among states.”Del Rosario stressed that it was important for the ruling to be accepted by all.“For the sake of maintaining international order, it is imperative that the Award and clarification of maritime entitlements be accepted by all relevant countries - without exception - so that we can work together on how remaining issues can be peacefully resolved,” he said.Six regional governments have overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, waters that are rich in fishing stocks and potential energy resources and where an estimated $5 trillion in global trade passes each year.The disputes have also increased friction between China and the United States, which has ramped up its military presence in the region as China has expanded its navy's reach farther offshore.White House spokesman Josh Earnest reacted to the ruling by encourage all parties to “acknowledge the final and binding nature of this tribunal.”Earnest spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as President Barack Obama was flying to Dallas.  He said the United States was not a claimant in the case and that it seeks a peaceful resolution to disputes and competing claims in the region, while preserving the U.S.'s ability engage in the freedom of navigation and commerce.Earnest said the White House sees the potential that the tribunal's ruling could aid in the resolution of the dispute in a way that doesn't further inflame the situation. He also urged the parties not to use the ruling as an opportunity to engage in escalatory or provocative actions.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the ruling is an opportunity for everyone in the region to act in a sensible way in accordance with the rule of law in order to settle disputes. Carter spoke at a news conference in Afghanistan where he was meeting with U.S. commanders. The U.S. State Department called on both parties to comply with their obligations, according to a statement from spokesman John Kirby. The United States has not taken sides in the South China Sea disputes but has worked to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in the region are maintained.The Philippines, under a U.N. treaty governing the seas, asked in 2013 for arbitration on a number of issues it had with treaty co-signee China.The five-member panel from the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands, unanimously concluded China had violated its obligations to refrain from aggravating the dispute while the settlement process was ongoing.It also found that China had interfered with Philippine petroleum exploration at Reed Bank, tried to stop fishing by Philippine vessels within the country's exclusive economic zone and failed to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone at Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal. China, which boycotted the entire proceedings, reiterated that it does not accept the panel's jurisdiction. China “solemnly declares that the award is null and void and has no binding force. China neither accepts nor recognizes it,” a statement from the foreign ministry said.It added that “China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by those awards.” The ministry repeated China's often-expressed stance that the Philippines' move to initiate arbitration without China's consent was in “bad faith” and in violation of international law. A professor of Asian political economy said the ruling could be a “transformative moment” in the region.Speaking outside the Peace Palace in The Hague, Leiden University professor Jonathan London said the decision will “give countries with a common interest in international norms something to point to and to rally around.”He said they can say to China: “Look, here are the results of an international organization that has found that your claims have zero historical basis.” Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said the tribunal's decision is “final and legally binding” and that the two sides should comply with it. He said in a statement that “Japan strongly expects that the parties' compliance with this award will eventually lead to the peaceful settlement of disputes in the South China Sea.”China considers bilateral talks with the other claimants the only way to address the South China Sea disputes.It has said vast areas of the South China Sea have been Chinese territory since ancient times and demarcated its modern claims with the so-called nine-dash line, a map that was submitted under the U.N. treaty. Manila brought the case to arbitration because China's claims infringe upon its own 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The tribunal said that any historical resource rights China may have had were wiped out if they are incompatible with exclusive economic zones established under the U.N. treaty, which both countries have signed.It also criticized China for building a large artificial island on Mischief Reef, saying it caused “permanent irreparable harm” to the coral reef ecosystem and permanently destroyed evidence of the natural conditions of the feature. Just before the panel announced its ruling, a busload of Chinese tourists arrived outside the court building in The Hague and joined a handful of other protesters in shouting down three people calling for China to leave Philippine waters. In Manila, dozens of rallying Filipinos jumped for joy, wept, embraced each other and waved Philippine flags after news of their victory. One held up a poster that said: “Philippine sovereignty, non-negotiable.”The aftermath of the ruling could be greatly influenced by new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who took office late last month and inherited a case filed by his predecessor. Duterte has spoken of having friendlier relations with China and said last week his government stood ready to talk to Beijing if it got a favorable ruling. It remains to be seen, however, how far Duterte can stray from Manila's previously critical stance, given his country's growing nationalist sentiment against China's actions.Vietnam, meanwhile Tuesday, accused Chinese vessels of sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat in disputed waters. Nguyen Thanh Hung, a local fisheries executive in the central province of Quang Ngai, said two Chinese vessels chased and sank the Vietnamese boat around midday Saturday as it was fishing near the Paracel islands. The five fishermen were rescued by another trawler around seven hours later.Vietnam's government welcomed the ruling in the Philippines' case.","tribunal rejects china expansive ,that destroyed coral reefs ,tribunal rejected china extensive ,hague tribunal rejects china ,rejected china extensive claims","['China', 'Philippines']",25,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.05402854 0.37112966 0.06491432],임정요,International,7,2016,"tribunal rejected china extensive claims ,international tribunal rejected china extensive ,prevent chinese fishermen from fishing ,helplessly chafed at china expansionism ,islands that destroyed coral reefs","['China', 'Philippines', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Philippines', 'philippine', 'Perfecto Yasay', 'Manila', 'Albert del Rosario', 'Rosario', 'Award', 'China', 'the United States', 'China', 'White House', 'Josh Earnest', 'Barack Obama', 'Dallas', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'the White House', 'U.S.', 'Ash Carter', 'Carter', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'the U.S. State Department', 'John Kirby', 'the United States', 'Philippines', 'U.N.', 'China', 'the Permanent Court of Arbitration', 'the Hague', 'Netherlands', 'China', 'China', 'philippine', 'Reed Bank', 'philippine', 'chinese', 'Philippines', 'Mischief Reef', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Philippines', 'China', 'asian', 'the Hague', 'Leiden University', 'Jonathan London', 'China', 'Japan', 'Fumio Kishida', 'Japan', 'chinese', 'U.N.', 'Manila', 'China', 'China', 'U.N.', 'China', 'chinese', 'the Hague', 'China', 'philippine', 'Manila', 'Filipinos', 'philippine', 'philippine', 'philippine', 'Rodrigo Duterte', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Manila', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'chinese', 'vietnamese', 'Nguyen Thanh Hung', 'Quang Ngai', 'chinese', 'vietnamese', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines']",3,[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.05402854 0.37112966 0.06491432]

Two officials from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety were also questioned as witnesses.Members attend the first meeting of the special parliamentary committee on the humidifier disinfectant case at the National Assembly on July 6. Prosecutors also added that it will specifically look into how the manufacturers and distributors of toxic humidifier disinfectants went through approvals by the related government institutions in the early 2000s. The prosecution had pressed charges last month against some 20 people -- mostly officials from Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, Lotte Mart, Home Plus and Cefu -- from companies related to the incident.The expanded probe into the government comes after the National Assembly endorsed last week a plan to conduct a parliamentary probe into the toxic humidifier disinfectant case.The plan was unanimously adopted Wednesday at the Assembly’s plenary session, permitting a special panel to carry out its own investigation for 90 days and to discuss how to compensate victims. The Justice Ministry and the prosecution were excluded from the subject list as the rival parties remained deadlocked over whether to include them.The prosecution earlier this year had stated it will not consider government institutions as the subject of investigation. They had said there was no legal basis to question whether the damages related to toxic humidifier disinfectant was due to the negligence of related ministries or officials who had conducted epidemiologic surveys of product safety.According to damage reports collected by the Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute under the Environment Ministry as of June 2016, at least 698 victims have lost their lives and 3,698 suffered from health damages since 2011. But civic groups have been claiming that the total number of victims is well above 200,000, due to the delayed response and insufficient action by the government.By Kim Da-sol","korean prosecution said monday ,month long investigation into ,prosecutors office said monday ,five month long investigation ,disinfectant case targeting government","['south korean', 'the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ’ Office']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.17928475  0.42471772

""There is a high possibility that the North's landmines can reach South Korean territory,"" a South Korean military official said.The North Korean military is also suspected of deliberately releasing some of the mines found so they can be washed away by torrential rains. This concern is causing the military to keep close tabs on North Korean activities, the source said.A South Korean man was killed in July 2010 when a wooden-boxed land mine he found in the Imjin River exploded. The river roughly flows along the boundary of the two Koreas. Land mines have also been found in the estuary region of the Han River and as far away as Gyodong Island between the two Koreas.North Korea is believed to have significantly increased the number of land mines it has planted in the Demilitarized Zone  that bisects the Korean Peninsula this year, other South Korean officials said. In August last year two South Korean soldiers were seriously injured by a land mine explosion at the DMZ that Seoul claim was planted by North Korea. Since April, the North has placed more than 4,000 new land mines in the DMZ, and 70 to 80 percent of them are believed to be wooden-box land mines which are hard to detect using conventional mine detecting gear, according to the officials.Millions of land mines have been buried on the divided peninsula during the 1950-53 Korean War and afterwards, particularly in the DMZ.The two Koreas still remain technically at war since the three-year war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.","korean landmines washed up ,counted 259 landmines that ,north korean landmines washed ,260 washed up landmines ,it counted 259 landmines","['south korean', 'north korean', 'inter - korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.67609048  0.36444864

They stayed at an airport for the past six months awaiting the decision. The Incheon Administrative Court ordered the Justice Ministry to allow the asylum seekers to apply for refugee status in the country, saying depriving applicants of the chance to claim asylum should only be made in exceptional cases. A total of 28 Syrian asylum seekers filed a lawsuit against the Justice Ministry to fight the immigration office’s rejection. The first 19 asylum seekers won the rights to enter the country last Friday. The Justice Ministry had cited that the Syrians had no clear reason to seek asylum in the country and that they flew to Korea via what it saw as safe countries, such as China or Turkey.But refugee rights activists here accused the immigration office of abusing its authority to bar asylum seekers without fair reasons.Asylum seekers stay at a deportation room at Incheon International Airport. From July 2013 to 2015, 119 people out of 393 seeking asylum at the port of entry were not referred to the refugee determination procedures, according to data obtained by refugee rights groups.With the court proceedings now underway, the Syrians have stayed at a facility in the international transit zone, which is designed only for short-term stays, since they separately arrived at the Incheon International Airport beginning in late November. Under the Refugee Act that came into force in 2013, all asylum seekers are allowed to apply for refugee status at a port of entry, unlike in the past when those arriving without a legitimate visa were simply repatriated to their countries of origin.The immigration office has up to seven days to decide whether to refer asylum seekers to the legal refugee application procedures. The Refugee Act stipulates the immigration office’s authority to deny entry of asylum applicants who come from countries without fear of persecution, submitted forged documents or has clear intention to abuse the system. Asylum seekers who are denied entrance need to either return to their home countries or fight the immigration office’s decision while living in the deportation room. The Justice Ministry, for its part, has claimed it needs to prescreen refugee applicants to distinguish between genuine refugees and economic migrants abusing the refugee system to extend their stay and earn money by acquiring a legitimate work permit.“It is difficult to process refugee applications because there is a growing number of applications who apply for refugee status only to extend their stay after illegally staying in Korea,” Ha Yong-gook, an official from the Justice Ministry said at a forum on the Refugee Act held at Sangmyung University on Thursday.Hosted by the Justice Ministry and UNHCR, the forum was held to mark three years since the Refugee Act took effect.“As the act does not limit the number of refugee applications per person and it allows them to stay in the country during the process, it has been abused to give migrants chances to get a job and extend their stay.” According to the Justice Ministry, 42 percent of the 5,611 asylum seekers in 2015 applied for refugee status after illegally staying in the country, while 9 percent did so right before their Employment Permit System visa expired and 6 percent did so after facing deportation.Since South Korea started receiving refugee applications in 1994, it has accepted 503 cases out of a total of 15,250 asylum applications, putting the refugee acceptance rate at 3.7 percent.According to testimonies of asylum seekers staying long-term at the airport, the deportation rooms have no beds or windows, with only one shower each for men and women. They are served three meals a day -- a burger and canned drink. They are allegedly allowed to go for a walk occasionally through the duty-free store. Some of the long-term residents reportedly had fallen ill due to sleep deprivation, poor quality of food and sanitary conditions.“Once asylum seekers are refused, it takes four to six months to fight the decision at court. When the government makes an appeal, it takes even longer,” said Lee-il, a human rights lawyer for Advocate for Public Interest Law. “Even when the court rules in favor of the deportees, it takes months until they are allowed into the country. They then need to wait for several years until the court decides whether they are entitled to refugee status.” “Given the reality that the immigration office’s rejection of asylum seekers’ entry results in long-term detainment and human rights violation, the Refugee Act should work to at least give refugee applicants opportunities to go through a legal process.”Judge Kim Seong-soo from the Seoul Central District Court in the forum pointed to the legal limbo faced by the asylum seekers.  “By law, the immigration office refuses to accept  refugee applicants into the country. But the rejection does not lead to deportations, which leaves those denied to stay at the deportation room long-term,” the judge said.  By Ock Hyun-ju","nine syrian asylum seekers ,korean court ruled thursday ,refugee status south korean ,syrians at airport win ,of nine syrian asylum","['south korean', 'syrian', 'the Incheon Administrative Court', 'the Justice Ministry']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.32165736  0.17697798

The Lawyers for a Democratic Society, or Minbyun, requested the Seoul Central District Court decide on the legitimacy of the state intelligence agency's protection of defectors who fled a North Korean-run restaurant in China with a male manager in April. The lawyers have asked the National Intelligence Service  to allow them to meet the restaurant workers to clarify Pyongyang's claim that they were kidnapped by Seoul.The defectors organization said the lawyers also defamed the South Korean government by being sympathetic to the North's claim. Free North Korea Radio, which leads the association on the issue, denounced the lawyers for infringing upon the defectors' human rights by asking them to appear in court despite their unwillingness to attend the hearing. ""The lawyers' action could further pose threats to the defectors' families back in the North,"" said Kim Seong-min, chief of the Seoul-based broadcaster.The court hearing, meanwhile, has been put on hold as the lawyers group asked the judge to be replaced, raising questions over the fairness of the legal procedures.","korean defectors said thursday ,12 north korean waitresses ,korean waitresses who defected ,20 north korean defectors ,north korean waitresses who","['north korean', 'Seoul', 'north Korean', 'north korean', ""the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office""]",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38788611  1.06652534

82,82,82,Dispute boils over court hearing on defectors,"About two months after fleeing their oppressive homeland, 12 former workers of a North Korean restaurant in China on Tuesday faced a legal debate over the legitimacy of their stay here under state protection.

The Seoul Central District Court opened a hearing to review a request by the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, better known as Minbyun, to determine whether the 12 had defected on their own free will and thus whether the government’s current holding of them is lawful. The liberal lawyers’ association has lodged a petition for habeas corpus, raising the need to clear a flurry of questions surrounding the mass exodus, after securing power of attorney from the exiles’ families via a U.S. national residing in China. The Unification Ministry’s unprecedented announcement of the defection, made just days ahead of the April 13 general election, stoked rumors that the National Intelligence Service had orchestrated the escape with a political intention, and that some of them were on the run without even knowing their destination. Pyongyang also claims that the new arrivals were “lured and kidnapped” by South Korean agents and demands their repatriation. The spy agency has declined the association’s appeal to meet with them at their shelter, saying the restaurant servers had volunteered to come.  Yet controversy is simmering as the court issued a summons to the 12 people, fueling concerns over their safety and that of their family members left behind in the North. Park Young-sik, an attorney recommended by the Korean Bar Association to represent the NIS, said in a recent media interview that he carried out one-on-one interviews with the 12 on May 14, during which none of them agreed to meet with Minbyun members or expressed their wish to return to their home country.   During the hearing, Park reiterated that the defectors will never actually have to show up at the court, given the safety concerns, and that the judge gave a consent to such a method, the lawyers said. But Minbyun attorneys argue that the refugees’ identities and backgrounds including the location of their onetime workplace have already been exposed following the government’s announcement. With the defectors being absent, the hearing ended some two hours later. Minbyun filed a petition for recusal, taking issue with the judge’s changed stance on summoning the defectors and his ban on any audio or written recording. They claimed such regulations violated public trial rules. “The justice changed his mind and said he would make his ruling today without listening to the restaurant workers,” Minbyun attorney Chae Hee-joon told reporters after the session.  “That means his verdict would solely reflect what the NIS says, despite their families’ different claims, which we believe could not make a legitimate trial.” The proceedings will be on hold until the local court conducts a review on Minbyun’s application.  In another development, the NIS has decided to have the group remain in their current residence instead of sending them to Hanawon resettlement center, a Unification Ministry official said, citing the special nature of their getaway, safety jitters and Pyongyang’s ongoing propaganda offensive against them. The agency had taken similar steps in past cases involving high-profile fugitives. Members of Lawyers for a Democratic Society speak with reporters at the Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday. Government officials regretted Minbyun’s move and the judiciary’s decision, arguing the defectors cannot be subject to habeas corpus relief because their stay at its protective facility is guaranteed by the North Korean Refugee Protection and Settlement Support Act. “The whole point is to define what the government did right or wrong, which is important and I understand that, but there are lots of unnecessary problems in the way  is doing it especially in terms of the defectors’ involvement,” the ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. “The process is taking place within an established framework, but I’m not sure if the judiciary can interfere with the administration’s work like this.” Ruling party officials and defector and conservative groups took a harder line, accusing the progressive association of only bolstering the Kim Jong-un regime’s logic while “criminalizing” Seoul’s efforts to embrace North Korean asylum-seekers and improve human rights in the communist country. The North has recently been staging a media blitz, releasing interviews with the defectors’ families and letters it claims to have been written by them, some of which called South Korean authorities “barbarian” captors.“If the defectors’ identities and testimonies are made public, their remaining families could be in great danger,” ruling Saenuri Party floor leader Rep. Chung Jin-suk said during a meeting at the National Assembly earlier in the day. “The defectors had risked their lives on their own free will to come here. Minbyun, which calls for putting them on the stand, is being manipulated by North Korea. … What kind of country are those lawyers from?”A constitution study group within the Saenuri, led by Assembly deputy speaker Rep. Shim Jae-cheol, also issued a statement Tuesday criticizing Minbyun and calling on the judiciary to reconsider its request for the defectors to appear in the court.

The vessel in question n Indonesian navigator filed a report to the vessel's operator in Busan after the incident took place.The two alleged culprits, both aged 32, are known to have been overpowered by the other fishermen aboard the 138-ton vessel and have been locked up, according to the Coast Guard.A total of 18 fishermen, including three South Koreans, seven Vietnamese and eight Indonesians, were on the boat, according to the authorities. Authorities said the vessel is now being navigated by a 50-year-old South Korean sailor, identified only by his surname Lee, and should reach the Seychelles in about four days.  The sailor told Yonhap News Agency via satellite telephone that the two suspects were good workers who had not complained much and not expressed any dissatisfaction with working conditions. He suspected that the incident might have taken place after they drank liquor given to the crew by the captain for a job well done, and as the ship was heading for new fishing grounds. He said that he suffered minor injuries while disarming the two culprits. The South Korean Coast Guard said it is planning to dispatch its officials to the island country for further investigation.South Korea's foreign ministry said that it will seek cooperation from the Coast Guard and local authorities in investigating the suspects, and carry out other necessary judicial procedures when the vessel arrives at the Seychelles.","fishermen kill korean captain ,vietnamese fishermen kill korean ,fishermen kill korean ,ocean killed south korean ,vietnamese fishermen kill","['vietnamese', 'south korean', 'the Coast Guard', 'Yang', 'Kang']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.37590438  0.40072858

The subjected companies include Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, Lotte Mart, Home Plus and Cefu. A boy with an oxygen tank enters a meeting with Oxy Reckitt Benckiser Korea to discuss compensation measures at a hotel in southern Seoul, Saturday. YonhapFor Oxy, formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea since 2014 and responsible for the largest number of damage claims, its former CEO Shin Hyun-woo has been arrested for allegedly developing and selling the product in question without due safety precautions. Another former CEO, John Lee, has been indicted without physical detention.Lotte Mart’s former sales director Noh Byung-yong was arrested and is being grilled with other Lotte Mart officials for selling private brand sterilizers based on the Oxy products without proper safety tests. Homeplus officials including former purchasing chief Kim Won-hee have also been arrested on similar allegations.The prosecution arrested Butterfly Effect’s CEO, who has been revealed to have made Cefu based largely on information he gathered from the Internet.Prosecutors have summarily indicted Oxy and Butterfly Effect for 150 million won in fine. The prosecution, however, was unable to summon officials at Oxy’s parent company in Britain suspected to be related to the deadly incident. The officials plan to investigate them through an emailed questionnaire.Investigators also stopped short of pinpointing which government officials are responsible for failure to recognize the safety hazards posed by the Oxy products until 2011. Oxy held a closed-door meeting with the victims and their families on Saturday to explain their compensation plans for government-assessed class 1 and 2 victims. The 530 victims who registered themselves as victims have been classified from classes 1 through 4, with class 1 denoting the strongest connection. Oxy CEO Ata Safdar vowed to pay 150 million won to bereaved families and those who were definitely harmed by the company’s products, and 100 million won to the rest of the 178 class 1 or 2 victims.He also vowed to spend a portion of the company’s 10 billion won humanitarian funds on victims who do not belong to class 1 and 2.But the victims and their families have expressed discontent with what they claim are inadequate plans, which they said looked to cover only the people the government assessed to be highly likely to have directly suffered from Oxy’s toxic humidifier disinfectant. One participant said Oxy was vague on how it will compensate a case in which all members of a family have been harmed by their product.“Choosing to hold a conversation only with those in class 1 and 2 appears to be an insult not only to the victims, but to the entire population of the Korean consumers,” said Gang Chan-ho, the spokesman for the victims and families.By Yoon Min-sik","month investigation into toxic ,end south korean prosecutors ,five month investigation into ,south korean prosecutors will ,the five month investigation","['south korean', 'Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.53751439  0.53526098

It was the first time Chinese boats were captured in the area since the South Korean military kicked off its crackdown last Friday. The Coast Guard said it is interrogating 14 crew members of the 35-ton boats and plans to arrest the two captains, aged 45 and 37, respectively, and four other senior crew members. The remaining eight members will be booked without physical detention. The latest seizure is a continuation of Seoul's joint operation with the United Nations Command launched to deal once and for all with Chinese boats fishing without permission in the tense border area.The military issued verbal warnings to disperse the boats but took action when they did not leave the area, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Tuesday. It said the crew strongly resisted and even threw fishing equipment at the troops.The crew said they departed from a port of Donggang near the Sino-North Korean border in early April and entered the estuary in early June, according to authorities.Still, local authorities are carrying out their probe based on the possibility that the boats started their illegal fishing activities from April onwards.The development comes after Seoul reported a growing number of Chinese fishing boats trespassing into the military buffer zone as blue crab season went into full swing. The intrusions have fueled security concerns over the closely monitored front-line region.Besides crabs, the no man's land where the Han River meets the Yellow Sea is a rich fishing zone that had been left largely untouched since the 1950-53 Korean War.","crew over illegal fishing ,police captured the boats ,over illegal fishing incheon ,illegal fishing incheon yonhap ,illegal fishing incheon","['INCHEON', ""South Korea 's"", 'Coast Guard', 'chinese', 'the Coast Guard']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3608616  -0.01871741

Korean Air makes parts for military jets.The network, developed by a private firm, allows its operators to remotely control computers en bloc. Over 160 major companies and government organizations use the system, police said. Among some 42,608 documents suspected to have been compromised, the design map of the wing of the U.S. F-15 fighter jet and photos of parts of a medium altitude unmanned surveillance vehicle were included, police said.Still, no major information which could pose a direct threat to South Korea's security was included, according to police.The Internet Protocol address -- the online equivalent of a street address -- that launched the attack was traced to Pyongyang, police said, wrapping up their months-long investigation. It was identical to the one that launched attacks against local media and financial organizations in March 2013.Police said they began the probe after receiving tips on malicious code suspected to have been distributed by the North in February.North Korea has a track record of waging cyberattacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has consistently denied any involvement.""North Korea seems to be engaged in some sort of long-term preparation to launch a nationwide cyberattack ,"" a police officer said.

The North's consent is also required for South Koreans to travel to the communist nation.""As they violated the law on inter-Korean exchanges, the government has slapped fines worth less than 2 million won  each on the seven people,"" said a government official.In Shenyang, the South and North's groups agreed to hold a joint event this month to mark the 16th anniversary of the inter-Korean summit in the North's border city of Kaesong.They also decided to host a jointly-arranged celebration for the 71st anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule in August in Seoul.The ministry said it also rejected the group's bid to visit Kaesong for the summit event slated for Wednesday.A summit between then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader Kim Jong-un, was held in Pyongyang on June 15, 2000. It produced a landmark joint declaration that outlines inter-Korean reconciliation and economic cooperation.The unification ministry said that North Korea's nuclear weapons program poses a ""grave"" threat to peace on the divided peninsula, calling on Pyongyang to give up its nuke arsenal.""North Korea's move to develop nuclear weapons is to hurt the spirit of cross-border agreements,"" it said in a statement. ""The North should suspend its reckless provocations and abandon its nuclear weapons program so as to change for the better.""South Korea has suspended almost all inter-Korean civilian exchanges and has not allowed South Koreans to visit North Korea after the latest nuke test in January.The two Koreas are still technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.","koreans fined for unauthorized ,china last month officials ,koreans in china last ,korea has imposed fines ,koreans fined for","['South Korea', 'North Koreans', 'China', 'north korean', 'Shenyang', 'inter - korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48649299  0.57224739

An estimated 50,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, along with their supporters, turned up at Seoul Plaza to demonstrate their pride and fight homophobia under the slogan “Queer I Am.”  Participants march through central Seoul at the Pride Parade, waving rainbow-colored fans and flags, Saturday. The slogan embodies the organizing committee’s determination to stay the way they are, despite prevailing hatred and discrimination against sexual minorities in society.“I am so proud of being gay, being myself,” Han Beom-yong, 18, told The Korea Herald in excitement as he participated in the festivities. “I am just so happy! I can finally feel free as most of the people here don’t care about my sexuality!” “My only wish is that people would respect sexual minorities and accept us as human beings without prejudice,” the student said, adding that he could not come out to his parents in fear that the revelation might damage the relationship with his family. “But anyhow my mother would have to accept it. I was born this way, which I never regret.”Participants march through central Seoul at the Pride Parade, waving rainbow-colored fans and flags, Saturday. Following a two-hour opening event for this year’s Queer Cultural Festival, participants marched 2.9 kilometers following seven decorated trucks, dancing to the music blaring from the trucks and waving rainbow-colored flags and fans. Some same-sex couples were seen displaying affection in public. Two women put arms around each others' shoulders marching through central Seoul at the Pride Parade, Saturday. Rain poured at times in the afternoon, but did not stop participants from enjoying the festival and parading through Seoul. Goo Soo-hyun, a 21-year-old university student, came all the way up from Daejeon with her lesbian friend to attend the parade. “I have always been afraid of being discriminated against for being a lesbian. But here, among all this crowd, I can feel proud of being myself.”The big day for local LGBT community came nearly three weeks after the Seoul Western District Court dismissed a petition filed by gay filmmaker Kim Jho Gwang-soo and his partner Kim Sung-hwan seeking legal status for their same-sex marriage. The couple openly tied the knot in 2013. The court stated in the ruling that a separate legislative step is needed because marriage by law should be seen as a union between a man and woman who can give birth to sustain society. Goo, who came out of the closet two years ago, slammed the recent court’s ruling against same-sex marriage. “Social awareness of the LGBT community is growing, but the country still has a long way to go,” she said. “I hope that the country can someday accept same-sex marriage, with more and more sexual minorities coming out and asking their marriage to be legally recognized.”An anti-homosexuality protestors hold up a placard reading ""Homosexuality is sin. Return to Jesus"" at the Pride Parade held in central Seoul, Saturday. The participants often confronted antigay campaigners who stood on the sidewalks of major streets shouting at marchers and holding placards reading “Homosexuality! Your children are in danger” in Korean or “Homosexuality is Sin. Return to Jesus” in English, but the revelers mostly kept their smiles, cheered and clapped in the faces of their opponents. An organization of parents of sexual minorities hold up placards reading ""Son, I love you the way you are"" before beginning to parade at the Pride Parade held in central Seoul, Saturday. “I came here to support my lesbian daughter,” said mother of film director Lee Young, waiting in a line to join the parade. “I always thought of homosexuality as someone else’s story, not mine, so I felt uncomfortable when she came out 10 years ago. But nothing changes the fact that she is my daughter, who has never disappointed me in any way, who never did anything to be blamed for.”Participants look around the booths set up by human rights organizations, embassies and global companies in support of sexual minorities at the Queer Festival held at Seoul Plaza, central Seoul, Saturday. The nine-day Queer Cultural Festival kicked off at 11 a.m., with more than 100 human rights groups, political parties, embassies from 14 countries and global companies having set up their booths to campaign for equal rights for sexual minorities, as well as to sell food items and goods.  “As a bisexual person, living in this country sometimes feels dangerous. I heard of homophobic attacks last year on some of my friends, so sometimes I just feel like I can‘t show my pride around certain places,” said Jacqueline Carrillo, a 30-year-old English teacher from the United States. “The festival was just truly amazing and the energy inside it was just so full of love and positivity.”“But protestors made us feel uncomfortable with their peering eyes,” she said, lamenting that an antigay protestor spit on her face over the fence in front of City Hall while she was selling drinks at the booth for LGBTQIA and Allies of Korea.Anti-homosexuality protestors hold up placards reading “The United Nations and U.S. President Barack Obama must stop intervening in the country’s affairs through ruinous recommendations for a legalization of homosexuality” or “Encouraging homosexuality spreads aids and increases taxes.” On the other side of the festivities, hundreds of anti-LGBT campaigners, mostly right-wing and Protestant groups, staged protests against the Queer Festival at three locations surrounding the Seoul Plaza. The majority of them signified their opposition to homosexuality, collectively praying while wailing and singing religious songs.Asking participants to “repent,” they held up placards reading “Anti-discrimination Act Out, Islam Out” or “Homosexuality is neither genetic, nor human rights” in front of the booth set up to collect signatures for a petition to outlaw homosexuality in Korea. Some even condemned Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon for permitting the festival organizing committee to host the event and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for advocating sexual minorities. Anti-homosexuality protestors hold up placards reading ""Homosexuality out, Islam out"" and ""Homosexuality is not human rights Some 4000 police officers were stationed around the plaza and along the parade route to separate LGBT advocates from their opponents. No major clashes were reported.“I think that homosexuality goes against the order created by God and thus has negative impact on society. Not only are LGBT people unable to reproduce but they also cause tax burden on society,” said Jang Dong-nam, a 30-year-old graduate school student and member of the opposing crowd. “The LGBT community should not be allowed to host this kind of festival, make noises and create ruckus in central Seoul.”But some Protestant churches opposed the antigay movement and stood in solidarity with the LGBT community. Kim Jeong Woong-Ki, a church-goer, holds up a placard reading ""Queer I Am, Jesus, I am here"" at the Pride Parade held in central Seoul, Saturday. “I am enjoying the festival with my gay friends. The festival is a lot bigger than last year, with more people and performances,” said Kim Jeong Woong-Ki, a freelancer in his 40s.As a protestant himself, Kim said that he was “ashamed” by the churchgoers protesting against sexual minorities, describing them as being full of hatred.“I believe that Jesus taught us to respect others and coexist together in society just like a rainbow.”A 32-year-old office worker, who only wanted to be identified by his surname Jung, said he had dropped by the event out of curiosity and had been scared by the unfamiliar scene. “But as I spent some time here looking at these people, I got used to it and started to enjoy the whole thing. Putting aside my personal feelings, I think all people should be entitled to being who they are.” As the performance of a pro-LGBT church choir announced the opening event at 2 p.m., spectators erupted in cheers and waved rainbow-colored fans in the sweltering heat. A variety of performances by LGBT musical bands and dance teams followed. An opening ceremony for this year's Queer Cultural Festival is held at Seoul Plaza in central Seoul, Saturday. Kang Myeong-jin, head of the event organizing committee, said in an opening speech that hosting the event at Seoul Plaza carries a greater meaning in that the LGBT community can freely communicate with Korean citizens and talk about diversity. Last year’s pride parade, which had the slogan “Queer Revolution,” drew 30,000 citizens to the heart of Seoul, hitting record high attendance numbers that were easily topped this year. The annual event first took place in Seoul in 2000, when it was located in Daehangno.The Queer Festival will last until June 19, with a couple of photo exhibitions taking place in Seoul. Nearly 60 films from 23 countries will be featured in the Korea Queer Film Festival from June 16-19 at Lotte Cinema in Sinsa-dong, southern Seoul.

According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, Chinese authorities arrested an unidentified North Korean citizen in Dandong, a border city in Liaoning Province next to North Korea. They reportedly arrested the North Korean in the middle of the night and seized 30 million Chinese yuan  and gold bars that were in his house. The authorities have yet to disclose the exact charges brought against the man, but sources expect that they are related to smuggling banned substances that are listed in the United Nations sanctions. According to the report, the agent has been living in Dandong for a few years and was called an ""executive director,"" and ""state representative"" among North Korean traders. The arrest was made just a few days after Ri Su-yong, the vice chairman of the North's ruling Workers' Party, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and returned to Pyongyang on June 2. The Yomiuri said that China's rare arrest of a suspected North Korean agent hints at Beijing's pressure on Pyongyang to give up its nuclear programs.  The arrest was reported to the North Korean Embassy and an official from Pyongyang departed for China to resolve the case, but it is not confirmed whether the North Korean man has been released from jail at this moment, the newspaper reported.","korean for smuggling charges ,month for smuggling charges ,smuggling charges chinese authorities ,north korean for smuggling ,for smuggling charges chinese","['chinese', 'north korean', 'japanese', 'the Yomiuri Shimbun', 'chinese', 'north korean', 'Dandong', 'Liaoning Province', 'North Korea']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27300557  0.44786012

Daegu is the hometown of the president, as well as a political stronghold for the conservative Saenuri Party.The Busan mayor had been considered a ranking pro-Park figure, until his city’s interests conflicted with that of other Yeongnam cities over the given issue.This theory that the pro-Park group had pulled strings, gained credibility during the campaigns for the April 13 general election, when a number of Yeongnam-based lawmakers made rosy promises to their voters on the airport construction.“I believe that President Park has a number of gift packages ready for Daegu,” said Rep. Cho Won-jin in his Daegu constituency back in March.“The southern airport construction project should make progress, of course.”According to Busan, the inland city of Miryang is less qualified for a large-scale airport due to the surrounding mountains, but that this factor was not included in the ADPi-led evaluation report.Local environmental civic groups spoke in favor of Busan’s claim by denouncing the Miryang airport scenario.“Miryang’s Hanam area is only 4-5 kilometers away from the Hwapo wetland, an important natural habitat for migratory birds,” said a group of South Gyeongsang environmental organizations in a joint statement late last month.“Building an airport there may cause frequent clashes between migrating birds and airplanes, especially during hibernating seasons.”But those in support of Miryang remained relatively reserved on the issue, calling for Busan advocators to wait for the final evaluation report and submit to the decision.“ should humbly accept the result of the  evaluation, which was initiated upon the consensus of all five local governments,” said Rep. Choung Tae-ok, a Daegu-based lawmaker of the Saenuri Party, in a radio interview Thursday.He thereby blamed Busan Mayor Suh’s earlier remarks as “political pressure,” reflecting the city’s anxiety of losing to Miryang.But despite the majority Saenuri sentiment apparently tilted towards Miryang, the ruling party is also forced to pay attention to Busan, which has recently been showing signs of switching its longtime support for the conservative party to the more progressive opposition camp.In the April 13 general election, the Saenuri Party lost six constituencies there, five to The Minjoo Party of Korea and one to an independent candidate. This change of political sentiment has led to concerns that the city may turn further away from it in the 2017 presidential election.Moon Jae-in, former chairman of The Minjoo Party of Korea, asks questions to Busan City officials during his visit to Gadeokdo Island, one of the candidate sites for a new airport to be built in the southeastern part of the country. YonhapThe Minjoo Party has also grown vocal on the issue, seeking to play a role in guarding the airport project for Busan.“The selection of the airport site should be based on fair, objective, and transparent rules,” said Moon Jae-in, the former chairman and top-ranking presidential potential of the party, during his visit to Gadeokdo Island on Thursday.As a former Busan lawmaker, Moon has received steady support in Busan and the nearby Gimhae, the hometown of the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, for whom he had served as chief of staff.“Even Mayor Suh, a key pro-Park figure, raised doubts about the appraisal process, to which the government should respond with proper explanation and full exposure of the relevant data.”But Rep. Kim Boo-kyum, a rare Minjoo figure to be elected in Daegu, expressed disapproval over Busan’s fierce resistance, claiming the city should respect the evaluation report as earlier agreed.The state-led airport plan was initiated in 2011, amid growing concerns on the lack of air transport infrastructure in the southern part of the country, but was scrapped in its early stages due to low commercial viability.The idea was, however, revived in the following year, as then-presidential candidate Park Geun-hye included it among her campaign pledges.Gimhae Airport, the only airport in the vicinity, has long exceeded its full capacity in terms of passengers and runways. According to the Land Ministry data, the number of passengers at Gimhae Airport reached 5.9 million in 2015, up 22.3 percent from the previous year, while its yearly capacity stands at 5.4 million.By Bae Hyun-jung","feuds over 10 trillion ,10 trillion won airport ,yeongnam feuds over 10 ,won airport site tension ,yeongnam feuds over","['Saenuri Party', 'Yeongnam', 'the Ministry of ...']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53793317  0.24858238

Police said the emails, which were disguised as if they were sent from local broadcasters, seem to be part of a propaganda campaign by the North.In the following month, more emails, pretending to be from a police officer, were sent to 48 people, including North Korean defectors and Pyongyang experts, asking for cooperation in the investigation of the fake video clip. Police said the emails contained viruses that could have infected the recipients' computers. In mid-January, a third email pretending to be from a South Korean expert on Pyongyang was sent to 83 people, including several local reporters.No damage has yet been reported due to this series of cyberattacks, the NPA said.

A group of academics, lawyers and human rights specialists at the Leiden Asia Center within Leiden University in the Netherlands has been delving into the practice of North Korean forced labor within the EU since last December. According to its preliminary findings, between 400 and 800 North Koreans are currently employed by at least 32 Polish firms, ranging from construction to shipbuilding. They work more than 12 hours a day, six days a week, while receiving “significantly lower wages” than their local counterparts, the report said.  A shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, where dozens of North Korean workers are employed. “This is if they even receive their wage at all. Mostly, managers collect the wages and workers in turn receive only a minimal livelihood allowance,” the report said. Some of the companies were found to have received financial support from the European Regional Development Fund, which was bankrolled by the 28-nation bloc and overseen by the European Commission, thus potentially “indirectly benefiting” the Kim Jong-un regime, it noted. North Korean workers’ payslip credit Among the firms are shipbuilders Crist and Nauta, which took out a 37.5 million-euro  loan and sold two-year bonds worth around 40 million euros, respectively, as part of the ERD program in November 2009. The corporations may then be subject to U.N. sanctions imposed in March, which calls for an asset freeze of any person or entity “engaging in, facilitating or being responsible for the exportation of workers” from the North. During an inspection in 2013, the Polish National Labour Inspectorate discovered that 29 North Koreans were working illegally at Crist’s shipyard. They were employed by Armex, a local recruiter that provides North Korean laborers to a number of Polish organizations, a practice that also violates Polish employment law. But the inspectorate concluded after further investigation that the North Korean workers are self-employed and thus outside of its jurisdiction. “In a situation with obvious insufficient control mechanisms, local employers continue to hire North Korean workers who work under extremely exploitative conditions,” the report said.“My fear is that what we have uncovered so far is just the tip of the iceberg,” Remco Breuker, a Korean studies professor at the school who led the research, said in a statement, noting that its complete report is expected to be published in early July. “We now want to examine whether the North Koreans move from one EU country to another to work there under some kind of lease system.”For the cash-strapped regime, overseas labor exports have long been a rare, coveted source of hard currency. A 2015 survey by the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea human rights alleged that more than 50,000 North Koreans are working abroad, pulling in collective annual incomes of between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion. Poland is deemed a major labor destination, having issued more than 430 work permits every year on average to North Koreans over the last six years, according to data from the Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Policy. The tally could be much higher if illegal laborers are taken into account. In its own research paper unveiled last December, the Seoul-based Database Center for North Korean Human Rights projected that some 800 North Koreans work across the European country.

Michele Nicoletti, a member of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, led the efforts.The lower house believes North Korea may be extorting salaries from its overseas-based athletes to evade international sanctions, imposed to cripple Pyongyang's economy following its recent missile launch and nuclear test.The lower house argued that North Korea typically takes about 70 percent of the wages earned by its labor workers overseas and the money is used to bankroll government activities, and that young North Korean football players may be no exception.Youth footballers from North Korea may be receiving anywhere between 50,000 euros and 100,000 euros  in signing bonus, according to the lower house. It called on both the Italian foreign ministry and labor ministry to study Choe's contract closely and make sure the player, not the North Korean government, is being properly paid.In March, Choe became the first North Korean to play in Italy at any level. Choe had an impressive run for the North Korean side at the 2014 Asian Football Confederation U-16 Championship in Bangkok. He scored the go-ahead goal to defeat South Korea 2-1 in the final. Choe turned more heads at the FIFA U-17 World Cup last year in Chile, where North Korea reached the round of 16.The secretary-general for the North Korean Football Association reportedly visited Italy to discuss terms of Choe's contract with Fiorentina.More Italian clubs are said to be taking interest in teenage North Korean players, including goalkeeper Ri Chol-song, and forwards Jong Chang-bom and Han Kwang-song.

A ministry official also agreed, saying, “Brokers are usually involved in any defections and they have control of the information network and means of their transportation so that they do not report to the government each time. Our diplomatic mission was also not aware of the latest report.”The revelation came about one month after the fleeing of a group of 13 servers of a North Korean bistro in the northeastern city of Ningbo. Observers have noted that their relatively high social status, minimum middle-class background and overseas experience likely allowed them easier access to South Korean culture and outside information while Pyongyang’s isolation is deepening in the face of tightening international sanctions.

In a taped conversation with Choi, he argued that the chemicals used in Butterflyeffect’s brand Cefu -- one of the sterilizers blamed for the deaths since 2011 -- were from China.Cefu was sold from 2009 to 2011 through online malls often used by mothers. It was advertised as an “environmentally friendly product from Denmark.” Victims and members of civic groups hold a rally in front of the Danish Parliament on Monday, local time. The brand is blamed for 14 deaths and health problems among 41 more people who reported side effects from its use to the government in 2014. “I’m 99 percent sure that the company got its ingredients from China,” said Damgaard. But he could not specify the name of the company. Butterflyeffect is no longer in business and the prosecution has sought an arrest warrant for its former head.“ was not PGH, but PHMG,” he added. This goes against what the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified in 2011 regarding the list of chemicals contained in Cefu. PGH is a powerful sterilizing agent compared to other chemicals. Denmark has officially banned the use of PGH and PHMG for industrial or agricultural use since 2012, after a warning from the World Health Organization.As of 2016, KeTox has no production facilities in Denmark, as the firm went bankrupt in 2012 and closed down last year.Choi of ACCEH called for a thorough probe into KeTox’s claims and other allegations linked to international companies.“About 68 percent of victims who died from humidifier sterilizers were known to have used products from European manufacturers such as Reckitt Benckiser and Tesco in U.K. and KeTox in Denmark,” Choi said.“The prosecution should, as soon as possible, start an international probe into these firms and summon related officials from Denmark and China,” added Choi.By Kim Da-sol","company butterflyeffect has denied ,danish firm denies link ,danish company denied any ,denied any business deals ,the danish company denied","['danish', 'KeTox', 'PGH', 'korean', 'danish', 'Butterflyeffect', 'Denmark', 'Choi Ye - yong', 'the Asian Citizen ’s Center for En']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39375806  0.71707571

The student, aged 18, had suffered an extreme case of depression due to dissatisfaction with her looks. She had even attempted suicide.  In 2014, while attending a school in North America, she briefly visited Busan, Korea, accompanied by her parents for nose and eye cosmetic surgeries. They left the country after explicitly asking the hospital not to use her photos. However, in March 2015 when they returned to the hospital for a touch-up procedure, they found before-and-after images of her eyes in the hospital’s promotional leaflet. They said that although the photo only showed her eyes, it was easy to identify. The student and her parents pressed charges to the Busan Police, claiming the hospital had taken the photos saying it would only be used for internal evaluation and for educational records. She had never agreed to their commercial use. The head surgeon of the hospital explained that there had been a misunderstanding on the hospital’s part due to the absence of paper work that clarified the Japanese student’s aversion to exposure.He said the hospital had so far only used photos of patients who gave permission, and that the photos never left the hospital premises as they were only printed in internal leaflets. The leaflets have now all been destroyed and the hospital is trying to reach a settlement with the patient.According to the Korean medical law, exposing a patient’s medical information without permission is a criminal act that is punishable by a prison term of maximum three years or a fine of maximum 10 million won .

Initially, they were returning pretty much all of the North Koreans who went through China that they captured. A week or two ago, 13 North Koreans who were working at a restaurant in China, they ended up in South Korea,"" King said.""Now it's hard to believe that in a state like China, that could have happened if the Chinese had not wanted that to happen. I think the Chinese are conflicted and I think the Chinese have relations with South Korea that are important to them and I think they're increasingly frustrated with the North Koreans,"" he said.King said that the international community should continue to put pressure on China to ""recognize the refugees who are leaving North Korea and fleeing through China, which is the only way for them to leave, and to allow them to go to South Korea if that's where they want to go.""King also said that despite presidential elections in the U.S. this November and South Korea next year, there won't be any change in the importance both countries attach to the North's human rights problem.""We can't find our Congress able to confirm a Supreme Court justice or even vote on a Supreme Court justice, we find great difficulty in dealing with budgets and other important issues, but when the House and the Senate considered legislation on North Korea earlier this year, it passed the Senate unanimously and there were only two votes against it in the House,"" he said.King also noted the recent passage in South Korea of the human rights law.

Officials of the two retailers said they would consider the proposal positively.""If Oxy creates a team that handles compensation matters, we will communicate with it,"" an official from Lotte Mart said. ""Since it has stated its official stance, we expect to be able to make contact.""""What we are concerned with is that the victims will not accept our compensation offer. The key is how we can set a standard that is fair,"" he said.An official at Homeplus said his company will favorably review Oxy's proposal when it is formally received. ""Because there are victims who have used different products, we hope to actively cooperate with related parties and compensate them in an orderly way.""Both of the retail chains have started operating an internal team for victim compensation comprised of senior executives as well as medical and law professionals and civic group members.Nearly 100 deaths have been blamed on chemicals used in humidifier sterilizers. Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, a British consumer goods firm, started selling its products in Korea in 2001, followed by local companies. It wasn't until 2011 that the products were taken off the shelves after mysterious deaths from lung complications were linked to the sterilizers. Oxy is accused of causing the greatest harm. South Korean government estimates say that of the 530 victims, 220 had used only Oxy products, while 184 had used both Oxy and other brands. Seventy of the deaths are believed to have been from using Oxy products. Civic groups say the extent of the harm is much larger.Victims instantly rejected the Oxy CEO's apology and said they will sue not just the Korean branch of the firm but the British main office. A boycott of the company's products, including bleachers, dehumidifiers and household cleaners that were popular among local consumers, has been growing, with mounting suspicions that the company knew of the health risks of the sterilizers but kept selling them.A rough tally from retailers showed the sale of Oxy's dehumidifiers dropped 53 percent in the April 18-May 1 period from the same time last year. Bleacher sales were down 38 percent, according to the tally.""The outcry of parents blaming themselves for the deaths of their children  isn't just someone else's story,"" a housewife who said she had been a frequent buyer of Oxy products, said.

The quake was the biggest to hit the country since 1979, when a temblor killed some 600 people and injured around 20,000.Yoo will pay for all costs needed to produce, transport and install the four works out of his own pocket. The two sets of ""The Greeting Man"" will be installed facing each other in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito, with the two sets of ""The Mirror Man,"" a sculpture of a giant man, will be erected face-to-face with fingers touching in the neighboring city of Cayambe. He hoped that ""The Mirror Man"" sculptures will serve ""as a symbol that puts together the southern and northern hemispheres of the global village in the country which lies smack in the middle of the equator."" He added that the statues will hopefully contribute to the friendship and goodwill between South Korea and Ecuador.The sculptures are expected to be shipped from the port of Busan in August and installed in the latter part of this year.Yoo and the Ecuadorian authorities are planning the artwork dedication for either Oct. 5, the anniversary of the establishment of Seoul-Quito diplomatic ties, or Dec. 6, the founding day of the Ecuadorian capital.He said he is greatly honored to be able to install his work in Ecuador, adding he will continue ""The Greeting Man"" installation project in the latter part of this year, with the next venue possibly in Brazil.","korean sculptor to donate ,korean sculptor said friday ,ecuador south korean sculptor ,recent earthquake the donation ,sculptor to donate work","['south korean', 'korean', 'Ecuador', 'central american', 'Yoo Young - ho']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.20826943  0.14938617

The number totals 14 when counting another child looked for in the first round of searches conducted earlier this year, who remains unaccounted for.The Education Ministry, police and Welfare Ministry have been conducting a nationwide search for the missing children this year amid escalating child abuse concerns. In a second round of government searches from February to early April this year, officials sought to trace the whereabouts of some 2,900 elementary and middle school students who were either unadmitted to school or absent for over a week.Of the 2,900 children, police found signs of child abuse among 376 children based on reports from police and children welfare centers. Of those 376, the ministry confirmed 35 of them to be clear cases of child abuse. Another seven cases are still under investigation and 12 are unaccounted for, officials said. The remaining children were found to have left the country or switched to homeschooling. The ministry also widened the searches in the second round to preschoolers. The officials looked into 810 preschool children who did not have any medical checkup history or vaccination records. The government said they found two infants living in poor environments, and one unaccounted for. During the meeting, Education Minister Lee Jun-sik vowed to push for enacting a charter of children’s rights to better protect the children. Education Minister Lee Jun-sik speaks during a ministerial meeting in Sejong City on Monday. “To fundamentally ensure the happiness of the children, our society should have a higher level of public awareness of children’s rights.

The members stayed at rented homes on Jejudo Island. A female member would contact the Korean men over smartphone dating applications and invite them to a video chat where she induced them to perform pornographic acts. She feigned she could not hear their voice and had them download malware, through which she stole private information as well as their personal contact list. The male members of the group then blackmailed the men, threatening to pass the videos on to their family and friends.On the sidelines, the group also arranged for fake paid dates with advance payments they took without providing the service, and were found to be involved in countless swindle cases regarding job introductions and loans.The police said the group together conned a collective 500 million won  out of more than 320 people.

The South took the step after Pyongyang tested its fourth nuclear device on Jan. 6 and fired a long-range rocket on Feb. 7.    The North countered the South's move by declaring it will kick out the South Korean companies and confiscate all assets left behind by these businesses. It said the complex will be turned into a military zone.Launched in late 2004, the complex merged South Korean capital with cheap North Korean labor. Kaesong lies some 10 kilometers north of the DMZ in North Korea but is connected by a road to the South. An emergency committee of the 120 companies ordered out of Kaesong had called for government compensation for fixed assets and manufacturing equipment left behind by using the inter-Korea economic cooperation insurance scheme. They have also asked for some sort of settlement for finished products and manufacturing materials they were not able to bring out.These businesses claimed that the value of finished goods and materials left behind stood at 246.4 billion won .After receiving damage reports from the companies, the government is now at the stage of verifying the actual losses, the official said.""Based on the findings, we will support those who experienced 'direct and unavoidable damages' based on reasonable standards and principles that can be accepted by our people, within the boundary of our budgets,"" the official said.The government is planning to announce the measures regarding the companies next month with an aim to normalize those companies within this year.Seoul has so far provided some 150 billion won in insurance coverage to Kaesong companies that had paid premiums in the past, with each firm getting a maximum of 7 billion won.Though those who left finished products and raw materials in Kaesong were not covered by insurance, as none of the companies had insurance contracts signed, they will be partly compensated based on the government's policy to support those who had ""direct and unavoidable damages.""","south korean companies instead ,korean companies instead of ,korea government is pushing ,behind by south korean ,korean companies instead","[""South Korea 's"", 'inter - korean Kaesong Industrial Complex', 'south korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.94868016  0.43533275

Officials of state-run railway operator KORAIL perform rescues and restorations Friday at the scene of a passenger train derailment around Yulchon Station in Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. The accident left one dead and eight injured. Of 27 passengers and crew members, a 53-year-old engineer surnamed Yang was killed in the crash. The other engineer and seven passengers sustained minor injuries. According to the regional railroad police, the Mugunghwa train was excessively speeding when it switched tracks and entered a curved section, allegedly traveling at 127 kilometers per hour when asked to operate at below 50 kilometers per hour.The train, which had departed Seoul at 10:45 p.m. on the previous day, is suspected of speeding under pressure to arrive in time at Yeosu Station.Police are looking into the train’s black box and two-way radio communications for any possible misconduct or violation of safety rules. During questioning, an official at the controller and the train‘s second engineer gave conflicting statements, authorities said. While the official claimed to have ordered the engineer to slow down before reaching Yulchon station, the latter rebutted that he was told to lower the speed at the next stop. The train operations, which were suspended in Yeosu and nearby Suncheon areas, will resume early Saturday morning.KORAIL dispatched some 200 staff members to restore the rails and hired charter buses to transport passengers during the recovery work, which could take up to 20 hours.The day‘s accident was the latest in a series of train derailments this year. A freight train went off the tracks near Sintanjin Station in Daejeon last month, triggering worries over the state-run rail agency’s lack of safety measures.According to statistics by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority, South Korea has seen an average of 3.5 trail derailment cases annually since 2001.By Ock Hyun-ju","korean passenger train derailed ,train derailed early friday ,dead injured in train ,train derailment south korean ,passenger train derailed early","['south korean', 'Yeosu', 'South Jeolla Province', 'Seoul', 'Yeosu', 'the Korea']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.21810018  0.15429957

Tatsuya Kato, former Seoul bureau chief for Japanese right-wing daily Sankei Shimbun, on March 18 demanded financial compensation to cover legal costs and transport fees incurred while standing trial in Korea. Tatsuya Kato Under the country’s criminal law, the wrongly accused, whose charges are cleared in court, can demand the government pay compensation for their financial damage and mental stress. The accused can pursue the rights within five years of the ruling. Kato was indicted in October 2014 for defaming Park with an online article published in August 2014. In the article, Kato reported rumors that the unmarried president might have been absent for seven hours to secretly meet her former aide Jeong Yun-hoe at the time of the sinking of Sewol ferry on April 16. The rumors garnered public attention as the Park administration was blamed for the delayed and botched rescue operation during the ferry disaster. The nation’s worst maritime accident killed 304 people, most of whom were teenagers on a school trip.Kato cited press freedom in a democratic society and said that he had only cited rumors circulating online. Prosecutors had argued that Kato had intended to libel Park and made little effort to verify the facts. The lowest court acquitted him of the defamation charge last December, citing the freedom of speech to criticize the nation’s leader under the Constitution. The acquittal was confirmed as the prosecutors did not appeal.","defaming south korean president ,files suit against korea ,government japanese reporter cleared ,last year filed criminal ,reporter files suit against","['japanese', 'south korean', 'Park Geun - hye', 'Tatsuya Kato', 'Seoul', 'japanese', 'Sankei Shimbun', 'Korea', 'Tatsuya Kato']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.22237743  0.4265317

A herb picker found the body last Wednesday and the police have investigated the case targeting people who were acquainted with the victim, a 22-year-old Chinese who entered the country on Oct. 7, 2015 and overstayed her visa-free period in order to work.The police had circulated this leaflet to verify the victim's identity. “Since it has not been long since the victim’s  status in Korea turned illegal, we assumed the perpetrator would be someone who already knew her,” the police said.The arrested suspect, according to the police, “had raised suspicions in terms of his relationship with the deceased.” He had often met with the victim at the place she worked, and stayed in touch with her through January, shortly before the suspected time of her disappearance. The suspect fiercely denies the accusations, and searches of his car and house revealed nothing out of the ordinary. Police will continue to investigate the people who knew the woman and who introduced her to her job. The young victim was found dead with six wounds to her chest and neck from a sharp object. Although the police are having difficulties discerning the exact time of her death, they estimate that she died no earlier than late January, as the owner of a nearby barley field had sown this year’s seeds in December and January without noticing the body.

It is rare for North Koreans to defect in such a large group.""This appears to be an example indicating that such incidents may continue if the North Korean regime continues to make the wrong choices, such as its development of nuclear weapons,"" he said in an address at a meeting of the Korea-Russia Dialogue's coordinating committee.Seoul has claimed the defections show that recent U.N. and bilateral sanctions against the North are having an effect as the South's unilateral measures included a call on its citizens abroad to refrain from visiting North Korean restaurants that generate income for the Pyongyang regime. The sanctions were adopted in response to North Korea's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February.Yun said he hopes the Korean Peninsula will see the same ""wind of change"" seen in the lifting of sanctions on Iran, the normalization of ties between U.S. and Cuba and the launch of a democratically elected government in Myanmar.The minister also stressed the importance of Russia's role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.""We will place importance on cooperation with Russia as much as cooperation with the U.S., Japan and China,"" he said, adding that he plans to visit Moscow within the year.The minister pledged Seoul's best efforts to develop ties with Russia despite various political and economic challenges, such as low oil prices.The Korea-Russia Dialogue was launched under the initiative of the two countries' then presidents following the September 2008 summit meeting.It is a private-public forum made up of six subcommittees that seek to bolster ties in culture, politics, trade, science and other areas.","last week mass defection ,four days after seoul ,13 north korean employees ,north koreans to defect ,run restaurant in china","['Yun Byung - se', 'north korean', 'China', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang', 'China', 'North Koreans']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66545767  0.40159455

""It is difficult to believe that the 13 people carrying North Korean passports were able to move out of China without the Chinese authorities' knowledge,"" the source said on the condition of anonymity.Some observers said that given that the mass defection took place in a short period of time, some help from the Chinese authorities might have been inevitable. The North Korean workers at the restaurant reportedly disappeared early last week and arrived in the South on Thursday.  Others, however, said that China did not need to offer any ""diplomatically risky"" assistance to the defectors since they all held legitimate passports, with which they could purchase flight tickets and leave China without any legal problems.Citing diplomatic concerns, the Seoul government has refused to confirm whether the restaurant where the 13 defectors worked was located in China. The defection came as Beijing has vowed to fully enforce international sanctions that the U.N. Security Council  adopted early last month to punish Pyongyang's latest provocations -- a move that the North said is tantamount to succumbing to America's political pressure.The sanctions include the mandatory inspection of all cargo going in and out of the North and a ban on the North's export of coal, iron and other mineral resources, a crucial source of hard currency for the impoverished country.The North's overseas restaurants have also been cited as an important source of revenue. As part of its standalone sanctions on the North, the South has recently called on its tourists to refrain from using North Korean overseas restaurants.  Pyongyang is known to operate some 130 restaurants in 12 countries, including China, Russia, Myanmar and Vietnam, as well as Hong Kong, raking in huge sums of money annually. Nearly 100 of the restaurants are in China.","restaurant in china speculation ,masse defection last week ,speculation grows over china ,run restaurant in china ,of 13 north koreans","['North Koreans', 'China', 'Beijing', 'South Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Beijing']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.70596313  0.65703148

They want social consequences as well.Many are posting online appeals to boycott all products of MPK Group. They claim Jung's behavior must have stemmed from his belief that he is better than others.""These are worshippers of gold who firmly believe that money gives them power to do anything they want. These are people who treat all others as their slaves,"" an online user named Lee Jeong-pyo wrote in an online post, urging people to boycott MPK pizza chains.The very pizza chain owners under MPK Group are backing up the accusation, suggesting the very group itself also behaves and operates in an exploitive way.In a protest rally held March 15, franchise owners of the group accused the company of overcharging its supplies to chain stores, claiming that cheese supplied by the group and its contracted suppliers was at least 30 percent more expensive than the market price.They also claimed one of two contracted cheese suppliers was run by Jung's relatives, apparently offering a reason for the high price. In a separate case, Lee Hae-wook, vice chairman of engineering and construction giant Daelim Industrial, also came under public criticism for reportedly assaulting and abusing his personal drivers.Lee is accused of ordering his drivers not to check the side-view mirrors on vehicles and hitting their heads from behind if they have trouble driving.The 48-year-old businessman and a grandson of the company founder has repeatedly apologized for the incident, also promising to pay due compensation to those who have suffered.Still, a civic organization has filed a formal complaint with the prosecution Tuesday against Jung and Lee.""We decided to file a complaint as they have deprived people of their basic rights and disdained them while also undermining their dignity and honor,"" an organization official said.In late 2015, Kim Man-sik, honorary chairman of Monggo Foods Co., a soy sauce maker based in Changwon, southern South Korea, quit his company post and issued a public apology after reports surfaced that he had habitually assaulted and abused his driver.The labor ministry later found the reports true through a special investigation.","owners sparks public uproar ,boycott some south korean ,arrogant behavior of business ,inhumane treatment of their ,south korean business owners",['south korean'],25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.50226486  0.20988736

Pena Nieto told Park, ""Me cae bien,"" meaning I like you. He also introduced Park to his wife as the South Korean president who can speak Spanish.In 2014, she surprised Pope Francis during his visit to South Korea by saying, ""La paz es un regalo que merece la pena,"" meaning, ""Peace is a gift which is worth the effort"" in English.She also said her favorite Spanish phrase is, ""La esperanza es lo ultimo que se pierde,"" meaning that hope is something one holds onto until the very last moment. The pope answered by saying that hope is a gift, according to their conversation posted on the website of South Korea's Foreign Ministry.In 2013, Park delivered a 20-minute speech in French during her trip to France in a gesture of friendship. The speech drew a standing ovation.Park studied in France for half a year at the age of 22. In 1974, she was called back to Korea to serve as a stand-in first lady after her mother was killed by a pro-North Korean gunman from Japan in a failed assassination attempt on her father, President Park Chung-hee.She has studied not just French but English, Chinese and Spanish as well.When she visited Washington in 2013, she delivered the entire address at a joint session of Congress in English. During a visit to Beijing in 2013, she gave part of her address at a college in Chinese.","spanish south korean president ,meeting with her mexican ,presidential palace in mexico ,south korean president park ,mexicans with spanish south","['south korean', 'Park Geun', 'spanish', 'mexican', 'Enrique Pena Nieto', 'Mexico City']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -1.05806005  0.41335812

Korea has been on alert after two Chinese nationals and a Vietnamese transfer passenger sneaked into the country without being noticed by immigration officials or airport security guards.  Currently, there are 1.9 million foreign nationals in Korea, accounting for 3.7 percent of the entire population. The Justice Ministry claimed that 11.3 percent of the total foreign population was here illegally. The government will also revise the Employment Permit System to prevent migrant workers from illegally staying in the country after their contracts expire. Under the EPS, Korea selectively receives migrant workers from countries in Southeast Asia and Central Asia who work in labor-intensive firms. The revised EPS will give more authority to Labor Ministry officials to report migrants who breach visa conditions. It will also ramp up screening of foreign applicants before issuing visas and accept temporary workers who can work in the country for up to 90 days in the agricultural sector. The rate of illegal residence in Korea by country of citizenship will be taken into account when the government sets country quotas for incoming workers under the EPS. The government also plans to help immigrants better integrate into society by expanding services aimed at foreign nationals and raise awareness of cultural diversity, it said. It will offer free legal counselling in various languages for migrant workers and increase the number of multicultural schools. For the overall plan to manage the foreign population, the government assigned 67.76 billion won -- a 3.1 percent decrease from before -- for 1,227 projects.

A team of retrievers then fished out the floating cargoes.  The smugglers carried the goods from Yantai, China  to Incheon, Korea  The police became aware of the group when the smugglers purchased a high-end speed boat worth 45 million won  with undeclared money. The mastermind behind the act was a 34-year-old man, who said the idea had come to him after seeing a passing ferry while fishing. He thought that trading on the black market would be more lucrative than his original job at a construction company. The man recruited two neighborhood acquaintances, aged 39 and 54, and put them in charge of loading and retrieving cargo. The rest of the gang were recruited with a day-pay of 200,000 won  to 300,000 won. The loading team, led by the 39-year-old accomplice, took the cargo ferry traveling from Yantai, China, to Pyeongtaek harbor near Incheon, Korea, three times a week. Each time, the group smuggled in 30 to 40 boxes of luxury goods bought for a cheaper price in China and at Korean duty-free stores at airport departure halls.  The Incheon Customs authorities inspect the smuggled goods. Up to mid-March, the smugglers brought in 30 bars of gold, each weighing 1 kilogram, 380 kilograms of deer antlers, 220,000 tablets of Viagra and 17,500 packets of duty-free Korean cigarettes. Incheon Customs had tracked down the group from the speed boat purchase. It arrested the three leaders of the criminal group and 18 accomplices with the help of the National Intelligence Service.  The Customs intends to tighten monitoring by strengthening ties with the ocean police and relevant authorities and by frequently sending out special investigation teams.

Money sent can be used to buy goods on the open market.An official of South Korea's intelligence service said that they are presently confirming the validity of the report.According to other sources, North Koreans living near the border with China are known to use Chinese cell phones and USIM chips after they purchase them in black markets. Such phones can be used to make calls outside the country.","sting operation to arrest ,arrested by security forces ,koreans using mobile phones ,operation to arrest people ,been arrested by security","['North Korea', 'South Koreans', 'China', 'north korean', ""Workers ' Party""]",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16218954  0.08555894

He has since sent 5,708 balloons to the North carrying materials criticizing the reclusive regime between 2009 and 2013. One balloon usually contains tens of thousands of leaflets.A North Korean defectors’ group Fighters for Free North Korea dispatch leaflets condemning Pyongyang’s nuclear test inside giant balloons from Paju, Gyeonggi Province, on Saturday. The government has stopped Lee from sending the balloons from residential areas since 2007. It has also dispatched military and police to prevent North Korea’s retaliatory attacks. On Oct. 10, 2014, the North fired antiaircraft machine guns at one of Lee’s balloons, prompting a brief skirmish between the two Koreas. Propaganda war has been a common form of confrontation between the two Koreas, with both sides launching propaganda materials across the border or turning on loudspeaker broadcasts slamming each other. Lee filed a lawsuit claiming the sending of leaflets constitutes freedom of expression. The court rulings, however, sided with the government’s measure as necessary to protect the safety of the general public.The first ruling, for instance, said the location from which the balloons are sent is inevitably exposed to risks and threats.Lee also claimed that the vinyl balloons are usually sent at night, making it difficult for the North to detect. The second ruling, however, said that the number and size of the propaganda balloons as well as the frequency of its distribution make it vulnerable to North Korea’s detection and that the action has causal link with the North’s provocation. The top court upheld these previous rulings.","government stopped him from ,north korean defector filed ,banning distribution of propaganda ,government to ban distribution ,59 north korean defector","['the Supreme Court', 'North Korea', 'Lee Man - bok', 'north korean', 'Lee']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08214504  0.11822946

Amid warm welcome from government officials and U.N. agencies, they set foot for the first time in the country that they would now can call home.The 22 Burmese people, who had spent a decade at a refugee camp in Thailand, were the first batch of refugees relocated in Korea as part of the U.N.-led refugee resettlement program. Under its independent Refugee Act, Korea joined the scheme in 2013 to share the international responsibility to protect the forcibly displaced. Park Mi-hyung, head of the International Organization for Migration’s Seoul Office, said that witnessing the arrival of the refugees was truly moving, as it meant that yearlong efforts by her team, the Justice Ministry and refugee aid groups were finally paying off. “The IOM’s job was to prepare refugees in Myanmar to be ready for relocation by checking their health conditions and teaching them about Korea, Korean culture and its language,” Park said in an interview with The Korea Herald at her office in central Seoul.While the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees selects refugees to be resettled in a third country, the IOM focuses on preparing them to be safely transported and relocated.“They safely arrived. Now, what is more important is to help the first group of resettlement refugees quickly adapt to life in Korea to continue the momentum,” said Park, who took office in 2013 after working for an international relief group for five years in Africa. “For example, the Korean way of education does not work for refugees. When giving language training to them at refugee support center, the process needs to become more participatory so that they can be engaged in classes,” she said in reference to one of the policy recommendations her team had suggested to Korean authorities. “When they acquire the language ability, they are able to work. When they are able to work, they can stand on their own feet. That way, they can naturally be assimilated into Korean society,” she said. “For rapid integration, I suggest that the government give refugees more chances to go outside the refugee help center, interact with locals, look for jobs and prepare for their own lives.” The IOM was founded in 1951 to assist in the resettlement of Europeans displaced in the aftermath of World War II. It took the lead in promoting humane migration, curbing human trafficking, resettling refugees and providing humanitarian assistance. Korea became a member of the organization in 1988.The importance of IOM’s efforts has been highlighted more than ever in recent years, with millions of people fleeing war-stricken countries and humanitarian crises in Africa and the Middle East. According to U.N. data, there were 244 million people living outside their country of birth in 2015, the highest figure ever recorded and an increase of 71 million people since 2000. The IOM reported that a total of 5,411 migrants were dead or missing on migratory routes in 2015, with 3,770 of them having died while crossing the Mediterranean.The IOM’s Korea office opened in 2007 on the back of the rising number of migrant workers here. It raises funds for intergovernmental organization's various projects. One of its main tasks is also to broaden awareness toward migrants through events and seminars. One worrying phenomenon is rising negative sentiments among the public toward asylum seekers and migrants here and abroad, said Park. This has been made worse by the prolonged economic slump and series of terrorist attacks overseas, most recently in Brussels. “It is easy to blame refugees and migrants for problems we are facing in difficult times,” Park said. “The whole humanity seems to be going backward. Wrong information is shared in the media, which gives rise to extremists and creates the wrong assumption that refugees cause harm to countries.”A recent poll by Gallup Korea on 1,500 Koreans showed that they are somewhat hostile to foreign workers who settle here. Fifty-four percent of the respondents viewed foreign workers’ migration here as “bad,” much higher than the average of 39 percent across 69 countries. Currently, the number of migrants in the nation stands at 1.79 million.“The assumption leads to negative public opinion, which prompts lawmakers to draw policies reducing room for safe and legal migration,” she said. “The lack of legal pathway drives migrants into the hands of smugglers and traffickers.” Park also pointed out that the refugee application process should help to identify and protect refugees and not focus on screening out and deporting them. “It should be more inclusive than exclusive,” she said. “If there are many people abusing the refugee system to extend their stay here, the Korean government might have to rethink its immigration and labor policies.”Park said that migrants and refugees are not a burden to society. They can contribute a great deal to an advanced country like South Korea, both economically and socially. “We first need to invest, but once they are integrated well, they can be hardworking citizens filling jobs left vacant by locals in the face of the shrinking population and low fertility rate,” she said. “Also, they bring diversity to the society. Isn’t that what a creative economy is about?”According to the International Monetary Fund, the influx of refugees into Europe is likely to spur economic growth in the short term. If refugees are well integrated into the job market in the long term, gross domestic product could be 0.25 percent higher for the EU as a whole by 2020, the IMF estimated. “It is already a globalized world. It is an irreversible flow that people move around the world and get mixed,” she said. “What I can say for sure is that fences and walls cannot stop people from moving.”“If so, wouldn’t it be better for Korea to take advantage of the influx of migrants and proactively adopt policies to embrace and integrate them into society?” she said. “It is our loss if we do it too late.”By Ock Hyun-ju","refugees relocated in korea ,four burmese families finally ,korea major airport looking ,first batch of refugees ,south korea major airport","['burmese', 'South Korea ’s', 'U.N.', 'burmese', 'Thailand', 'Korea']",25,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.42270389  0.37078887

But the prosecutors added a charge of perjury, which led the court to additionally hand down the suspended six-month prison term. The 28-year-old man from Liberia and 32-year-old woman from Russia, who were in a relationship, conspired with a Ukrainian woman to swindle a Korean man via social media.  The Ukrainian woman first seduced the Korean man with her photo on a social network site in February last year. She pretended to be stuck in Ukraine and claimed she was trying to escape to Korea with her sister. She said that her parents had been killed by rebel army in a civil war in her homeland. She asked the man to lend his name and personal information to her so that she could issue a cashier’s check to receive $6 million in inheritance left by her deceased parents. The Korean man sent her a photo copy of his driver’s license. She then asked the man to meet with the Russian and Liberian in Seoul to help her leave Ukraine.The Liberian, who posed as a broker, threatened the Korean, asking for $30,000 to rescue the Ukrainian. The Russian woman, who pretended to be the Ukrainian’s aunt, urged the Korean man to pay the broker the ransom. The fraud case eventually came to light after the Korean man, frightened by the fact that his lover was being held hostage, reported the case to the police. The court handed down a six-month prison term to both the Russian and Liberian, saying that they had exploited the man’s compassion and his interest in foreigners to extract money. With additional evidence indicating that they had committed perjury, they were sentenced to four more months in jail, suspended for a year, according to the court.","russian liberian jailed for ,six months for fraud ,jailed for swindling korean ,four months in prison ,liberian jailed for swindling","['russian', 'Liberian', 'korean', 'Liberia', 'Russia']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.48535213  0.15542512

There is no official report on the rulings from the North's state media.The North's Korean Central News Agency  earlier said that the student entered North Korea nominally for tourism, though his real intention was to undermine North Korea's unity under the U.S. government's approval and control.Warmbier told a press conference in Pyongyang on Feb. 29 that he stole a political sign that had promoted ""the Korean people's love for their system"" from the hotel.The KCNA said he had confessed to his ""severe"" crime and asked for forgiveness.In early March, the United Nations Security Council imposed tougher sanctions against North Korea following Pyongyang's nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.Experts said the North has used detained Americans as leverage to force the U.S. to open bilateral talks with it.In 2014, Pyongyang released three detained Americans -- Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Fowle.Lim Hyeon-soo, a Korean-Canadian pastor, has also been held in captivity in the North since he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission in January 2015.In December, the North's highest court sentenced Lim to life in prison, citing his ""subversive plots"" against the North's regime.","korea sentences detained student ,court sentenced detained student ,university student was arrested ,north korea sentences detained ,korea highest court sentenced","[""North Korea 's"", 'U.S.', 'Otto Warmbier', 'U.S.']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17291379  0.07679649

The RV technology conventionally depends on the compound of the ballistic missile, corrosion  and terminal phase homing technology, which can all be confirmed through a test launch,” he said. The North has yet to conduct a test launch of its ICBM KN-08 missile.Earlier in the day, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said that his troops will test-fire a ballistic missile that can be armed with a nuclear warhead “in the near future.” He also vowed that there will be a nuclear warhead detonation test. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  looks at a device presumed to be a warhead of a ballistic rocket in this photo released by North Korea’s Rodong newspaper on Tuesday. The North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency reported that Kim had attended an atmospheric reentry simulation of a ballistic missile. It claimed that the test affirmed that the ballistic rockets are able to withstand five times the heat and pressure expected to occur upon reentry. Kim had claimed that his country now has the capacity to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to be mounted onto a ballistic missile. The Defense Ministry has also denied this. Pyongyang has been stepping up threats since the U.N. passed earlier in the month the strongest set of sanctions against it in decades, as punitive action against its Jan. 6 nuclear testing and Feb. 7 long-range missile launch.South Korea’s Defense Ministry told the National Assembly early Tuesday that the North is currently conducting military drills aimed at destroying key facilities in the capital. The hermit kingdom on Saturday had warned that it will conduct what it called a “Seoul liberation plan” as a preemptive attack against the South. North Korea has vowed an “all-out” attack in response to the annual Seoul-Washington joint military drills. The ministry also said that the military is on alert for further provocations from the North, which may involve the North sending drones, causing skirmishes along the border, firing missiles, GPS jamming or carrying out terrorist activities. Local experts have said that the North may carry out an ICBM testing in the near future, although it is unlikely the test-launch will actually carry a nuclear warhead. A multiple-staged demonstration of a nuclear warhead detonation and an ICBM launch is possible, they added. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the local think tank at Sejong Institute, said there is high probability of the North pushing ahead with a long-range rocket test and a nuclear testing to add credibility to its claims. He speculated that it may occur before the convention of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party in May.U.K.-based institute IHS Jane’s had said that the North’s actions may stave off mounting pressure from the surrounding countries. In light of rising inter-Korea tensions, the U.S. has deployed its high-powered strategic assets in the peninsula including a nuclear-powered supercarrier John C.

The security breach has also led to the leak of the phone numbers of other senior South Korean officials.The NIS did not identify any officials whose smartphones were compromised.The latest cyberattacks came amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula following Pyongyang's nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year. South Korea and the U.S. began the largest-ever annual military drill on Monday in the latest show of force against North Korea. In response, North Korea threatened to counter with a preemptive attack.The hacking attacks also came as President Park Geun-hye has called on the parliament to endorse a bill meant to prevent cyber terrorism.The NIS asked the relevant ministries to maintain readiness to cope with North Korea's cyberattacks, noting it has detected signs that North Korea could be preparing a massive cyberattack.The NIS also said it confirmed last month that North Korean hackers controlled the internal computer network of a South Korean firm whose security software is used by more than 20 million South Koreans for financial transactions on the Internet.The security breach could potentially pose a threat to South Koreans who rely on the Internet for banking and credit card transactions.Still, the NIS said no ordinary South Koreans were affected and that joint security measures were taken with the company to deal with the attack. It said the damage was restricted to the company's server.It then said North Korean hackers made a failed attempt to steal the email accounts and passwords of employees related to South Korea's rail operator in January and February.Last year, North Korea turned 60,000 computers into zombies, which could be used for its cyberattacks. In January alone, North Korea is believed to be in control of about 10,000 ""zombie computers"" in more than 120 countries, according to the NIS.North Korea -- which has thousands of cyberwarfare personnel -- has a track record of waging cyberattacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.North Korea launched a cyberattack against South Korea in July 2009, two months after its second nuclear test. It also hacked South Korean media organizations and financial firms in March 2013, a month after its third nuclear test.North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket in February.","korean hackers sent text ,north korean hackers sent ,stole information from smartphones ,hackers sent text messages ,korean hackers sent","['North Korea', 'south korean', 'Seoul', 'South Korea', 'north korean', 'south korean', 'the National Intelligence Service']",25,"[ 0.          0.          2.         ... -0.53338295  0.72621661

Won Yoo-chul.Won also said he would talk to National Assembly speaker Chung Ui-hwa, demanding he put the cyberterrorism bill to a floor vote on his authority.The Minjoo Party sternly resisted, citing infringement on people’s basic rights to privacy. It also pointed out that the ruling party had recently forced its way by laying the antiterrorism bill, which triggered a nine-day filibuster, a marathon parliamentary debate in protest against the legislation.The controversial cyberterrorism prevention bill has been put forward several times over the past parliamentary terms, but reached its expiration date due to a lack of consensus.

During blackouts, the center control system will air safety instructions to passengers inside the train as well as at the subway stations.The alerts will also be operable inside underground subway tunnels, city officials said.Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corp., which operates Subway Lines Nos. 5-8, will develop its own big data system -- SMRT Automatic Mechanical Big Data Analysis -- that makes use of Internet of Things technology -- Internet-connected devices -- to predict the life span of various pieces of equipment and track down mechanical errors on trains.“The SAMBA system has already been rolled out on Subway Line No. 7. It will soon be applied to trains on Subway Line No. 5 in May,” an official from the SMRT told The Korea Herald.Later this month, the two subway operators will join hands to launch a “zero-error” task force team to take actions to reduce the number of man-made train accidents.“Seoul City will focus on strengthening safety at subways and responding immediately to possible accidents or cyber terror attacks at subway stations,” said Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon in a statement. In January, over 700 passengers were left stranded inside a Subway Line No. 4 train after service between Hansung University Station and Sungshin Women’s University Station broke down for an hour during the evening rush hour. Disruption on the line was attributed to a traction power fault, but no official emergency alert was announced to passengers who eventually forced open the train door and walked over 100 meters inside the underground subway tunnel to reach the nearest station.

The soldier asserted that he had made a mistake and that he had meant to enter his friend’s residence on the fourth floor after finding the building’s front gate locked.Authorities confirmed that the friend in question indeed lives there and that the trespasser was heavily intoxicated at the time.The case is to be delivered to the U.S. military police.“Regardless of the reasons, the trespassing charge is to be applied to his case as he obviously broke into a residence,” said a police official.Around 28,500 U.S. soldiers are currently stationed in South Korea, where the U.S. military has maintained a large presence to deter North Korean aggression since the 1950-53 Korean War.By Ock Hyun-ju","seoul airfield for trespassing ,breaking into korean woman ,drunk soldier nabbed for ,trespassing soldier was apprehended ,influence police said sunday","['U.S.', 'korean', 'the Seoul Yongsan Police Station', 'Seoul Airfield', 'Seoul']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40324107  0.11024102

During the campaign period, 1,279 cases were reported from abuse survivors and witnesses nationwide, and 61 offenders were placed under arrest.The police said 58.3 percent of all offenders were in their 20s and 30s, while 35.6 percent were in their 40s and 50s.Also, 58.9 percent had criminal records, among which 11.9 percent were felons who had been convicted nine times or more previously.  123RFMore than 90 percent of the victims were women.The legislation was inspired by the case of Clare Wood, a British woman who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009. The late victim had reportedly been unaware of her ex’s criminal history of violence against women, which included a case of kidnapping.Following her tragic case, a pilot scheme to protect women from violent partners, known as Clare’s Law, was rolled out nationally in the United Kingdom in 2014. The U.K. law allows police to disclose information about an individual’s criminal history if requested by the partner. According to the Press Association of the U.K., more than 1,300 disclosures of criminal records had been made across England under the law, as of last year.In South Korea, statistics released by a number of think tanks and private agencies have been suggesting that dating abuse is a serious problem in the country. According to 2014 research by Duo, a leading matchmaking agency, 72.3 percent of the 491 surveyed single male and female Koreans in their 20s and 30s said they had been abused by a romantic partner. Further research by Lee Hwa-young at Korea Women’s Hot Line -- a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence -- showed that up to 50 percent of Korean women said they had been physically abused by a romantic partner. Almost 90 percent of the participants said they had been either physically or emotionally abused within the context of dating or courtship. According to the police, the largest number of the reported cases last month, 61.9 percent, were cases of physical abuse, while 17.4 percent involved confinement and blackmailing. Meanwhile, sexual violence including rape accounted for 5.4 percent of all reported cases in February.

166,166,166,Court rules government not responsible for war victim,"South Korea’s top court on Tuesday ruled that the government is not responsible for compensating a Korean civilian killed by the U.S. Navy’s shelling during the 1950-53 Korean War. 　The Supreme Court ordered a retrial for the case in a lower court, reversing an earlier verdict that had demanded the government pay 48.8 million won ($39,600) to the victim’s bereaved families. 　 (Yonhap)The victim, identified only ...","South Korea’s top court on Tuesday ruled that the government is not responsible for compensating a Korean civilian killed by the U.S. Navy’s shelling during the 1950-53 Korean War. The Supreme Court ordered a retrial for the case in a lower court, reversing an earlier verdict that had demanded the government pay 48.8 million won  to the victim’s bereaved families.  The victim, identified only by his surname Bang, was one of about a thousand victims killed by artillery fire from a U.S. Pacific Fleet destroyer, the Haven, along the beach of Pohang, while fleeing the war in September 1950. After the U.S. naval destroyer received a request to open shelling into the crowd -- a mix of Korean refugees including Bang -- along the beach, it checked with the Korean Army’s 3rd Division as to whether or not to fire. The Korean Army said that it had information about enemy troops mixed in with the crowd and asked the U.S. Navy to fire the artillery, which killed Bang and hundreds of other civilians at the scene. The case came to light after a civic committee on revisiting Korea’s history in 2010 unveiled a report on the issue. The bereaved families of Bang filed a suit against the government, seeking financial compensation for the civilian’s death. In the first trial, a local district court ruled that the 3rd Division was operating under Lt. Col. Rollins S. Emmerich, and thus the Korean government had no responsibility to compensate the victims’ family.A higher court, however, overturned the verdict, saying the Korean Army’s request to the U.S. Navy was decisive in firing the artillery into the civilians. It added that there was no evidence that Emmerich ordered the shelling at his own discretion. The Supreme Court viewed the shelling as a result of the U.S. Armed Forces’ war strategy, which presumed civilians as taking side with enemy troops unless proven otherwise. “Bang was victimized by the U.S. Navy, not by the Korean government or its officials,” it said in the ruling. By Ock Hyun-ju","compensating korean civilian killed ,korean civilian killed ,korean civilian killed by ,war victim south korea ,court on tuesday ruled","['South Korea ’s', 'korean', 'the U.S. Navy ’s', 'the Supreme Court']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.18528473  0.59390473

It is quite noteworthy that they don’t do that anymore,” said Yoon. “What makes me excited is that the Korean lawmakers now try to debate, not physically fight, over issues. It is not about whether I support the bill or not. It is not about whether I agree with the speech that opposition lawmakers are making during the filibuster,” he said.With opposition lawmakers continuing to stage filibusters for more than three days against a counterterrorism bill they believe would undermine civil liberty by expanding surveillance power, the U.S.-style parliamentary rule has quickly gained prominence among the public.  A member of the minor and liberal Green Party participates in a mock filibuster organized by opposition supporters in front of the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapSince the filibuster was abolished in 1973, the lawmakers have been mostly deprived of the right to obstruct the passage of bills backed by the majority other than by physically blocking the lawmakers from passing the law. Though the obstruction rule was reinstated in 2012, it was not used until Tuesday.The rare scene in the National Assembly drew enthusiasm to the new political process particularly among netizens, many of them young voters frustrated with having little access to legislative procedure dominated by partisan battle among establishment politicians. When the first filibusterer Rep. Kim Kwang-jin took the podium Tuesday and his successor Rep. Eun Soo-mi cracked the record for the longest filibuster in Korea’s history Wednesday, the first-term lawmakers’ names and the word “filibuster” became the most searched items on Naver, Korea’s top search engine.Some users volunteered for an “online filibuster” by creating a website where citizens could express their opinion on the counterterrorism legislations. Its homepage, filibuster.me, was flooded with comments criticizing the pending bills. The enthusiasm in cyberspace was also brought to the doorstep of the National Assembly. People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, one of the nation’s largest progressive civic groups, has been launching a campaign at the Assembly since Tuesday to allow citizens to speak out against the bill. But the mood did not appear to resonate with voters as a whole. Earlier in the day, Korea Parent Federation, one of the nation’s extreme right-wing groups, held a press conference at the Assembly to condemn the filibuster led by liberal lawmakers and urged the Assembly to pass the antiterrorism law.  A conservative civic group members hold up placards protesting the opposition‘s filibuster at the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapPublic poll also showed a split across the political spectrum. Local pollster Realmeater found Wednesday that advocates for the filibuster were outnumbered by opponents, with 46.1 percent opposing the move and 42.6 percent supporting it. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.3 percent points.Among them, those that identified themselves as liberal supported the filibuster while the conservatives opposed it by 64.9 percent to 73.4 percent. Some 68 percent and 56 percent of those in their 20s and 30s, respectively, supported the filibuster, but those in their 50s and 60s opposed the measure.While most of the ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers blamed opposition parties for hijacking the legislative process to block the bill conservative party view it as crucial for national security, some moderate Saenuri members acknowledged the filibuster as an opportunity to resolve partisan standoff through discussion. “The filibuster clause is aimed to prevent physical fighting between the lawmakers over the passage of the bills and encourage them to reach a compromise through discussion. I hope they will pass the law through negotiations,” said Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil of the Saenuri Party. Lee Jung-hee, political professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, agreed that the filibuster would serve to better inform voters about the legislative issues by allowing the lawmakers an opportunity to make their case and communicate directly with the people.“One of the filibuster’s strengths is its ability to highlight the issue. Back in previous days, the voters were overwhelmed with political standoff and often failed to grasp what the fight was about. By watching the debate, they will better understand the issue,” Lee said.

In a suit filed by a 41-year-old man surnamed Kim, the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed earlier rulings that had ordered a nullification of the marriage and demanded the 26-year-old Vietnamese woman pay him 3 million won  in alimony. Supreme Court “A person’s history about childbirth should be seen as private,” the judge said in the verdict. “Marriage cannot be canceled just because she did not tell her husband about her history in advance.“The Korean man and the Vietnamese woman tied the knot in February 2012 in Vietnam. The woman entered Korea later that year and was raped by her father-in-law. As a result of the trial over the rape, the father-in-law received a seven-year jail sentence, but the ordeal uncovered her past experience of childbirth and rape in her country.The Vietnamese woman reportedly was kidnapped and raped by a Vietnamese man when she was 13 years old. She was then forced to marry him, but ran away after 8 months and gave birth to a son. The son was taken away, she said. After her Korean husband learned about her experience, he filed a suit against her, seeking 30 million won in financial compensation and annulment of the marriage. The man claimed she should have told him about her past before they were married. Under the marriage act, it is possible to file for the cancellation of marriage when the marriage is considered to be fradulent. The woman filed a countersuit, taking issue with her Korean husband neglecting the fact that she had been raped by her father-in-law. She demanded 10 million won in compensation. The lower courts ruled in favor of the husband, saying that one’s history of childbirth is a decisive factor to take into account in one’s decision to get married. The case will be tried again in a lower court.","court denies man marriage ,court monday denied man ,denies man marriage annulment ,been raped south korea ,top court monday denied","['South Korea ’s', 'Kim', 'the Supreme Court', 'vietnamese']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43643689  0.03436005

174,174,174,Media watchdog to uphold ‘right to be forgotten’ in Korea,"South Korea’s state-appointed media monitoring agency said Sunday that it will set out guidelines to enable Web users to request for deletion of personal data online. 　Under the administrative guidelines to be proposed by the Korea Communications Commission, Web users will be able to demand that Web portals remove personal information that they do not want online. 　“We have studied the rights to be forgotten for ...","South Korea’s state-appointed media monitoring agency said Sunday that it will set out guidelines to enable Web users to request for deletion of personal data online. Under the administrative guidelines to be proposed by the Korea Communications Commission, Web users will be able to demand that Web portals remove personal information that they do not want online. “We have studied the rights to be forgotten for more than a year through a group composed of legal, academic and industry experts,” an official from the media watchdog said. “We plan to introduce the guidelines in the first half of the year.”  The European Court of Justice already set a major precedent in 2014 when it ruled in favor of the right to be forgotten by upholding a complaint made by a Spanish man who asked Google to remove search results relating to the forced sale of his house. The court said that the erasure of the information was considered “irrelevant” given the time lapse. Under the new guidelines, ordinary people will be allowed to demand that search engines remove online information relating to themselves, even if the data was legally posted. Decisions on whether information should be removed from search engines will depend on factors such as the nature of the information. For instance, the information should not be about public figures, such as high-profile officials and lawmakers, neither should they be newspaper articles and academic research that are in public interest.Controversy can surface over the criteria and standards for the removal of such personal data. Hence government officials and experts have to juggle between an individual’s privacy and the public’s right to know. The media watchdog said it will map out the guidelines in a loose, self-regulated form, given ongoing controversy over censorship and the public’s right to know. One sticking point is whether to give the right to ask for deletion only to those who write the posts in question. Also, it has yet to be decided whether the guidelines will only apply to large search engines or even include smaller Web platforms. The communications regulator is also mulling over whether to set up a separate body to determine what data can be removed. The current information communications network act stipulates that only illegal information is subject to deletion. This includes the nation’s confidential data, harmful content, lewd videos and photos as well as data that tarnishes one’s reputation and privacy. In 2007, the government introduced a rule called “a temporary measure” under the information act, which allowed online users to ask for the removal of search results that damage reputation.The rule compelled the nation’s largest portal sites Naver and Daum to block access to the information in question for the first 30 days and then to permanently delete it later. In 2014, Naver and Daum received requests to delete 337,923 and 116,261 posts, respectively. Both agreed to remove nearly 95 percent of them, according to the media monitoring agency. By Ock Hyun-ju","web portals remove personal ,that web portals remove ,korea state appointed media ,be forgotten in korea ,web portals remove","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Communications Commission']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.56036681  0.31419462

The prosecution on Monday searched premises of toxic humidifier disinfectant manufacturers and distributors, and secured product supply records and ingredient analysis documents. The investigation includes local companies HomePlus and Lotte Mart, and manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser, which produced Oxy Ssak Ssak, the product most-often used by the victims. This is the third search following others in October and earlier this month. Investigators are looking into whether the manufacturers and distributers had known in advance the harmful nature of the products' ingredients.Eight toxic humidifier disinfectant manufacturers and distributors were indicted and referred to the prosecutors’ office in September last year on charges of manslaughter and professional negligence resulting in injury. Prosecutors are reportedly considering increasing the charges to murder by willful or advertent negligence.“There is reportedly circumstantial evidence that some companies had known the harmful nature of the ingredients. If this is true, this cannot be merely dereliction of duty but willful crime,” sources said. Some families of victims have filed petitions to the authorities to seek murder charges against the manufacturers. YonhapReckitt Benckiser was not immediately available for comment when contacted by The Korea Herald.In 2011, the government discovered the “significant association” between lung damage and the humidifier disinfectant use after four pregnant women died of mysterious lung diseases. Of 530 users initially investigated, only 221 were confirmed to have been harmed by the disinfectants. Last year, an additional 310 potential victims made health complaints to the Environment Ministry to join the public health probe into the impact of humidifier disinfectant. Of this number, 38 have died.While the government has stopped accepting such health complaints from this year, civic groups urged it to continue collecting health reports.According to the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, 202 new potential victims reported their cases to the civic group last month and eight of them have died. From 2011 to January this year, a total of 1,484 individuals reported potential cases to both the government and civic groups, and 226 of them have died, added the center. Of the number who died, only 221 were officially confirmed as health casualties by the government under its strict criteria.Of the confirmed victims, 14 underwent lung transplants and two died from the aftereffects of to the surgery, according to the center. These victims shouldered an average of 170 million won  of medical costs from the surgery.The government currently provides limited aid for medical and funeral costs only to those who are confirmed to have suffered health problems because of the devices.By Lee Hyun-jeong","prosecutors consider murder charge ,korean prosecutors are speeding ,murder charge in toxic ,prosecutors consider murder ,probe south korean prosecutors","['south korean', 'Lotte']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.41599527  0.74316692

According to the Supreme Court on Monday, 3,789 foreigners faced criminal trials in South Korea in 2014, up from 3,243 in 2012. The figure doesn't include civil or family court cases.By the Supreme Court's count, there were 1,736 registered interpreters for 29 languages as of 2015, with Chinese interpreters leading the way at 329, followed by 314 interpreters for English, 224 for Japanese and 133 for Vietnamese.Courts usually post job notices on their websites or accept recommendations from government agencies or research institutes.Candidates are tested on their language proficiency and legal knowledge, and courts also run criminal background checks.And with an increasing demand for interpretation in courts, those currently in the field say more steps should be taken to ensure quality and consistency of interpretation services.""The Seoul Central District Court offers a two-hour training session per year for interpreters,"" said Joo Mi-hye, a 57-year-old who interpreted in the high-profile Itaewon murder trial last month, when U.S. citizen Arthur Patterson received a 20-year jail term for murdering a South Korean student.""But there are no separate sessions for different languages. And some interpreters who have been hired often complain that they never hear back from the courts,"" Joo added.Court interpreters receive 70,000 won  for their first 30 minutes, and 50,000 won for each ensuing 30-minute period. Active interpreters say they should be compensated more for taking on challenging cases, or they'd be discouraged from interpreting under public scrutiny in high-profile trials.A 2012 report by the Korean Institute of Criminology said South Korea should adopt a U.S.-style certification program for court interpreters, and also said two interpreters should be present at each trial, with one monitoring accuracy of the other.","789 foreigners faced criminal ,more foreigners in court ,south korea in 2014 ,on monday 789 foreigners ,monday 789 foreigners faced","['South Korea', 'the Supreme Court', 'South Korea']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26330066  0.69123554

The network can be used wirelessly from North Korean territory, according to police.It is the same Internet network behind a cyberattack on South Korea's nuclear power operator in 2014, according to Kang. North Korea is suspected of orchestrating the attack, though it has denied the charges. Police said similar emails pretending to be from the presidential office or other government bodies have been sent from June 2015 to a total of 759 people.After probing into 460 of the recipients' occupations, police said 87.8 percent have jobs related to North Korea.""Looking at the probe results, there is a trace of an intentional and deliberate targeting process that cannot be deemed as a coincidence,"" Kang said.Police also said some words in the mails are used only in North Korea.Although South and North Koreans speak the same language, South Koreans do not understand some North Korean expressions.The police chief said no major damage to national security has been confirmed due to the attack. Police said they are planning to conduct an international joint investigation as they found two European servers used to send other spam mails disguised as a notice from a major South Korean portal site.North Korea has a track record of waging cyber attacks on South Korea and the United States in recent years, though it has flatly denied any involvement.The latest hacking attempt came amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea claimed in January that it successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test.In response, South Korea is working with the U.S. and other regional powers to punish the communist country for its nuclear test and long-range missile launch that shortly followed the January provocation.","korean hackers sent massive ,hackers behind massive spam ,chief north korean hackers ,north korean hackers sent ,korea hackers behind massive","['north korean', 'south korean', ""South Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Kang Sin - myeong', 'the National Police Agency']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.38127285  0.4016014

In 2013, Ri was appointed as the general staff chief equivalent to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman. The next year, he become a candidate member of the party’s powerful politburo.The source offered several potential reasons for his execution. “Recently, North Korean leader Kim appointed party officials for senior military posts. For this, Ri, a longtime active-duty field officer, might have expressed his displeasure,” the source told reporters.“There is also a possibility that those who lead party control over the military might have reported Ri’s  blasphemous activities to the authorities so as to eliminate him.” The sources also noted that the continued executions of top military officers signaled that Kim was apprehensive about maintaining firm control over the North’s military.Since Kim took power in December 2011, a series of top military officers were purged or executed. In July 2012, Ri Yong-ho, then chief of the general staff of the North’s military, was purged. Ri was then replaced by Hyon Yong-chol, who was executed in April 2015.Rumors have persisted that there could be some power struggle between military and party officials as Kim has been trying to strengthen the role of the party as part of efforts to institutionalize his dictatorship. Under the rule of his late father Kim Jong-il, the party’s role to support the leader was rather loose, as he wielded enormous charismatic authority.Speculation about Ri’s oust had already been circulating as he had not appeared at recent high-profile military events including a Pyongyang ceremony marking what the reclusive regime claims to be a successful launch of the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite. Reporting on the ceremony for the satellite launch, the Rodong Sinmun, the daily of the ruling party, enumerated participants in the order of their military and party rankings.

The punishment was first implemented in 2011 to introduce stronger measures against sexual assault crimes in the country. In 2013, the Daejeon District Court filed a request for constitutional review of the legislation, claiming it violates basic human rights. In a 6-3 vote, the Constitutional Court ruled that hormonal treatment to control sexual impulses in sex offenders is constitutional. The convict, named Kim Seon-yong, has been sentenced to 7 years of hormonal treatment, as well as 80 hours of sex therapy and education, on top of imprisonment of 17 years. Kim had been initially jailed for 15 years in 2012 for rape. However he sexually abused another victim last year after running away while being treated for a hearing condition at a hospital in Daejeon.“He has committed sex crime repeatedly and needs to be isolated and monitored for a long period of time,” the Daejeon District Court said.Another sex convict, whose case in 2013 triggered the constitutional review of the legislation, was also sentenced to five years in prison and five years of hormonal treatment. The offender, identified only by his surname Yim, had been convicted in 2013 for sexually assaulting a minor. Critics of the legislation, including the three judges who opposed it during the constitutional review, have been pointing out that there has not been sufficient research into the effectiveness and side effects of such treatments.By Claire Lee","sex offenders last year ,convict in south korea ,to punish sex convict ,sex convict in south ,punish sex convict for","['the Constitutional Court', 'the Daejeon District Court']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66230565 -0.02337789

Some universities had previously banned students from marrying and becoming pregnant while working on their degrees. Some schools would expel those who broke these controversial rules.In 1951, former late President Kim Young-sam had to “secretly” marry his wife Son Myung-soon, who was then a student at Ewha Womans University. This was because Son’s school did not allow students to get married. Son hid her marital status and finished her degree in pharmacy, even concealing her first pregnancy by wearing loose clothing. Ewha Womans University scrapped its ban on marriage in 2003, more than 110 years after the rule was established. The school claimed it had initially introduced the policy to prevent its female students from being forced into marriage at a young age without getting an opportunity for education in the late 19th century. In 2013, two students -- one female and the other male -- were expelled from Korea Armed Forces Nursing Academy, after it was confirmed that they were expecting a child. The couple was not legally married at the time.The academy, which is regulated by the Defense Ministry and not the Education Ministry, still bans its students from marriage. “We are not sure if the education law revision will have any effect on us,” its official said.The law revision also allows all students to take semesters off for the purpose of child care. Up to this point, students at some universities have had no choice but to quit school when they needed a break from their studies to take care of newborns. By Claire Lee","pregnant south korea education ,universities had previously banned ,south korean college students ,education ministry announced friday ,banned students from marrying","['South Korea ’s', 'the Education Ministry']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73387802  0.47216612

The 36-year-old man told police that he had left the box containing a butane gas canister and a warning message in Arabic in a men’s restroom at Incheon International Airport out of anger towards society. “I was irritated because I could not find a job and I was in need of money,” the man allegedly said, admitting to his crime. “I had no intention to bomb the airport.” According to police, the man holds a master’s degree in music, but has remained unemployed. He has been married for a few years and has a child. He had no previous criminal record or signs of mental illness, police said. A suspect who allegedly left a box containing a butane gas canister and a threatening note inside a restroom at Incheon International Airport last week is seen in this CCTV footage released Thursday. Police had apprehended him at his residence in Guro, southwestern Seoul, on Wednesday night on charges of speical threat and plotting to install explosive devices. This took place five days after the suspicious box raised terror alerts in the nation.The box contained a butane gas canister, a bottle of water, guitar strings and electronic cords, as well as banana peels and other vegetables, without any explosives or detonators. It also had a printed memo in Arabic on half a sheet of paper, reading: “This is the last warning to you. God will punish.” The suspect said that he used Google’s translation service tool to write the threatening note. Experts have said that the memo had grammatical errors and was different from typical threatening messages used by terrorist organizations. The arrest came after police analyzed 84 closed-circuit television cameras installed on the first floor of the airport and suspected the man of entering the restroom with a shopping bag. Police plan to investigate his possible links to international terrorist organizations and details of the incident. They requested a warrant to take him into custody on Thursday.By Ock Hyun-ju","airport bomb scare police ,jobless korean arrested for ,arrested for airport bomb ,korean arrested for airport ,bomb scare police",['south korean'],25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.25718477  0.30020884

They have also cited security challenges  as a reason for limiting rights,” Kiai said in a press briefing held on Friday afternoon in central. “But they should not be an excuse for unduly limiting rights.”“I am confident that the government has the capacity to get it right.” The Kenyan human rights lawyer visited the country from Jan. 21-29 to investigate possible violations of the rights to public assembly and free speech after an association of civic groups filed a petition with the U.N. In recent months, Koreans took to the streets to protest against the Park administration’s push to adopt state-authored history textbooks, reform the labor market and open the agricultural sector, which led to police firing water cannon mixed with tear gas into the crowd. The police water cannon blast left Baek Nam-gi, a 69-year-old activist, unconscious at a hospital.“Certain police tactics during assemblies concern me, such as the use of water cannons and bus barricades,” Kiai said in the briefing. “But aggression only begets aggression.”Protestors have lashed out at the police for abusing its authority to silence criticism of the government, while police have stressed its role in maintaining public order. Following a series of anti-government protests last year, thousands of citizens faced questioning on charges of violating the demonstration act, disrupting traffic and using violence during protests. “It is important that the government and protestors build trust to prevent violence,” he said. “The authorities should guarantee people are not punished for participating in peaceful assemblies. Rights should come before restrictions.” During his visit, the U.N. special rapporteur visited labor union groups, minor political parties, and representatives of sexual minorities and civic groups. He met with the bereaved families of the victims of the Sewol ferry tragedy and students staging an outdoor sit-in outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul to protest the relocation of the memorial for sex slavery victims by Japan during World War II. In an effort to seek a balanced view, Kiai also consulted government officials from the Foreign Ministry, Labor Ministry, Justice Ministry, as well as officials from the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and the nation’s Human Rights Commission. Kiai plans to write a report on Korea and submit it to the United Nations Human Rights Council in June.

""The demand for a special Kim Jong-un class is part of the agreement between the country's university and UI to carry out exchanges of students, staff and lecturers,"" she went on.Ines stated that currently UI is reviewing the agreement, including the request for a Kim Jong-un class.""We will examine all of their requests,"" Ines said, further emphasizing that UI hopes to develop a partnership that satisfies both parties.According to the Korean Embassy official, Indonesia has maintained a relatively good relationship with North Korea, but it also speaks out toward Pyongyang, like when it criticized North Korea's recent fourth nuclear test.He said that Indonesia does not want to become an object of ridicule, which it fears it would become if UI were to open the Kim Jong-un class at a time when the international community is criticizing the North's provocative attitude.","never considered accepting pyongyang ,university will not open ,korean embassy in jakarta ,indonesian university has never ,university has never considered","['the south Korean Embassy', 'Jakarta', 'the University of Indonesia', ""North Korea 's"", 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un', 'indonesian', 'Pyongyang', 'Pyongyang', 'Yonhap News Agen']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27447644  0.47893044

The temporary unit, under the Anti-corruption Department at the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, is expected to crack down on possible graft in the public sector, particularly involving large-scale state projects. Reportedly, two teams of the unit will each deal with crimes by politicians and civil workers, as well as by entrepreneurs, although the details have not been officially released.President Park Geun-hye instructed her Cabinet earlier this month to set up infrastructure to “preemptively monitor and spot elements of corruption,” which she said will result in more transparent state-led projects.Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, her second-in-command, subsequently announced a state-led anticorruption drive that encompasses real-time monitoring of large-scale projects and enhanced audits of government organizations. The new unit consists of 30 members and includes 11 prosecutors, but additional members can be dispatched when required. It will be headed by seasoned prosecutor Kim Ki-dong, who is most noted for heading a joint government investigative team against arms procurement corruption from 2014-15. Prosecutor Kim Ki-dongBut an investigative unit that directly answers to the prosecutor general has sparked concerns over its potential political bias. The previous investigative unit with a similar chain of command, the Central Investigation Department, is now defunct. As the president has the authority to appoint the prosecutor general, observers have said that an organization that is ordered directly by the top prosecutor can be influenced by the incumbent administration.Opposition lawmakers -- including Rep. Park Young-sun of The Minjoo Party of Korea -- had accused the former President Lee Myung-bak administration of using the department to target his predecessor Roh Moo-hyun, which is said to have led to his suicide in 2009.The National Assembly agreed to abolish the department in 2011 as part of reforms, and President Park formally shut it down in 2013.

State prosecutors are also in the process of carrying out a criminal investigation against Volkswagen Korea's head over a proposed recall plan that has been deemed insufficient by the country's environment ministry.Earlier this month, Volkswagen Korea claimed that by installing a simple ""flow transformer,"" the diesel driven cars it sold in the country will have better exhaust gas recirculation that could lead to the lowering of harmful emissions. It said such changes can be carried out without hurting fuel economy and performance. The German automaker admitted in September that it had installed so-called defeat devices in some of its cars that are designed to cheat official emission testing cycles.The FTC said it is taking issue because Volkswagen claims affect the 125,522 cars that need to be recalled. These cars, including the very popular Tiguan crossover, should have met Euro 5 emissions standards.The watchdog said that if it finds Volkswagen lied to consumers, fines of up to 2 percent of its sales could be levied.The case could also be sent to the prosecution and even lead to more civil lawsuits.The FTC, however, cautioned that the probe requires time to sort out a lot of details. The agency said the results will not be made public in the near future.Related to the latest probe, industry watchers said that Volkswagen is facing a similar investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its ""clean diesel"" ads.","volkswagen ag misled consumers ,korean watchdog probing volkswagen ,volkswagen is under investigation ,volkswagen ag misled ,watchdog probing volkswagen over","[""South Korea 's"", 'Volkswagen AG', 'the Fair Trade Commission', 'Volkswagen', 'U.S.', 'european']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16254553  0.47316566

JYP Entertainment is the South Korean management agency for the singer, Chou Tzu-yu, who waved Taiwan's national flag on a South Korean entertainment TV program in November. The image of Chou, who performs under the name Tzuyu as a member of South Korean girl band TWICE, sparked controversy in mainland China after China-based Taiwanese singer Huang An reportedly accused Chou of supporting Taiwanese independence.The issue has attracted intense media attention in both Taiwan and China at a time when Tsai Ing-won of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, which wants independence from China, has been elected as the island's first female president. Some South Korean media reported that K-pop singers from JYP have been banned from performing in mainland China, but an official at China's culture ministry told Yonhap News Agency by telephone that, ""There is no regulation that allows China's central government to ban a certain celebrity of a certain country or a certain agency from performing in China.""  In an apparent fear that the issue could fan nationalistic sentiment in mainland China, JYP Entertainment apologized and suspended Chou's activities. Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war. China's ruling Communist Party claims sovereignty over Taiwan, but the landslide victory of Tsai Ing-won shows that many Taiwanese people support the island's democracy.","banned jyp singers over ,banned singers under jyp ,banned jyp singers ,taiwanese pop singer jyp ,it banned jyp singers","['China', 'south korean', 'JYP Entertainment', 'China', 'taiwanese', 'JYP Entertainment', 'south korean', 'Chou Tzu - yu', 'Taiwan', 'south korean']",25,"[ 0.          0.          3.         ... -0.64721972 -0.03821059

The leaflets had depreciatively doctored photos of President Park Geun-hye and U.S. President Barack Obama, and featured the image of a loudspeaker with a message that can be roughly translated as “we shall disintegrate those who thoughtlessly bark at us” splattered across.In response, Seoul said it deployed four additional movable loudspeakers with enhanced amplification capacity for its anti-North broadcasting campaign.By Yoon Min-sik","korean police on friday ,police on friday recovered ,korean border last week ,10 000 propaganda leaflets ,fliers south korean police","['south korean', 'North Korea', 'Goyang', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Seoul', 'North Korea', 'Seoul', 'anti - pyongyang', 'inter - korean']",25,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00 ... -6.84280396e-01

They said the government neglected its duty to take active measures against Japan to settle the issue, such as organizing a trouble-shooting committee with Japan.They cited a pact reached between Seoul and Tokyo to normalize their diplomatic ties in 1965, which stipulated that any disputes regarding implementation of the deal should be resolved through diplomatic channels and that what cannot be resolved in such way should be brought to the arbitration committee comprised of the two countries' representatives and one from a third party country.The court, however, said the deal does not mean that the government is obligated to hold the committee in every case.""The government has been constantly trying to settle the dispute through diplomatic channels,"" the court said. ""Considering the recent Seoul-Tokyo deal on Japanese wartime sex slaves -- though there is a controversy -- it does not seem like  efforts to diplomatically negotiate the  issue are as meaningless as the plaintiffs claim.""The two countries reached a rare deal last month to resolve the issue of Japan's wartime sex slaves during World War II, under which Japan apologized and agreed to offer 1 billion yen  in reparations to the victims through a fund to be created by the South Korean government. South Korea said it would end the dispute once and for all if Japan fully implements the deal.There are about 4,300 foreign atomic bomb victims and 2,600 of them are Koreans, according to Japan's official data.","court rejects korean bomb ,rejects korean bomb victims ,korean atomic bomb victims ,rejects korean bomb ,korean bomb victims suit","['south korean', 'japanese', 'Japan', 'the Seoul High Court', 'korean', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki']",25,"[ 0.          0.          1.         ... -0.03228729  0.18910746

The other man did not have any documents but said he was 27 years old,"" Hild said.   Refugee support groups have expressed fears of human trafficking and dangerous clandestine crossings across the Baltic as a result of Sweden's ID checks.   A country of 9.8 million people, Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers last year, more per capita than any other EU nation.   Unable to cope with the unregulated flow of arrivals, it has since January4 required all travellers to show photo identification when entering from Denmark, the main entry point for migrants into Sweden.   The number of asylum seekers has dropped sharply since then. On January 8, the migration agency said the number of asylum applications received in the first week of January had fallen below 1,500, after receiving almost 10,000 a week for much of October and November.","boat swedish police arrested ,swedish police arrested man ,smuggling migrant into sweden ,boat swedish police ,swedish police arrested","['swedish', 'Sweden', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Kim Hild']",25,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76438671 -0.17648603
