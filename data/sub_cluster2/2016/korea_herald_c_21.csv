Each was asked to estimate the likelihood and impact on US interests of each of the contingencies, it said.It was believed to be the first time that a North Korea crisis has topped the annual list of international concerns for New Year, though the issue has been classified as a Tier 1 international concern in previous surveys.""Donald J. Trump assumes office at a particularly turbulent time. It may not be long before his administration is tested by a serious foreign crisis,"" CFR said in the report. ""The new administration must decide how active it wants to be in managing the risks a more turbulent world poses to US interests.""Most American experts agree that North Korea will be one of the biggest problems facing the Trump administration as the communist nation stepped up its development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental US.Outgoing President Barack Obama also reportedly warned Trump of the dangers the North poses to the US when the two met at the White House last month.During the election campaign, Trump said he would pressure China to exercise its influence over North Korea as the main food and energy provider to rein in the regime in Pyongyang, saying the North is basically China's problem to fix.But he also expressed a willingness to hold direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un over ""hamburgers,"" a remark seen as aimed at underscoring the point he's a great negotiator. However, the remark invited huge criticism that such a meeting would only bolster the North's dictator.","puts korea crisis atop ,north korea ranked atop ,survey puts korea crisis ,korea crisis atop list ,nato highly disruptive cyberattack","['North Korea', 'the United States', 'a Council on Foreign Relations', 'Preventive Priorities Survey', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'NATO', 'US']",21,"[ 2.          1.          1.         ... -0.50166827  0.63564813

Among couples with a single breadwinner, however, only 29.9 percent were childless.Matches with the husband and wife both in their early 30s accounted for 18.8 percent of all newlywed couples, closely followed by duos where the husband was between 30-34 years and the wife between 25-29 years at 18.4 percent. Also, 506,000 couples, or 42.9 percent, were double-income families, and the percentage reached 50 percent for those who married less than one year ago.Among 853,000 marriages that include salaried workers, 30.6 percent of them have a combined annual income of 30 to 50 million won, while 21.9 percent are in the basket of 50 to 70 million won, and 18.4 percent are in the 10 to 30 million won income group.The findings reflect that an increasing number of South Korean people get married and have children when they are older, or give up on tying the knot and having babies altogether.A separate survey showed that half of people thought that marriage is necessary in their lives last year, down from 56.8 percent polled in 2014.The average age that a woman has her first child was 31.2 last year, up from 31 years in 2014.

Per 1,000 outpatient and emergency room visits of those aged 7-18, 153 were flu patients. The previous record was set in 2013 at 115 flu cases per 1,000 hospital visits. A nurse examines a child at a pediatrics clinic in Seoul on Friday. A total number of suspected cases for seasonal influenza reached 61.8 patients per 1,000 visits across the nation, about a 77 percent jump from 34.8 cases, the KCDC said. By age group, those aged six or below showed the highest number of infected cases at 59.6 patients, followed by those aged 19-49 at 51.5.Those aged 65 or more showed the least number of flu cases at nine per 1,000 hospital visits, followed by those aged 50-64 with 22.2 cases. The virus currently raging is the influenza A virus subtype H3N2, the doctors said.While doctors stress that simple hygiene etiquette is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the contagious virus, they said that the influenza B virus is likely to appear early next year.“Seasonal flu shows different types of aspects of spreading and considering the current spread of influenza A, the second round of seasonal flu -- influenza B -- may begin spreading early next year,” said Doctor Jung Yong-pil of Asan Medical Center.“These two different strains of the virus share almost identical symptoms such as high fever, headache and muscle pain,” Jung added. Getting a vaccination, either a flu shot or a nasal-spray type vaccination, is a simple method to reduce the chances of catching both influenza A and B, experts say, but fundamental preventive steps such as washing hands often can sometimes work better.According to Doctor Lee Jae-gab of Hallym University Gangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, it is difficult to expect which subtype virus of influenza B would spreading, making it hard to guess which vaccination to get for prevention.“There are two subtypes of virus under influenza A and B, while a vaccination cannot always create the specific antibodies to resist the viruses, it depends on people,” Lee said.“That’s why doctors stress flu prevention methods, such as wearing a mask and washing hands often, as the most certain and basic ways to stay away from a cold,” he added.The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced earlier this week that it would temporarily expand the health insurance coverage for those aged 10-18, so they can get antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu at a 30 percent discount and promptly receive treatment.By Kim Da-sol","record worst flu outbreak ,flu patients this week ,sees record worst flu ,worst flu outbreak south ,worst flu outbreak","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45462513  0.50120986

That accounts for 23.3 percent of the country's average GDP of $15 billion during the period.Oman was a distant second on the list, spending 11.4 percent of its GDP on the military, followed by Saudi Arabia with 8.6 percent, South Sudan with 8.4 percent and the African nation of Eritrea with 6.9 percent, according to the report.South Korea spent about 2.6 percent of its GDP on the military, the 47th largest in the world, while Japan was in 136th place by spending an average 1 percent of its GDP on the military during the period, according to the report.In absolute terms, however, the North's annual military spending during the period ranked only 46th in the world, while South Korea's ranked 11th, spending an average $30 billion. The US was by far the world's No. 1 with $701 billion a year on average, way ahead of runner-up China's $114 billion.In 2014 alone, the US military expenditures amounted to $656 billion, while China's totaled $157 billion.

Russia came next but trailed with only $8 billion worth of exports.North Korea ranked 31st on the list, with about $100 million of annual arms exports.

The KCCR began collecting data on the occurrence rate of cancer in 1999. It peaked in 2012 with 323.3 cases per 100,000 people, but has since been on a gradual decline. By type of cancer, thyroid cancer topped the list with 30,806 people diagnosed in 2014 -- about 28.1 percent lower than in the previous year -- followed by colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer and prostate cancer.Researchers said the fall in the occurrence rate of thyroid cancer compared to previous years could be due to the heightened public awareness regarding overdiagnosis and the resulting unncessary surgery.Among the five kinds of cancer monitored by the National Cancer Information Center, breast cancer was the only type that showed an increasing trend, with the number of cases rising by 5.7 percent from 17,398 in 2013 to 18,381 in 2014. The data also showed that 1 in 35 South Koreans have suffered or have been suffering cancer since 1999, amounting to a total of approximately 1.46 million as of January 2015. Based on the life expectancy of South Koreans, at 82 years old, 2 in 5 men and 1 in 3 women are likely to develop cancer in their lifetime, researchers found.South Korea’s occurrence rate of cancer was 265.7 cases per 100,000 people, similar to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 270.3 cases per 100,000 people.

Currently, there have been no reports of infections through people or livestock.Chung Ki-seok, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks Tuesday in a briefing held at Sejong Government Complex. “While the possibility of the bird flu infection spreading to humans is extremely low, simple but fundamental steps, such as washing hands for 30 seconds and avoiding visiting poultry farms or habitats for migratory birds can prevent the outbreak spreading to people,” said Chung Ki-seok, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a briefing.“We also ask that citizens who find symptoms or suspicious cases visit ministry-designated hospitals. We appointed some 17 hospitals across the nation equipped with special sanitation facilities to report and treat cases immediately,” Chung added.As of Monday, 9,183 people working at poultry farms or participating in the mass culling of poultry at the disease-hit areas had been vaccinated and classified as a high-risk group to receive state monitoring.Authorities said 26 people among the high-risk group reported flu-like symptoms, but just one of them was confirmed with the H3N2 strain of the seasonal flu.The highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of the flu is currently being examined at the National Institute of Environmental Research to find out if the outbreak can spread to people, authorities added. The CDC said it also published and distributed guidelines for bird flu prevention measures in 14 different languages, including Thai, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and more, in an aim to help foreign workers in rural areas understand the situation and follow the measures. Officials said that while the seasonal flu is sweeping the country at an alarming pace, it is theoretically possible for a human to catch both seasonal flu and bird flu infections, but it is very less likely for the outbreak to spread to people. “The most significant step for people to prevent both  viruses is to wash hands often and eat heated food,” the CDC official said.By Kim Da-sol","bird flu strain week ,government on tuesday mapped ,flu strain week after ,tuesday mapped out plans ,pathogenic bird flu strain",['the Ministry of Health and Welfare'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64097333  0.36836189

Females in South Korea are predicted to reach 25.56 million in 2045, compared with 25.49 million males.South Korea is also expected to go through rapid population aging. The number of people aged 65 and older will likely come to 18.18 million in 30 years, up 2.9 times from the 6.54 million last year. Its share of the country's total population is predicted to soar to 35.6 percent from 12.8 percent.South Korea is projected to become an aged society in 2018 with the ratio hitting 14 percent and emerge as a super-aged society with 20 percent in 2025. A country is defined as an aged society when more than 14 percent of its people are 65 or older.In contrast, the country's labor force aged 15-64 will fall to27.72 million in 30 years from last year's 37.44 million, with the annual number of newborns slumping to around 310,000 from 430,000, according to the data.South Korea's stubbornly low birthrate and aging people are widely feared to undermine the growth potential of Asia's fourth-largest economy.","30 years south korea ,million in 2045 slightly ,05 million in 2045 ,in 2045 slightly higher ,chronically low birthrate government",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83497125  0.20945698

Outside the parliament, where hundreds of citizens awaited in thick padded jackets, people shouted out in relief, while some hugged each other in joy. “It was an outcome I prayed for. Still we have a long way to go until the final decision . I will participate in tomorrows and future rallies until it all ends,” Choi Hye-jeong, 29, said at the scene. On the other side of the cheering citizens stood others with grim faces in a group supporting President Park Geun-hye, as they called out that the results were unfair and irresponsible. Police guarded the gate of the parliament and surrounded the loud crowds, guarding against possible violence. 4:16 p.m. The impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye passed at 4:10 p.m., Friday.

She has also come under fire for failing to make key rescue decisions during the Sewol ferry sinking incident in 2014.“We have realized that truth  may never come to light as long as the Park administration is in charge,” said Yoo Kyeong-keun, the committee head of the Sewol Families for Truth and a Safer Society.“Impeachment will mark the start of a new era in which we may reveal the truth about Sewol and step forward into a safe society.”The participating members pledged to exert pressure upon the parliamentary floor to vote in consent of impeachment and thus embrace the public sentiment.Shortly after the opening of the session, Rep. Kim Kwan-young of the runner-up People‘s Party presented the impeachment bill to the floor, stating President Park’s violation of the nation‘s Constitution and other laws. 2:30 p.m.Thousands gather at the front gate of the National Assembly on the day of impeachment vote. Thousands of citizens have gathered at the front gate of the National Assembly building on the day of impeachment vote in a last-ditch effort to pressure lawmakers to pass the motion.

Placards read “immediate resignation” and “prompt punishment.” Protestors relentlessly chanted “Park Geun-hye, resign,” while facing the national assembly building. Many of the protestors echoed hope for a better, more just society by impeaching the president. If the motion does not pass, many said they would continue to fight until she resigns. Conflicts have erupted as a farmer drove a tractor to the main road in front of the National Assembly building packed with protestors. As police blocked protestors walking from another part of the area from joining the protestors at the front gate, protestors chanted “guarantee peaceful rallies” and “open the way.”In this afternoon, South Korea’s parliament will vote on whether to impeach President Park Geun-hye over an influence-peddling scandal involving her secret confidante Choi Soon-sil. 12:50 p.m.Chunchugwan, the presidential press office building.

The parliamentary floor vote on ousting the president is to start at around 3 p.m.“All we can do is keep watching,” said an official under anonymity.“All senior secretaries have pledged to hold the fort so as to minimize confusion in state affairs.”This message echoed that of the embattled president who is said to have visited the secretaries‘ office on the previous day, urging all officials to “wait for the decision in a composed manner.”Meanwhile, Park was said to be in her presidential residence in the morning, keeping away from the operation offices and watching the situation in Yeouido on television. 12:30 p.m.Groups opposing and demanding Park’s impeachment are rallying outside the National Assembly.A group of Park’s supporters have quarreled with a liberal activist.A dozen police buses are lined up to block access to the parliamentary compound, a preventive measure in case angry protesters try to break into the parliamentary buildings.The Assembly has decided to shut down the buildings if the impeachment vote falls through. 10:34 a.m. Ruling party lawmakers attend an emergency meeting in the National Assembly on Friday.

The National Assembly will make a historic decision today. The history and the people will remember today’s choice as justice.” Rep. Choo Mi-ae, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Korea:“Impeachment is the way to save the country and people’s lives. Citizens, who hold national sovereignty, have already impeached the president.” Rep. Hwang Young-cheul of the Saenuri Party:“What citizens asked in Gwanghwamun Square was to have justice in the country and keep sound conservative values. We heard their requests and will keep them in our hearts when we head to the vote.” Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung:“The president is in fact in absence already . Nothing can be worse than the current situation. Zombies are the most dangerous –  should either live or die. The fact that someone who should die is still alive, just causes chaos.”Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon:“We will say goodbye to old, warn-out South Korea and open the door to new South Korea in few hours. The citizens will undoubtedly win.”Rep. Park Jie-won, floor leader of the People’s Party:“We stand by the citizens to welcome tomorrow. When the impeachment motion is passed at the Assembly, citizens may live in confusion and fear. But the impeachment on the president is the order of the citizens.”Rep. Kim Dong-cheol of the People’s Party:“The impeachment of the president is the judgment of the past and the start of the future. Citizens will play the main role in creating a new history.

The OECD announced the results of its 2015 Program for International Student Assessment , which surveyed about 540,000 15-year-olds in 72 different countries, including 35 member nations of the OECD. South Korea ranked “first-fourth” in math by earning 517 points, “third-eighth” in reading with 524 points and “fifth-eighth” in science with 516 points among the OECD member states.Including non-OECD members such as Singapore, Hong Kong and China, South Korea’s rankings dropped further. South Korea stood at “fourth-ninth” in reading, “sixth-ninth” in math and “ninth-14th” in science.The PISA results are described in scopes such as “first-fourth” and “third-eighth” to present upper and lower bound estimates of each country when the score differences are not significant. In the 2012 PISA result, the OECD ranked South Korea at the top in math with 554 points, put it first or second place in literacy with 536 points and between second and fourth in science with 538 points among its member countries.  South Korean students study in the classroom.Despite the fall in the PISA results, South Korean students showed stronger academic ability in every subject than the OECD average. The average of the OECD in the 2015 PISA results was 493 points in reading, 490 in math and 493 in science. PISA is an international assessment that evaluates 15-year-old students on their proficiency in science, reading and math every three years since 2000. In South Korea, 5,749 students attending 145 high schools and 23 middle schools took part in the program. By gender, South Korean girls outshone boys in every subject. The proportion of students showing poor performance increased in every subject last year, from 7.6 percent to 13.6 percent in reading, from 9.1 percent to 15.4 percent in math and from 6.7 percent to 14.4 percent in science, compared to 2012. The survey found that South Korean students are slightly more motivated to study science and interested in the subject in 2015 than in 2012, though they are less enthusiastic about their study than the OECD average. “As the PISA results showed a fall in academic ability, the state and provincial education offices should improve the system to support those lacking basic academic skills,” said the Education Ministry. “As Korean students lack an interest in science compared to the OECD average, there needs to policy efforts to make courses more fun and interesting.” By Ock Hyun-ju","south korea ranking drops ,the 2015 international student ,oecd report showed tuesday ,student assessment slightly slipped ,korea ranking drops in","['South Korea ’s', 'the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', 'OECD', 'OECD']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.3700538   0.6026389

The report team said the overall poverty rate among single-member households in Korea consistently went up from 2006 to 2014, while the absolute and relative poverty rate both took a downward turn in 2015.The research team added that government’s policy measures should be more focused on dealing poverty issues targeting elders who live alone.“The trend  shows more elders are depending on government policies and welfare programs, while such programs should be redesigned to embrace elderly who live alone in poverty,” the research team said.OECD data in 2015 showed that South Korea’s elderly poverty rate was the highest among 34 OECD member countries, as the poverty rate among senior citizens aged 65 or older was 48.6 percent in 2011.Beyond that, South Korea had one of the lowest net pension replacement rates. Only five other countries -- Mexico, Japan, Britain, New Zealand and Ireland -- were ranked lower than South Korea, but those countries did not have an elderly poverty rate as high as Korea’s.  By Kim Da-sol","45 percent of elderly ,almost doubled since 2006 ,korea the poverty rate ,doubled since 2006 study ,poverty rate among senior","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79855341  0.45237935

The pangovernmental comprehensive framework, approved by the Cabinet, aims to achieve the country’s goal of cutting carbon emissions by 37 percent, or 315 million metric tons, based on business-as-usual levels. Seoul introduced its voluntary reduction target during a UN climate conference in Paris last December. “The action plans were formulated in a way that helps to shift the reduction-focused responses to climate change to a fresh paradigm centering on the market and technology ... and strengthen the private sector’s role and promote the acceptability of the policy,” the intra-agency statement said. Under the plan, the government aims to slash 219 million metric tons, or nearly 70 percent of the total reduction goal, from eight areas such as power production, industry and buildings, setting the sectoral target at 25.7 percent below projected levels. The largest slice would come from electricity generation with 64.5 million metric tons, followed by industry with 56.4 million metric tons, buildings with 35.8 million metric tons and new energy sectors including electric vehicles and energy storage with 282 million metric tons. Seoul also looks to curb 96 million metric tons through international market mechanisms in line with the Paris climate agreement. It would devise a more detailed blueprint by 2020, saying the overseas reduction plan requires additional global discussions such as on carbon credit trading and funding sources. Yet mindful of the industry’s unabated jitters over what it calls a side effect on the business environment, the government left room for a future revision, saying it would “adjust and complement” its plans according to the “fast-changing economic conditions” at home and abroad and global climate policy trends. To ensure a transparent implementation and inclusiveness, the Prime Minister’s Office will take over control from the Environment Ministry to oversee the issue and carry out inspections every five years through a public-private partnership. As part of efforts to pare the country’s reliance on fossil fuel, the government is seeking to boost incentives for renewable energy and cleaner power plant projects. It intends to raise the share of renewable sources in its portfolio to 7 percent from the existing 6 percent by 2020.  The plan called a cap-and-trade system “key” to meeting the 2030 goal, which it said would expedite industry innovation and environmentally friendly investment while helping to integrate into the future global carbon market. It pledged to expand funding in the development of 10 climate technologies including solar and fuel cells and conversion of waste gas, while doubling investment in clean energy research to 1.12 trillion won  by 202. Korea is the world’s seventh-largest polluter, with its carbon output in 2013 reaching 572 million metric tons, according to the International Energy Agency. The country’s emissions marked the fastest growth since 1990 among the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Choi is one of the most important witnesses in the ongoing parliamentary investigation.  Choi Soon-sil arrives at a Seoul court on Nov. 3 to attend a hearing to review the legality of her detention The 60-year-old longtime friend of Park cited health issues and the prosecutorial investigation she is undergoing as reasons for her absence. Currently under arrest, she faces a trial for her involvement in the scandal, as she is accused of manipulating government affairs through her ties to the president. Choi’s elder sister Choi Soon-deuk and niece Jang Si-ho also told lawmakers they are too ill to attend the session. The two have been charged with using their ties with Choi to amass personal wealth illegally. The panel said that if the Chois continue to avoid inquiry, they would request the court issue an order to force their attendance. By law, those who refuse to obey such an order can be sent to prison or face fines.

According to an award-winning paper released by Jeon Sae-ran and Lee Myeong-hoon of Korea University, those in rural areas were 1.37 times more likely to have plans for children than those living in cities, when comparing on equal income conditions.The paper studied 2,207 couples who registered for marriage from 2010 to 2014 with their annual average income standing at 48 million won  and spending an average of 280,000 won monthly in debt.By marriage length, couples married for less than two years in rural areas were 1.39 times more likely to have a childbirth plan than those in cities, while those outside cities married for three to five years were 1.25 times more likely than their counterparts in urban regions.The team explained that despite that many in their 20s and 30s, who are the primary birth-givers, live in cities, the rate difference occurs due to the high living cost and child-rearing expenses in urban regions. The average home price stood at 400 million won in the capital area, higher even than the average of metropolitan cities like Busan  and other regions .Child care expenses turned out to be more burdensome in more urban areas as well.Households with a child in big cities spend a monthly average of 717,000 won, while those in small and middle-sized cities spend 615,000 won, data from Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs showed. Residents in the countryside spent an average of 521,000 won per month.“Last year’s birthrate was 1.24, which means newlyweds gave birth to just one child . We need to come up with more fitting policies for new married couples to increase the birthrate,” the research team said.

In the second quarter this year, there were 10.08 million senior workers, adding 272,000 more than the same period from the previous year, according to Statistics Korea.  Job seekers check out job advertisements displayed at a job fair. YonhapIn the third quarter, the tally decreased to 10.02 million, but still remained above 10 million. Senior workers accounted for 38.5 percent of total workers in the third quarter, adding almost 10 percentage points from 27.9 percent in 2006. The proportion of seniors in the total workforce has been gradually increasing over the past decade. In the second and third quarters of 2006, a total of 6.49 million workers were 50 years old and above. The number exceeded the 7 million threshold in 2008 for the first time, 8 million in the second quarter of 2011 and 9 million in the second quarter of 2013. The rapid increase is largely due to the growing population of the older generation, which includes Korea’s baby boomer generation who were born between 1955 and 1963. As of September, the population in their 50s increased by 113,000 to a total of 8.2 million from a year ago, while those in their 60s added 475,000 to 9.96 million. Meanwhile those in their 30s and 40s has decreased by 88,000 and 56,000, respectively. “The baby boomers have failed to prepare for their postretirement life,” said Park Yoo-soo, a researcher at the state-run Korea Development Institute. “As a result, they still remain in the job market.”The reason behind the lack of preparation for their postretirement life can be attributed to polarization in the Korean job market, Kim Yoo-bin, associate fellow with the Korea Labor Institute, told The Korea Herald. “Those who earned low incomes and worked irregular jobs are likely to be the ones who are not ready for retirement and forced to stay in the workforce even after the retirement age.” The average retirement age in Korea was 72.9 for men and 70.6 for women in 2014, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor in July, meaning that Korean workers remain in the workforce seven to eight years longer than average among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In recent years, the government has rolled out measures such as child care leave and flexible working hours in a bid to help working parents. 123rfOver 26 percent of the respondents selected economic difficulties as the reason for not taking leave or a shorter workweek program. Only 4.2 percent said they prefer to continue developing their career.When asked what should be done to fix the current situation, 41.5 percent said employers’ perception toward work-life balance must change. Some 38.6 percent said the government should provide more support. On the question of what policy measure they feel is most needed, 95.1 percent of the workers said reinforced maternity leave, followed by more day care centers for babies and toddlers  and paternity leave . The ministry says the small, but fast-growing number of paternity leave takers is a hopeful sign of change in the country’s rigid workplace culture.

Defections from the reclusive communist country up to October increased by 18 percent from the same period last year. The annual number was 1,384 in 2005 and 2,914 in 2009, but has been going down since 2011 with Pyongyang’s leadership clamping down on defections. The South Korean government has speculated that the resurge in defections is due to the oppression of the Kim Jong-un leadership and the UN-led economic sanctions that followed Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.About 72 percent of defectors and 80 percent of defectors this year were women, the ministry noted, explaining that women in North Korea are relatively freer to move from within the country. About 58 percent of those who fled the hermit kingdom were in their 20s and 30s.Of the teenagers who originated from the North, 51 percent had been born in neither South nor North Korea. Among the notable changes concerning defection in recent years was why they chose to escape.The No. 1 reason for defection in 2001 was “financial difficulties and hunger” at 66.7 percent, but that figure plunged to 12 percent this year, according to a survey by the ministry-affiliated resettlement support center Korea Hana Foundation. Instead the top spot was taken by “longing for freedom,” which jumped from 9.6 percent to 34.8 percent during the same period. Numbers indicate that there are more defections motivated by the will to improve the quality of life rather than to ensure one’s survival, with 55.9 percent saying that their income in the North was “enough.” The figure in 2001 was 19.4 percent.The number of politically motivated defections also jumped during the period from 6.2 percent to 17.5 percent.Data from the KHF showed that more members of the “elite group” -- consisting of doctors, teachers or researchers -- are fleeing the North. The elites accounted for 2.5 percent of the defectors who arrived here five to 10 years ago, but this rose to 5 percent among those who arrived more recently, one to three years ago.This year was marked by a series of North Korean elites fleeing the country, namely a director-general level official at the North’s spy agency, a colonel-level officer at the military intelligence organization and London-based diplomat Thae Yong-ho.The ministry said it is working with related organizations for a comprehensive measure to support former North Koreans settling in the South. This is expected to include increased job opportunities, academic support for younger generation and overall social participation.Compared to 2007, the employment rate for defectors jumped this year from 36.9 percent to 54.6 percent, the ministry said.

The drop had been attributed to tighter border control along the North Korea-China frontier which is not heavily guarded.Official source attributed this year's increase to the ""reign of terror"" perpetrated by Kim and tighter international sanctions that is forcing North Korean workers living abroad to repatriate more money. The North Korean leader has purged many leading figures from positions of power and has resorted to terror tactics like public executions to enforce his rule.Besides such developments, many North Korean elites are opting to defect for the sake of their children's future as well as getting away from political oppression.Reflecting this, polls conducted by the unification ministry on defectors showed less people escaping the country because they were starving or for economic reasons.Before 2001, 66.7 percent of those that left the country said they were trying to get away from hunger, but this decreased to 57.9 percent in 2002-2005 period and dropped to just 12.1 percent from 2014 to this year.In contrast, those that cited freedom and discontent over North Korean politics reach 87.8 percent in the 2014-16 period from 33.3 percent before 2001 and 42.1 percent in the 2002-2005 period.","korea to hit 30 ,korean defectors that arrived ,30 000 mark gov ,percent spike in defectors ,defectors that arrived korea","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'north korean']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53720027  0.55159062

According to a nationwide poll by local pollster Research View, the disapproval rating for Park hit an all-time high of 81.2 percent, up 14.9 percent from a week earlier, right after the influence-peddling scandal surfaced. Park’s efforts to soothe public anger by making an apology and carrying out a reshuffle of the presidential staff have not had much impact. The latest data corresponds with other survey results released over the past few days which point to a dive in the president’s popularity across all age groups and regions. The fall in her popularity is especially notable in her core support base -- Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province and the over-60 age group. In Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province, her approval rating stands at 11 percent. In Busan, Ulsan and South Gyeongsang Province, 12.4 percent said that the president was doing okay. In Seoul, 8.3 percent said they backed Park. The poll showed that 41.3 percent of the supporters of the ruling Saenuri Party thought that the president was doing OK, while 40.6 percent thought otherwise. Among those who voted for Park in the 2012 presidential election, only 20.1 percent still support her, with 66 percent turning their backs on her. Park was the least popular among the younger generation. Only 5.3 percent of those in their 20s and 5 percent of those in their 30s said that she was doing a good job. Among those in their 60s, 18.1 percent had a positive view of Park.The survey was conducted on 1,088 mobile phone users aged 19 or over on Oct. 31 through the random digit dial method.

Ideally, social innovation helps us to tackle the root cause of the problems, instead of just to mitigate symptoms,” said Tim Draimin, the executive director of Social Innovation Generation based in Vancouver, in a recent interview with The Korea Herald.For over a decade, Draimin has put effort into international nonprofit organizations and the social innovation ecosystem in Canada. In particular, he actively worked on bridging social innovation initiatives among the government, private companies, educational institutes and others. He visited Seoul last week to give a speech at the 2016 Future Innovation Forum in Seoul, hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government under the theme of “A Window to the Future.”Tim Draimin, executive director of Social Innovation Generation, speaks during the 2016 Future Innovation Forum hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government last week. According to Draimin, social innovation is a set of new ideas that help people to tackle challenges such as social and environmental issues. It also helps people to imagine future forms of innovation. “Generally, business and social organizations we have now were built about half a century ago. Now is the time to challenge ourselves to change our minds,” said Draimin. He emphasized that partnerships across organizations, sectors and countries can lead to new and better outcomes for citizens, citing Grameen Danone as one such example. Established in 2006, Grameen Danone is a joint venture between French food product group Danone and Bangladesh’s Nobel prize-winning microfinance organization Grameen Bank. It provides children with key nutrients missing from diets in rural Bangladesh. “Hiring people in  Bangladesh community not only gave social impact in Bangladesh, but also led to new business opportunities and more cash flow to Danone.“Progressive businesses which want to retain smart employees and improve their relationship with community, should ask this question to themselves: How can we incorporate thinking about community in our project and economic values in our business model?”Draimin also spoke about government organizations’ role of establishing and promoting cross-sectoral business models through education.Draimin’s team at SIG is currently running a number of education programs and diploma courses at the University of Waterloo and other educational institutions. Some of the programs are even available online.“Younger people are generally more open to newer ideas and opportunities represented by social innovations. Young people can learn how to apply innovation principals to existing social problems, that are also applicable in business, government, community and universities,” Draimin said. “We face a lot of social challenges. In the future, many of these problems will require us to collaborate in order to understand the cultural differences between sectors. It will help us create new architecture of how we collaborate together to solve problems.”By Kim Da-sol","social innovation helps us ,social innovation is key ,social innovation helps ,ideally social innovation helps ,public administration social innovation",['Tim Draim'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.74410743  0.07107849

A slightly smaller proportion, 42.3 percent, predicted no impact on their jobs, while 13 percent of respondents were hopeful more jobs would be created. Those in the financial industry were most pessimistic about their job outlook, as fintech, robo advisors and internet-only banks are already having an impact in that industry, leading to reductions in the numbers of physical offices and employees. Some 81.8 percent of financial workers predicted job cuts. The survey also showed that over 60 percent of workers in the chemical and materials industries feel that way, while those in social welfare and religious services were least concerned about the prospect of their jobs being replaced by technology, with only 13.6 percent viewing it as likely.","korean workers feel threatened ,workers feel most threatened ,half of south korean ,poll of 600 workers ,workers feel threatened","['south korean', 'the Korea Employment Information Service ’s']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5549745   0.34217301

That figure translates into more than 4,200 criminal cases per month.Criminal charges filed against foreign nationals jumped nearly 44 percent to 38,355 last year compared to 26,663 in 2013, due mostly to an increase in cases of assault and traffic offenses. The upward trend is likely to continue this year, with the number of criminal cases involving foreign nationals estimated to surpass 50,000 by year-end.Of reported crimes by foreign nationals over the past three years, physical assault marked the highest figure, totaling 27,897, followed by white-collar crimes with 12,863 and theft at 6,281.

Na has so far attracted 113 million viewers on AfreecaTV since 2011, emerging as one of the most sought-after streamers here. He also has 1.3 million YouTube subscribers. Na Dong-hyun, who uses the alias “Great Library” on YouTube AfreecaTV, launched in 2005, relied heavily on influential streamers like Na to gain a growth momentum and seek profits in the fledgling streaming market. Their relations were, at least initially, amicable, as they needed each other to boost traffic and strengthen their brand. As top-rated streamers can make bigger profits on the strength of their fans and corporate sponsors, they begin to question the cut in profit they pay to AfreecaTV. As the streaming industry expanded, their relationship started to show signs of strain.The bubbling conflict exploded on Oct. 14 when AfreecaTV suspended Na’s broadcast channel for seven days, a punishment for conducting for-profit activities with a corporate advertiser without getting permission. About a week earlier, Na co-hosted a live broadcast via AfreecaTV with his wife Lee Umi, another well-known streamer known as Yum-Dang to advertise a mobile game called “Acheron.” The broadcast also featured well-known Japanese gravure idol Ai Shinozaki, who has been recruited as the main model for the game. Na Dong-hyun , Yum-Dang  and Japanese gravure idol Ai Shinozaki on AfreecaTVNa and Lee did not get permission from AfreecaTV for the commercial broadcast, which resulted in the suspension. What angered Na was not a procedure for getting prior permission but the profit-sharing scheme that he views as unfairly favoring AfreecaTV. “I don’t get their logic. I did the commercial, but somehow they tell me to share the revenue,” Na said on his YouTube channel last Friday. “That is why I’ve decided to move to YouTube. They don’t charge me for airing a commercial broadcast.”  A screenshot of Na on his YouTube channel on FridayNa claimed that AfreecaTV charges partner streamers up to 10 million won  per each sponsored broadcast, and his agency, CJ E&M;, an entertainment arm of CJ Group, has covered the fees. AfreecaTV confirmed that there is indeed a profit-sharing plan, but refused to reveal how much streamers pay. Lee Dae-woo, PR manager at AfreeaTV, told The Korea Herald that the company is following the rules: “Whether it is for commercial broadcast or new content, we are working closely with streamers to make sure their content abides by guidelines from the Korea Communications Commission.”In addition to corporate sponsorship, AfreecaTV offers another tool through which streamers make money with their videos: “star balloon,” a digital coin that viewers can buy and give to streamers as a gift. When streamers exchange the cyber money for real cash, AfreecaTV takes a cut of 30 to 40 percent, depending on their popularity. There are only a small group of star streamers who earn a huge amount of money, so average streamers tend to search for alternative source of income with their videos. A screenshot of Na streaming online game plays on AfreecaTV YouTube offers such an alternative. Initially, the US video site was used as a free storage of video files after AfreecaTV streamers wrapped up their broadcast. On top of that, whenever their past videos are watched, they can get ad money from YouTube, which is not much.A turning point came in August last year when YouTube kicked off Gaming, a new livestreaming channel. The service offers an alternate platform that could replace AfreecaTV, so Na seems to have made up his mind when he clashed with his longtime platform partner. Moreover, other IT giants like Facebook and Twitter have also joined the streaming fray, allowing their users to stream content directly on their platforms. A YouTube video that features Na playing Minecraft “Great Library’s decision to move to YouTube may not be an isolated event,” an industry expert said. “Now with more platform options available, popular streamers here will see more incentives to look for a new place to maximize profits.” Foreign streaming platforms such as YouTube and Twitch, however, are latecomers on the Korean market where AfreecaTV remains the dominant player. Their status might change if more top Korean streamers take cue from Na’s decision in search of better profit-sharing deals.

And the deficit has been widening at such an alarming pace that environmentalists both here and overseas call for immediate attention to the issue. Calculated by the Global Footprint Network, a country’s ecological balance shows how much natural resources a country has and how much it uses. The supply is measured by biocapacity, which is the capacity of a given biologically productive area to generate a supply of renewable resources and to absorb its spillover waste. Consumption is assessed in terms of ecological footprint, which is the amount of land required to sustain a person’s use of natural resources.  “ 1960s, Korea’s ecological footprint grew to exceed its biocapacity as Koreans demanded more from nature than our ecosystems could provide. Korea has run an ecological deficit ever since,” writes Global Footprint Network in its report “Korea Ecological Footprint Report 2016,” jointly published by GFN and the World Wide Fund for Nature, Korea. Globally, humanity’s overall demands on biocapacity outstrips global supply by 64 percent. In Asia-Pacific, the demands placed on biocapacity now exceed the region’s supply by 150 percent. Korea demands eight times more from nature than the ecosystems within its borders can sustainably provide. Simply put, humanity currently uses renewable resources equivalent to 1.6 planets, Simon Yoon, CEO of WWF-Korea said in a June report. For Korean citizens, this amounts to 3.3 planets. Korea’s vast environmental imbalance stems largely from its carbon emissions, the report said. Carbon emissions are the greatest demand that humans put on nature. South Korea is now the world’s eighth-largest contributor in terms of the world’s total carbon footprint -- the amount of carbon or greenhouse gases emitted by activities or organizations in the country -- accounting for 1.7 percent of the global footprint, although its population makes up only 0.7 percent of the global human population.The country’s carbon footprint now comprises 73 percent of the country’s ecological footprint, larger than the world’s average of 60 percent. In 1961, when the data began to be collected, it made up 29 percent of the country’s total footprint.Theoretically, a country can run a biocapacity deficit, as long as it can access extra resources and ecosystem services from elsewhere. But the problem is more countries around the globe are becoming biocapacity importers, leading to increased competition for constrained resources. Among them are Korea’s key trade partners and global powers -- the United States, Russia and China.  Climate change Climate change compounds the challenges of growing ecological constraints and puts our ecological and economic wealth at risk.For instance, the rise in sea levels is an impact of climate change in South Korea.According to the Environment Ministry last year, the southern island of Jeju saw a rise in sea level at a rate that was three times higher than the global average. Ocean temperatures near the Korean Peninsula are also increasing rapidly. The country also experienced an unprecedented heat wave this year, which continued for a record-breaking 24 days, with the temperature reaching up to 37 degree Celsius in Seoul and the lowest amount of rainfall since 1973.With such temperature ups and downs, climate change can have a domino effects on agricultural crop yields, ecosystems, public health and other areas of Korean society, experts say. Daily consumption decisions made by individuals can make a difference on Korea’s ecological footprint, experts say. According to the report by GFN and WWF, about 70 percent of Korea’s ecological footprint comes from the industries of infrastructure , food  and mobility . As a whole, Korea has much to benefit from phasing out fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy.    “Our country, which produces not a single drop of oil, has nothing to lose and much to gain from the shift from coal, oil and gas to non-fossil energy,” said Dr. Lee Hoe-sung, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.“Businesses that regard such a shift as just costs need to see it from a far longer term perspective,” he added.As part of a historic agreement in Paris late last year, Korea pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent from the business-as-usual level by 2030 across all economic sectors including energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture and waste. Separately, before the Paris agreement, Korea set a goal for new and renewable energy to supply 11 percent of primary energy by 2035, according to the fourth New and Renewable Energy Master Plan of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy in 2014.The government needs to reduce the amount of fossil fuels needed, experts added. As of 2014, fossil fuels accounted for 39 percent of South Korea’s total power sources. The South Korean government also recently announced that it would built 20 more coal-fired power plants by 2022.By Kim Da-sol","alarming pace that environmentalists ,deficit continues south korea ,ecological deficit continues ,ecological deficit continues south ,deficit has been widening","['South Korea ’s', 'the Global Footprint Network']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.43719807  0.12458275

The ministry said it has selected the refugees with the UNHCR's recommendation and conducted its own screening process from June to September to accept them here. This is the second time that South Korea has decided to bring in refugees from a foreign country under the UNHCR program. Last December, South Korea helped the resettlement of 22 refugees from Myanmar who had been staying at refugee camps in Thailand. The Myanmar refugees stayed at foreign support centers to learn Korean and to receive job education for about 10 months before they resettled in the Seoul metropolitan area last month, the ministry added.

The ministry said jamming signals were sent from five North Korean regions -- Haeju, Yonan, Pyonggang, Kumgang and Kaesong -- between March 31 and April 6 of this year, compared with just one spot in Kaesong in 2010.""The jamming signals were weak in the past, but recently they have become stronger,"" it said.South Korea has been beefing up its system to counter North Korea's attempts in recent years, and has been conducting drills regularly and actively developing technology that can detect the source of jamming attacks.","100 planes since 2010 ,planes since 2010 disruptions ,affect over 100 planes ,planes since 2010 lawmaker ,over 100 planes since","['North Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Jeong Yong - ki', 'Saenuri Party', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.0977708   0.62110442

Researchers at Yonsei University in Seoul said on Monday that children in middle and high school who were obsessed with dieting, fasting, or binge eating, and the use of unprescribed medication are twice more likely to commit suicide than those on a normal diet. The study’s result came after they had reviewed the previous survey from the Minister of Health and Welfare in 2014, which surveyed around 70,000 middle and high school students here who were on a diet.  123rfThe research team first divided the group of the surveyed participants into two groups. One had what the researchers described as a “normal diet” with regular exercise, prescribed weight loss pills and “one food diets,” in which the dieter only eats one kind of food. The diet methods of the other group included 24-hour fasting and unprescribed pills that caused vomiting and diuretic effect. The second group showed a higher probability of contemplating or attempting suicide than the first group, the study showed. The male subjects in the second group who were not eating for 24 hours or more turned out to be 1.7 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts and 1.8 times more to attempt suicide. For the girls, the difference was even higher: Those on extreme diets were 2.2 times more likely to commit suicide, the study revealed. Professor Park Eun-cheol who led the research attributed the result to “side effects regarding anxiety, decreased concentration and mood swings that are caused by unhealthy diets.” He added that “psychological problems and eating disorders seem to be the cause of the bad choices.” The researchers published their findings in the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences journal.

A petition was originally brought to the NHRCK in July 2009 by an assistant teacher at an elementary school. The school had refused to renew her contract after she did not submit to the test.The commission initially dismissed the case, citing it as an individual complaint, even though thousands of teachers took the test each year and 50 teachers had already filed a similar report. But in dismissing the complaint, the commission allowed the case to be taken to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which told Korea last year to apologize to the teacher and pay compensation, as well as remove visa requirements for HIV testing.Now, the NHRCK has backed the CERD decision, telling the Ministry of Justice to amend or rescind its rules on medical testing.“The Republic of Korea should actively implement CERD recommendations stemming from the individual communication system,” it said, citing in particular “compensation for damages suffered by the petitioner.”“Even the vast discretion embedded in immigration control hardly renders it reasonable that while Korean teachers and ethnically Korean foreign language instructors are exempted from the testing, only foreign E-2 visa holders are under an obligation to test for HIV,” the NHRCK said in its decision.It also highlighted the stigma that could be created by mandatory testing of specific groups.“Such stigmatization imputes the cause of infection to the group and misleads the general public to think that they are safe from the disease as long as it is limited to a small group of people,” it said.The decision is dated Sept. 8, but Ben Wagner, who represented the petitioner in both the CERD and NHRCK cases, said he was only notified Thursday. There is no notification of the decision on the commission’s website.Wagner welcomed the decision, which he said had exceeded his expectations.""This decision has been too long coming, the NHRCK delayed for nearly 8 years and that has to change. But I can say without hesitation that the decision is a very good one indeed,” he said. ""The NHRCK has taken a very strong position on protecting the rights of foreigners. But even further than that, the NHRCK has been very direct in insisting that the government ‘walks the talk’ when it comes to the international law standards that it professes to uphold and abide by but doesn’t always live up to. ""The NHRCK told The Korea Herald the decision was issued as an addition to the CERD recommendations last year, and it expected the Ministry of Justice to respond within 90 days of the report.The Ministry of Justice, which manages immigration affairs, was unavailable for comment as of press time.By Paul Kerry","teacher complaint over hiv ,stop its mandatory hiv ,nhrck backs teacher complaint ,complaint over hiv tests ,medical testing of teachers","['the National Human Rights Commission', 'Korea', 'NHRCK', 'NHRCK']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.08936134  0.0636373

According to Education Ministry data released by Rep. Lee Jong-bae of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of English teachers from native English-speaking countries at public schools fell from 8,520 in 2012 to 4,962 this year. Native English teachers and Korean teachers at primary and secondary schools in northern Seoul. High schools saw the biggest drop of 68.7 percent, followed by middle schools at 55.3 percent and elementary schools at 29.6 percent during the period of 2012 to 2016. By region, Incheon saw a 71.8 percent plunge over the same period, followed by Gyeonggi Province at 63.1 percent, North Chungcheong Province at 54.6 percent, South Chungcheong Province at 47.3 percent and North Gyeongsang Province at 46.8 percent. In the nation’s capital of Seoul, the number decreased by 43.2 percent. The reduction in native teachers appears to be a direct result of a national policy to have regional education offices fund a state free child care program. “We have limited budget, but the priority seems to have shifted from English education to other things, like funding child care programs or investing in school facilities,” an official from Seoul Education Office told The Korea Herald. “It seems that demand for native English teachers has also decreased, especially for high school students, as they tend to focus more on preparing for college admission exams.” “It also has been our goal to enhance English training for local teachers to gradually replace native speakers in the long term,” she said. Currently, foreign teachers are selected and dispatched to public schools through a program run by the National Institute for International Education and they are paid by regional education authorities. “Parents are increasingly bearing more burden to give private education to their children as the number of the native English teachers decreases,” lawmaker Lee said. “There need to be measures to lift the burden for English private education by hiring more native English teachers.” Under the previous Lee Myung-bak administration, the government encouraged public schools to recruit native English teachers as part of efforts to improve the quality of public English education and ease reliance on private education. Seoul Education Office, for example, assigned at least one foreign teacher to its public schools by 2012. According to the Education Ministry’s data, an estimated 5.9 trillion won  was spent for South Korean elementary, middle and high school students’ private education across the nation last year. But English fluency among students ranked just No. 27 out of 70 surveyed countries, down three notches from the previous year, according to global education institute Education First’s index.

Under a system called “dolgyeokdae,” or “storm troopers,” authorities recruit orphans and other underprivileged youngsters in particular and force them to labor up to midnight, while offering monthly wages the equivalent of a few bowls of noodles, it said. “I was not paid at all during my days at a first dolgyeokdae, and in the second one, I was made to carry some 75 kilograms of bricks all the way to the 20th floor every day, but with my pay I could only afford two candies or two packs of sweet potatoes,” said Park Kyung-ho, who defected in 2009 after working for three years at a state-run construction site. “My goal was to enter the Workers’ Party because I thought people like me, with a poor background, had to battle my way, so I worked really hard. But when I told a party executive about that, he said in a sorry voice it would be unlikely given my parents’ records. So I escaped, frustrated.” The report said the members of the groups, many of whom are children, are required to follow military-like disciplines for about 10 years. In addition to harsh labor, beatings and hunger prevail there, as well as injuries and deaths due to the lack of proper equipment. The stripped salaries are estimated to total 7.5 trillion North Korean won, about $975 million annually. The report came amid growing calls for countries around the world to no longer accept North Korean workers who are also known to live in harsh conditions and who are used as a cash cow to fund leader Kim Jong-un’s nuclear and missile programs. In its watershed survey released in February 2014, the UN Commission of inquiry pointed to slavery-like practices at some prison camps. “What happens to the overseas workers happens because it also happens inside North Korea. The suffering people in North Korea also deserve the attention we pay to the overseas workers,” said Kwon Eun-kyoung, director of the civic group. “We plan to translate the paper into English and submit it to the UN special rapporteur and other UN mechanisms, as well as UN representatives of especially Security Council member countries.”Ahn Youn-kyo, head of the UN’s human rights office in Seoul, said: “We will look into the report in detail later on, but in the dolgyeokdae system there are sources of rights violations given the discrimination and violence that occur there.” “North Korea, too, as a UN member and signatory of four related conventions including on children’s rights and discrimination against women, is obliged to abide by them and protect its people.”By Shin Hyon-hee","north korean regime plunders ,975 million yearly ,korean regime plunders at ,korean regime plunders ,labor estimated at 975m","['north korean', 'Seoul', 'North Korea']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.29546249  0.06997173

This is down from 8,000 won for rice and 2,000 won for corn traded in the same county earlier in the year after torrential rains and floods disrupted food supplies reaching the remote northwestern part of North Korea. Jiro Ishimaru, who heads the Osaka office of Japan's Asia Press, told the RFA that grain prices seem to have fallen to pre-flood levels. He then cited insiders reporting from the reclusive country that said while rice is not plentiful, shipments are arriving in stricken areas, which is lowering prices.Besides food prices, the media outlet said that North Korean authorities tried to give precedence in regards to rations to people who lost their homes due to the floods but because so many people lined up to get free food, it was forced to reconsider the practice.According to some estimates, the floods caused by heavy rains accompanied by Typhoon Lionrock left more than 500 people dead or missing, and more than 140,000 others homeless.","corn trading for 300 ,stabilizing in korea flood ,rice prices stabilizing ,in korea flood hit ,areas report rice prices","['North Korea', 'japanese', 'Asia Press', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Musan', 'North Hamgyong Province', 'north korean']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.34452167  0.23599042

Emergency handling of child abuses rose by 54.1 percent from the same period a year earlier. The number of victims who received a psychological therapy and counselling also jumped 40 percent. The government further mapped out its plan to make it mandatory for all preschools to be assessed and authorized to curb child abuses cases. When abuses occur in preschools, the grade of the schools will be lowered. It will also run a big data system called “e-child happiness support system” to predict families where children are at higher risks of being abused and keep track of children’s attendance records at schools and parents’ finance and medical records. The government will also monitor preschools’ use of CCTV and crack down on unauthorized teachers and child care service operators offering child care services and step up parenting education for parents.

The report by Byeon Mi-ri, chief of the Global Future Research Center under the Seoul Institute, also showed that households consisting of one or two people will account for 62 percent of Seoul’s 4.1 million total households by then.  Byeon attributed the decrease in population to high living costs, along with the general trend that involves gradually less people living in the country’s most populous city. As of 2016, about 10.26 million people live in Seoul. But the figure has consistently declined since topping 11 million in 1992.Most of those who left the city are expected to settle down in the so-called capital region of Gyeonggi Province and Incheon, Byeon noted.During the time, Seoul is likely to see a gradual decrease in the working age population , coupled with a continued increase in the senior population made up of those 65 and over.The 15-64 group will drop from 7.5 million to 5.45 million, along with the major consumer group  shrinking from 800,000 to 642,000. This will likely fuel the economic slump, the report noted.The birth rate is also set to decrease, with women of childbearing age falling to 960,000 from the current 1.5 million. But the average life expectancy will be 85.1 for men and 90.7 for women. The average life expectancy for those living in Seoul as of 2014, according to state-run Seoul Statistics, was tallied at 78.99 for men and 85.48 for women.Between the rising life expectancy and falling birth rate, the median age will be set at 52 instead of the current 39. Byeon’s report said the change in demographic will likely spur changes in the lifestyles of Seoulites, with “Social Tribe,” “Nomadingle,” “Me Gray Senior” and “Passive Silver” being the key words of 2040 Seoul.“Social Tribe” refers to those who seek to solve their problems by actively sharing information within the online community via social networking service. “Nomadingle” -- a combination of nomad and single -- are those not constrained by social norms.“Me Gray Senior” refers to the wealthy aged population who actively partakes in social activities, with the flip side of this being the “Passive Silver” group who commit their lives to supporting their family and end up with limited financial means and roles within society. The report was based on data from Statistics Korea and the Seoul Metropolitan Government. It is to be presented at the institute’s seminar on the theme of the city’s future, to be held Tuesday at the Seoul City Hall.By Yoon Min-sik","seoul million total househol ,2040 report south korea ,16 million by 2040 ,current 10 million population ,of seoul million total","['South Korea ’s', 'Byeon Mi - ri', 'the Global Future Research Center', 'the Seoul Institute', 'Seoul']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.45752758  0.4596805

Another 32 percent will be made up of two-member households, she predicted.The increase in such households can be attributed to the growth in women's economic activities and the change in views about marriage, which is already leading to many people opting to stay single or marry at a later age, experts say. Other reasons include the rise of divorces and elderly citizens left alone after the death of a spouse, and young people who don't have a job stable enough to start a family.According to the report, based on data from Statistics Korea and the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Seoul population will shrink to 9.16 million by 2040 from the current 10 million, due to the decrease in the overall birthrate and high housing-related fees.The working age population, between 15 and 64, will also decrease to 5.45 million from the current 7.5 million, it said.Such a development can lead to a possible slowdown of economic growth.South Korea's life expectancy, meanwhile, is expected to increase to 85.1 years for men and 90.7 years for women by 2040.The country's life expectancy came to 81 years as of end-2013, up 8.6 years from 72.5 years in 1990, according to government data.The details of the report will be released at the institute's seminar on the future of the capital city to be held at city hall Tuesday.","seoul population report households ,30 percent of homes ,60 percent of seoul ,majority of seoul population ,million households another 32","['household', 'Seoul', 'the Global Future Research Center', 'the Seoul Institute']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.83102924  0.30220681

Park Kwang-on, a total of 2.05 million married women were on a career lull due to marriage, pregnancy or child care reasons, accounting for 21.8 percent of the 9.42 million married women aged 15-54. The data from April 2015 was provided by Statistics Korea.While 79.9 percent of unmarried women aged 30-34 were employed, a far less 47.3 percent of the married women had jobs.Among those who were married and not working, 38.8 percent of them had been on a career break for 10 years or more. The corresponding percentages for five-10 years and three-five years were 23.6 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively.Statistics also showed that 62.4 percent of those on a career break were out of the workforce for at least five years, illustrating the difficulties women face in re-entering the job market, Park said.It took an average of 9.7 years for women who had children to return to work.123rfPark pointed out that the government measures to support job re-entries of married women have been insufficient, as they only target those seeking to be re-employed within five years of leaving work.Park said he has therefore submitted a bill to lengthen the job re-entry period eligibility to 10 years for receiving various tax benefits. The bill also includes a clause to offer married women an income tax cut of 50 percent for the five years following re-employment. This takes into account the average salary of a re-employed woman in her 30s at 12 million to 15 million won .Park also proposed raising tax credits on personnel expenses from the current 10 percent to 20 percent for small and mid-sized companies when they employ women who had been on a career break due to pregnancy or child care.“South Korean women’s economic participation rate stands at 55.6 percent, which is in the mid to low level among the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development members.

According to the index, Busan showed $20.45 billion of total GDP at risk, followed by Daegu , Incheon , Daejeon  and Gwangju .The report said the South Korean capital could be hit hard by a windstorm, mainly due to its geographical location in the northwest Pacific typhoon belt.By threat type, a windstorm was the highest risk factor for Seoul, with potential economic loss calculated at $44.68 billion, followed by an oil price shock , market crash , flood , pandemic  and drought .Among 301 cities, Seoul was also the third most exposed city to potential losses from natural threats, including flood and drought. Seoul showed the world’s highest exposure to drought, due to the fact that the Korean Peninsula suffered its worst drought in the past century in 2012.But despite South Korea’s strongest earthquake last week, the report calculated the potential losses from earthquakes at zero. In terms of man-made economic threats, the report said that as South Korea lacks oil and gas resources, Seoul was vulnerable to a market crash and an oil price shock, placing the country in third for highest exposure to an oil price shock in the world. The report added that one-third of Seoul’s total exposure to economic threats come from emerging threats, including pandemic, cyberattacks and solar storms.“The nature of these threats is changing, too. Certain extreme weather events linked to climate change are increasing in severity and frequency. Man-made threats, such as cyberattacks and market crash, are increasingly significant as companies expand into new markets and territories,” said Inga Beale, CEO of Lloyd’s.“ is a wake-up call to us all, as disasters that have occurred in the past are likely to do so again in the future,” Beale added in the report.By Kim Da-sol","third biggest economic loss ,seoul ranks third in ,biggest economic loss globally ,the third biggest economic ,third biggest economic","['Seoul', 'the Cambridge Center for Risk Studies', 'the University of Cambridge Judge Business School', 'UK', 'Lloyds']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62067622  0.48587435

According to statistics from UNESCO on the mobility of students in 2014, the number of Korean students studying abroad was 116,942. Among South Korean students, the most popular destination was the United States, with 64,693 students, or more than half of the total, choosing to study in the country. Japan was the second most favored destination, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada. According to the latest census released this year, South Korea’s population surpassed 50 million as of last year, a 2.7 percent increase from 49.7 million in 2010. The nation ranked 28th in the world in terms of population, according to the 2015 CIA World Factbook, when its figure was 49.1 million.Participants attend the Korea Study Abroad and Emigration Fair held at Coex in southern Seoul in March. The UNESCO data showed that an estimated 5 million students around the world studied outside of their home countries last year, more than double the 2.1 million who did so in 2000. North America and Western Europe hosted a combined 57 percent of the mobile students. The US was the favorite destination not only among Koreans, but among all international students, hosting 19 percent of the students. The UK came in second, receiving 10 percent of international students. Australia and France shared the No. 3 spot, both respectively accepting 6 percent of international students.  China, the world’s most populous country with a population of 1.36 billion as of 2015, sent the most students overseas, with 712,157 students studying abroad for higher education. India, which has the second-biggest population of 1.25 billion, ranked No. 2, sending 181,872 students abroad. Germany came in third with 119,123. South Korea is also increasingly becoming a popular destination for foreign students, with the total number of foreigners studying here exceeding 100,000 this year. According to data compiled by the Education Ministry and Higher Education in Korea , 104,262 students had enrolled in local schools as of April 1, a far cry from just 3,954 in 2000.Among them, 60.5 percent were studying for a degree in Korea. The biggest portion of foreign students were from China at 61.7 percent, followed by Vietnam at 5.5 percent, Mongolia at 3.6 percent, the US at 2.5 percent and Japan at 2.5 percent. Korea University had 4,333 foreign students enrolled this year, topping the chart among local universities. Of them, 1,564 were pursuing degrees, with the rest being exchange students or attending language courses.Kyung Hee University ranked second with 3,655 students, followed by Yonsei University with 3,223, Sungkyunkwan University with 2,783 and Chung-Ang University with 2,033. Outside the top five schools, Hanyang University, Konkuk University, Dongguk University, Kookmin University and Seoul National University made the top 10 list with over 1,500 foreign students each, according to the data. While the number of incoming foreign students as well as outgoing local students remains high, the total student enrollment quotas among 141 four-year universities has declined by 21,867 over the past three years since the Ministry of Education launched its university restructuring plan in 2014. According to data obtained by Rep. Yoo Eun-hye of The Minjoo Party of Korea, 77 percent of slashed admission quotas were concentrated on universities outside the nation’s capital Seoul. The Education Ministry has pushed universities to reduce student admission quotas as part of efforts amid the falling birthrate. The fertility rate, the number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, was at 1.24 this year, well below the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 1.68.

According to the Korean Institute of Criminology, the total number of crimes stood at 1.93 million in 2014, which marks 3,767 offenses per 100,000 in the country with a 50 million population. The number of criminal offenses has remained at around 1.9 million since 2010 after it reached a peak of 2.16 million crimes in 2009. But only 69.5 percent of those committed crimes involved arrests in 2014, compared to 78.4 percent in 2005. The number of murders committed in the country over the period of 2005-2012 remained at around 1,000, before falling slightly to 966 in 2013 and further to 938 in 2014. The number of robberies dropped from 5,266 in 2005 to 1,618 in 2014.In contrast, sex crimes including rape and sexual harassment soared from 13,631 in 2005 to 29,863 in 2014, with the crime rate per 100,000 people having risen from 28.3 in 2005 to 59.2 in 2014. “Unlike other types of serious crimes seeing a decline in number in recent years, the number of sex crimes has increased,” said researcher Hwang Ji-tae of the KIC. “For sex crimes, it is more difficult to learn about the status quo with official data as victims are less likely report such crimes to the police.” The report also showed a rise in the number of senior offenders. Those aged between 51 and 60 among criminals arrested for murder and other serious offenses accounted for 7.5 percent of the total in 2005, but it more than doubled to 14.4 percent in 2014. The portion of those aged 61 or over surged from 3.1 percent to 6.7 percent during the same period. Violent crimes committed by those aged 51 or over accounted for 13.1 percent in 2005, which increased to 28.4 percent in 2014. The proportion of those who committed asset-related crimes including fraud rose from 16.5 percent in 2005 to 30.6 percent in 2014. The portion of those in their 50s who committed sex crimes also saw an increase from 8.1 percent in 2005 to 13.9 percent in 2014. Those in their 60s committed 3.2 percent of such crimes in 2005 and 6.7 percent in 2014. “There was a clear rise in the number of criminals in their 50s and 60s who committed serious, violent and asset-related crimes, while there was a decline in the number of 20s and 30s who committed such offenses,” Kim Ji-seon, a researcher at KIC, said in the report. “It is a result of a growth in the number of the baby boom generation who are now in their 50s and 60s.” By Ock Hyun-ju","decreased but sex crimes ,decade with the arrest ,crimes against women surged ,93 million in 2014 ,sex crimes and senior",['the Korean Institute of Criminology'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64310658  0.37441543

The ratio of female workers who received wages below two thirds the national average reached 37.8 percent in 2014, the highest among 22 OECD members checked and 6.8 percentage points more than No. 2 Ireland's number of 31 percent.The figure has steadily fallen from 45.8 percent in 2000 to below 40 percent, but it is still higher than the ratio of underpaid Korean working men at 15.4 percent.

The concentration of women in low-paying jobs was above that of major economies including the United States, Great Britain, Germany and Japan, which all remained below the 30 percent mark, the OECD report showed.The gender pay gap was largely attributable to the comparably larger number of qualified women leaving their jobs for child care who later have difficulties in finding higher-paying employment. Experts say the public and private sectors should make concerted efforts to utilize highly educated women and help them retain their jobs by expanding childcare programs.  ""The short-term employment support measures have their own limits,"" Jung Sung-mi, a researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, said.

These and other plans were released by the Health and Welfare Ministry in the latest round of cancer management measures. YonhapFor early diagnosis of lung cancer and to lower the death rate from the disease, low-dose spiral computer tomography will be offered free of charge to those aged 55-74 who have been smoking about one pack, or 20 cigarettes, a day for the past 30 years.Further details of those eligible for the checkup will be decided upon reviewing the examination capacities of each region’s public and state-run cancer centers and their respective budgets.Lung cancer has been the country’s biggest cause of death among cancer patients, accounting for 22.8 percent. Some 23.5 percent of lung cancer patients live for more than five years upon diagnosis, shorter than the average 69.4 percent of all cancer patients. Early diagnosis is therefore imperative, the ministry said.The ministry said it will also set up regional support centers for some 1.37 million cancer patients nationwide. It will also diversify hospice services so that up to 25 percent of terminal-stage cancer patients would have access by 2020.Low-income cancer patients will receive state subsidies regardless of their place of diagnosis.Currently, health insurance subscribers could benefit from the subsidies if they were diagnosed through state-managed examinations.Those who have received abnormal findings in their general checkup will also be advised to take further tests with state subsidies. Currently, the system is only available for those in risk of stomach and colorectal cancers. It will expand to liver, breast and cervical cancers.The government will also work to advance an infrastructure to manage cancer such as by constructing a data base for each cancer type to follow the diagnosis, treatment and development of the diseases.A geographic information system will be established to help figure out the causes and risks related to cancers to be released for public viewing by 2017.","next year cancer patients ,implemented next year cancer ,free lung health checkups ,next year cancer ,year cancer patients",['south korean'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59611619  0.27213138

According to a report on the employment structure and income disparity of seniors released by the Korea Labor Institute, the Gini coefficient -- a measure of inequality -- for people aged 65 or over in Korea was 0.422, the second highest after Chile at 0.428. On a scale between 0 and 1, the closer the Gini ratio is to 1 the greater the income inequality. When the Gini index is above 0.4, the extent of income disparity is seen as serious.The inequality among senior citizens is in stark contrast to the relatively low level of income disparity among the working population. YonhapThe Gini coefficient among Koreans aged 18 and 65 was 0.28, lower than major economies like the United States at 0.392, the United Kingdom at 0.353, Germany at 0.299 and France at 0.294. The income inequality among the elderly is attributed to a growing number of retirees landing low-quality, low-paying jobs, according to the report. “The increase in the employment rate for senior citizens will likely continue as baby boomers born between 1955 and 1963 have started to retire,” researcher Kim Bok-soon said in the report. “But the jobs are mostly irregular, part-time and unstable, providing poor working conditions.” The employment rate for senior citizens aged 60 or over was 38.9 percent last year, with them accounting for 21.9 percent of the working-age population. According to Statistics Korea, 11.6 percent of the entire working population took home less than the minimum wage  last year, while 37.1 percent of the elderly earned less than the minimum wage. Nearly 57 percent of the senior citizens received low-pay, which is two-thirds of the nation’s median income. Women in the age group were also more exposed to income disparity, with 71.6 percent of them receiving low pay and 46.6 percent of them being paid less than the minimum wage, the data showed. The poverty rate -- the proportion of people with net income below a defined threshold -- for senior citizens with more than two family members in a household was 47.6 percent, while the figure for elderly living on their own was 67.1 percentMost of the working seniors found temporary, irregular employment in the services, health care and social welfare industries, the report said. “Given the senior generation entering the labor force right now has not prepared themselves for after-retirement life and most of them are willing to remain in the labor market even by holding low-quality job, the government needs to release policies to curb income inequality and create quality jobs for seniors to make use of their experience at work,” said Kim.

This development has raised speculation in the South that conditions in the North may be becoming unstable and that the reason behind the defections is changing.Official data showed that while only 19 percent of defectors who escaped before 2001 referred to themselves as having above average incomes when they lived in the North, this shot up to 55.9 percent after 2014.""Compared with the past, the number of North Korean defectors seeking more opportunities and better lives for themselves in South Korea has increased,"" a government official said.Seoul has said the North Korean government's strong pressuring of its overseas workers and diplomats to send more money to the North is one reason more people who are socially well off are defecting. Tougher international sanctions have cut off many of the regime's traditional sources of hard currency. In April, a group of 13 North Koreans working at a restaurant in the Chinese eastern city of Ningbo defected to South Korea en masse. In June, three more North Korean restaurant employees working in China escaped to Seoul. Most North Korean restaurant workers are chosen from families with good backgrounds who are trusted by Pyongyang.In addition, Thae Yong-ho, a minister at the North Korean Embassy in Britain, recently defected to the South with his family, making him one of the highest ranking officials to flee to South Korea.Seoul's unification ministry said that Thae defected due to his disillusionment with North Korea and aspiration for freedom and democracy. Concerns for a better future for his children were also factored into his decision, it added.","894 north koreans escaped ,korea rose 15 percent ,north korean defectors coming ,nk defectors up 15 ,korean defectors coming","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'North Koreans', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Unification']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.16950431  0.6138798

Of the total budget, 12.159 trillion won will be spent to improve the country's existing aircraft and anti-missile capabilities and the remaining 28.176 trillion won will be injected as operating costs for troops and armaments, the statement said. Starting with its fourth underground nuclear test in January, North Korea has escalated its saber-rattling this year by firing off numerous ballistic missiles, including those launched from a submarine. Most recently, the isolated communist regime test-fired three ballistic missiles into the East Sea in a new show of force days ahead of the 68th anniversary of its government's establishment which falls on Friday.The missiles -- determined to be upgraded mid-range Rodong missiles -- all flew about 1,000 kilometers and landed in waters some 400 km inside Japan's air defense identification zone in the East Sea.

By law, tunnels must have various safety facilities, depending on their length and the level of potential danger. Tunnels longer than 500 meters must have an escape route, for instance, while some are required to have broadcasting speakers installed to warn drivers of an accident ahead. The report given by the ministry showed that 86 of 236 tunnels on highways and 133 out of 278 tunnels on national roads did not have the mandatory escape routes. It also said 27 of 192 highway tunnels and 40 of 231 national road tunnels did not have the needed speakers.Also missing were emergency phone boxes, automatic fire detectors and entrance blockades, according to the report. Rep. An Ho-young, a member of the parliamentary committee on transportation who had asked for the ministry data, said the chances of an accident turning into a bigger disaster is especially high inside tunnels because paths for escape are limited and drivers cannot see what's ahead.

Manufacturers can choose from three types of labels, each highlighting different hazards. The government, however, will not require different positioning of the labels.

According to statistics released annually by the Education Ministry in August, the number of students in nationwide preschool, elementary, middle and high schools reached 6.63 million as of April 1, down 2.7 percent from the previous year. The number of middle school students saw the biggest drop of 8.1 percent, compared to a 1.5 percent decrease for elementary school students and a 2 percent fall for high school students. The number of preschoolers increased by 3.2 percent.  Average class sizes also became smaller.  The number of students per class was 22.4 for elementary schools, 27.4 for middle schools and 29.3 for high schools, statistics showed. The student-to-teacher ratio also dwindled, with one teacher in charge of 14.6 elementary school students, 13.3 middle school students and 12.9 high school students. The number of teachers stood at 491,152, a 0.3 percent rise from a year earlier. Their average age was 40.6 years and 70 percent of them were women. Nearly 10 percent of them were not on a regular payroll at schools. Despite the overall fall in students, the number of those from multicultural backgrounds jumped by 20.2 percent from the year before, standing at 99,186 and accounting for 1.7 percent of the total number of students. Students of Vietnamese descent made up the biggest portion at 24.2 percent, followed by Chinese at 21.3 percent, Japanese at 13 percent, Filipino at 12.6 and ethnic Korean-Chinese at 12.4 percent. Nearly 80 percent of them were born in Korea. The number of foreign students also continued to rise, reaching 104,262 in 2016. Among them, 60.5 percent were studying for a degree in Korea. The biggest portion of foreign students were from China, 61.7 percent, followed by Vietnam at 5.5 percent, Mongolia at 3.6 percent, the US at 2.5 percent and Japan at 2.5 percent. Students celebrate their graduation at Seoul National University in Seoul on Monday. About 3.5 million high school graduates, or 69.8 percent of students, entered universities this year, down 2.7 percent from last year. The university entrance rate has declined gradually from 75.4 percent in 2010. Nearly 34 percent of high school students in Korea got a job soon after graduation without pursuing higher education. “Now, there are 120,960 fewer first-year middle school students than first-year high school students. If universities maintain the current admission quota, they will likely have trouble recruiting students,” said an official from the Education Ministry. The Education Ministry has pushed universities to reduce student admission quotas as part of restructuring efforts amid the falling birthrate. The fertility rate, the number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, reached 1.24 this year, showing a 2.8 percent increase from a year earlier. It is still well below the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 1.68.The ministry has also offered state funds to universities complying with its recommendation to remove or merge certain majors, create courses in engineering and science and set up career-focused colleges to curb a growing mismatch in the labor market between young people’s career expectations and skills employers look for from job candidates.The mismatch has been cited as one of the reasons behind the high unemployment rate for young people aged between 15 and 29, which stood at 9.2 percent in July.

The index has a total of four categories, including economic participation and opportunity, education and health and survival. South Korea’s rank in women’s economic participation and opportunity dropped significantly since 2006, the year the index was first published, according to the report. In 2006, South Korea ranked in the 96th place in the specific category, belonging to the lowest 17 percent. Last year, the country ranked at an even lower place, 125th, belonging to the lowest 14 percent.123rfSouth Korea was also placed at the bottom -- along with Japan and Turkey – among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in this year’s “glass-ceiling index” compiled and published by the British weekly the Economist. The index was created after combining data on women’s higher education, labor force population, maternity rights and representation in leadership roles, among others.“In South Korea the favorable parental-leave system is mainly a response to its aging populations and shrinking labor force; but in other aspects it is far behind the Nordic countries, whose commitment to sexual equality goes back a long way,” the paper wrote. A 2014 report from the International Monetary Fund found that the wide gender wage gap in South Korea is linked to the country’s employment market that often offers little job security. “These indexes show that little is being done to tackle gender disparity in South Korea,” wrote researcher Park Geum-ryeong in the report. “Among many other things, Korea should come up with its own gender index that is conscious of the country’s unique social and cultural climate that affects the lives of women, such as social pressure on child care and domestic chores.”By Claire Lee","south korea at 115 ,gender equality last year ,latest gender gap report ,annual index on gender ,korea at 115 out","['South Korea', 'Gender Gap Report', 'the World Economic Forum', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'the World Economic Forum', 'South Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.5510121   0.65965992

Women made up 19.1 percent of offenders last year, according to the report. A sniffer dog goes through parcels at the express cargo terminal at Incheon Main Customs. Teenagers’ drug use was also higher and the prosecution said this was because Korean students might be more exposed to drugs through international exchange programs. Some 128 adolescents aged 19 or younger were caught last year, up 25.5 percent from the previous year. The growth in the number of drug offenders is attributed to increased exposure and access to drugs through the internet and social media, the report pointed out. In association with social media, 15.97 kilograms, or 20 percent, of the seized drugs were traded via express parcel or international post. During a massive crackdown on drug dealings in June last year, some 100 people, including a doctor and teacher, were nabbed selling and buying drugs via social media. The most common drugs trafficked into the country was methamphetamine at 56.6 kilograms, followed by marijuana at 24 kilograms, according to the report, with a notable increase in transactions of propofol and zolpidem.Overseas suppliers of drugs have also grown including those from China, Japan, Mexico and Southeastern Asian countries such as Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, the prosecution said. The prosecution tightened its clampdown on drug trafficking in partnership with the police in April. It closed down 202 websites from June 2014 to this month and ordered the deletion of some 1,377 postings related to drug transactions. It plans to adopt a program later this year that can automatically detect drug-related posts online to help their investigation.

It showed that the average retirement age of workers with desk jobs was 55.7. Those with manufacturing jobs retired at the age of 58.7 on average.The prescribed retirement age by the companies’ regulations, however, was the same for all types of jobs, at 58 on average.The biggest gap in retirement age among job types was in the petrochemical industry. While those with manual jobs retired at 58 on average, those working desk jobs retired at 50. A similar phenomenon was seen in the shipbuilding industry.The steel industry, on the other hand, showed almost no gap between the job types in their average retirement age. The report cited a relatively larger number of companies in the industry with employment stability, such as POSCO.“It is true that there are more demands on site for those with experienced skills in the manufacturing field,” Lee Ho-chang, a senior researcher at Korea Labor Foundation, told Yonhap News.“It also seems that the lower participation rate among those with desk jobs in the companies’ labor unions also was a factor.”The report also revealed that earlier retirement was more rampant in large companies than small and mid-sized businesses.While the official retirement age for those with desk jobs at companies with at least 500 employees averaged at 58.5, the actual retirement age was 51.8.The official and actual retirement age for those with office jobs at smaller companies that had between 100 to 299 employees was 57.8 and 57.6 respectively. Those in blue-collar jobs retired at 59.8 on average, meaning they worked past the official retirement age at 57.6.The report said this could be due to active re-employment among the smaller companies with high demand for skilled workers with labor shortages.It added that employment policies against an aging society should not just focus on alleviating personnel expenses, such as through voluntary resignation or a wage peak system, but comprehensively reconsider how to foster the retired workforce aged 60 and older. A peak wage system gradually decreases the salaries of employees past retirement age to make the employment market more flexible.South Korea’s portion of the population aged 60 and over is expected to grow from 18.5 percent last year to 47.4 percent in 2060.“Advanced countries such as Germany put much effort into advancing the work capacity and skills of elderly laborers through consistent re-education,” said senior researcher Park Myung-joon at the KLI.“We must also reinforce such a retraining system and introduce a wage system that centers on job functions and skill levels as we prepare for the full enforcement of the extension of the retirement age to 60.”The obligatory extension of the retirement age to 60 came into effect for all companies with at least 300 employees this year and will expand to smaller companies from next year.","desk jobs retire earlier ,workers retire earlier report ,collar workers retire earlier ,institute surveyed 272 businesses ,with desk jobs retire",['the Korea Labor Institute'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.69928282  0.21805361

Also noticeably, the number of those arrested aged 19 or under rose by 25.5 percent to 128, compared to 102 tallied last year, according to the data.It said overseas suppliers of the drugs, as well as the age, sex and nationality of those dealing with the illegal substances have diversified over the last year.The authorities confiscated 82.5 kilograms of major banned drugs, including marijuana and meth, last year, up 13.6 percent from the previous year.The SPO said it will continue its crackdown on drug offenders in collaboration with the police and develop a monitoring system to prevent people from searching for drugs online. It also plans to strengthen cooperation with foreign authorities to arrest drug offenders overseas.","crimes rose 19 percent ,drug arrests in korea ,arrests in korea hits ,drug related crimes rose ,record high in 2015","['South Korea', ""the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.38226235  0.68159163

Up until 2014, the biggest number of such children were either children of unwed mothers or those with divorced parents. According to the study jointly complied by the Welfare Ministry and the National Foster Care Center, a total of 4,503 children were separated from their parents and placed under government protection last year. The largest proportion of them, 25 percent, were those who had been physically or emotionally abused at homes, while 23.7 percent were those from broken homes. Meanwhile, 20 percent were children of unwed, single mothers. Members of an anti-child abuse organization stage a protest on Aug. 10, calling for strict punishment on parents of Shin Won-young, a seven-year-old who died in February after being severely abused and neglected by his father and stepmother. The stepmother was sentenced to 20 years in jail, while the child’s father was sentenced to 15 years behind bars. Only 6.68 percent were orphans who lost both parents, while 0.57 percent were children who got lost.South Korea has seen a number of high-profile child abuse cases this year, including the case of Shin Won-young, a 7-year-old child who had allegedly been locked up and beaten for three months by his stepmother before his death in February. To tackle child abuse, the Gender Ministry has been offering and encouraging Koreans to attend classes on child care and parenting. As of this year, about 80 percent of all reported child abusers are the victims’ parents.The report by the Welfare Ministry also showed that the number of abused children in government foster care increased from 2008-2015, from 891 to 1,094. Among the 4,503 children who were separated from their parents last year, 2,682 of them were admitted to shelters or children’s institutions, while 1,821 of them were either adopted or placed with their grandparents, relatives or temporary foster parents. The report also showed that children of unwed mothers who have been placed at shelters decreased significantly from 2008-2015, from 2,349 to 930. Last year, the Child Support Agency was established after a government study showed that 83 percent of all single parents in Korea never received any child support payments from their ex-spouses or ex-romantic partners as of 2012. Almost 80 percent of all Korean single parents are women, while about 90 percent of Korean adoptees are born to unwed mothers who have few resources to raise their children alone and are vulnerable to social stigmatization.

According to a report submitted by the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation at the request of Rep. Ahn Min-suk of The Minjoo Party of Korea, 136,900 high school graduates last year sat the College Scholastic Ability Test, also known as Suneung. The figure accounted for 21.56 percent of the total test applicants, up from 19.61 percent in 2013. High school seniors students study for the state-administered College Scholastic Ability Test, which is slated for November. YonhapSince 1993, South Korean students have taken a standardized college entrance exam every November, a process including a CSAT, interviews and essays. CSAT grades are seen as the most decisive factor in who enters top-tier universities, which has led a number of Korean students to sit the annual exam multiple times to get a higher score. Rep. Ahn, member of the parliamentary Education, Culture and Sports Committee, pointed to a lack of careers education as the reason behind the increase in the number of those who apply to repeat the CSAT exam while being fully enrolled at universities. According to the report, 17.2 percent of 294,855 new students at 153 universities in the 2014 school year dropped out or took a year of absence. “It is estimated that the growth in the number of  graduates who took the CSAT again happened because they did not enter the college they wanted,” the lawmaker said. “But it is also because they lacked education on their future career during high school years, chose a major without thinking about it much and decided to take the CSAT again .” By Ock Hyun-ju","graduates last year sat ,900 high school graduates ,school graduates last year ,high school graduates last ,korea college entrance exam","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation', 'Ahn Min - suk', 'the Minjoo Party', 'Korea', 'the College Scholastic Ability']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.40844086  0.82112253

Two victims who raised objections after the second round of verifications in April 2014 were also confirmed as category 2 victims.However, members of a group of victims and their families known as Gapimo and the Asian Citizens Center for Environment and Health argued that the government’s standard for recognizing the victims of toxic disinfectant was unfair. They also charged that the government did not consider victims suffering from other long-term health illnesses and underlying diseases.According to the government’s victim verification process, which was introduced in 2014 to provide due compensation and medical treatment, the scale goes from 1-4. A rating of 1 indicates a high level of certainty that their lung diseases were caused by the use of humidifier disinfectants. The ministry-run Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute explained that those who suffered lung-related diseases are classed as category 1 or 2 victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories 3 and 4.“The government still left some 130 people out, with 50 percent of them being put as category 4, a group that cannot even receive health monitoring from the government,” said Choi Ye-yong, head of ACCEH, during a press conference in Seoul on Friday. Choi Ye-yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health, speaks during a press conference in Seoul on Friday. YonhapThe ACCEH also argued that the government has so far put more victims into categories 3 and 4 than categories 1 and 2.In the first round of victim verifications in June 2013, 184 victims were confirmed as categories 3-4, whose health conditions were recognized by the government. After the second verification process in April 2014, 69.2 percent or 117 victims were put into categories 3-4. On Thursday, the ratio of categories 3-4 victims went up to 79 percent or 130 victims.“The government defines category 4 victims as those whose health problems have almost no connection with the use of humidifier disinfectants. There were three category 4 victims who passed away but are still listed as alive on the government record,” said Choi of the ACCEH.“This is because the government ignored the severity of the victims’ health conditions and did not conduct in-depth investigations into their health,” added Choi.Victims also argued that deaths of infants, victims with blood-flow disorders and a mother who had a stillborn child -- all confirmed as category 4 -- should be reconsidered. They argue they should be reclassified as categories 1-3, to at least receive state care and contribute to understanding the relationship between the use of humidifier disinfectant and other diseases.However, the ministry has so far deferred their decision to revise the standard by which victims are verified, sticking to categorizing victims by disease.“We will consider establishing an additional standard to find the relationship between the use of toxic disinfectant and diseases other than lung-related diseases,” said Seo Heung-won, director of the Environment Health Policy Division under the Environment Ministry.The ministry said that it would soon conduct another verification process regarding the remaining 587 victims who filed reports in December.But the number of victims is likely to increase as the government started receiving a fourth set of applications in April. A total of 3,031 cases have been filed as of Friday.Meanwhile, the National Assembly’s Special Committee said Friday that it cancelled its on-site inspection plan at the Reckitt Benckiser headquarters in Slough, UK, after RB headquarters notified them that they want to keep the investigation private. The Special Committee’s three-day trip to UK was slated for Aug. 22.RB CEO Rakesh Kapoor reportedly told them that RB headquarters cannot open the entire investigation process to media. CEO Kapoor also declined to offer an official apology to victims in Korea, according to the lawmakers.“It is very regrettable that the RB headquarters is not cooperating with us,” said Rep. Woo Won-sik of The Minjoo Party of Korea, the head of the special committee, during a press conference.But RB Korea said in an statement on Aug. 19 that the “RB headquarters was prepared to receive the National Assembly delegation in the UK and that the group's CEO intended to provide a full apology to the victims' representatives and the National Assembly members.""Rep. Woo added that it would request the RB headquarters to send a person in charge to be present for the Oct. 4 hearing. The humidifier disinfectant case came to light after four pregnant women died of unidentified lung-related diseases in 2011. A state-led investigation later confirmed a connection between at least 100 lung-related deaths and the chemicals used in humidifier disinfectants.By Kim Da-sol","victim evaluations under fire ,37 victims of toxic ,damage reports collected last ,confirmation of 37 victims ,humidifier disinfectant victim evaluations",['the Environment Ministry'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50882477  0.24504001

The average temperature in Seoul from Aug. 1-15 was 29.8 degrees Celsius this year, the highest since the nation started documenting daily weather in 1907. As of Aug. 15, 16 Koreans have died of heat-related causes, such as heat stroke. In 2012, 15 people died of heat-released diseases. The number was 14 in 2013 and one in 2014. Last year, 11 lives were lost to heat-related illnesses.YonhapThirteen out of the 16 deaths this year were reported since the last week of July. Heat wave warnings have been issued by the Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul for 11 consecutive days since July 31. The warning is issued when the daytime high hits 33 degrees Celsius and continues for at least two days. As of Aug. 15, 1,800 individuals had suffered heat-related diseases, which is 1.7 times higher than the total number of patients treated for the condition last year and 3.2 times higher than the number treated in 2014.Among all patients reported this year, the highest proportion of them, 26.8 percent, were those aged 65 or above. In addition, 21.2 percent of the patients developed heat-related diseases while staying indoors, and 28.1 percent developed them between 6 p.m. to 10 a.m. the next day. Lack of air conditioning and the so-called “tropical night” phenomenon -- defined by nighttime low temperatures staying above 25 degrees Celsius -- are considered some reasons behind the statistics. This year also saw the highest number of ozone warnings being issued -- 202 times as of August -- since the alert was introduced here in 1995. Ozone, a gas found in air pollution, is known to cause breathing attacks, indigestion and nausea in many people, especially children and seniors. In general, hot and sunny weather conditions increase the likelihood of high ozone concentrations. To avoid heat-related illnesses, the KCDC advised drinking plenty of fluids and wearing loose-fitting, lightweight clothing. When one cannot avoid staying outdoors in the hot weather, it is important to rest frequently in a cool spot and drink enough water, it added. The agency also stressed that heatstroke is a serious medical emergency and can be life-threatening. “If you see someone who has lost consciousness after being outdoors in hot weather, make sure you call 119 -- the Korean version of 911 -- and seek emergency and professional help,” health authorities said in a statement.

YonhapAccording to a poll on 873 people by job portal site Saramin released in November, a job seeker spends 60,000 won to prepare for each job interview. Nearly 70 percent of those surveyed said that they felt expenses were a “burden” and 30 percent gave up on attending job interviews due to financial problems. The announcement came amid mounting controversies over the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s implementation of the “Youth Allowance.” The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been opposing the program, ordering the city government to cancel the project and take back the money already distributed to 2,831 applicants. In what many see as a similar program, the municipality provides 500,000 won per month for up to six months to some 3,000 selected young people, who have lived in Seoul for more than a year, work less than 30 hours a week and are aged between 19 and 29. The Labor Ministry, however, drew a clear distinction between its scheme and Seoul City’s version. “It is serious that youth looking for a job give up on taking part in job interviews due to financial difficulties,” the minister said.“But Seoul City’s ‘Youth Allowance’ would take away job opportunities  because it does not set the young’s participation in job searching efforts as a precondition,” he said.“Seoul’s plan also broadly acknowledges individual activities unrelated to finding employment, it is highly probable that the youth are just settling for cash subsidies rather than actively look for a job.” Lee also said that some 35 of about 110,000 participants in the ministry-led job support program cancelled their application to apply for Seoul City’s “Youth Allowance” as the ministry does not offer support for expenses.  The Seoul Metropolitan Government welcomed the Labor Ministry’s plan, saying that it corresponds to the principle of the municipality’s program. “As the central government is rolling out a measure that is rarely different from Seoul City’s policy, the Ministry of Health and Welfare should withdraw its decision to cancel the ‘Youth Allowance’ program,” an official from Seoul Metropolitan Government said. “We will cooperate with the central government if there is common ground.”Under the current program, job seekers received cash in the first and second stage of their nine-month-long job consulting program encompassing counselling, vocational training and internship. The new plan, which will take effect in September, will benefit some 24,000 job seekers chosen by counsellors at job centers. The Youth Hope Fund will provide the budget of 7.4 billion won for the program. The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 29 stood at 9.2 percent in August.

The FKI did not provide the exact ratio of those married to unmarried.Those married currently had an average 1.5 children, while single female workers said they planned to have an average 1.1 children.South Korea's low birthrate has long been a serious problem, especially when its overall population is aging at one of the fastest rates in the world.An earlier report from the FKI showed the ratio of people aged65 years or more is expected to reach 35.15 percent of the total population in 2050, meaning those able to work may be outnumbered by those too old or too young to work.South Korea's birthrate came to a little over 1.2 percent in 2015, the lowest among all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.To tackle the problem, the central and regional governments have been offering various incentives to newlyweds and those who give birth, ranging from food stamps and tax breaks to payments of up to 5 million won  in cash for a fifth child.Those surveyed, however, said such incentives were neither adequate nor realistic.Nearly 7 out of every 10 people surveyed said the support measures were unrealistic, while only 5.4 percent said they were happy with the government measures.Fear of losing one's job or career apparently played a role in forcing people to postpone or even give up having children, the survey showed.Nearly half, or 47.8 percent of those surveyed, said government support must focus more on issues related to employment of those who give birth, while 42.2 percent of the total also noted a need to promote a work culture that encourages mothers to take childcare leave.","10 single female workers ,losing their jobs survey ,of unmarried female workers ,unmarried female workers ,korean industries 38 percent",['the Federation of Korean Industries'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51079226  0.4956657

The North earns about 82 billion won  annually from the sale of the fishing rights to its biggest ally in its coastal waters. All earnings have been funneled to prop up Kim Jong-un's leadership, according to the sources. ""It has been confirmed that Pyongyang has rolled up its sleeves to earn foreign currency by selling the fishing rights in its waters to China. Our analysis shows it has sold the rights above the Northern Limit Line  in the East Sea,"" an intelligence source said. It is widely known that the North has sold fishing rights to China in its waters above the NLL in the Yellow Sea, but this is the first confirmation that the communist state has sold fishing licenses in the East Sea. ""North Korea is selling fishing licenses through an intermediary trade agency,"" the source said. ""But it looks like North Korea plans to manage fishing rights sales directly in the future.""In 2004, Pyongyang and Beijing signed a deal to allow Chinese vessels to catch fish in the East Sea well above the NLL, but the allowed fishing areas didn't include the waters near the inter-Korean sea demarcation line, a government source said. He pointed out that given 900-1,000 Chinese vessels have recently been spotted fishing near the northern side of the sea demarcation line, it is confirmed that China has bought more fishing areas from the North.The sources said some 2,500 Chinese fishing boats are estimated to be fishing in the East Sea and the Yellow Sea waters.  North Korea's earnings from fishing right sales are more than double what the National Intelligence Service reported to the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee last month.

His hair fell out just from a breeze of wind or from merely walking around,” said the mother. The boy became completely bald within a week of taking the medicine. His parents took him to several hospitals, including Seoul National University Hospital, Severance Hospital, and Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. According to the parents, the doctors said the possibility of a full cure is only about 10 percent. The story of Chang spread after the mother sued the herbal medicine clinic and posted on an Internet cafe photos of her son before and after the baby took the medicine. The insurance company under which the clinic is registered investigated the issue. It found that the clinic was accountable for the baby’s physical condition and set the compensation fee at 3 million won . Many online commenters and the boy’s parents say that the fee is too low. The clinic is continuing to deny accountability. The clinic asserts that the toddler had health issues such as bronchitis before it took the medicine. It stated that he had been hospitalized due to enteritis and had taken other medications prior to taking herbal medicine. Based on that, it argues that herbal medicine is therefore not necessarily the reason for the baby’s hair loss. However, doctors who had treated the toddler before he started taking herbal medicine in November stated that his former physical condition should have nothing to do with the hair loss. The Association of Korean Medicine recently launched an investigation into the medications that Chang took.

Among them, 214 developed the symptoms while indoors. Of this number, 93 were in their homes, while 44 were in their workplaces. Another 19 were in buildings, 15 were in greenhouses and eight were inside Korean-style saunas. The remaining 35 were in other indoor locations.Medical experts said that to prevent getting ill from the heat, one should remember to hydrate by drinking a sufficient amount of liquids.Citizens try to cool off from the heat under Mapo Bridge at the Hangang River in Seoul. “Most believe that heat-related illnesses occur from being directly under the sun. But the biggest cause is the level of temperature where one is staying,” said Park Hee-jin, a professor of family medicine at Severance Hospital.“Dehydration, dizziness and vomiting all occur as our body tries to adjust to the surrounding temperature. It is the most basic step to drink enough water to help the body adjust,” Park said.It also helps to choose drinks such as sports drinks or water mixed with salt or lemon to replenish salinity lost through sweat.

They also give bribes to security officials.","24 hour convenience stores ,korea report an increasing ,convenience stores make inroads ,stores have steadily increased ,inroads into north korea","['South Korea', 'North Korea', 'China', 'chinese', 'Radio Free Asia', 'Musan', 'Hoeryong', 'North Hamgyong Province']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.59791797  0.35913932

More than 78 percent of groundwater generated daily was directly dumped into rivers, while the rest was sent to sewage disposal plants.The city government said that about one quarter of the groundwater generated every day was sent to rivers due to “environmental reasons,” as it is not adequate to be filtered for potable use. However, the report argued that Seoul’s groundwater was found to be of similar quality as tap water based on the current water analysis system.The report added that groundwater has a stable temperature of 14 to 19 degrees Celsius throughout the seasons, which means it can serve as a resource for air conditioning and heating systems in buildings. YonhapCurrently, just two subway stations in Seoul are using groundwater in air conditioning or heating systems. Subway line No. 4 Gireum Station is reported to have saved at least 61 million won  annually since it started running its air conditioning system with groundwater in June 2014.At some 20 subway stations at least 1,000 cubic meters of groundwater can be found at each daily. Reusing the resource could save up to 13 billion won in total, the report added.  In other developed countries, underground water is used for various purposes. Since the 1990s, the U.S. has been reusing groundwater to operate over 350,000 air conditioning and heating systems inside buildings. Japan has likewise seen energy costs savings of over 40 percent in public hospitals and city halls.According to the Groundwater Act enacted here in 2013, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport encourages places that release over 300 cubic meters of groundwater to utilize it in air conditioning or heating systems to boost “public welfare and the growth of the national economy.”By Kim Da-sol","seoul groundwater wasted daily ,groundwater wasted daily report ,of seoul groundwater wasted ,groundwater wasted daily ,wasted daily report ninety","['Seoul', 'the Seoul Metropolitan Government ’s']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60142112  0.47473407

About 47 million people, or 92 percent of the population, are Internet users, indicating the nation’s inseparable relationship with their digital space.In an ever so connected society, words spread faster than ever before. So do the malicious comments.In an effort to fight online negativity, professor Min Byoung-chul has been pioneering a campaign for peace on the Internet, fighting online bullying and hateful comments since 2007.The movement, called Sunfull, has now taken roots and wide recognition in Korea, joined by 6,000 elementary, middle and high schools and civic groups. The name originates from “sun,” a Korean word meaning good, and “full,” referring to the word for “reply.”Min Byoung-chul, chairman and founder of the Sunfull Movement Now, Min is moving to spread the movement to other countries, including the U.S. and Japan, with the focus now being China, Korea’s neighbor crucial in cooperation both online and offline. And his efforts have already started to pay off. In 2014, Korean netizens sent a book of condolences to families of victims of the Sichuan earthquake that hit China in 2013. Likewise, Chinese netizens left words of comfort on a memorial website for the dead and missing students from the Sewol ferry accident in 2014.“I believed that the launch of this movement was even possible to contribute to enhancing Korea-China relations,” said Min, chairman and founder of the Sunfull Movement in an interview with The Korea Herald.“A single slanderous comment on the Internet may hurt someone’s feelings or even possibly cause international conflict,” he added.In the same vein, in May last year, Min brought together 3,000 young people from Korea, Japan and China in an aim to build multinational friendship and peace. Participants were also invited to a ceremony to showcase their campaign for peaceful Internet comments, which took place at Gwanghwamun Square in downtown Seoul.“I wish to host more of such events in hopes that the it will foster friendship among the young people of Korea, Japan and China, and allow them to commit themselves to staying away from negative online culture,” said Min.Min lectured at Beijing Language and Culture University in 2014 as a visiting professor to introduce China’s younger generation to positive online culture. He also held a cyber debate via a channel of China’s biggest social media portal Weibo. Min moreover ranked No. 17 on Weibo’s list of people of the year in January for his work for the public welfare in China.“It is just the beginning of my quest to urge youths around the globe to pledge an end to posting negative Internet comments and to send each other peaceful messages,” he added.He stressed that by doing so, the younger generation, the future of society, will acquire positive online habits that can strengthen and build students’ characters.“As studies find, the earlier you start character education, the greater the influence it will have on the child. That’s why it is important to teach young people how to relate to others and put themselves in others’ shoes.“Such personality training can become one’s life habit,” said Min.Min also stressed the need for establishment of regulations to fight slanderous commenting. “Just like when a penalty is given to punish those who violate traffic regulations, there must be a collective effort to control groundless malicious comments,” Min said, arguing for stronger legal action against reckless online negativity. Currently, malicious comments online are punishable under the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection for spreading false facts or defamation. One can receive up to three years imprisonment or a fine of 30 million won . Most cases end up with a monetary penalty.“And by doing so clean online culture will settle here and spread to other countries as a good example.”By Kim Da-sol","world fastest average internet ,fastest average internet connection ,fastest average internet ,the most wired countries ,most wired countries in",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.22984397  0.9168998

Following the accord signed by the municipalities with the ministry, some 1.4 million diesel cars registered before 2005 in metropolitan areas that are under air pollution control will be restricted on the road.But old diesel cars that have passed an inspection conducted by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority every one or two years will be excluded from the restriction. Cars that attached exhaust reduction devices or went through engine modification will also be excluded.The accord will take effect starting with Seoul in 2017, followed by Incheon and 17 cities in Gyeonggi Province in 2018 and the rest of the metropolitan areas across the country in 2020.The ministry explained that the measure is being introduced as diesel cars registered before 2005 are produced without exhaust reduction devices. The ministry added that those cars can produce as much as eight times more emissions compared to recently produced diesel cars.YonhapTo encourage drivers’ participation, the government said it plans to provide a discount for car owners when they purchase new vehicles after scrapping old diesel cars. Negotiations on the discount is currently under review with local automakers, the ministry added.For drivers in the low-income bracket, the government will cover 90 percent of the cost to attach exhaust reduction devices on their cars and modify their engines. This would usually cost about 6.5 million won  altogether. Upon the number of worn-out diesel cars being reduced, the ministry said annual fine dust emissions would also decrease to 1,071 ton by 2020, accounting for 28 percent of the current level at 3,769 tons.The ministry said it also expects to see a cleaner atmosphere in cities as more vehicles have exhaust reduction devices attached, from the current 144,000 vehicles to 423,000 vehicles by 2024.By Kim Da-sol","million diesel cars registered ,some million diesel cars ,ministry some million diesel ,million diesel cars ,diesel cars to create","['the Ministry of Environment', 'Seoul', 'Incheon', 'Gyeonggi Province']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66253024  0.38354257

Speaking to Yonhap News Agency on the sidelines of a meeting of heads of overseas diplomatic missions in Rome on Saturday, Yun Byung-se said the Maltese government has decided to take firm steps in relation to human rights abuse of migrant workers.""Valletta has stopped extending visas for North Korean workers and will not issue new ones,"" South Korea's top diplomat said.The development is noteworthy because Malta has maintained a close relationship with North Korea since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1971. There have been reports that the rights of North Korean workers in the country have been violated and the money these workers earned was being used to prop up the regime in Pyongyang that was slapped with the strongest sanctions yet by the United Nations Security Council earlier this year.The international body took strong action after the North conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and fired off a long range missile a month later. Yun Byung-se  poses for a photo with South Korean heads of overseas diplomatic missions of European Union countries at a meeting in Rome on July 30.Yun then said starting with Malta, European countries that still host North Korean workers, such as Poland, are taking similar actions to stop the flow of cash to the reclusive country.In addition, the minister said he conveyed to his Maltese counterpart a wish to ink an agreement that would permit working holiday arrangements and other ways to expand exchanges between the peoples of South Korea and Malta.""Although Malta is small, it is situated between Europe and Africa, and its position will grow when it assumes the rotating chairmanship of the European Union in the first half of next year,"" he stressed.The official then said he held talks with his Italian counterpart Paolo Gentiloni and agreed to expand cooperation in such areas as defense, the arms industry and creative economy areas. The two sides agreed to expand two-way commerce that hit $9 billion last year to over $10 billion.Yun said Seoul needs to strengthen ties with Italy due to the country's importance on the international stage and its large potential. He pointed out that with Britain's decision to leave the EU, Italy's role, along with that of Germany and France, will grow.Rome is set to become the chair of the Group of Seven meeting and a nonpermanent member of the UNSC next year.The minister, meanwhile, said at the meeting of South Korea's diplomatic missions in the EU that Seoul needs to take more steps to protect its people in Europe in the wake of terrorist attacks and work with European countries to enforce tighter sanctions against North Korea.On the matter of Choe Ryong-hae, vice chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, making a stopover in Beijing on his way to Brazil for the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games, Yun did not place much importance on it. ""The matter does need to be checked further, but Choe may have just stopped at the Chinese capital en route to Rio de Janeiro,"" Yun said.Around 30 North Korean athletes have been sent to Brazil to compete in wrestling, judo, marathon and six other sports at the Olympics scheduled to run from Aug. 5 to 21.China and North Korea seem to be trying to mend relations that have been frayed by Pyongyang's saber-rattling in recent years.At the recent ASEAN Regional Forum held in Laos, China showed its willingness to engage the North in dialogue as a way of showing its displeasure with Seoul and Washington for their joint decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul and Washington have brushed aside dialogue proposals with the North by insisting the country make a firm commitment to denuclearization first.","stopped issuing work visas ,minister malta has stopped ,malta has stopped issuing ,malta has stopped ,for koreans foreign minister","['Malta', 'North Koreans', ""South Korea 's"", 'Yonhap News Agency', 'Rome', 'Yun Byung - se']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.63126308  0.34072149

The margin of error is plus or minus 3.08 percentage points at a 95 percent level of confidence. Among the respondents, 97.8 percent said reunification is needed and would be helpful to South Korea's national interest.On the desirable type of unification, 44.1 percent said, ""One nation and peaceful co-existence of two systems,"" while 30 percent said a complete reunification of the two Koreas is the only option.Nearly 70 percent of them said reunification won't be possible within the next decade.With regard to unification costs, 63.4 percent was in favor of introducing a unification tax.In 2010, then-President Lee Myung-bak proposed a public debate on whether such a special tax is necessary. But relevant discussions have made little progress with the public opinion sharply split and inter-Korean relations soured.The pundits, meanwhile, regarded the U.S. influence on the issue of reunifying the two Koreas as dwindling, while that of China is growing.Asked to pick the most influential nation over the matter, 54.4 percent selected the United States, down from 63.2 percent in last year's poll.

Considering the size of the foreign population grew by an annual average of 8 percent during the 2011-2015 period, the Justice Ministry expects the number to exceed 3 million and make up 5.82 percent of the population by 2021.  Foreigners -- some wearing traditional Korean clothing, others military uniforms -- take part in the 2016 Namdaemun Market Global Festival that opened at the market in downtown Seoul on May 26 for a three-day run. The festival gives visitors a chance to experience both traditional and modern Korean culture. Among the foreign population, 74 percent, or 1.48 million, had been staying in Korea for more than 90 days, the minimum number of days for them to be considered long-term residents. That was seven times higher than the 219,962 during the same period in 2000. By nationality, the majority came from China at 50.6 percent. That was followed by Americans at 7.8 percent, Vietnamese at 7.2 percent, Thais at 4.6 percent and Filipinos at 2.7 percent, the data showed.  Chinatown in Incheon The growth has been attributed to a rise in Chinese workers following the enforcement of the Visiting Employment System in 2007, open to ethnic Koreans in Russia and China, the ministry said. The number of Chinese in Korea soared from 58,984 in 2000 to 807,076 in 2016. The Employment Permit System, which invites workers from 13 countries in Southeast Asia to fill jobs mostly in manufacturing and construction, also contributed to the rise in the foreign population, the ministry commented. The number of foreigners staying in the country without a legitimate visa stood at about 200,000, making up 10.6 percent of the foreign population. Nearly 60 percent of them ended up staying here illegally after entering the country on a short-term tourist visa, the ministry said. By Ock Hyun-ju","has doubled hitting million ,korea has doubled ,korea has doubled hitting ,in korea has doubled ,doubled hitting million","['Korea', 'the Justice Ministry']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27583054  0.597893

The main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea currently remains neutral about the plan, although some of its lawmakers voiced their anger.Supporters of the THAAD deployment mostly claimed that it will add to national security and safety, while the opposition said the missile shield may be effective but it could adversely impact Seoul's relationship with China and Russia.Nearly half of respondents said they are willing to host the THAAD system in their neighborhood, while 39 percent said they would oppose the move.The government said earlier that the THAAD system will be stationed in Seongju, located 296 kilometers southeast of Seoul.President Park Geun-hye's approval rating came to 32 percent this week, up 1 percentage point from a week earlier. The ratio of dissenters also moved up 2 percentage points over the cited period to 54 percent. U.N.

The number involves both foreigners and South Korean nationals who crossed the border after a certain period of time, which excludes short-term visitors.It is the first time the figure posted negative on-year growth since 2009 when it marked 1.16 million.A total of 622,000 people left the country last year, up 4.8 percent from a year ago, while the number of entrants dropped 7 percent to 684,000 from a year earlier.The number of South Korean-passport holders who went overseas edged down 0.5 percent on-year last year, marking the sixth consecutive decline since 2009, while those who returned to their home country dipped 5.3 percent on-year.Foreigners who came to South Korea for living or long-term business decreased 8.4 percent on-year last year, the biggest on-year decline in six years. The number of aliens who left the country jumped 11.3 percent over the same period.The statistical agency attributed the decline in South Koreans' departures to a decline in the number of young people in their 20s and 30s, who go overseas for study.""Most people who go abroad are those in that age group,"" said the agency.

The gap was even wider between female workers hired in permanent positions  and those working on temporary basis , according to the study by the Korea institute for Health and Social Affairs.The institute surveyed 788 women aged 15 to 49 who had their first childbirth after 2011. It found that 41.1 percent of them used maternity leave. The rate reaches 75 percent for public workers and teachers at public schools, and 66.7 percent for those working for state-invested institutions.For women employed at private companies, the rate stops at 34.5 percent, the study showed.The present law allows mothers up to 1 year leave to raise children. The women are entitled to 40 percent of their basic pay during the leave period and can receive up to 1 million won  as support money. The system, however, is available only at workplaces that are subscribed to state employment insurance, leaving many of the smaller and financially weak employers out of the loop.The study showed that among women who continued to work after giving birth, 67.1 percent had used childcare leave.The number of women using the system has risen over the years, starting at 5.3 percent before 2000 to 13.7 percent in 2001-2005 period, 24.7 percent in 2006-2010 and 41.1 percent in 2011-2015.Maternity leave users were also increasing, the same study indicated, from 39.6 percent before 2000 to 47.2 percent in 2001-2005, 49.8 percent in 2006-2010 and 61.4 percent in 2011-2015.","between female workers hired ,schoolteachers used childcare leave ,75 percent of female ,mothers especially public workers ,female workers hired","['Korea', 'Health']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53726161  0.45271915

Obesity was measured according to the body mass index, the stress level by respondents' answers ranging from one to four, and illnesses by the number of diagnosed diseases.According to the study, the stress level for rural residents was 2.9, higher than the 2.86 for city dwellers. It was higher as the town size became smaller -- 2.84 for residents of towns with 500,000-plus populations compared with 2.97 for those in towns under 100,000. The stress level in noncapital areas was also higher  than in capital regions . Medical school volunteers provide free checkups for the elderly in Jeongeup, a small farming town in the southwestern North Jeolla Province, on July 23, 2015. The degree of stress rises with age and peaks in the 30s for everyone, regardless of where they live, but unlike in cities when it falls with age, in rural areas, it falls but rises again when people are in their 60s.Obesity showed the same tendencies. The average BMI was higher in the rural parts  than in cities . It was higher in less populated towns  than in more populated areas . Disease prevalence was lower in cities  compared with rural districts . Like other measurements, the prevalence grew as the size of the neighborhoods became smaller.The study recommended that the government take these differences into account in executing policies.  ""We have to look at the differences between regions in terms of the population and health indicators and carry out policies depending on these conditions,"" it said.

For some men, this appears to apply even to their mandatary military service. Since the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, or KATUSA, is widely perceived as an opportunity to practice the language and enjoy enhanced welfare as a soldier, interest in enlisting as a KATUSA soldier is high. Potential applicants have been turning to cram schools to get the required English scores.Some of these institutes are run by ex-KATUSA soldiers who know a thing or two about spending time in the U.S. barracks, in a bid to appeal to their potential clients. There are even some exclusive classes designed just for KATUSA aspirants. KATUSA soldiers and their parents participate in a ceremony to mark the completion of their basic training at KATUSA Training Academy in Camp Jackson in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, where they were also assigned to their respective positions for the rest of their military service. Active KATUSA soldiers are picked by a public lottery in November each year. The applicants are asked to hand in their English test scores meeting the minimum requirement earlier in August.Korean men who are eligible to enlist have to earn scores of 780 or above at the Test of English for International Communication, or the equivalent scores in four other written English tests and three oral proficiency tests, to qualify for the lottery session. Yang Jun-kyu, a KATUSA reserve soldier, said he chose to attend one of the cram schools in his pursuit of joining the unit.“I was able to earn the score I wanted by the deadline ,” said the 26-year-old Yang, who entered the force in January 2010.When he was chosen, Yang once again turned to a private course, to prepare himself for communication in English. “I was still worried after I was accepted,” he said. “I was not fully confident with my English skills then.”The minimum English requirement was introduced in the 1980s as part of the military authorities’ struggle to find those suitable for the job.According to the Military Manpower Administration, KATUSA soldiers were randomly selected from the ROK Army’s basic training camp until 1987. It was in 1987 that an entry examination was introduced, and applicants were tested on English, Korean, ethics and Korean history. Half of the quota was still filled by selection from the ROK Army.TOEIC was first adopted in 1996 as means to measure English proficiency of KATUSA soldiers. In the beginning, those with the highest scores were accepted. Two years later, the Korean Army employed the lottery system among all applicants with a TOEIC score of above 600 to unify the conscription system.The minimum TOEIC score was 600 or 700 for 10 years until 2008, when the minimum was raised to 780.Lim Hee-joe, a self-help book author and private TOEIC instructor, sees himself as a mentor for aspiring KATUSA soldiers. He went through the then-26-month service as a KATUSA military policeman starting in 1998.The popularity Lim gained with his special classes for aspiring KATUSA soldiers has allowed him to operate a blog to share experiences as a KATUSA military policeman covering some 20 U.S. military posts. In 2013 he published “All About KATUSA,” a self-help book that delves into the KATUSA routine.With the applicants being allowed to submit their oral proficiency test scores instead of the written ones, it has motivated some cram schools to provide intensive classes for speaking. For instance, a two-week cram course by one of the institutes promises to help applicants earn above Level Intermediate II in the Oral Proficiency Interview by Computer.The oral test result was included as a required document as part of the Korean Army’s move to address the lingering problem that a high written test score does not necessarily correspond with a good command of spoken English.By Son Ji-hyoung","soldier interest in enlisting ,education fever test scores ,korean for some men ,fuels private education fever ,fever test scores play","['south korean', 'the Korean Augmentation', 'the United States Army', 'KATUSA', 'KATUSA']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33289766  0.2934677

The 4-week average, which is less volatile, dipped slightly to 264,750.Unemployment claims are a proxy for layoffs. The 70-week streak of claims staying below 300,000 is the longest since 1973. It's evidence that employers view their business prospects as being strong enough to keep workers on the job, even as Britain's vote to depart the European Union has further compounded the volatility seen in the financial markets this year.There were recent signs that employers were turning somewhat pessimistic about the pace of growth as monthly hiring slowed sharply in April and May. Employers added just 38,000 jobs in May, the fewest in more than five years.But economists expect the government jobs report being released Friday will show a pick-up in June, with estimates that employers added 180,000 workers.The modest level of unemployment benefits indicates that employers are looking past the sluggish 1.1 percent annual U.S. economic growth recorded from January to March. The total number of people receiving benefits has dropped 7.8 percent from a year ago to 2.12 million.Many economists are forecasting growth in excess of 2 percent for the second quarter ended in June.Still, the Federal Reserve has held off on any changes to its short-term interest rates. The U.S. central bank that once hinted at the possibility of multiple hikes in its federal funds rate this year has yet to take action so far, citing uncertainty about the economy and global factors such as weaker growth abroad.","unemployment benefits last week ,layoffs the 70 week ,unemployment benefits last ,weekly applications fell 16 ,weekly applications fell","['WASHINGTON', 'AP', 'Americans', 'U.S.', 'the Labor Department']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31001106  0.35532489

Observers have said that the decline witnessed in the past several years was due to an improvement in the North Korean economy, as well as reinforced measures such as stronger punishments by the regime to deter defection.The ministry said at the current rate, the number of the defectors is expected to reach 1,500 by the end of this year.The South Korean government has said that the recent rise in the number of defectors is attributable to the strong sanctions slapped on the reclusive regime upon its fourth nuclear and long-range missile tests earlier this year. They have pointed to the increasing defections by North Korean workers sent overseas. A total of 13 workers from a North Korean restaurant in China entered the South on April 7. Another group of three North Korean restaurant workers in China defected and came here last month. The latest defection has also caused controversy upon the North’s claim that the defectors had actually been “abducted,” followed by demands by progressive groups here to clarify the allegation.The ministry added that the total number of North Korean defectors settled in the South was on track to exceed 30,000 by October. The number currently stands at 29,543 as of the end of June.Defectors who enter the South receive education and support to settle into the life here at Hanawon, operated by the Unification Ministry.The ministry said it plans to hold an event celebrating the 17th anniversary of the organization on Friday.","defectors since north korean ,defectors rises 22 ,unification ministry said thursday ,of defectors rises 22 ,2012 514 in 2013","['north korean', 'the Unification Ministry', 'north korean', 'Kim Jong - un']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39040276  0.66897631

The phase-out is due to the country’s dwindling population, according to the officials.Nine percent answered they supported the plan, while the other 2 percent were not sure.YonhapAll able-bodied South Koreans are required to serve in the military for 21 to 24 months, depending on the branch of service, as the country remains technically at war with North Korea.But each year, around 28,000 people with special skills -- mainly majors in natural sciences and engineering -- are allowed to serve in alternative fields, which include working at research institutes. Other alternate service posts include assisting the police, Coast Guard, firefighters and work in other public sectors.The survey by BRIC showed 92 percent of the respondents thought the conscripts benefited from the alternative service, with most of them in their 20s and are budding researchers. One researcher pointed out that students of medicine, law and administration are able to utilize their expertise in the barracks, and that researchers should be allowed the same opportunity. Another said research in science or engineering takes multiple years and inherently requires continuous work, and that it can be hindered greatly by spending two months as a soldier on the front line.Of the respondents, 40 percent were undergraduates, followed by graduate students, faculty and professional researchers at 27 percent, 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively.The ministry’s plan announced in May sparked fierce opposition from universities around the country.The heads of nine universities, including Seoul National University and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, released a statement urging the government to scrap the plans.By Yoon Min-sik","90 of scientists engineers ,majority oppose the military ,90 of scientists ,survey on 999 researchers ,999 researchers and engineers","['the Defense Ministry ’s', 'the Biological Research Information Center']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57916731  0.5187794

Ministry of Patriots & Veterans Affairs recently made a pre-announcement of legislation outlining expanded support for those with national honorees status, so as to get more companies to hire these people who have made sacrifices for the country. According to the changes, employing a wounded veteran or other honorees with a disability level of five or higher will be counted as hiring two disabled employees. Levels five to one on the disability scale translates into increasing severity of injuries.The ministry expects that the ""market-friendly"" approach will motivate companies to hire more people with injuries and prop up the employment rate of soldiers, police, firefighters and other people who have done good deeds for the country.The revised rules comes amid rising complaints that local companies are shunning hiring national honorees. The companies, on the other hand, voiced reservations that the mandatory employment quota for such people are unrealistically high. According to local law, companies are legally bound to maintain a 3-8 percent employment quota for disabled patriots and those injured while helping others. However, the regulation has stayed largely nominal, as a majority of local companies would rather pay fine of 5 million won  than hire people with physical impairments.","hire disabled national honorees ,more companies to hire ,firms that hire disabled ,disabled national honorees south ,that employ disabled soldiers","['South Korea', 'Ministry of Patriots & Veterans Affairs']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39056236  0.36886287

According to data on the types of employment in 3,454 conglomerates involving 4.73 million workers, 38.7 percent of the Korean workers at large companies were either hired temporarily by the firms or indirectly through outsourcing firms. Of the irregular workers, 19.7 percent of the laborers were recruited through subcontractors or external human resources agencies and dispatched to conglomerates. Of those directly recruited by conglomerates, 23.7 percent were on temporary contracts. Companies bigger in size are more prone to “indirectly” hire workers, according to the survey. Companies with less than 500 employees had 14 percent of their workers hired through outsourcing firms, while those with more than 5,000 staff members had 26.6 percent on their irregular payroll. By industry, the construction sector generated the most irregular jobs at 44.5 percent, followed by the manufacturing sector -- especially in steel, metal and shipbuilding -- at 24.4 percent, the transportation sector at 22.7 percent, and the wholesale and retail industry at 22.6 percent. The employment data came amid growing concerns over job insecurity and poor working conditions for irregular workers who do mostly unwanted work left vacant by regular employees or the same kind of jobs as permanent workers for a lot less income. But the Korea Employers Federation lashed out at the scheme for “misleading the public” by giving the impression that temporary jobs are bad and those hiring workers through outsourced firms create low-quality jobs. Members of the Federation of Korea Trade Unions, one of the top two umbrella labor groups here, stage a rally on Thursday, demanding for the resignation of Employment and Labor Minister Lee Ki-kweon. YonhapThe plight of irregular workers came to public attention recently after a 19-year-old irregular employee, surnamed Kim, died while fixing a subway screen door on his own at Guui Station when he was supposed to have been working in a team of two. Labor unions see the death as a result of Seoul Metro’s cost-saving strategy that outsources safety-related jobs to subcontractors.The number of irregular employees nationwide stands at 6.15 million, making up 32 percent of the entire labor force.According to government data, the wage for irregular workers is 11,452 won  per hour or 65.5 percent of that of regular workers. Workers hired through outsourcing firms were paid 8,589 won, the least among irregular workers, compared to laborers on temporary position taking home 11,575 won. Also, irregular workers are more likely to be excluded from social safety nets. While 95 percent of the regular employees are under employment, health and occupational accident insurance schemes, only 67 percent of irregular workers have such social protection. The management bloc, however, believes that it should be given more flexibility to hire and fire workers to save production costs and outperform foreign competitors for Korea’s export-driven, manufacturing-focused economy.

The increase contrasts with those in their 30s, whose employment fell by 38,000, and also those in their 40s whose number decreased 14,000.But a closer look showed that the types of jobs younger hires held were mainly menial work. The study said there were 23,000 more people in their 20s working as security guards, building cleaners, delivery personnel and in other physically demanding jobs compared to the year before. The number of people of the same age group working in sales increased by 22,000 and those in machine and equipment operations by 16,000. The increase in professional jobs stopped at 8,000, while desk job holders fell by 3,000.Short-term contract jobs were also prevalent.For the 15-29 age group, 20.7 percent of first jobs after graduation were on a contract of one year or shorter, up from 8.7 percent in 2006. Discontent over such job market conditions was growing. A survey of the group who quit their job less than a year ago found that 15.8 percent left because they were dissatisfied with the work hours and pay level. The number is a steady increase from 12 percent in 2013 and 14.1 percent in 2014.

Among the cases, 6,900 involved theft and robbery, while 4,500 involved violence and 2,700 were intellectual crimes. In the period leading up to May this year, 1,044 teenagers were arrested and 547 of them had committed violent crimes such as murder, robbery and arson. Experts said that most of the juvenile delinquents had spontaneously committed their crimes out of curiosity and lacked a sense of guilt for their wrongdoing. In Gwangju, South Jeolla Province on Wednesday, a 17-year-old runaway high school student surnamed Choi, was arrested under charges of breaking into an apartment and robbing and murdering a housewife in her 50s. The police said Choi had prepared three knives and pliers for the allegedly premediated crime. According to the police, Choi had brutally murdered the victim and meticulously removed traces from the house. In Daejeon, North Chungcheong Province in May, a teenager brutally beat a woman he did not know, because he was upset after fighting with a friend.

In Hwasun, South Jeolla Province, a high-school student strangled his girlfriend and abandoned her body.

This is due to introduction of new bituminous or soft coal-based and nuclear energy power plants as well as low oil prices, it said.While industrial demands for coal such as from steel manufacturers and cement plants will remain stagnant, the demands for power generation will rise. New bituminous coal power plants at a combined size of 6.7 gigawatts are to start being mobilized by the end of this year.In comparison, the demands for natural gas is expected to reduce by 6.4 percent this year, following last year’s decline by 8.7 percent. The institute said it was due to large-scale expansion of base-load power stations that use nuclear power or coal that are relatively cheaper to generate power from.The institute also said the report is based on government energy policies that were in place before the measures to cut back on fine dust were released.Such forecast runs counter to the government’s measures last month to decommission some of the coal-based power plants into environment-friendly ones such as by shutting down outdated coal power plants, in order to reduce fine dust that has surged as a serious cause of air pollution.The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy officials reportedly explained that mobilization of newly-built power plants is inevitable to meet the demand and that no details have yet been settled on suspending time-worn coal power plants.","289 tons of oil ,thursday the korea energy ,south korea coal consumption ,coal consumption is expected ,korea coal consumption is","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Energy Economics Institute', 'South Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.41428193  1.04034007

The figure underscores the return-to-farm trend in Korea, where a growing number urban dwellers choose to move to the countryside to spend their post-retirement period amid a rapidly aging society with a low birth rate.The movement has also been encouraged by the government that gives incentives to attract more people to settle in rural communities which have been suffering from population declines stemming from decades-long urbanization and the low birth rate.According to separate data, the combined number of Koreans on farms plunged to 2.84 million in 2013 from 14.4 million in 1970.The country's fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, hit a record low of 1.08 in 2005 and has hovered around 1.2 in recent years.","fishing villages last year ,more koreans go back ,government data showed thursday ,rural life in 2015 ,more koreans go","['korean', 'Statistics Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67995769  0.98238432

Undated photo shows the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint inter-Korean factory park in the North's border town of Kaesong. ""North Korea's private financing has now evolved into a market that has a supply-demand structure and even a remittance system,"" the report said.Underground bankers served mainly as money exchangers in the 1980s before expanding into loan sharking in the 1990s, and private lending and investment in the 2000s, it said, adding they have established a money remittance system in this decade.North Korea's underground banking further expanded after Pyongyang ordered state companies to raise funds needed for production on their own, while private money lenders are even credited with contributing to the recovery of its economy by investing in diverse industries and running companies, it said.The report also said the development of North Korea's underground banking into a market system has helped stabilize interest rates in the impoverished and reclusive country.Monthly interest on loans ranged from 13 percent to 15 percent in the 2000s, but the rate has fallen to the 5 to 10 percent range in the 2010s.""North Korea has no choice but to recognize the expansion of underground banking and is even pushing for measures to regularize foreign currency traded on the black market,"" the report said.

CCTV argued that Chinese patients are typically charged from two to 10 times higher than locals, leading them to eventually stop visiting Seoul for cosmetic surgery.Lured by the beauty of Korean celebrities and in search of trendy and professional surgeons, a total of 36,224 foreigners received cosmetic surgeries in Korea in 2014. About 56 percent, or 20,480 of them, chose clinics in Gangnam, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.However, those clinics are seeing a downturn in patient numbers. The Ministry’s data showed the number of foreign patients was 12,000 in 2015, a fall of 40 percent from 2014.While many of the clinics attributed the shrinking number to the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome last year, experts say the dwindling number of Chinese customers -- the biggest proportion of foreign patients -- is chiefly because of their falling satisfaction.“I deem the number of Chinese patients visiting Gangnam for cosmetic surgery to have dropped by as much as one-third,” a woman who wished to remain anonymous told The Korea Herald. She runs a pharmacy in a clinic-filled street in Apgujeong-dong in Gangnam and added that this trend has been taking place over the last two years.She pointed out that many of the tourists, who typically have trouble communicating in Korean, were often exposed to illegal brokers and were overcharged. A speaker talks during a forum hosted by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute and China Cosmetic Surgery Association in Shanghai, China on April 23. The forum was held to ease negative public sentiment among Chinese patients who often deal with problems such as illegal brokers, unqualified surgeons and excessive commissions. Yonhap“When a Chinese patient pays a commission fee to a broker, the operation cost would have to go down,” she said. “Because the operation cost is low, the surgery will be undertaken by an intern surgeon or even an unqualified doctor, which leads to frequent medical malpractice,” she added.Experts said that the industry’s lax regulations towards medical practitioners, such as lack of emergency training or proper equipment, have begun to affect Seoul’s reputation as a top medical tourism destination.A Chinese tourist was pronounced brain-dead last year during a cosmetic surgery operation. Such tragedies have prompted warnings of possible complications that can occur from such surgeries to be circulated online and via social media in China. Upon investigation, it was found that her surgeon did not have a proper medical license and the clinic had employed brokers to cajole foreign tourists to receive surgery at the clinic.“There is currently no regulation or standard that supervises and checks the status of facilities and equipment at private clinics,” Kwon Young-dae, a board-certified doctor who runs a cosmetic surgery clinic in Gangnam and director of public relations for the Korean Board of Plastic Surgeons, told The Korea Herald. He explained that for a cosmetic surgery clinic, a simple set of operating equipment, sterilizers and a surgery room would be sufficient to operate. Under the current Medical Service Act, nonspecialist or general doctors can open practice of any service with due facility and equipment. Up until 2007, general practitioners when opening their practice had to abide by a set of rules, specifying their area of service to differentiate them from specialists. The regulations, however, have since been eased.Kwon added that such a legal loophole has led to exaggerated advertisements and doctors trying to attract patients more through marketing than professionalism. Analysts see there are roughly 10,000 nonspecialist doctors in Korea performing plastic surgery, while board-certified plastic surgeons are much fewer, at around 2,000. After getting a medical degree, they must take training courses, do a one-year internship and four years of plastic surgery in order to receive the certification.Chinese patients are usually not aware if their doctors are board-certified or not. Faced with a myriad of issues that may compromise the health and safety of patients, the South Korean government vowed in April to take steps to support foreign patients to check what procedures they receive and how much they should pay. The government said that in doing so, it would target a million foreign patients and 2.9 trillion won  in medical revenues by 2020.The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it would allow foreign patients to reclaim 10 percent of value-added tax. The ministry also capped the commissions that agents can charge, in order to avoid illegal brokers affecting the fixed surgery cost.However, industry insiders say it will still be difficult to fully guarantee patients visit reliable clinics.“We cannot fully guarantee that all cosmetic clinics we are partnered with operate surgeries under certified doctors. It is actually difficult to monitor all of them,” said an official from the government-run Gangnam Medical Tour Center, which opened its doors in 2014 to connect foreign patients with the safest clinics in Seoul.“Monitoring brokerage agents is even more difficult, because they will appear anyway in different form,” she added.By Kim Da-sol","surgery demand from china ,metro seoul sees decline ,cosmetic surgery in seoul ,decline in cosmetic surgery ,tourist allegedly being overcharged","['Beijing ’s', 'China Central Television', 'Seoul', 'chinese', 'Gangnam', 'Seoul', 'CCTV', 'chinese']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60030365  0.5309059

Lawmaker Kim Seung-hee of the ruling Saenuri Party pointed out Wednesday that the legal working age in Korea started at 15, and that middle school students between 12 and 14, in cases when they ran away from home for personal reasons, were unable to obtain money through proper channels and became easy prey to prostitution. Notwithstanding this, article 305 of the Korean criminal law currently dictates that children above the age of 13 are considered as being able to exert autonomy, and therefore having a consensual sex with them is not legally punishable. Having sex with children under 13 is punishable at all times. Among the 258 reported cases of underage prostitution, only 16 cases ruled immediate prison terms to the adults involved in the act. The rest 98.8 percent of the cases handed out suspended sentences and unsubstantial penalties, citing the voluntariness of the teenagers as the reason. Representative Kim said, “In other advanced nations such as the U.S. and the European states, despite their relatively liberal ideas regarding sex, the minimum protected age for the sex trade is 16.”Kim plans to submit a revision to criminal law to raise the threshold age for protection of teenagers involved in sex.By Lim Jeong-yeo","prostitution involving minors abruptly ,rise in underage prostitution ,underage prostitution the number ,sexual misdemeanors targeting underage ,of prostitution involving minors",['the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60658711 -0.12800314

Some of the tips include how to register a birth certificate, how to bathe a newborn and how to care for a wife suffering from postpartum depression.A parenting guide for young fathers published by South Korea’s Gender Ministry. “We came up with this booklet for many different reasons, and they are all related to one another,” said Park Seo-young from the Gender Ministry. “Greater involvement by men in child care would lead to better work-life balance for both men and women. Poor work-life balance is one of the biggest reasons behind the nation’s low fertility rate. We also want to form a social atmosphere where it’s natural for fathers to be interested in child care and actively seeking information.”South Korea has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, with a growing number of women choosing to get married later in life. Last year, 47.5 percent of Koreans said child care is the biggest obstacle for women’s careers here. Notably, 65.4 percent of Koreans in their 30s, and 52 percent of those in their 40s, said women are facing disadvantages in the local job market because of prenatal duties and lack of social support. Men’s participation in child care remains low in Korea. In 2014, only 3,421 men took paternity leave from work, accounting for just 4.4 percent of all working fathers in the country. A number of studies have shown that many men do not take such leave as they fear possible career disadvantages such as a demotion. The booklet was coauthored by two working fathers, and reviewed and edited by a group of professionals including a pediatrician and researchers. Based on their personal experiences, the authors, who are fathers who actively engage in child care, give hands-on and sometimes hilarious advice.  One example states: “Do not forget to show your wife your appreciation if you arrive at the hospital after the baby is born. Many men become too excited at the fact that they’ve just became a father and forget the fact that their partner just went through labor by herself.” Another said: “My wife spent a lot of time making homemade baby food. Our baby hated it. So I ate it for breakfast.” The book also offers recipes for baby food and tips on how to manage parental stress as a new father. Lee Sang-hun, a 30-year-old father of a 2-year-old daughter, said it would have been helpful for him to have attended a parenting class before his child was born. He said one of the biggest challenges for him was bathing his newborn daughter. “I didn’t find diapering too hard. You get used to it after about three or four tries,” he said, identifying himself as a “self-taught dad.”“But so many things could go wrong when you bathe your newborn. The water temperature has to be right. You have to support her neck and head with one hand the whole time. I wish I had an opportunity to somehow prepare myself for it before my daughter was born.”Lee also said he would have liked to attend a class on ways to play with an infant. “At first it was just really hard. I didn’t know how to ‘play’ with a baby,” he said. “So in the beginning I would just shake a rattle for her as I didn’t know what else to do. It obviously got better as I spent more time with her, but things would’ve been easier if I were told what to expect in advance.”Gender Minister Kang Eun-hee said education on parenting is especially crucial for couples during pregnancies. “It’s when they can really prepare themselves before their baby arrives,” she said. “We hope this booklet can be a way for men to grow as an individual and learn life lessons from parenting.”The booklet will be distributed for free at all health care centers and obstetrics clinics nationwide from later this month.

However, the figure for those aged 65 and older reached 30.6 percent for South Korea, trumping Japan's 21.7 percent.Japan's high senior employment rate was attributed to its well-established policy system to support job searches by the elderly.After introducing a law to tackle population aging in 1995, Tokyo started spending state funds on helping senior citizens land jobs in 1997, with the related budget growing at an annual average rate of 4.7 percent since. This year's budget stands at 7.69 billion yen .Starting in 2006, Japan also required companies to adopt one of three options for senior workers: abolishing the mandatory retirement system, extending the retirement age or allowing employees work as temps after retirement.Lee Bu-hyung, an HRI economist, said the government should not only establish a detailed policy network to help boost the employment of seniors, but also come up with measures to ensure that increased senior employment will not lead to a drawdown in youth employment.""An increase in senior employment is the most effective way to reduce the social burden ranging from medical care to welfare and pensions,"" he said.As of this year, some 4.92 million people are aged 55 to 64 in Korea that has a total population of 50.62 million, according to government data.In an effort to tackle the country's rapid population aging, Seoul extended the retirement age to 60 in 2015.

A government-led investigation confirmed a connection between more than a hundred people who died of lung problems and the chemicals used to clean household humidifiers.""We have agreed to form a special investigation committee to look into the humidifier disinfectant case that has caused many people so much pain,"" Kim Do-eup, the vice chief of ruling Saenuri Party, said after meeting with senior officials of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea and the People's Party.The parties will come up with a detailed plan for the parliamentary probe and get it approved in a floor meeting on July 6.  Victims of toxic humidifier disinfectant attend a parliamentary hearing held by the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea on June 23.The latest move comes as victims and their families have called on parliament to open an investigation into those who manufactured or sold the deadly humidifier disinfectant and enact a special law to prevent a recurrence.Prosecutors have been investigating manufacturers and retailers of the problematic disinfectants to figure out whether they sold the products despite the health risks.The government has found that the South Korean unit of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, a British consumer goods company, and local retailers made and sold the product to unsuspecting consumers.The victims have been classified into four classes depending on the likelihood of their illnesses or deaths being caused by the disinfectants, with class 1 denoting the highest relevance.","four pregnant women died ,pregnant women died of ,worst consumer product scandals ,pregnant women died ,after four pregnant women","[""South Korea 's""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66545737  0.31626126

The victims and their families, however, remain opposed to the plan, saying the additional compensation still neglects victims with relatively less damage and overlooks different causes of death allegedly caused by the products.In a closed-door meeting attended by some 150 victims and their families in Seoul on Sunday, RB Korea’s representative director Ataur Rashid Safdar said the company -- formally renamed Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014 -- would increase the amount of compensation to 350 million won  to victims classified in categories one and two, in addition to the originally proposed 150 million won.The plan was offered after the third round of talks with victims and their families since May.Victims and the families of victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectants enter a meeting with Oxy Reckitt Benckiser in Seoul on Sunday. The company would also provide 1 billion won in compensation for the deaths of infant and child victims.The adjustment to compensation cost was to “console the agony of not only the victims, but also their family members.” “ to understand the grave loss of father, loss of caregiver and mother,” according to RB Korea.The company also vowed to provide victims with lifelong medical treatment by calculating the amount of income that a victim would have been able to make if not affected by the toxic humidifier. It also added the company would actively execute the compensation plan before the victims go through hassles to file damage report to receive compensation. However, victims and their families remained bitterly opposed to the new plan.They demanded the new compensation plan be applied to all victims, including those classified under categories three and four.As of May, there were 309 victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants classified in categories three and four. There were 221 victims in categories one and two. The scale goes from one to four, with the lowest being highly certain that health damage came from the use of humidifier disinfectants. According to the government, those who suffered lung-related diseases are confirmed as category one or two victims, while those with other respiratory-related diseases fall into categories three and four. Victims and their families also argued that the compensation scheme still fails to address different kinds of cases of deaths and the suffering of victims, such as a mother who lost her life from using Oxy’s product while she was pregnant. The prosecution probe into the toxic humidifier disinfectant tragedy is nearing its end, but victims and their families have said that RB Korea is trying to wrap up the incident by proposing a “still incomplete” compensation plan.“RB Korea’s move  seems like an effort to end the situation as quickly as possible as the prosecution investigation nears the end,” said Lee Ye-do, a family member of the victim.“We have waited for five years to see whether we could get compensated. Why is RB Korea in such a hurry to conclude everything so soon?” asked another family member of the victim. The prosecution said last week that the five-month investigation into toxic humidifier disinfectants would come to an end, with charges being pressed against some 20 people related to the incident. The subjected companies include Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, Lotte Mart, Home Plus and Cefu.RB Korea said that it had formed a task force team to process the compensation payment and complete the payment to the victims by the end of this year. It added that there are no more planned rounds of official meetings with victims and their families.

Every year, some ...","More infertility treatments, including medical examinations, will be covered by national health insurance in Korea starting next year, as part of the government’s measures to boost the nation’s low fertility rate, the Health Ministry announced on Sunday.According to the ministry, the number of Korean couples who sought medical help for infertility increased from 178,000 in 2006 to 215,000 in 2015. Every year, some 200,000 Koreans are newly diagnosed with the condition, which is defined as not being able to become pregnant after a full year of trying.Starting next year, medical costs for infertility tests, such as semen analysis, hormone testing and biopsies, will be covered by the national health insurance. More treatments, such as fertility drugs for women with ovulation disorders and sedative drugs used during an egg retrieval procedure needed for intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization will be covered as well, the ministry said.As part of its demographic policies to tackle low birthrate, the South Korean government has been providing state allowances for Koreans with infertility since 2006. In 2010, the Health Ministry started giving subsidies for those who wish to receive an IUI -- a fertility treatment that involves placing sperm inside a woman’s uterus to facilitate fertilization -- and external fertilization procedures. To qualify for the subsidy, each couple has to earn 150 percent of the national average monthly income -- about 5.27 million won  -- or less. For the IUI, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won, which covers about half of the total cost, for up to three procedures. For eternal fertilization, a maximum of 3 million won is given to each couple, according to their household income, for up to four procedures. In general, a single IUI costs about 500,000 won, while a single extra fertilization procedure costs about 1.5 million won.From 2006-2015, a total of 100,993 newborns were born here to parents who received state support for their infertility treatments. The budget for the program also increased dramatically from 31.5 billion won in 2007 to 92.5 billion won this year.Still, a recent study has shown that many couples are struggling with infertility, especially those who have not been able to conceive even after three or four IUI or extra fertilization procedures. The study by Hwang Na-mi from the Korea Institute and Social Affairs found that 81.9 percent of the surveyed 1,063 Korean women who were being treated for infertility were extremely stressed because of the condition. Also, 59.6 percent of them said they felt socially isolated and depressed because of infertility.Another study by researcher Hwang, published in May, found that more than 75 percent of Koreans who received government subsidies for IUI in 2014 had unexplained infertility. The figure is strikingly high compared to the world average -- only about 30 percent of all men and women who get treated for infertility worldwide are diagnosed with unexplained infertility, according to the World Health Organization. The statistics may indicate that infertile Korean couples are not being properly tested -- by not being asked to undergo the required semen analysis or ovulation testing -- before receiving IUI or IVF, researcher Hwang explained.  The Health Ministry is also to introduce a three-day vacation for workers who are being treated for infertility, starting next year, officials said.By Claire Lee","korea starting next year ,korean couples who sought ,ministry announced on sunday ,health insurance in korea ,infertility treatments more infertility","['Korea', 'the Health Ministry', 'korean']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64387804  0.55167568

The percentage of people below 30 decreased to 9.9 percent of the total from 25.5 percent in 1995, while those for people over 50 increased to 26.3 percent from 13.9 percent.The trend is attributed to the abolishment in 2009 of the age limit in applying for the state-run test to become a civil servant, extension of retirement in 2009 for mid-level civil servants and an unstable job market that is forcing more educated people to seek jobs in the government.Reflecting this, among the local government officials, the number of university graduates with a master's degree rose significantly to 22,336 last year from 3,607 in 1995 and that with a bachelor's degree also increased to 230,909 from 107,203.Meanwhile, women are increasingly accounting for a bigger portion of the workforce at the regional government level. The total number rose a whopping 83.3 percent over the past two decades to 99,865 from 54,472, taking up 33.7 percent of the total. Women have accounted for more than 50 percent of all new hirings since 2005, during which more men retired, accelerating the trend.Last year, women made up 52.2 percent of new hires, and among those that retired, only 22.1 percent were women. More women are increasingly taking on managerial jobs within local governments, with the total in such positions reaching 2,535 last year, from just 604 two decades ago. By region, the rate of female servants turned out to be higher in small cities and counties, rising to 82.4 percent, while the rate remained relatively low in bigger metropolitan governments and provinces at 17.6 percent.","female employees nearly doubled ,female hiring higher average ,employees nearly doubled data ,more female hiring higher ,sees more female hiring",['the Ministry of the Interior'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4908382   0.28697646

The report said that South Korea could see at least 1,109 early deaths per 1 million people in 2060 -- the only OECD member to exceed the 1,000 mark -- unless the country makes significant efforts to prevent air pollution.The premature death rate for Australia and New Zealand for the same year was projected to be only 95 early deaths per 1 million people, just 8.6 percent of South Korea’s figure. Other than South Korea, India and China was also predicted to see the biggest rises in mortality rates from air pollution, due to rising populations and exposure to emissions from factories and traffic.  An activist wearing a oxygen mask hold a performance calling for all-out measures to fight against air pollution in Seoul. The report also highlighted that increasing health costs and decreasing labor productivity will have the biggest impact on gross domestic product loss. Countries like China, Russia, India and Korea will be hit hardest by GDP losses, it added.Between 2001 and 2006, the concentration of coarse particulate matters  were 51 to 61 micrograms per cubic meter in Seoul. With the implementation of the air environment management plans for the metropolitan region since 2005, the concentration dropped to below 60 micrograms per cubic meter and further to 40 micrograms per cubic meter in 2014.Air has improved at a stagnant pace since then, with air quality remaining poor compared to other advanced nations. Experts say that the high density of fine dust in South Korea derives from its high population density and rapid industrialization, as well as the impact of geographical proximity with China. Major domestic culprits include emissions from vehicles and coal-fired power plants.Other causes also come from the meteorological characteristics of the country, such as precipitation being concentrated during summer, making it harder for fine dust to be washed out. Frequent formation of high atmospheric pressure also leads to air stagnation. Last May, when the OECD unveiled the 2016 Better Life Index, South Korea ranked last out of 38 OECD member countries. According to the report, South Korea’s average level of ultrafine dust particle concentration was at 29.1 micrograms per cubic meter, double the OECD average of 14.05 micrograms per cubic meter and triple the World Health Organization’s recommended level at 10 micrograms per cubic meter. “The number of lives cut short by air pollution is already terrible and the potential rise in the next few decades is terrifying,” said OECD Environment Director Simon Upton in the latest report.“If this is not motivation enough to act, this report shows there will also be a heavy economic cost to not taking action. We must prevent these projections from becoming reality,” he added.By Kim Da-sol","air pollution latest report ,million premature deaths ,korea more vulnerable to ,pollution latest report ,to million premature deaths","['the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development', '2060.South Korea', 'South Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.35406411  0.13749245

There have been a slew of reports from overseas that warned of worsening air pollution in Korea, with the latest being Yale University’s study released last Friday. It found that Korea ranked 173rd out of 180 countries in terms of air quality. One of the main culprits for the worsening air quality is particulate matter, otherwise known as fine dust. The small particles -- 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter -- can penetrate deep into the respiratory organs and blood vessel, causing serious illness such as lung cancer, stroke, heart diseases, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases.But the origin of the toxic matter and the measures to prevent them remain debatable, leaving the general public mystified about how they should go about their daily lives. Here are some clarifications on some of the misperceptions toward fine dust. The sky in Seoul city is covered with fine dust. YonhapMost fine dust in South Korea comes from ChinaFalse. Certainly, yellow dust is mostly blown from the desert of Mongolia and Northern China, bringing with it some toxic particles picked up along the way. However, according to Greenpeace in 2015, 50 to 70 percent of the harmful dust came from South Korea’s coal power plants. A government study also supports the claim. The Comprehensive Plan for Fine Dust, an interagency study published in December 2013, found that only some 30 to 50 percent of the toxic material came from overseas.  Grilling mackerel indoors is worse than walking around in “very poor” air quality True. A 2016 report from the Environment Ministry said that grilling mackerel without proper ventilation can produce 2,290 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, about 20 times greater in density than the level considered to be “very harmful,” which is 101 microgram per cubic meters. The World Health Organization said in its 2014 report that in addition to outdoor air pollution, indoor smoke is a serious health risk for some 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes with biomass fuels and coal.Depending on the cooking method, the level of the toxic material varies. Grilling is known to produce almost eight times more ultrafine dust then boiling, and more than three times the amount produced by frying. Health officials recommend that people keep windows open when grilling fish or other food. Diesel cars are more harmful than gasoline cars True. Diesel cars produce about 20 times more particulate matter and nitrogen oxide than cars powered by gasoline, according to the Environment Ministry, which has imposed a strict limit on the amount of gas being produced by diesel cars. However, some local media outlets have claimed that diesel and gasoline cars emit pretty much the same amount of toxic matter into the air. Citing a 2009 experiment conducted by the Korea Institute of Energy Research, they criticized the government for singling out diesel cars as the main cause of pollutants. But a KIE official has refuted the argument, saying that the result does not include the amount of nitrogen oxide that contributes to the creation of toxic particles. Working out is still good even in bad air as benefits outweigh risks False. Working out requires more use of the mouth for breathing than the nose, hence increasing the amount of fine dust that enters the body. According to a 2015 study from Intermountain Healthcare, people with heart disease face an increased risk of a serious heart attack during days with poor air quality, which refers to days with above 25 micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter of airWearing masks can protect one from all harmful dustFalse. Some ultra-small harmful particles can still penetrate through average dust masks. Depending on the level of protection, masks designed specifically for fine dust are classified into three types and assigned different “KF” numbers – 80, 94 and 99. The number refers to the thickness of the masks. These masks are known to filter out more than 80 percent of the toxic dust.  But young kids, pregnant women and asthma patients should be careful not to choose masks that have higher protection levels. If the mask is too thick, they could have more trouble breathing. Authorities say that the KF 80 mask is sufficient enough for those who have weaker respiratory systems. If the sky is blue, we are safe from air pollutionFalse. Weather experts say that the blueness of the sky is determined by the size of the particulate matter. If the particles are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, they prevent sunlight from reaching the ground, making the sky become unclear.  So we can have blue skies even when the air is peppered with dust – as long as they are not small enough to be dispersed by sunlight. For instance, the skies were clear during the final week of last April, but the authorities had issued warnings for the harmful dust, which mostly consisted of larger particles.  By Yeo Jun-suk","air pollution in korea ,korea ranked 173rd out ,pollution in korea ,pollution in korea with ,latest being yale university","['South Korea', 'Korea', 'Yale University ’s', 'Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65550476  0.84689188

The April figure also marked the steepest on-year decline since November 2013, when new childbirths sank 12.3 from a year earlier.The downbeat trend in the number of newborns has been regarded as one of the most worrisome social phenomena in South Korea, coupled with rapid aging. The chronically low birthrate and aging population is feared to reduce the workforce and drive up welfare costs, undermining the growth potential of Asia's fourth-largest economy.The country's fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, hit a record low of 1.08 in 2005 and has hovered around 1.2 in recent years, despite the government's constant efforts to encourage people to have more babies.Meanwhile, the number of marriages gained 7.7 percent on-year to 22,800 in April, while 8,300 couples divorced, marking a 5.7 percent drop over the cited period.

Seoul shut down the Gaeseong Industrial Complex in the North's border city on Feb. 10 in response to Pyongyang's January nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in February.With the Gaeseong investors' losses mounting, the government last month offered 386.5 billion won  in compensation to the companies. The Korean firms, who reported a combined 944.6 billion won in financial losses in the first three months, urged the government to take full responsibility for inflicting damage by doing an abrupt about-face on its North Korean policy.Chung Ki-seop, who heads an emergency committee for the companies, said company officials will hold rallies starting next week to pressure the government and raise public awareness of the issue. ""We decided to hold rallies as follow-up measures to boycotting the government's support measures,"" Chung said. ""We will hold rallies and street demonstrations, and also distribute leaflets to raise awareness of our suffering.""They will also request the government to allow their visit to North Korea within the month. Their previous request on June 8 was not accepted by the government.""Our demand is not an immediate resumption of Gaesong park. We are asking the government to allow us to visit the complex to check our equipment as the rainy season is starting,"" Chung said. ""The government should approve our visit because assets in the Gaeseong park are also South Korean assets.""The complex, located some 50 kilometers northwest of Seoul, had served as a major revenue source for the cash-strapped North since opening in 2004.

It said such a development will seriously affect leader Kim Jong-un's so-called ""gift politics,"" which has been a tool to exercise control over North Korea's elites. Quoting the Swiss Watch Industry Association, RFA said North Korea bought a total of 87 watches in the first four months of 2016 worth $11,140.RFA said the North's halting of watch imports is a clear indication of the Swiss federal government's stern sanctions against Pyongyang. The reclusive country has unwaveringly pursued nuclear and missile programs despite warnings from the international community. The media forecast that the Swiss government's sanctions will squeeze the Pyongyang regime in other fields including finance. In early March, the U.N. Security Council adopted its toughest-ever sanctions, Resolution 2270, to punish the North's nuclear and missile tests in January and February, respectively. In response to the U.N.'s punitive action, the Swiss government in May placed 25 of its luxury items on the embargo list for the North. The items include caviar, wine, cigars, luxury wristwatches, ski and golf equipment and home appliances.As a consequence, RFA said, Kim is experiencing trouble giving gifts to loyalists. The leader is known for giving luxury items to his family members, senior officials of the party and the military to secure their allegiance. Kim's control is partly maintained by keeping the country's ruling class on his side.","swiss watch imports fell ,korea unable to import ,zero in may ,korea swiss watch imports ,country for its nuclear","['North Korea', 'Switzerland', 'european', 'Radio Free Asia', ""North Korea 's"", 'swiss']",21,"[ 2.          0.          0.         ... -0.5206337   0.48395678

Among the 51 women who secured seats in the parliament, 25 of them were elected by proportional representation. “Both the ruling and the opposition parties had initially pledged that they’d allocate 30 percent of all nominations for assembly constituencies to women, but it never ended up happening,” researchers for the group wrote in their report.  Rep. Lee Hye-hoon of the Saenuri Party. Researchers also found that almost 90 percent of the 26 women who won the constituency seats, including Rep. Nam In-soon from The Minjoo Party of Korea and Rep. Lee Hye-hoon from the Saenuri Party, had run in the Seoul metropolitan area, suggesting that “gender disparity may be more prevalent in regional politics,” said Choi Seon-young, a researcher at the organization. Rep. Nam In-soon of The Minjoo Party of Korea. The only three female politicians who won constituency seats outside the metropolitan area are Rep. Kwon Eun-hee from the People’s Party, who ran in Gwangju, Rep. Cho Bae-sook from the same party, who ran in Iksan, North Jeolla Province, and Rep. Kim Jeong-jae from the Saenuri Party, who ran in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province.Rep. Cho Bae-sook of the People’s Party. Also, none of the 33 candidates who did not belong to the four major parties -- the Saenuri Party, the Minjoo Party of Korea, the People’s Party and the Justice Party -- were able to win a seat. “This shows how hard it is for women to win seats as either independent candidates or members of smaller parties,” researcher Choi told The Korea Herald. “Also, the fact that parties avoid nominating women for constituencies means that there’s gender disparity within the parties. We also assume that the lack of resources and mentoring programs for aspiring women politicians who are based in remote regions is a contributing factor.”The organization also surveyed 909 Koreans aged 19 or older on women’s presence in Korean politics as well as the results of the 20th general election held in April. Researchers found that 69.5 percent of participants think that women are not participating enough in politics, despite Korea being a developed nation.  When asked why they think women are being underrepresented in parliament, the biggest proportion of the participants -- 26.6 percent of them -- said it’s because “ Koreans don’t feel comfortable with women politicians.” Meanwhile, 24.5 percent said it has to do with the public’s prejudiced thoughts that male politicians are “supposed to be more capable” than their female counterparts.However, a significantly high proportion of the participants, 37.8 percent, said for future elections they would vote for a female candidate if she were competing against a male politician whose credentials and experiences were similar to her own. At the same time, 29.1 percent of participants said they would vote for the male candidate even if the female candidate had a resume just as good as his.Currently, Rwanda and Bolivia have the highest number of seats held by women lawmakers in their national parliaments. While women lawmakers hold 63.8 percent of all congress seats in Rwanda, women account for 53.1 percent of all congress members in Bolivia.

More than 92 percent of lawmakers from the third-largest People’s Party supported a revision.Compared with the two opposition parties, the ruling party appeared to take a more cautious stance as President Park Geun-hye has been opposed to the revision on the grounds that the issue could divert attention from more urgent issues, such as revitalizing the economy.The current election system is based on a mixed form of a small electoral system, in which one person represents one constituency, and a proportional representation arrangement. It has long been criticized for worsening regionalism and encouraging elected politicians to focus only on the interests of their provincial voters. It remains to be seen whether a change in the Constitution could actually happen as there has been little consensus among potential presidential contenders over when and how it should be carried out.To rewrite the Constitution, either the president or half of the 300 lawmakers have to propose a change in a motion, which must be approved by more than two-thirds of the lawmakers and supported by a majority of voters in a national referendum.In the survey, 46.8 percent of those polled said they favor a presidential system in which the chief executive is allowed to serve two four-year terms. The current system bars the president from seeking reelection. Meanwhile, 24.4 percent of lawmakers said they were in favor of a “dual executive system” under which more power is given to the prime minister, while 14 percent supported the adoption of a purely parliamentary cabinet system like the one in Japan.The dual executive system is a power-sharing model in which the prime minister is given substantial power in handling state affairs, such as public security, economic policies and personnel, while the president is in charge of external affairs, including foreign affairs and defense.As for the timing of the revision, 47.6 percent of those surveyed said that the revision should be completed before the presidential election in December next year, while 41.2 percent said that the revision should be carried out under the next government.Meanwhile, the survey also found that 65.6 percent of those in favor of the constitutional revision acknowledged that the revision should come with a change in the current election system. But 28.8 percent of them remained opposed to the change in the election system.In light of the growing calls, some senior lawmakers appear to be taking a more active stance. Rep. Won Hye-young.The Minjoo Party’s fifth-term lawmaker Rep. Won Hye-young over the weekend said that he was picking up the suspended move to launch a cross-party group to discuss constitutional revision.“As there is high focus being paid to the constitutional change, the discussion will greatly pick up pace if there is a group dedicated to it,” Won told a local media outlet. “As each lawmaker and each party has different suggestions to discuss the amendment,  will pave a way for the discussion to be conducted in an open manner that fits the spirit of the current times.”Won had previously pushed to open such a meeting during the 19th Assembly. Prior to his latest move, Won reportedly shared common ground with the party’s members that have been vocal about the need for a change to the Constitution. They include Assembly Secretary-General designate Woo Yoon-keun and Reps. Baek Jae-hyun, Jeon Hae-cheol and Lee Choon-suak.“The group will also gather members belonging to the Saenuri Party. Rep. Na Kyung-won has also showed willingness to join,” Won was quoted as saying. He has also reportedly relayed his proposal to Saenuri Party’s veteran Rep. Suh Chung-won, who leads the faction loyal to President Park. Suh reportedly responded that he would think about it.Another pro-Park member and former head of the Korean Constitutional Law Association Rep. Chong Jong-sup has also created a research gathering to “innovate the state,” along with the Minjoo Party’s sixth-term Rep. Moon Hee-sang and People’s Party’s third-term Rep. Yoo Sung-yop.

The item accounted for 40.2 percent of its overall exports, the data showed.Exports of clothing rose 5.5 percent on-year to $800 million, with its portion in the North's entire export rising to 29.7 percent from 24.1 percent in 2014.","sank 18 percent last ,korea trade volume sank ,volume sank 18 percent ,korea trade volume drops ,trade volume sank 18","[""North Korea 's"", 'south korean', 'Korea Trade - Investment Promoti']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.18185787  0.55111265

In Seoul, 6,925 domestic abuses cases were reported, a 52.4 percent rise from a year prior. As of May, police have been monitoring 12,000 families with previous reports of domestic violence. During the first five months of this year, police cracked down on 18,585 cases.The police said the surge in the number of domestic violence cases is a result of the creation of teams of investigators specializing in crimes against women and children. The teams were created last February in light of a series of brutal child abuse cases that led to the deaths of children in the hands of their abusive parents.According to a 2014 survey by the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations on 93 domestic abusers, 82.4 percent of the offenders were men, while 17.2 percent were women. Most of the cases were violence between couples, with 69.9 percent of the physical abuse having been committed by men against women. Nearly 35 percent of the crimes occurred due to differences in their personalities, followed by intake of alcohol at 19.2 percent and mistrust between couples at 18 percent.A survey by the Gender Ministry has shown that the majority of domestic violence cases still tend to remain unreported. According to the poll on domestic violence conducted every three years, only 1.8 percent of abuse cases were reported to police in 2013. Police currently monitor families in danger of being exposed to domestic violence by dividing them into two groups.Group A are households in which the family member experienced at least two occasions of domestic violence within the past three years, or at least three reports to the police within the past year. They also include those that have been slapped with an injunction. Police have been paying such families a visit or calling them once a month.Group B are those who have suffered from domestic violence at least once within the past three years with at least two occasions of a family member reporting to police within the past year. The monitoring for Group B families is conducted once every two months.As of May, 4,294 Korean families  belong to Group A, and 7,940 families to Group B.By Ock Hyun-ju","domestic violence soared dramatically ,caught by police nationwide ,2015 132 percent increase ,juveniles police said monday ,koreans booked on charges","['South Koreans', 'the National Police Agency', 'South Gyeongsa']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.42626134  0.26846364

Meanwhile, 64 percent of day care centers in remote areas said the biggest concern they have is the lack of applicants who are fully qualified for the job.The study stressed that kindergartens and day care centers in remote regions need highly qualified and capable individuals as employees, as children being raised by their grandparents or foreign-born mothers often require specific needs and care. According to the study, 48.7 percent of all children at day care centers and kindergartens in remote regions were from double-income households, while 10.2 percent of them were born to foreign-born women married to South Korean nationals. However, statistics showed that teachers who work at day care centers in remote regions in general have a lower education level than those who work in cities. Currently, the minimum requirement to be a teacher at day care centers nationwide is a high school diploma. However, 34.7 percent of all day care teachers in cities had a degree from a four-year university program. Yet in the nation’s fishing and farming regions, only 24.1 percent of all day care center teachers had a university degree.The study also found that because of the shortage of employees, meals were prepared by the director of the institutions, not a certified cook, at 25.9 percent of all day care centers in remote areas. Also, 24.5 percent of the centers in such regions had uncertified cooks prepare meals and snacks for the children. To improve the situation, the think tank suggested making sure all kindergartens and day care centers nationwide have a certified cook to ensure food safety, as well as introducing measures to attract more qualified teachers to the nation’s remote regions. “Offering higher salary, as well as safe housing, can be one such measure,” researchers wrote in the report.By Claire Lee","kindergartens in south korea ,percent of all kindergartens ,kindergartens in the nations ,trouble recruiting teachers ,korea relatively remote villages","['South Korea ’s', 'the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55514795  0.43783423

This is equal to 22 percent of the 6,218 elementary schools checked. The drop is attributed to the low birth rate in the country, which naturally led to a lower number of school-aged children.By region, South Jeolla and North Gyeongbuk provinces have the most schools with small numbers of new students: 217 schools each.This was followed by North Jeolla Province with 187 and Gangwon Province with 179, respectively.There are even 93 primary schools that didn’t even admit one new student for their first grade.In the case of middle schools, some 337 of them have recruited less than 10 students, according to the information site. Eleven schools admitted no students.Sixteen different high schools had less than 10 new students, with four having no new admittances.The data, meanwhile, showed that the average number of students who were admitted to schools this year stood at 70 for elementary schools, 147 for middle schools and 252 for high schools.

We need global solidarity, commitment and investment to end the epidemic for good.”The top health official participated in this year’s High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS, a two-day annual event held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York last week.The UNAIDS Fast-Track approach to end the AIDS epidemic has a set of time-bound targets. Of them is reducing the number of newly infected patients from 2.1 million in 2015 to fewer than 500,000 in 2020 and that of AIDS-related deaths from 1.1 million to fewer than 500,000 in the same time period.The commitment also includes eliminating HIV-related discrimination and to ultimately end the epidemic by 2030.According to UNAIDS, remarkable progress has been made in the response to HIV since the last U.N. general assembly meeting on the disease in 2011. As of 2015, 17 million people had access to antiretroviral drugs. During the same period, new HIV infections among children and AIDS-related deaths have been considerably reduced. However, the agency stressed that too many individuals, especially young women, intravenous drug users, sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men as well as transgender people are still excluded from such improvements. According to Jung’s speech, more than 2 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2014 alone, while 1.2 million people died from AIDS or AIDS-related diseases. A UNAIDS report also showed that more than 5,000 young women acquired HIV every week, the vast majority in southern Africa, while AIDS-related illnesses remain the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age globally. In South Korea, more than 90 percent of reported AIDS patients from 1985-2014 were male. This means female patients may not be seeking professional help or remain unaware of their HIV infection. Throughout the 2000s, studies by the National Human Rights Commission and Inha University showed that Korean AIDS patients struggled with fear of unemployment and social discrimination.Stigmatization against people with AIDS continues to prevail in South Korea. In March, a study showed that more than 95 percent of 5,627 surveyed South Koreans were against the Health Ministry’s decision last year to bar geriatric hospitals from rejecting AIDS patients -- claiming the newly introduced legislation is unsafe for the public and therefore needs to be abolished. “The AIDS epidemic today is more than ever characterized by stigma and discrimination,” said a UNAIDS report. “People living with HIV and the people most vulnerable to HIV, including, among others, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, people in detention, face high levels of stigma. Addressing stigma and discrimination in all aspects of life and society, including in health-care settings, is therefore essential for ending AIDS by 2030.”While a law revision in 2008 prohibited any discrimination against people with HIV in the workplace here, and the country has no HIV-specific travel restrictions solely based on HIV status since 2010, South Korea has yet to pass a comprehensive antidiscrimination law.  “We must raise public awareness on HIV/AIDS based on accurate information, thereby eliminating social prejudices and improving access to voluntary HIV testing and treatment,” Jung said in his speech in New York.By Claire Lee","aids epidemic by 2030 ,aids south korea vowed ,end the aids epidemic ,combat aids south korea ,programs and eliminating hiv","['South Korea', 'Jung Ki - suck', 'Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'U.N.']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.59998995  0.09252036

The defense budget for this year stands at 38.8 trillion won. The budget increase reflects welfare plans to hike the salary of military conscripts by 10 percent and to expand psychological counseling services for the conscripts, the statement said. The 2017 budget plan also includes a fund of 1.6 trillion won to be spent in the on-going long-haul drive to build an indigenous air defense system.

The index was developed by the World Health Organization to evaluate the level of drinking habit. The AUDIT score of stressed-out single women was 6.9 points, which was 1.25 points higher than those who felt less stress.The score of those with depression was 7.81 points, which was about 2 points higher than those with no depression. The score is determined based on the frequency and amount of drinking as well as self-control ability. People with an AUDIT score of over 8 are considered to have a problematic drinking habit. “The survey showed that single women not only have higher stress or depression but also tend to cope with their mental problems by drinking,” said researcher Kim Hyo-jung who participated in the study.“Drinking can negatively impacted their health, including pregnancy.”Another survey in 2014 by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs had shown that the high-risk drinking rate -- drinking at least five glasses of alcohol a day, more than twice a week -- had surged to 6 percent in 2012 from 3.4 percent in 2005 among women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.Experts have noted the higher risk of alcohol dependency among women who choose to drink alone to evade societal prejudice against women who drink.The study was published in the latest issue of Perspectives in Nursing Science, a journal published by Seoul National University Research Institute of Nursing Science.

Then the number gradually fell since Kim's inauguration, largely due to the North's economic recovery and brutal retaliation against the defectors. According to the ministry data, the number of defectors fell to 2,706 in 2011, 1,502 in 2012, 1,514 in 2013 and 1,397 in 2014. In 2015, the number shrank to 1,276.Ministry officials forecast that, at the current pace, the annual number of defectors will reach about 1,500 this year.By September or October, the cumulative number is expected to top 30,000, with a total of 29,380 defectors residing in the South as of the end of May, they said, counting international sanctions on the North for its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year as one of the reasons for the spike in defections.On April 7, 13 North Korean employees of a North Korean restaurant in Ningbo, China, defected to South Korea. North Korea watchers also note that North Korean people's complaint has also risen after the Pyongyang regime hosted a series of expensive and labor-intensive public events, such as the 70th anniversary ceremony of the Workers' Party of Korea in October 2015 and the party's seventh congress in May 2016.","korean defectors rises again ,rebounded this year after ,posting 16 percent hike ,north korean defectors arriving ,korean defectors rises","['north korean', 'South Korea', 'South Korea', 'the Ministry of Unification']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.73779798  0.74865782

The key action plan is to limit the entry of old diesel-powered cars into the Seoul metropolitan area and to shut down coal-powered power generation plants which have been in action for 40 years or more.Reflecting the study result that diesel vehicles account for 30 percent of fine dust emissions in the city, the government will also increase funds to replace bus fuel from diesel to compressed natural gas. A special tax cut will be offered to CNG buses, starting from 2018.It also pledged to increase the proportion of environment friendly electric cars up to 30 percent by 2020, and to establish some 3,000 electric charging stations around the nation.As for barbecue places, authorities decided to provide subsidies so that they may set up filtered vents to reduce the amount of smoke and dust particles.Earlier on, the Environment Ministry suggested that the roasting of pork and fish accounted for a considerable amount of fine dust emissions, raising the argument that it was shifting the blame onto restaurant owners.The task force did not, however, include a diesel price hike, a plan earlier suggested by the ministry but which was met with fierce backlash from industrial circles.Fine dust refers to particles that are smaller than 10 micrometers which are known to cause various respiratory problems and harm the human immune system.A fine dust watch is to be issued when the average concentration exceeds 65 micrograms per cubic meter over the past 24 hours or remains at 90 micrograms per cubic meter for more for two hours straight.By Bae Hyun-jung","government to curb diesel ,possible diesel price hike ,diesel price hike ,cars hoping to reduce ,diesel price hike it",['south korean'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64268339  0.01694242

The victims and their families sued the government last month, claiming that authorities had allegedly overlooked harms from toxic humidifier disinfectant since 2011.Environment Vice Minister Jeong Yeon-man leaves the briefing room after announcing additional subsidy plans for humidifier disinfectant victims on Friday. Along with the subsidy, the government will also provide the victims and their families with counseling for any mental suffering.The ministry also said that it would expand medical checkups at eight more hospitals across the country, so more victims can find out whether their symptoms are linked to the disinfectants. As of now, Asan Medical Center in downtown Seoul is responsible for treating applicants who have reported such health problems.The current damage reporting system will be revamped to allow victims to file damage complaints year-around. Until now, the reports were received only when the ministry conducted related surveys.Meanwhile, the prosecution carried on with its probe on the distributors and sellers of the harmful humidifier disinfectants.On Friday, the Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office summoned the former CEOs of Lotte Mart and of Homeplus for questioning, mainly on whether they had conducted safety test on their disputed products.

It has not dropped below the 10-million mark since the capital became a mega city in 1988. The number has been decreasing for 15 consecutive months since March last year, according to data. During the cited period, the population shrank by 109,422.""The drop below the symbolic 10-million mark in population is a new change,"" said Eun Ki-soo, a professor at Seoul National University. ""Considering the decrease in overall population due to the nationwide low birthrate and exorbitant housing costs, it is unlikely that Seoul will be able to regain the 10-million mark down the road."" According to moving-in reports made by those who left Seoul, housing was the most frequently cited reason, said Lee Ji-yeon, an official at Statistics Korea.""Previously, birthrate often contributed to the increase in Seoul's population, but now with the low birthrate trend, it  is mostly decided by people moving,"" she added.The government's recent data showed that the fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, stood at 1.24 in 2014, well below the proper level of 1.8 needed to sustain the current population.Meanwhile, the population in Gyeonggi Province, surrounding the capital, increased by 6.85 percent to some 12.5 million from 11.7 million in 2010, the data showed, indicating the expansion of the capital area.""Though the number of residents decreased due to housing issues, the daytime population who wish to study, work and benefit from diverse services in Seoul is still high,"" professor Eun said.

The said clause was first introduced as a guideline in June 2014 and was formally implemented earlier this month.According to the ministry, officers who were in the bottom 5 percent in terms of patient evaluation will all be forwarded to a relocation committee. They include officers deemed as neglectful in writing their medical charts, or have faced three or more complaints of rudeness.A personnel official of the Defense Ministry said the new measure will preemptively prevent possible slacking of medical officers. YonhapThe new posts of such officers will be at places less favored by them, officials said.But relocating the substandard officers to less-favored locations has sparked concerns about the well-being of soldiers already stationed there. The general outposts adjacent to the inter-Korea border are known to be least favored by most soldiers, while being the most likely places for injuries.“The criteria for relocation is not based on the medical officers’ medical skills or competence, but is based on their attitude at work,” said a ministry personnel, emphasizing that the regulation would not necessarily mean that the underqualified officers will be dispatched to the frontlines.He added that the officials will hold further reviews on implementing or revising the new clause.There have been reports of substandard treatment by some of the military medical officers. Medical officers outrank most of their patients, most of whom are enlisted soldiers.In 2013, the military hospital diagnosed corporal Shin Sung-min with a simple headache. But his personal visit to a civilian hospital during his leave revealed a brain tumor that eventually killed him five months later.The military reform team of the minority opposition Justice Party recently revealed a case in which  military officers overlooked the severe injury of two brothers, both of whom were servicemen at the time, and pressured them to return to their platoon, accusing them of feigning injury. The belated treatment resulted in the two getting complex regional pain syndrome, a form of chronic pain associated with the nervous system.By Yoon Min-sik","relocating medical officers evaluated ,involve relocating medical officers ,to send underperforming medics ,relocating medical officers ,send underperforming medics to","['South Korea ’s', 'Defense Ministry']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.17438689  0.35329008

The study randomly picked officers of different ranks in nine types of Army units. BMI is derived by dividing the weight by the square of the height. A value above 25 is regarded as obese, and between 23 and 25 is viewed as overweight.The link between the years in service and weight gain was highly visible. The chances of obesity for those in service for over 20 years were 3.41 times higher than those who had been in the Army for less than a year.Officers in front line units were 3.65 times more likely to become fat than their counterparts posted in special warfare units.The number is even higher for officers at rear units, at 4.48 times.Authors of the study said that the frequent relocation that often results in having to live apart from family exposes the officers to eating out, irregular eating habits and an unbalanced diet compounded by work-related stress and sleeping disorders that raise the risk of obesity.""We need weight control programs for officers who have been in service for lengthy periods and for those who are bound to desks in their jobs,"" Park said.

Kang's remarks came in the wake of the murder of the 23-year-old woman by a 34-year-old man with a knife at a bathroom in a building near the crowded Gangnam subway station last Tuesday.He had no personal acquaintance with her before the murder.During a police probe, the suspect is known to have testified that he committed the crime out of hatred toward women as he had always been ignored by them. The case immediately sparked off a large-scale campaign against sex discrimination among young people, although police later said that the homicide seems to have been committed due to his mental illness.","woman crimes the government ,targeting females next week ,random murder of woman ,violent crimes targeting females ,crimes targeting females next","['Seoul', 'Kang Eun - hee']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.79693025  0.1379173

Researchers at the institute said the number of suicides is likely higher since deaths from suicides were applied limitedly, leaving out many forms through which people take their own lives.The statistics should resonate with insurance firms, which on Monday were ordered by the government to promptly pay insurance money related for suicide deaths. Companies had resisted giving payments for people killing themselves, citing unclear clauses in the policy. According to industry estimates, insurers have yet to pay 246.5 billion won  for suicide-related deaths.The tally said the number one cause of deaths for those in their teens was suicide by leaping from a tall building. The third-biggest cause was from self-suffocation.For those in their 20s, hanging was the biggest cause of death, followed by jumping to one's death.

If a policyholder killed himself two years after he bought the policy, the life insurer has to deliver insurance benefits to his bereaved families without fail,"" an FSS official said.In a case of suicide by depression or other mental illness, life insurers also have to pay insurance money to the bereaved families of those who take their own lives. In this case, the insurers have to deliver the money regardless of the length of the policy-holding period, he said.""Insurance terms previously stipulated that insurance money should be paid in case of suicide two years after the purchase of the policy, or for a suicide resulting from a mental disorder,"" said the official. ""If insurers delay or refuse the payment of all suicide insurance money, they may face a probe  into their past payments of insurance money to customers.""From March 2015, the family of a policyholder who kills himself is required to apply for the suicide insurance money within three years of the suicide. The period was extended by one year from the previous two years, the FSS said. Suicide-related insurance payments amount to 80 million won  on average per case, it said.In fact, unclear insurance terms have caused conflicts between insurance companies and clients, particularly when it comes to policies which cover suicides and deaths caused by disasters.For years, Korea has had a high suicide rate. Data released in August last year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that an average of 29.1 people per 100,000 here took their own lives, compared with an average of 12 for other OECD member states.","pay suicide insurance money ,monday urged life insurance ,to pay suicide insurance ,suicide insurance money ,pay suicide insurance","[""South Korea 's"", ""the financial Supervisory Service 's"", 'the Supreme Court']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.24398614 -0.03378057

More than 100 victims and families held a general meeting and set up a board comprising 22 members, including 17 directors, three advisers and two auditors. So far, the group has worked as an unofficial unit without any legal basis. Victims and the families of victims of toxic humidifier disinfectants attend a general meeting at the National Assembly on Sunday. “ has worked with the mere goal of bringing up the problem, but it has concluded that working as an unofficial group has limitations for drawing active and systematic measures,” said Choi Ye-yong, head of the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health.“With the support of civic groups and the public,  would like to start a long-term process to find the truth and punish those responsible for the deaths.  by seeking legal punishment against manufacturers, a group lawsuit, a parliamentary hearing over the case and the enactment of a special law for the victims.” The group said it will not only put efforts into receiving “sincere” apologies and compensation from the manufacturers, but also launch a social movement to call for preventives measures for a safer country. They will also be dedicated to finding untraced potential victims, the group said.The probe into the humidifier disinfectant case continues with more members of Oxy Beckitt Renckiser being questioned along with more local distributors last week. Meanwhile, reports said that former head of Butterflyeffect, one of the toxic sterilizer manufacture, had used his own product named Cefu at his home, leading to the death of his 1-year-old daughter in 2011. The official cause of the death was acute pneumonia, which was the same symptom of many victims.Of the victims officially recognized by the government, 27 used Cefu, with 14 deaths reported. Oh was arrested on May 14 for accidental manslaughter charges for selling the toxic humidifier disinfectant. He was found to have imported 700 kilograms of PHG from Danish company KeTox in 2009 and 2010. The Danish company previously denied that it provided the chemical and claimed that it had only provided 40 liters of samples in 2007. The prosecution said Oh had initially produced the disinfectant with PGH, but later mixed the chemical with PHMG purchased from SK Chemicals as he had difficulties in obtaining more PGH. On Monday, the prosecution will summon John Lee who headed Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s Korean branch from June 2005 to May 2010, on charges of accidental manslaughter. Lee is currently serving as Google Korea CEO.

During a press conference at the National Assembly, the Asian Citizen’s Center for Environment and Health said that 566 additional victims, including 41 who have passed away, were listed at a civil complaint center from January to April 25.The complaint center, supported by the ACCEH, had operated temporarily after the government decided to stop receiving damage reports from victims. The Environment Ministry decided to start receiving the reports again from this month, after facing public criticism. The ministry conducted damage surveys in 2012, 2013 and 2015.“Although the ministry has started receiving damage applications again, its efforts to interact with victims is still not enough. Some victims complained that they could not reach the ministry for three days,” said Lim Heung-kyu from the ACCEH.“The government should work in an active manner to find out  more victims by going through medical records, rather than waiting to receive damage applications from them,” he added.Meanwhile, the prosecution summoned and questioned Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s finance director Ulrich Hosterbach and the company’s in-house lawyer surnamed Kim on Thursday. Hosterbach was responsible for funds management when Oxy requested Seoul National University for its product’s toxicity test in 2011.Oxy Reckitt Benckiser’s finance director Ulrich Hosterbach appears for questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday. Prosecutors added that they would soon summon former CEO John Lee. The Korean-American, currently CEO of Google Korea, headed the company from June 2005 to May 2010 when sales of toxic humidifier sterilizer peaked. He will be questioned mainly on whether he tried to minimize damages by ordering a ban on sales or recalling the disputed products. Both Hosterbach and Lee are banned from leaving the country.On Saturday, former CEO Shin Hyun-woo was arrested on accidental homicide charges, along with two senior officials from RB Korea.On Thursday, the Korea Federation for Environmental Movements, liberal lawyers group Minbyun and nonprofit organization People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy submitted a request for government inspection to the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea.They argued that the government and related ministries did not take due responsibility over the damages caused by the toxic humidifier sterilizers.“It is important to punish the companies who did not follow their civic responsibility.

According to a survey conducted last year by Asan Medical Center’s medical professor Hong Soo-jong, 31.3 percent of children aged 7 were found to have used the humidifier disinfectant at home. About 1,500 children were surveyed. Participants attend a forum on ecotoxic substances at the National Assembly on Wednesday. “If their families are included, about 30 percent of the total Korean population is speculated to have used the disinfectant,” said Hong at the second forum on ecotoxic substances held by the Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology and Korean Society of Environmental Health. Hong claimed that the disinfectant may have affected organs other than the lungs. “According to the toxicity experiment of PHMG and PGH, fish which were exposed to those chemicals died within 70 minutes, which indicates that they affect other organs. Rhinitis, diabetes, arteriosclerosis or fatty liver should also be considered,” said Hong. Occupational medicine professor Paek Do-Myung of Seoul National University suggested that about 11 million of the population might have been exposed to the disinfectant -- about 22 percent of the population -- considering the three rounds of a health probe conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its epidemiologic survey. Paek was cochair of the probe team.“Although the significant association between the product toxicity and lung damage has already been revealed, more concrete facts should be uncovered. The government and civic groups should draw up support measures that embraces the victims,” said Paek. Meanwhile, another former CEO of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser is likely to be summoned later this month, investigators said. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said it would soon question former Korean-American CEO John Lee who had headed Oxy -- currently RB Korea -- from June 2005 to May 2010. This period was when sales of toxic humidifier disinfectant had soared. The 48-year-old has been serving as the chief of Google Korea since 2014. The prosecution will look into whether he had known of the product’s toxicity and whether he had responsibility in decisions to skip the safety test. It will also question him about whether there was direction or involvement from the U.K. headquarters over the sales. Lee is the second former CEO to be summoned. Former Oxy CEO Shin Hyun-woo was arrested Saturday for accidental homicide charges along with two other officials including Oxy’s senior researcher surnamed Choi. In the latest revelation of evidence, prosecutors said Choi had been warned of chemical toxicity in 2000 by the head of a household chemical product manufacturer surnamed Noh whose firm had developed the humidifier disinfectant for the first time in 1994. When the two met in 2000, Noh reportedly said that an independent safety test must be conducted as the inhalation-toxicity of PHMG had not been proven anywhere in the world. Noh had substantial experience in the field, having acquired more than 10 patents in the use of disinfectant substances.  When the prosecution raided Oxy’s office and research center in February, it found a note that Choi had written about Noh’s warning. The humidifier disinfectant was introduced in the market in October 2000 without the inhalation-toxicity test.By Lee Hyun-jeong","home about 500 children ,500 children were surveyed ,percent of the korean ,humidifier expert about 30 ,31 percent of children","['korean', 'Asan Medical Center ’s', 'Hong Soo - jong']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46626529  0.47831163

According to the report published on Tuesday by monthly news magazine Shindonga, the 85-year-old former Army general said in the interview last month that it was “a ridiculous allegation” that he ordered the shooting against the protesters.“Who could have ordered the shooting against the people ? It is so ridiculous,” Chun was quoted as saying. Chun had been found guilty for staging a coup in 1979 and for the brutal repression of protests in May 1980. He was pardoned and freed in 1997. Former President Chun Doo-hwan He claimed that he was not in a position to order his soldiers to fire shooting during the uprising. “Back then, I was the commander of Security Command who cannot defy the president,” he said. Chun became president in 1980 through an indirect election controlled by the government. Former first lady Lee Soon-ja supported his claim. “Not over my dead body,” she was quoted as saying when asked whether she would acknowledge Chun’s responsibility. She added that Chun’s accountability for the May 18 uprising does not include involvement with shooting against the civilians. His aides played down the significance of the controversial interview. Min Jung-ki, the presidential adviser during Chun’s presidency, said in a statement that Chun’s answer was “unarranged” and that he would reveal his official position through his memoir scheduled to be published next month. His remark is likely to put a damper on the former president’s attempt to make peace with the victims of the May 18 massacre and liberal activists’ in Gwangju. Last week, Chun’s aides said the former president was seeking to visit the memorial of the May 18 uprising and pay respect to the victims. But the proposal was dismissed as a “dubious’ maneuver by the victims’ families and ceremony officials. They said that they would not allow the former president to visit the city unless he made an official apology to the People.

The EPI evaluates countries’ performance on high-priority environmental issues based on 20 indicators such as air quality, health impact, climate and energy. The results are announced at the World Economic Forum biannually.National air quality performance is rated based on household air quality, average exposure to fine particulate matter and exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Members of civic groups stage a rally calling for measures to curb fine dust in Seoul on Monday. YonhapIn terms of average exposure to fine particulate matter such as ultrafine dust, South Korea scored 33.5 out of 100, while China scored 2.26, taking the lowest slot.A report said that 1.3 billion people exposed to poor air quality lived in East Asian countries, with more than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea and China exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust. In India and Nepal, the percentage was around 75 percent.South Korea tumbled to 80th place for its overall EPI, with a score of 70.6, falling from 43th place in 2014.European nations dominated the top slots. Finland was the most environmentally sustainable country in the world, followed by Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Slovenia. Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Malta and France were among the top 10 countries. Singapore was ranked the highest among Asian countries at 16th place, followed by Japan , Taiwan  and Malaysia .“ air pollution problem is worse in rapidly developing economies, like China and India, than in wealthy or very poor nations. ... Yet dangerous air pollution is not confined to any one country or group of countries,” said researchers in the report.According to the EPI 2016 report, about half of the world’s population  live in nations where average exposure to fine particulate matter exceeds levels the World Health Organization considers safe at 10 micrograms per cubic meter The South Korean Environment Ministry, meanwhile, has questioned the credibility of the list, saying different indicators and standards are applied to the indexes between years.The World Health Organization has been highlighting the health dangers of fine dust. It established an air quality guideline in 1987 to create better awareness. In 2013, the WHO-run institute International Agency for Research on Cancer declared that fine dust is classified as a carcinogenic substance.By Kim Da-sol","south korea ranked 173rd ,poorest performers among asian ,korea ranked 173rd out ,korea ranked 173rd ,the poorest performers among","['South Korea', 'South Korea', 'asian', 'EPI', 'Yale University', 'Columbia University', 'EPI']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65052217  0.69258809

A total of 814 cars sold since November have been ordered to be recalled. The company should submit its recall plan within 45 days. According to the ministry, Nissan faked its emissions test results by using a defeat device that allows the vehicles’ emissions to be controlled by a company-manufactured emission reduction device. The ministry’s own experiment showed that Qashqai in fact discharged nearly 20 times more nitrogenous compound  than the ministry standard of 0.08 g/km.An Environment Ministry official demonstrates the exhaust gas recirculation system of Nissan’s Qashqai model during a press conference Monday. But the company denied the claim, saying “it had never used any device to manipulate the emissions results,” in an official statement released Monday. It also added that it would “fully cooperate with the ministry to resolve the issue.”The ministry is set to file a suit against Takehiko Kikuchi, head of Nissan Korea, and cancel the certification of Qashqai’s emissions results approved last year. The ministry’s action came after the government conducted a probe into 20 models of diesel cars here over the past five months, following German automaker Volkswagen’s emissions scandal last October. According to the ministry, BMW’s 520d was the only model that followed the ministry’s standard, with emissions of 0.07 g/km of nitrogen dioxide.Some other 17 makes of diesel cars, including Land Rover’s Range Rover Evoque, Volkwagen’s Golf, Ssangyong’s Tivoli, KIA’s Sportage and Audi’s A3 discharged from 1.6 to 10.8 times more nitrogen dioxide than the standard. Renault Samsung’s QM3 emitted about 17 times more nitrogenous compound than the standard, the highest level followed by Nissan’s Qashqai. An official from the company told The Korea Herald that it will voluntarily put effort to minimize the amount as low as five times of the ministry standard by the end of this year.According to the revised Clean Air Act, the amount of exhaust fumes discharged from a new vehicle model launched from September 2017 onward must be within 2.1 times the ministry standard. Related emissions laws will be strengthened by 2020, with an upper ceiling of 1.5 times the standard. Vehicles that do not meet the standard will be banned from sales, regardless of whether the carmaker rigged the emissions result or not. The ministry vowed to conduct probes on at least 100 diesel-engine vehicles annually through frequent inspections on emissions test results. Last year, Volkswagen was found to have faked the emission results of its diesel models, which led to an unprecedented recall in the country of at least 120,000 vehicles.

Jeju Free International City Development Center, an investment arm of the Ministry of Land, Transport and Infrastructure, established Haeul to take charge of the project.The South Korean government first floated the ambitious education experiment in 2008 as a growing number of parents sent their children abroad so they could learn English and avoid the brutally intense competition of the Korean educational system.  But the boom in early study abroad often resulted in the separation of families, with the mother accompanying the children abroad and fathers earning the money at home and occasionally flying to visit them, garnering the nickname ""wild goose dads.""North London Collegiate School from Britain opened the first sister school in Jeju in 2011, followed by Korea International School by South Korean language education company YBM and Branksome Hall Asia from Canada. St. Johnsbury Academy, a private American boarding school, will open its Jeju campus containing primary and secondary schools in September 2016.   ""The project was initially aimed at absorbing demands for overseas study by offering a more global and English-language curricula at home. So far, it has fulfilled its initial purpose as more students are opting to come to Jeju for a better education,"" Jung Wook-su, the chief executive of Haeul, said during a recent interview with Yonhap News Agency. ""This is only beginning. We plan to attract not only Korean students but also talent from Asian neighbors, including China, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.""The average registration rate started from 35 percent of the full capacity, and now stands at 70 percent. About half of the students are from Seoul and 15 percent of students are foreign nationals, with most of them Chinese. Annual tuition fees range from 25-50 million won depending on grades and residence options, which are much more expensive than Korean public schools and less than comparative programs in such countries as the U.S. and Britain that entail additional living costs.Jung said that the schools expect to fill 80 percent of the full capacity within two years, which would cause them to turn to black for the first time. ""I think we will be able to make a turnaround by 2018,"" the 53-year-old said.While Incheon Free Economic Zone was considered one of the potential candidates for the project to draw students from wealthy families living in the Seoul metropolitan region, the official said Jeju is better suited for such a global project as it is more free from government influence. ""Jeju's status as a special autonomous province gives it a competitive edge over other regions, making it an ideal test bed to draw foreign investment,"" Jung said. ""Air travel also gives a feeling of being abroad, while it is close to allow families to get together more often.""The southern resort island is a one-hour flight from Seoul and Shanghai, and two hours from Beijing, with low-cost carriers offering cheap fares. The project initially planned to invite 12 prestigious foreign schools by 2015, but Haeul has lowered the target to seven by 2021. Talks are currently underway to attract direct investment from private institutions, he said. English proficiency and a diploma from a foreign university can give anyone an easy pass to land decent jobs when returning to South Korea in the past, but the prolonged economic slowdown has now created a hard time in the tight job market for those with a lack of connections here. That has made more people rethink when considering making the big investment in studying abroad, as early as elementary school. As a result, the fever of study abroad has recently lost steam with the number of students from elementary to high schools dipping to slightly over 10,000, nearly one-third of the peak at 2006, according to education ministry data.Having seen the early batch of graduates enter top-ranking universities abroad also sparked more interest in Jeju among eager Korean parents.  ""The first year of graduates showed good results in terms of receiving admissions from prestigious universities abroad, and second year graduates have produced even better outcome,"" he said.The global education infrastructure also allows foreign investors to bring their families to do business in the popular vacation destination with an accommodative visa policy. Several large-scale development projects are currently underway, involving China's property developers Greenland Group and Landing International Development Ltd as well as Genting Singapore Plc., Southeast Asia's largest casino operator.""There are many Chinese investors who operate businesses here and also want to educate their children,"" Jung said. ""I expect a steady surge in the number of Chinese students attending these schools as their parents have to stay here to run their business."" Jung said a diverse mix of ethnicity and background is important to help students improve communication skills and develop a global perspective. ""We are making efforts to double the ratio of foreign students from the current 15 percent to 30 percent,"" he said, noting overseas presentations in such major Chinese cities as Beijing and Shanghai. To be able to compete with Asia's education hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong, Jung called for the government to ease regulatory hurdles to foster a global education campus. A bill aimed at easing rules on schools sending profits to their home country is currently pending in parliament. ""After having four English-speaking campuses, we are considering hosting specialized schools related to arts, tourism and China,"" he said. In response to the unavoidable criticism over the schools only for those ""born with a silver spoon in their mouth,"" Jung said the government has assigned 500 million won to scholarships for students from lower-income families since last year. The amount, however, is not enough to draw a meaningful number of low-income families to the schools, which charge extra money on some afterschool programs and overseas excursions. ""Opportunities should not just open to a few selected children from affluent family background,"" the official said, though he fell short of elaborating on support measures citing Haeul's operating deficit at present.","profit turnaround in 2018 ,global education city landed ,won 51 billion education ,in 2018 international schools ,campus official eyes profit",[],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.76184702  0.40847206

In a 2014 survey conducted by then main opposition Democratic United Party, more than 70 percent of respondents said that the lawmakers’ high income was “unnecessary” and that the salary should be reduced. A 2014 analysis by the Korea Employment Information Service ranked members of the Assembly as holding the fourth highest-earning job. The lawmakers’ annual salary is lower than that of Cabinet ministers , but higher than that of vice or deputy ministers .Badges representing the status of lawmakers in South Korea. YonhapCompared to other advanced democracies, South Korean lawmakers’ annual salary is higher than their counterparts in the U.K., where it was 112 million won as of 2012, and in France where it was 126 million won as of 2010, according to data from the Assembly secretariat. In a move to address concerns, lawmakers-elect and political parties have vowed to cut back their salary and use the money to support legislative affairs. The ruling Saenuri Party has announced that it would have its members divert 2.5 million won of the monthly salary to create an advisory group for the lawmakers. The main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea’s lawmaker-elect Kim Young-choon said he would push to cut back lawmakers’ salary by 30 percent. The progressive Justice Party plans to cut the salary to 75 million won per year, which is almost five times higher than minimum wage.

Most of them failed to recognize the scam in their inebriated state, until the next day by which time the money had already been transferred. Kim procrastinated on canceling the transactions. One of the victims, a 60-year-old man surnamed Lee, recalls the shock he experienced upon finding an automated text message from his bank alerting him that he had spent 2 million won  the night before. He only recollected having 20,000-won worth of beer and chasers with a friend. When confronted, the bar owner Kim claimed to have made a mistake of adding three extra zeros to the charged amount, and said he would cancel the transaction -- a promise that was never carried out.The credit card companies could not help as long as the transaction was not retracted by Kim. The Daejeon Dongbu police detained Kim on May 1 under charges of habitually scamming customers at his bar from October 2015 to recently. Kim is being accused of swindling close to 17 million won. The police said Kim intentionally played on the fact that drunk people do not care much for receipts and urged people to check how much they spend when out drinking.

The team studied 403,250 babies born in 2009-2010 in seven major cities, based on health insurance applications. The findings were published in the newest edition of the journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth.Statistics provided in the study showed birth defects during the measured period, 548.3 per 10,000, or 5.5 per 100, was an increase from 3.7 per 100 in the years 1993-1994. In the latest study, the ratio of anomalies was higher among boys than girls, 306.8 per 10,000 compared with 241.5 per 10,000.  The most common abnormalities were found in the circulatory system, 180.8 per 10,000, followed by urinary organs  and musculoskeletal functions , according to the study. The number of cases of urinary system anomalies, which was 0.7 per 10,000 in 1993-1994 period, jumped to 9.9 in the 2009-2010 period.Heart defects from a hole in the heart, known as atrial septal defect; cystic kidney disease; and dislocated hip joints also showed an increase over the measured periods. Other defects have decreased, notably anencephaly, or an absence of a major portion of the brain and skull, that fell from 3.4 per 10,000 to 0.05, and problems in the pulmonary valve, which decreased from 23.1 to 8.2. The research team did not provide conclusions on the causes of these congenital defects but conjectured that those related to the circulatory system could be from technological advances in detecting the problems at the birth stage and from environmental pollution. Hormonal imbalances in mothers from environmental hormones and other external factors were cited as possible reasons for abnormalities in the urethral and reproductive systems.""The rate of some of the birth defects in the country is very high, and we direly need to make efforts to prevent them,"" professor Lim Jong-han, who led the study, said of the results.

The control group was comprised of 60 same-age, same-gender peers who lived in the same neighborhoods but didn't use the sterilizers.Instead of releasing the survey results, the CDC belatedly announced them in the form of a thesis in the U.S. science journal of PLOS one in 2015. It sparked criticisms that it should have revealed the results sooner given the severity of the lung damage in affected consumers.Most of the victims used humidifier sterilizers made by Britain's Oxy Reckitt Benckiser. Oxy is currently being probed by state prosecutors over its toxic humidifier sterilizers that have been cited for causing many deaths and illnesses. Oxy started selling its products here in 2001.Korea confirmed 221 people as victims. Among them, 177 had used Oxy products. Out of 90 deaths, 70 are believed to have been using Oxy products. In early May, Oxy Korea CEO Ata Safdar made an official apology and vowed to fully cooperate with the Korean government in the ongoing investigation. Now the focus is on whether the company's high-ranking executives approved the sales of its disinfectants while knowing the health risks.Prosecutors reportedly plan to summon several foreign executives, including former CEO John Lee, definitely involved in key management decisions at Oxy Korea in mid and late 2000s. They are suspected of pushing forward sales of the toxic products despite consumer complaints about side effects.The ruling Saenuri Party will ""positively"" consider holding a parliamentary hearing and probe into the case in a follow-up to the on-going prosecution investigation, party officials said after their consultation with the government earlier in the day.The party also agreed with the government to hold safety tests of each and every biocide product on the domestic market, the officials also said.","sterilizers increased the risk ,lung damage by 116 ,sunday in august 2011 ,humidifier sterilizers increased the ,damage by 116 times","['the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.27996171  0.76556528

""But it is not moving yet to put them there again.""Last May through June, the North put the buoys around the NLL, a flashpoint where three bloody naval skirmishes took place in 1999, 2002 and 2009. The exact reason why the North deployed the buoys remains unknown. But military authorities believe the North that did not have a high-tech naval monitoring system might have used them to identify the NLL.But late last year, the North built a 20-meter-high steel tower on Ari Island, an uninhabited island adjacent to Yeonpyeong Island and put a high-performance monitoring device on the tower. It also deployed some 30 personnel in charge of operating a radar system there. The new monitoring equipment might be the reason why the North did not try to reinstall the buoys near the sea border, a military official said.""As the North has installed the new device that can keep close tabs on the movement along the NLL in the West Sea, it might have thought that there is no need to put the buoys again there,"" he said on condition of anonymity.In recent months, South Korean authorities have been reinforcing their monitoring activities near the border due to a spike in the number of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats catching crabs near the NLL. A daily average of around 380 boats including 140 North Korean vessels have been seen operating near the border, officials said.Military tensions have run high along the sea border as Pyongyang has persistently disputed the border on the grounds that it was drawn unilaterally by the then U.N.-led United Nations Command after the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.The North has demanded that the NLL should be redrawn further south.","north korea installed last ,away some 10 buoys ,korea installed last year ,korea installed last ,washed away government source","['North Korea', 'inter - korean']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.73980504  0.48060352

Bihon, a neologism that signifies a person’s choice to remain unmarried, is often contrasted with a similar sounding word “mihon,” which merely states that a person is single without indicating his or her intentions.Daumsoft said that Koreans are increasingly viewing marriage as an option and not a requirement in life, amid the economic slump and rising unemployment rate.Along with the rise of “bihon,” words with negative connotations such as “stress” tripled in online conversations in 2015 compared to four years ago. Other such words were “economic burden,” “practicality” and “realistic.”Neologism such as “wedding-poor,” referring to people who feel financially pinched after spending a staggering sum of money on their wedding ceremony also rose in use.

Questions, however, persist over the direction of the investigation, the current legal system and the government’s role in the tragedy that has led to more than 200 deaths allegedly caused by using the products.“We are going to help them with practical compensation, by discussing with representatives of the victims group within this week,” an official from the special probe team was quoted as saying.A group of protesters participate in a campaign to boycott Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products calling for corporate punishment for the firms behind toxic humidifier disinfectants during a press conference in Seoul on Monday. Park Ki-ho, a male victim’s father, told The Korea Herald, “We decided to work with lawyers from the Lawyers for a Democratic Society and we will strive to get our voice heard until the firms  apologize in front of us.” Victims of the toxic humidifier disinfectant agreed Sunday in a closed-door meeting to push ahead with a group litigation. Victims and their families also decided to promote the boycott of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser products. According to the prosecution, the special probe team is set to summon four executives of Oxy Reckitt Benckiser -- including former CEO Shin Hyun-woo -- on Tuesday. Shin headed the firm in 2001 when it started selling the disputed humidifier disinfectant. Last week, the prosecution reconfirmed the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report that there is a significant association between the health impacts and the use of Oxy’s humidifier disinfectant.The KCDCP in 2011 had submitted a report that the use of humidifier disinfectant can cause serious health damage.However, the company submitted its own 77-page report last month to refute this, saying the deaths may have been triggered by other factors such as yellow dust in spring. The prosecution argued that the newly submitted report has “low credibility.”Oxy’s PR agency Prain Global told The Korea Herald that the firm’s additional report was in line with “earnest cooperation with all investigations and steps to pursue a solution.”Experts voiced concern that it could take several years to figure out whether the deaths of disinfectant users were due to yellow dust as claimed by the company. They would need to conduct additional tests to figure out the correlation or redo the toxicity test for the use of disputed humidifier disinfectant. According to the Korea Institute of Toxicology, experiment on toxic chemicals and its health impacts normally takes 24 to 36 months to ensure the accuracy of the test.“Experiments to test harmful chemicals or carcinogenic substances on animals take at least two years. Chemicals that are tested by inhalation  may especially take longer with more detailed processes, with at least 1 billion won  as experiment fee,” an official from KIT told The Korea Herald. Prain Global said it cannot check whether Oxy will conduct another toxicity test on its disputed humidifier disinfectant. Experts also criticized the weak legal basis to punish the companies, as well as the government’s unsystematic reaction to the incident. Current law has no stipulation to punish companies responsible for huge loss of lives.In July 2015, some 800 civilians signed and submitted a legislation petition to the National Assembly in order to penalize companies who do not follow due civic and crime responsibility.In 2014, when the sinking of the Sewol ferry left 304 dead or missing, then-ship operator Cheonghaejin Marine Co. was only fined 10 million won for an oil spill. The prosecution last week summoned officials from Oxy’s marketing team to question them over false advertising and for claiming that its products are “99 percent sterilized and not harmful even to children.”“It is quite a light punishment for Oxy to just get penalized for false advertising, which can amount to a maximum of 150 million won in fines,” lawyer Hwang Kyung-hwa told The Korea Herald.“The Environment Ministry designated more than 200 patients to just one hospital in Seoul, which takes about three years per patient to check if their health damages are related to the use of toxic humidifier disinfectant. Even before the cause of their health damage is confirmed, the statute of limitation against firms behind the toxic disinfectants will lapse,” she added.On Monday, Rep. Jang Ha-na from the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea contended that local chemical manufacturer SK Chemical should be held responsible as well for producing and selling PHMG, saying that “the firm was aware of the toxicity of the chemical when inhaled.”“SK Chemical should step up and take responsibility for providing the base material of the disputed humidifier disinfectants to companies,” said Rep. Jang in a statement. The prosecution said they would focus on finding out whether the Oxy executives had known of the toxicity of PHMG contained in their products, as well as whether they had destroyed related evidence after four disinfectant users died in 2011. It will also question if the firm fabricated the materials safety data sheet, on suspicion that Oxy bribed professors at Seoul National University and Hoseo University in exchange for overlooking toxicity test results.By Kim Da-sol","200 deaths allegedly caused ,humidifier disinfectant is quickly ,more than 200 deaths ,than 200 deaths allegedly ,compensation this week questions",[],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.62934953  0.33228254

Even if the bus is packed, I will still hop on and ride the bus standing for the entire 40 minutes,” said Jeong Hye-ryoung, who commutes to Pangyo in Gyeonggi Province for work every day.Like Jeong, as many as 24,000 or 12.5 percent of bus commuters in the metropolitan region t...","At 6:50 a.m., a group of people with eyes half-closed make a long line outside Seoul Station.“This is quite usual . Even if the bus is packed, I will still hop on and ride the bus standing for the entire 40 minutes,” said Jeong Hye-ryoung, who commutes to Pangyo in Gyeonggi Province for work every day.Like Jeong, as many as 24,000 or 12.5 percent of bus commuters in the metropolitan region travel crammed into a bus daily, barely standing up and holding onto the seat for safety every morning. Gyeonggi Research Institute estimates an average bus commute to be over 61 minutes.According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, there are 2,203 red buses -- which run between downtown Seoul and nearby suburban areas in Incheon and Gyeonggi Province -- on 166 bus routes. Passengers wait at a bus stop. In July 2014, the Transport Ministry banned standing in a traveling bus for safety reasons. But faced with protests from commuters, the ministry eased the restriction, instead promising to replace the packed single buses with double-decker buses as soon as possible.Buses operated by Gyeonggi Province that travel to and from Seoul -- also called Mbuses -- are normally equipped with 39 to 41 seats. But double-decker buses can carry more passengers, with 79 seats. South Korea’s first double-decker bus was introduced in December 2014, as part of a pilot operation by the Transport Ministry and the municipalities to alleviate road traffic.There are nine double-decker buses running in Seoul so far, still far too few to dramatically ease the packed public transportation situation. Around 10 double-deckers will be added by August.The first double-decker bus introduced by Gyeonggi Province to operate between Gimpo and Seoul “We are seeing that one double-decker bus is more efficient than two single-decker buses, since the operation costs of buying the buses and put them on the street is similar ,” said Kwon Ho-jeong from the Transport Ministry’s public transportation division. “Our ultimate goal is to replace old single-decker buses with double-decker buses, without having to increase the current rotation rate of buses,” he added. The Gyeonggi Research Institute said that between October and March, the number of standing travelers in Namyangju and Gimpo in the province dropped by half after double-decker buses operated along those routes.The plan, however, has encountered several problems, including the current restrictions against vehicle height and resistance from bus operators, who cite budget limitations.Unlike those in Hong Kong or London, Korea’s road traffic law limits the maximum height of a bus to 4 meters.When considering the total height of double-decker buses, the second floor of a bus in Korea needs to be built with a lower ceiling of 168 centimeters in height or less. This means it is more difficult for taller people to use the upper deck, not to mention the added cost of adjusting the height of buses that do not meet specifications, as is the case with many models. In Hong Kong, double-decker buses are built 4.1 to 4.4 meters tall.The Transport Ministry explained that customizing the height of Korea’s double-decker buses is doable by getting them tailor-made or importing models that fit the standards set by the Automobile Management Act.“But it could be problematic when it comes to setting the price at an appropriate level as there are certain costs and budgets set by each municipality and operators to introduce the double-decker buses,” said Kwon Ho-jeong of the ministry’s public transport division.Some experts noted that flexibility may be needed to achieve the greater benefit of securing safety of commuters.“The reason  cannot be over 4 meters tall is because of sign boards or displays on the road. It does not cost too much to adjust those, so why not be realistic?” said professor Kim Young-chan of traffic design from University of Seoul. According to the industry insiders, local bus operators have also been reluctant to use double-decker buses due to purchasing and operation costs. One double-decker bus costs about 450 million won  -- with government funding of 300 million won putting the cost for bus operators at 150 million won.But the operators are still not keen to buy them, citing existing financial difficulties.An official at Gyeonggi Bus Workers’ Union, who wanted to be anonymous, claimed the numbers envisioned by the government were too vague.“The amount of funding is not enough , as we are running at a deficit,” he said.“, the ministry will increase bus capacities for passengers, either by introducing longer buses  or higher buses with more seats.” The Transport Ministry said it would not provide extra funding, but that it could consider arranging tax benefits.There are also criticisms that the high cost of the double-decker plan is due to the high price of the bus model selected by the ministry. The buses are manufactured by Volvo and imported from Taiwan. The government said the model was the “most optimized” one with its safety verified in other countries.Local double-decker buses made by companies such as Hyundai or Kia are priced at 150 million won , only 30 percent of the price of imported versions. The ministry officials said the option of switching to local brands is still being reviewed.By Kim Da-sol","the bus is packed ,more double decker buses ,buses at 50 group ,bus is packed will ,percent of bus commuters","['Jeong Hye - ryoung', 'Pangyo', 'Gyeonggi Province', 'Jeong']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39824745  0.48043483

But the new National Assembly, stuck between domestic socioeconomic distresses and increasing North Korean military threats, is facing a turbulent term ahead. The legislative badges to be offered to members of the incoming 20th National Assembly. YonhapThe current 19th National Assembly has displayed the worst-ever legislative efficiency.Its average approval rate for submitted bills stood at 40.2 percent, down from 44.4 percent in the previous term and continuing a constant fall from the 73 percent of the 15th parliament.Also, the average processing period per bill reached a record-high of 517 days, up from 485.9 days in the previous term, 413.9 in the 17th, 272.9 in the 16th and 210.1 days back in the 15th.Blaming such inefficiency on the restricted power of majority by the controversial National Assembly Advancement Act, the ruling conservative Saenuri Party had vowed to revise the law introduced in 2012 to lower the three-fifths quorum to a 50 percent majority.The fortified quorum clause is what has kept the ruling party from pushing ahead with bills despite its 152-seat majority. It was also for such reason that the Saenuri Party, when the opposition division was reaching its climax, wishfully targeted sweeping at least 180 seats.But the revision has now become less plausible due to the Saenuri Party’s failure to safeguard its parliamentary lead, giving way to the opposition camp.The advancement bill is currently awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Court, which pledged to judge the issue before the current parliamentary term closes in late May.Regardless of the quorum revision, President Park Geun-hye and the ruling camp are desperate to push ahead with pending economic bills.“The government has propelled the service industry bill and labor reform bills, aiming to create jobs and economic growth, yet such efforts have been blocked by the parliament,” the president said in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, adding pressure just a day before polling.The tug-of-war on economic bills is expected to increase further in the incoming parliament in light of worsening outlooks.The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that it downscaled South Korea’s economic forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 2.7 percent, citing the slowdown in neighboring China’s economy. Also, the nation’s overall employment for those aged 25-54 stood at 75.9 percent last year, lower than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average, data showed.Another key challenge is the ever-increasing military threats from North Korea and tricky relations with world powers.While the parties are univocal in the need to sanction North Korea and strengthen the alliance with the U.S. following the North’s nuclear test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year, their stances differ on various inter-Korean, foreign affairs and defense issues.The opposition supports rapprochement in dealing with the reclusive regime, while the Saenuri Party underscores seclusion and pressure. Center-leaning People’s Party also supports resuming the suspended inter-Korean industrial park in Gaeseong.Some of the thorny issues are also expected to involve the anticipated deployment by the U.S. of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system here. The plan is opposed by liberals who question its military efficacy and high cost, as well as the security dilemma it would pose such as in relations with China.

I hope lawmakers can actively pass more bills to support younger generations,” said 24-year-old Kim Han-nuri, who voted in Itaewon and was recently discharged from his compulsory military duty in March.Voters wait in line at a polling station in Jamsil, Seoul, Wednesday. As of last month, just 643 out of 5,288 bills that passed the 19th National Assembly were related to youth employment. While younger people hoped to see more hardworking lawmakers, senior voters wished to see a harmonious National Assembly, disenchanted at the past 19th National Assembly.“I have been so disappointed in lawmakers so far, but I am here again  to give one more chance to work in harmony, regardless of their parties,” said 77-year-old Kim Jin-soon at a polling station in Itaewon 2-dong Community Service Center. “I think lawmakers forget to work on legislation and miss the right timing to pass bills because they fight all the time,” said a female voter in her 40s in Seocho-gu.In 2012, the votes were split approximately equally between ruling-party affiliated candidates and the rest, but the assembly was tainted with frequent scuffles over legislation.When the Sewol ferry disaster broke out in 2014, the National Assembly was faced with public criticism as a “vegetative National Assembly” for not being able to pass a single bill during a five-month period.With continued backbiting and delayed bills, some voters said they had lost hope in Korean politics.A taxi driver in his 50s who abstained from voting in this year’s general election questioned the eligibility of aspiring lawmakers.“To be honest, when I found out all three candidates who are running for my community have a criminal record for driving under the influence, I did not want to vote,” said Kim Yong-gyu, who lives in Seoul’s northwestern Yangcheon-gu.“If a lawmaker does not abide by the law, how can they lead the country? I really want to question their qualifications.”By Kim Da-sol","42 million eligible voters ,some 14 000 voting ,improved politics more ,14 000 voting stations ,million eligible voters headed","['National Assembly', 'the National Election Commissions']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.65557832  0.45501414

On the other hand, China's imports from North Korea contracted 10.8 percent to 3.83 billion yuan, he said. ""Major Chinese exports to North Korea are machinery, electronic goods, labor-intensive products and agricultural goods, while imports mainly are coal and iron ore,"" Huang said.The spokesman indicated that the trade increase should not be viewed as China circumventing the U.N. Security Council sanctions because the latest figure accounts for bilateral trade volume before the sanctions took effect.China immediately implemented the sanctions after it announced a list of banned trade goods with North Korea on April 5, the spokesman pointed out. ""The China-North Korea trade data for the first quarter has nothing to do with anti-North sanctions,"" the official said, also vowing to ""follow through with the U.N. sanctions resolution thoroughly."" Another official from China's State Council stressed any trade items that concern the public welfare or have no link to North Korea's nuclear weapons development are not subject to the sanctions. But the official refused to release the monthly trade figure for March, only saying that the monthly data is not available.In early March, the U.N. adopted the toughest sanctions it has ever slapped on North Korea as punishment for the communist country's defiant nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February.","posted double digit growth ,china posted double digit ,china trade up 12 ,and china posted double ,stood at 79 billion","['North Korea', 'China', ""the United Nations '"", 'Huang Songping', 'Chin']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.23243387  0.91771823

As of the end of 2015, 1.84 million of 10.02 million citizens in Seoul were aged 60 and over, or 18 percent of citizens. Tokyo topped the world’s list, with an expected 13.2 million individuals aged 60 and above by 2030. This was followed by Osaka, New York, Rhine-Ruhr, London, Los Angeles and Nagoya.The city which is anticipated to have the highest proportion of its population in their 60s is Punta Gorda, Florida, in the U.S., where 57 percent of the population will eventually be of this demographic group. Others in the top five include Orense in Spain, Imabari in Japan, Bradenton in Florida, U.S., and Andong in South Korea’s North Gyeongsang Province. The report also predicted that by 2030, Western Europe will see an overall decline of 10 million people among those aged between 15 and 60.

However, the proportion of newborns who needed critical medical attention, including premature and low birth-weight babies, increased from 3.8 percent to 4.7 percent in the same time period.Low birth-weight babies are defined as infants weighing less than 2.5 kilograms at birth, while premature babies are those who are born 36 weeks or earlier.Some of the biggest causes of the increased preterm births here include more pregnancies after age 35 -- as more women are putting off marriage and childbearing -- depression during pregnancy as well as side effects of infertility treatments.The report pointed out that the medical cost that was spent to treat premature and low birth-weight newborns accounted for 42.9 percent of the total cost spent on all newborns in the country in 2014, which was 121.4 billion won . According to the World Health Organization, common causes of preterm births worldwide include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes. Meanwhile, a number of overseas researchers have found a relationship between depression and preterm births. In 2008, overseas research published in Human Reproduction, a European peer-reviewed scientific journal, showed depressed mothers-to-be are more likely than non-depressed women to have a preterm birth. Another overseas study, published in 2012 in the Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research, also found that depressed pregnant women are more vulnerable to preterm labor. “Mental health counselors and programmers are suggested to have some educational programs about psychiatric health for midwives and the personnel who provide health care services for pregnant women,” Iranian researchers wrote in the paper. In order to prevent preterm births, South Korean health authorities recommend all pregnant women receive mental health checkups as well as see their obstetrician at least once a week from week 36 until the delivery. Preterm birth is among the top causes of death in infants worldwide. According to WHO, over 1 million infants die annually from premature birth complications. The agency has developed new guidelines with recommendations for improving outcomes of preterm births. “The guidelines include interventions provided to the mother -- for example, steroid injections before birth, antibiotics when her water breaks before the onset of labor and magnesium sulfate to prevent future neurological impairment of the child,” the agency said in a statement currently available on its website. By Claire Lee","newborns decreased in korea ,premature births on rise ,country study showed tuesday ,south korea since 2010 ,including premature babies","['South Korea', 'the Health Insurance Policy Research Institute', 'the National Health Insurance Corporation', 'Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.6919238   0.44719476

He declined to name the exact time of their arrival or which country they came from, citing possible diplomatic faux pas, protection of those related and possible further defections.“The employees said they learned about the reality of South Korea and the false nature of North Korean regime and its promotion via South Korean TV, drama, movies and the Internet, and recently decided to defect,” Jeong said in a media briefing at the Seoul government complex. Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee Related government bodies will question them after they have rest.Observers said the North is likely to respond to news of the latest defection -- the largest in size since nine defected together in March 2011 -- with more threats and provocation.According to Jeong, the defectors decided to escape after the U.N. imposed the sanctions as punitive action against its recent nuclear testing and long-range rocket launch. He added that this marks the first time workers at a foreign-based North Korean restaurant escaped the repressive Kim Jong-un regime. The government presumed that the defectors were middle class, based on the fact that there is heavy competition among North Koreans to be sent to work at oversees restaurants.“I understand that since the sanctions, other North Korean restaurants overseas are also experiencing difficulties. It was mentioned that these restaurants are under immense pressure from the North Korean government about their due payments in foreign currency,” he said. North Korea operates restaurants oversees for the purpose of acquiring foreign currency, but the number of customers -- majority of whom are South Koreans -- has dwindled considerably since the sanctions. Local media reported Thursday that three North Korean restaurants in Cambodia have shut down recently. Majority of the North Korean restaurants are based in Asia, namely China, Vietnam and Cambodia, The only North Korean restaurant in the Western Europe -- which was based in Amsterdam -- shut down last year. Jeong said the mass defection implies that the U.N.-led sanctions have significant impact on the North Korean economy. “Although we do not have official statistics, we believe that we can already see the effects of sanctions. Roodong Sinmun  has also mentioned ‘Arduous March’ of economic hardship, and this recent case makes me think that the sanctions are ‘hurting’ North Korea,” he said.

The jobless rate of those in the same age bracket also reached a monthly high of 12.5 percent in February.Against such a backdrop, both the ruling and main opposition parties have named creating jobs for young workers, or voters, as their No. 1 priority in their respective economic platforms ahead of the parliamentary elections to be held on April 13.They differ, however, as to how they are seeking to expand job opportunities.The ruling party insists companies are reluctant to invest more partly due to sluggish local spending.Kang Bong-kyun, a former finance minister and three-term lawmaker of the main opposition bloc who is currently leading the Saenuri's campaign committee, claims increased spending by firms, especially large conglomerates, will lead to more spending by smaller firms, which in turn will spur spending by general consumers.To this end, the 73-year-old has proposed the central bank take over outstanding loans of policy lenders, such as the Korea Development Bank, to private firms, which he says will allow the state-run banks to lend more to companies and thus lead to increased spending and investment by private firms.However, the proposal, dubbed a Korean-style quantitative easing, is causing a heated debate as it could be seen as an attempt to tell the Bank of Korea what to do while many say the central bank is and must be insulated from any outside pressure when making its monetary policy decisions.Unionized workers of the BOK dismissed the ruling party's campaign pledge as a populist idea, noting the very reason the central bank is legally protected from outside pressure is to prevent such an attempt by political parties to utilize or abuse the bank's note issuing rights for political gains.The call for the so-called Korean-style quantitative easing ""seriously undermines the independence of the central bank and is the worst populist idea,"" they said in a statement released Thursday, two days after Kang announced the party platform.Abusive or not, the main opposition party says the ruling party's economic policy will not save the local economy, let alone help a great number of local firms.Kim Chong-in, interim chairman of the Minjoo Party and also a former finance minister, says the ruling party policy, if realized, will only benefit rich and large conglomerates, which are already sitting on record amounts of cash reserves.""The Saenuri government has consistently advocated quantitative easing and eased regulations for large conglomerates for the past eight years, but they have brought no changes to economic conditions while only driving the youth jobless rate to a record high of 12.5 percent,"" Kim said earlier.Following its victory in the upcoming elections, the main opposition party says it will encourage or require public firms to create more jobs for the young instead of entrusting a few, large private companies with the seemingly impossible task.Also, the party claims a recovery in spending can only be achieved when a majority of people and companies are able and willing to spend more.To this end, the opposition party has pledged to levy more taxes on large conglomerates, and use the fresh funds to help small and medium-sized firms.Its main campaign pledges also include increased monthly allowances for the elderly to help spur consumer spending.Currently, the government is paying an allowance of between 100,000 won and 200,000 won per month to about 70 percent of people aged 65 years or above.The Minjoo Party has promised to pay a flat amount of 300,000 won each month to all people aged 65 years or above.The ruling Saenuri Party, too, has accused the main opposition party of leaning on populist and empty pledges, noting there simply are not enough funds to realize all such promises.""Welfare programs must be pursued carefully while closely keeping in mind financial circumstances of the government,"" ruling party chairman Kim Moo-sung said. ""There is no country on Earth that can finance all populist welfare programs that are introduced recklessly without such care.""An earlier analysis showed the ruling party's campaign pledges will cost 56 trillion won over the 2017-2020 period, while those of the main opposition Minjoo Party will require nearly 148 trillion won over a five-year period starting in 2017.","remedies for ailing economy ,sluggish consumer spending ,asia fourth largest economy ,rival parties offer opposite ,to sluggish consumer spending","[""South Korea 's"", 'Saenuri Party', 'Minjoo Party']",21,"[ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 ... -5.11543989e-01

On Monday, a team of 12 SNU researchers headed by professor Ye Sung-joon of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, submitted a project report that analyzed the number of joint international research initiatives conducted by SNU and its implications in global university rankings.The front gate of Seoul National University The SNU research team blamed the institute‘s comparatively low level of global cooperation as the main issue behind the low citation rate of theses written by SNU scholars. “In the top 10 percent of globally cited theses, SNU’s remained among the lowest ranks,” the team said, pointing out that universities with more joint international collaborations generally received more citations.It stressed SNU’s need to improve on certain markers of internationalization, “The university needs to take measures to proactively respond to global issues by expanding the number of foreign faculty members and students with growth potential.” The team’s research was done by compiling and studying dissertations published between 2010 and 2014 on “Scopus,” a global database for reference articles.According to the researchers, articles published by SNU in collaboration with overseas universities showed a consistent climb, from 1,848 in the year 2010 to 2,341 in 2014. In those five years, a total of 10,899 articles were published under joint efforts with foreign universities.Albeit laudable, however, SNU came in seventh on the list of eight institutions selected by the team as the world‘s best research-centered schools.University of Toronto took the crown, churning out 32,508 theses, nearly triple that of SNU’s in the same period. Oxford University came in second with 28,119 theses, followed by Stanford University’s 20,102 theses. For percentage of joint international theses as a part of total number of theses published, SNU marked 26.4 percent, coming in last. Oxford University was first in the same measure at 53.2 percent, University of Toronto second with 45.5 percent and Australia’s University of Melbourne third with 43.2 percent.When compared to other top Asian schools such as University of Singapore, University of Tokyo, University of Beijing and University of Hong Kong, SNU still lagged behind.It marked second to last in the accumulated number of joint international research among eight Asian universities, and third to last in the percentile of international theses to the total published articles. Its number of foreign full-time professors as of 2015 remained 4.96 percent, far behind the 10 percent of the universities of Tokyo and Kyoto and 20 percent of the universities of Hong Kong and Singapore.By Lim Jeong-yeo","korea top university lags ,monday team of 12 ,of 12 snu researchers ,of korea leading universities ,top university lags behind","['Seoul National University', 'korea‘s', 'SNU', 'Ye Sung - joon', 'the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.39993569  0.60280025

Moreover, the number of new high school entrants slightly increased between 2015 and 2016, due to the so-called millennium baby boom.""The so-called 'demographic cliff' phenomenon, which began in elementary schools in 2008 and 2009, appears to have expanded to affect middle and high schools,"" a ministry official said.He noted that the local education authorities have begun measures to adjust the number of high school classes in anticipation of the upcoming demographic change.The Seoul Metropolitan Office Of Education, for instance, recently recommended that the number of high school classes in the capital city be reduced by about 700 by 2018.Education experts say the falling population of high school students will drastically pull down the competition ratio for entrance into domestic colleges and universities, starting in 2020.At present, about 550,000 people attend colleges and universities, including two-year colleges, in South Korea.South Korea has one of the lowest birthrates among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members, stoking concerns that it could cripple the country's growth potential and possibly result in more welfare expenses.The government's latest data showed that the fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, stood at 1.24 in 2014, well below the proper level of 1.8 percent to sustain the current population. South Korea's population is projected to start to decrease in 2030, when it will peak at 52.16 million, with the pace of aging and the low birthrate to continue.","schools nationwide will fall ,100 000 by 2018 ,next two years government ,falling birthrate the ministry ,school entrants to decrease","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Education']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.49912378  0.36977595

The size of this group was larger than that of the employed in their 20s and 30s combined, which came to 9.37 million, accounting for 36.1 percent. The reversal is the first since the agency began tracking the data in 2000, when twice as many in the younger group  had jobs compared to the elderly  to account for 50.2 percent.The increased number of elderly in the job market has raised the average age of people in the job market from 41.1 in 2004 to 44.4 last year.Social trend watchers say the current situation was led by the baby boom generation, a segment of the population defined as people born between 1955 and 1963. This particular generation is larger than other age groups and is staying in the job market even after retirement to support themselves, while new corporate hires of the young have slowed from a protracted economic downturn, they say.The agency's tally showed that of 337,000 people hired last year, 172,000 were those aged 60 or over, the largest age bracket.The figure for those in their 20s stopped at 68,000 while that of those in their 30s fell by 38,000.The younger working group still dominated the job market in 2011 when it outnumbered the over-50 group by 1 million people. But the difference has continued to narrow, to 910,000 in 2012, 410,000 in 2013, and to just 5,000 in 2014 before the reversal in 2015.""The current labor market is frozen in a situation where existing workers are staying rather than people newly entering,"" professor Kim Kwang-seok of Hanyang University said.  ""With the pushback of the official retirement age this year, the trend is bound to continue.""","statistics korea on thursday ,totaled 65 million last ,working population is aging ,korea on thursday people ,65 million last year","[""South Korea 's"", 'Statistics Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.87229276  0.39392185

The competition rate is 3.7 to one, compared with 4.84 to one in the 2004 parliamentary elections.The remaining 47 seats will be allocated to political parties according to the numbers of votes that they receive overall under proportional representation, the National Election Commission said late Friday.The election watchdog also said a total of 25 political parties participated in the elections, although three major parties -- the ruling Saenuri Party, the main opposition Minjoo Party and the splinter People's Party -- currently hold most of the seats in the National Assembly. Other parties have little, if any, influence in local politics, as some of them were formed just one month ahead of the parliamentary elections.Ten candidates are set to face off in the Jongno Ward of central Seoul, making it the most heated race in the elections.Jongno Ward -- home to Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea's presidential office and the government complex building -- is a crucial electoral district, as it carries political significance for candidates and their political parties.A recent poll showed that Oh Se-hoon of the ruling Saenuri Party is a frontrunner in Jongno Ward. He is set to face off against Chung Sye-kyun of the main opposition Minjoo Party, who currently represents Jongno Ward in the National Assembly.Oh resigned from the Seoul mayorship in 2011 after he failed to block an opposition-led free school lunch program in the city's first-ever referendum.In a country where about one-fifth of its 50 million people live in the capital city, the Seoul mayorship often serves as a key stepping stone for the country's president. Former President Lee Myung-bak served as Seoul mayor in the early 2000s before being elected president.Meanwhile, Lee Koon-hyon, a candidate of the ruling party, was elected even before the elections began, as he is the only candidate running in the country's southeastern port city of Tongyeong.In Seoul, nine candidates -- some of them from minor parties or independents -- have paid no taxes over the past five years, whileAhn Cheol-soo, head of the splinter People's Party, paid 20.7 billion won  in taxes over the same period.The election watchdog also said 82 out of the 205 candidates in Seoul have criminal records, including drunk driving, theft and violation of the country's National Security Law. The election watchdog said the richest candidate is Kim Byoung-gwan of the main opposition Minjoo Party. Kim's wealth is valued at 263.7 billion won. Kim is the largest shareholder of South Korea's online game developer Webzen Inc. The average net worth of the candidates is 2.5 billion won.","900 candidates run for ,944 candidates 844 men ,elections more than 900 ,than 900 candidates run ,900 candidates run","[""South Korea 's""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55427814  0.22272886

According to the report by the Government Public Ethics Committee, 74.6 percent of senior government officials reported an increase in their wealth in 2015. The average assets of those surveyed was 1.31 billion won  last year, up 55 million won from 2014.Under the country’s public service ethics act, 1,813 senior officials, including high-ranking government officials, lawmakers, senior judges, heads of municipalities and chiefs of universities, are required to report their personal assets every year. Government Public Ethics Committee officials look through the report on the wealth of high-ranking officials in the public sector. A rise in the value of real estate, stocks and personal savings contributed to the wealth gains, the committee said. President Park Geun-hye had assets of 3.5 billion won, up 349 million won from the previous year. The jump was attributed to royalties from her autobiography and the rise in value of her house in Samseong-dong in southern Seoul. Her book was published in 2013 in China, and more than 150,000 copies were sold. The richest government official was Woo Byung-woo, a senior official at Cheong Wa Dae, for the second consecutive year. He recorded personal wealth of 39.3 billion won. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon had the least wealth among 17 heads of municipalities for the fifth straight year, reporting a debt of 680 million won. By party, ruling Saenuri Party lawmakers were found to be wealthier than those in the opposition parties in general. When three lawmakers with over 50 million in wealth are excluded from the calculations, Saenuri lawmakers had an average of 2.33 billion won, while those from the main opposition The Minjoo Party of Korea had an average of 1.3 billion won. Those from the minor opposition People’s Party had an average of 1.9 billion won. The wealthiest lawmaker was entrepreneur-turned-politician Ahn Cheol-soo, cochairman of People’s Party, with his wealth of 162.9 billion won. His assets shrank by 78.1 billion won as he donated half of his shares in AhnLab to a charity last year. But the value of the remaining shares increased by 85.1 billion won. Six lawmakers from the ruling Saenuri Party, two from People’s Party and two independent lawmakers comprised the top 10 richest lawmakers.The poorest lawmaker was Rep. Jin Seon-mi, reporting debt of 1.4 billion won. Meanwhile, three in 10 senior officials refused to disclose the wealth of their families. They are allowed to decline to reveal their family’s wealth when their family members are able to make a living independently. The committee also found that about 13 percent of the 3,147 senior officials falsely reported their wealth. It took disciplinary action against one official, imposed financial penalties on 10 and cautioned 400.

Against this backdrop, every 100 working-age people supported the livelihoods of 17.9 senior citizens last year, with this number expected to triple to 100 people providing for 57.2 senior citizens in 2040.The latest data also showed that the fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman is projected to have during her lifetime, stood at 1.24 in 2014, well below the proper level of 1.8 percent to sustain the current population.The statistical office forecast that South Korea's population will start to decrease in 2030, when it will peak at 52.16 million, with the pace of aging and the low birthrate to continue.Life expectancy at birth in South Korea was 85.5 years for females and 79 years for males as of 2014, the data showed.South Korea's gross domestic product expanded 3.9 percent on-year to 1,485.1 trillion won  in 2014, with the gross national income per capita reaching $28,180, up from $26,179 the previous year, according to the statistical office.","statistics korea 13 percent ,aging in korea south ,topping 13 percent last ,of aging in korea ,population topping 13 percent","['South Korea', 'Statistics Korea', ""South Korea 's""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.46265396  0.24293759

It marked the second consecutive year of decline, following a 2.1-percent drop in 2014. According to the statistics agency, the number appears to be falling again this year, with the tally for the January-February period showing a 1.2-percent decline.The trend is new, considering that the number of stay-home married women has been increasing every year from 2000 when related recordkeeping began. The increase had continued even as young women were starting to have careers of their own from 2000. For instance, in the age group of 25 to 54, the percentage of economically active married women rose from under 50 in 1990 to 59.6 percent in 2015.The cycle was broken only in 2014, with marked changes among elderly housewives.

Contrarily, the number for couples in their 30s fell 0.4 percent.Experts say part of the phenomenon of older women working has to do with demographic shifts as the society ages, but it also has to do with the elderly having to work to sustain livelihood.""The rising trend of home prices has been broken and interest rates have fallen, dragging down the value of assets,"" Lee Geun-tae, senior researcher with LG Economic Research Institute, said.

The baby boomer generation has no choice but to work.""According to government analysis, South Koreans lived an average of 82 years in 2013, 23 years longer than in 1970.  ""Flexible work hours, subsidized daycare services and maternity leave policies have contributed to more women getting jobs,"" said Chung Seong-mi of the Korea Labor Institute.

The disaster pushed up the national average.According to the ministry, the rapid increase in the number of maritime accidents is largely blamed on poor maintenance of vessels and equipment.Accidents from poor maintenance rose to 854 ships last year from 377 in 2014, while those due to using faulty equipment sharply increased to 676 ships from the previous year's 305.Also accidents involving vessels that drifted due to empty fuel tanks shot up to 224 from 104 the previous year.By type of vessel, fishing boats accounted for most of the accidents, at 1,566, followed by water leisure crafts at 324 incidents, and tugboats and barges at 145.With the rise in the number of maritime accidents, the safety ministry plans to organize what it calls a vessel safety consultative body to make prompt and follow-up measures after maritime accidents.Meanwhile, the Coast Guard will also start operating a mobile maritime safety corps by the end of May to crack down on vessels operating without properly working transceivers, navigating under the influence of alcohol and fishing in off-limit areas.","was double the annual ,resulting in 112 deaths ,maritime accidents increased significantly ,accidents last year ,last year was double",['the Ministry of Public Safety and Security'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.66993117  0.72625566

But now, Kim rarely goes to the library. Instead, she simply turns to the Internet to download digital books and reports available.“Most of the reading material is up online, so I don’t find it necessary to go to libraries now,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “I prefer to download material from an e-library as it is easier for me refer to when I write up a report.” Latest statistics show that Kim is one of an increasing number of university students who rely more on the Internet than school libraries to do research and access books. According to a report on students’ usage of libraries by the Korea Education & Research Information Service, students borrowed 7.4 books per person on average in 2015. This has been dropping for five years. The average number of books per person was 10.3 in 2011, 9.6 in 2012, 8.7 in 2013 and 7.8 in 2014, according to the report. The state-run KERIS conducted the survey on 409 university libraries across the nation in 2015, involving more than 2 million students.Among the students, only 57.7 percent said that they have borrowed a hardcopy book from their school libraries. “I can definitely feel a downward trend in the number of students borrowing books from school libraries,” said Kim Seung-cheol, associate manager at Sungkok Library at Kookmin University in Seoul. Kim cited the high-speed Internet and increasing usage of smartphones as major reasons for this tendency. “I think Koreans are now more used to reading content and acquiring information on smartphones.”According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted on 40 nations, 88 percent of adult Koreans own a smartphone, more than double the global median average of 43 percent. Korea also ranked highest for Internet usage, with a rate of 94 percent.The competitive job market, in which youth unemployment rate stands at 9.5 percent, also contributed to the trend as students tend to focus more on preparing themselves to find employment these days, he noted. “Students normally look for books about English tests, job interviews and so on,” he said. “They tend to buy those kinds of books from bookstores rather than borrow them from libraries.” Among those who do opt to visit libraries, literature is still the most popular genre, according to the KERIS report.Nearly 21 percent of the books borrowed by students attending four-year college programs were literary books. Another 20.5 percent of the books were in social science while 13.4 percent were technology science books. “Short reading material is more popular in e-book form, but long ones including text books or literary books are still more popular in print forms,” he said. “I believe it is premature to predict an end of paper books. Rather, e-books and print books are complementary.” Among the surveyed universities, Seoul National University had the highest rate of students borrowing books from libraries, with a person on average taking out 24 books per year. Among the universities with four-year programs, the total amount of money spent on purchasing materials, including paper and electronic books, was 871 million won , down 2.1 percent from a year earlier. The proportion of budget spent on buying digital resources has been rising since 2012, with e-books accounting for 64.4 percent of the total budget. This means that less is being spent on hardcopy books. The average number of books in the 20 largest university libraries in Korea increased by 56,000 per library per year, significantly less than libraries registered under the Association of Research Libraries. The ARL, an organization encompassing over 120 libraries in the U.S. and Canada, saw an increase of 229,000 books per library, per year. But the librarian Kim said the decrease in the amount of money spent on hardcopy books could be a result of a rise in the prices of digital books. “As the total amount of budget has remained almost the same and digital material gets more expensive, libraries have less money to buy hardcopy books.”By Ock Hyun-ju","university students use libraries ,fewer university students use ,school library to browse ,fewer university students ,25 who attends university","['Kim Min - jin', 'Seoul', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'the Korea H']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.67359734  0.04347998

This, on the other hand, means, 42 percent did not use the rental system in 2015.Literature-related books were borrowed the most, accounting for 20.9 percent of the total, followed by social science with 20.5 percent and technology and natural science with 13.4 percent.Each Seoul National University student borrowed some 24 books on average, the largest among all universities in the country.Meanwhile, purchasing expenses for documents and data at each university library dropped to 871 million won on average from the previous year's 890 million won, attributable to the decrease in university student enrollment.Electronic data purchases have been outpacing demand for printed materials ever since 2012. Until 2011, the ratio of students purchasing printed materials was higher than electronic data, but thereafter, the ratio between the two reversed, with the purchase of electronic data increasing to 64.4 percent as of last year.According to KERIS data, the number of books at university libraries increased by 3.8 million last year, down sharply from 5.06 million books tallied in 2011.","university students borrow less ,409 school libraries nationwide ,students borrow less books ,two year junior colleges ,student borrowed an average","['south korean', 'Korea Education and', 'Research Information Service']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4027431   0.53135884

Notably, the number of male sex abuse victims aged 19 or above, who visited the centers for support, increased significantly in the last two years, from 72 in 2014 to 120 last year.Also, a total of 464 men also sought help for domestic abuse at the centers. The proportion of male domestic abuse survivors who visited the centers also increased by 1.4 percent points from the year before, from 6.9 percent to 8.3 percent. “We don’t think of this as more men are being abused nowadays than in the past,” said Hong Mi-ga from the Gender Ministry. “We think male survivors have always existed. We think more survivors are realizing there is help available and that it’s okay to seek support.”Meanwhile, the number of male children sex abuse victims – those aged 13 or under – dropped last year from the year before, from 545 to 433.In total, 1,019 male survivors were treated at the centers nationwide in 2015. Still, they only accounted for 5 percent of all 20,218 sex abuse survivors who sought help at the centers. The Gender Ministry last year released a report on sex abuses cases against men for the first time. The report contained research by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, which surveyed South Korean men who were sexually abused while serving their military duty, their perpetrators, as well as their witnesses. Majority or 74.7 percent of the surveyed survivors said they were abused for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, 72.9 percent of the perpetrators, as well as 76.8 percent of the witnesses, claimed the victims became subject to violence because they “looked or behaved in a feminine manner.”In 2014, a male army conscript surnamed Yoon died after six male colleagues allegedly hit him in the chest while he was eating which led him to choke on his food. According to the Military Human Rights center, Yoon had been constantly sexually assaulted by the bullies, on top of being physically and verbally abused on a daily basis. Some 470 military same-sex sexual abuse cases were reported in 2013, but only 39.5 percent ended with convictions, according to the organization. While such military same-sex sexual violence prevails, the Gender Ministry currently has no statistics on the gender ratio of Korean perpetrators who have sexually abused men. According to data from the National Police Agency, a total of 25,223 Koreans were arrested for sex abuse charges. Among them, only 1.7 percent were women.South Korean law currently does not acknowledge same-sex rape or any forms of sexual penetration other than vaginal as rape. Accordingly, same-sex rape is defined as “rape-like” by Korean law and carries lighter penalties. According to Gender Ministry’s report last year on male sex abuse victims, 41.6 percent of the survivors said they took no action after being abused. Among them, 42.8 percent said they did not do anything as they did not acknowledge the assault as a form of violence.Among survivors, 60 percent of them experienced sexual harassment, such as being touched inappropriately or being kissed or held in ways that caused discomfort, while 20 percent of them were raped by the abusers. The report also revealed that male survivors who had been abused by same-sex perpetrators often developed self-loathing and anxiety disorders. One of the survivors interviewed by the government researchers said he volunteered to join the Marine Corps after being sexually assaulted, to prove to himself that he is not “weak.” “I heard that the training at the Marine Corps is the toughest in the country,” he told researchers. Another survivor, who identifies himself as gay, developed feelings of guilt after surviving the abuse. “I thought I was punished because I was gay,” he told the researchers.By Claire Lee","more korean male sex ,korean male sex abuse ,36 sunflower centers nationwide ,sexual violence survivors increased ,male sex abuse victims","['south korean', 'Sunflower Centers', 'the Gender Ministry', 'the Gender Ministry', 'Sunflower Centers']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.36433461  0.57508737

However excluding those not receiving private lessons, the actual amount spent per student rose to 355,000 won.The survey was based on interviews with 43,000 parents of elementary, middle and high school students enrolled across 1,244 schools nationwide. The budget for private education was mostly proportional to the age of the students, the data showed. The average for elementary school students inched up 0.1 percent on-year to 286,000 won, while that for middle and high school students rose 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent, to 397,000 won and 471,000 won respectively.Elementary school students were the most reliant on private education, with nearly 81 percent taking extracurricular lessons, followed by middle school students at 69.4 percent and high school students at 50.2 percent. Elementary and middle school students spent the most time on private tutoring. They spent 6.4 hours per week, while high school students spent 4.1 hours. Meanwhile, the nation’s total amount of spending on private education saw a 2.2 percent decrease from the previous year at 17.8 billion won, on the back of a drop in the number of students. The number of students dwindled from 7.23 million to 6.08 million over the period 2010 to 2015.The data also showed a widening gap in spending on private education between high-income and low-income families.

The report was written after surveying a total of 3,155 Koreans who attended anti-violence education provided by the ministry last year.  On a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being “strongly agree,” the participants were asked to rate statements such as “sexual violence is preventable as long as the victim resists the attack.”The research found that those who are aged 50 or older, regardless of their gender, were most lenient towards violence among all groups. Men rated 2.94 out of 7 -- with 7 being the most lenient towards violence -- and women were rated at 2.56. Those in their 50s rated 3.17, while Koreans in their 20s rated 2.46. Meanwhile, those who had never attended postsecondary education rated 3.05, while Koreans who attended graduate schools rated 2.52.The number of reported sexual violence cases have been steadily on the rise in South Korea since 2009. According to Gender Ministry data, the number of cases increased from 17,242 in 2009 to 29,517 in 2014. Meanwhile, the number of reported domestic violence cases has also been increasing, from 8,762 in 2012 to 40,822 in 2015. To combat domestic violence, child abuse and sexual violence, the Gender Ministry has requested a total of 68,000 public institutions, including high schools, day care centers and municipal governments, to submit reports on the mandatory anti-violence education that all public servants were required to attend last year.

The provincial government attributed the hike in property acquisition taxes to growing interest inside and outside of the country in the resort island as it has become one of the must-see tourist sites in South Korea, with more than 12 million tourists visiting the island per year.""We had many real estate transactions last year affected by speculators, resulting in a big increase in property acquisition taxes,"" said Chae Jong-woo, a tax official at the Jeju provincial government.The Jeju provincial government has seen a gradual increase in property acquisition taxes since 2009, when it had collected 74.1 billion won from real estate transactions, which has climbed by 4.6 times over the past six years to reach 340.2 billion won last year.Property acquisition taxes are local taxes that are directly used to finance local governments.","2015 53 percent increase ,taxes collected last year ,billion won 275 million ,percent increase from 2014 ,boom data showed thursday","['Jeju', 'Jeju']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.26066759  0.28042689

It not only provides a new source of economic growth with innovative technology but also strengthens democracy by attracting citizens to participate in policymaking and keeping information transparent,” Nam Young-sook, secretary-general of the World e-Governments Organization of Cities and Local Governments, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. Nam Young-sook, the secretary-general of the World e-Governments Organization of Cities and Local Governments Chung Hee-Cho/The Korea HeraldThe e-government refers to a system using information technology and digitizing administrative affairs to effectively offer public services and improve interaction among agencies, and between the government and citizens. Established in 2010 by Seoul Metropolitan Government, WeGO has promoted administrative efficiency and sustainable development of global cities by sharing digital government know-hows and bridging the digital divide. This is the first multinational city-led organization dedicated to information and communications technologies for public administration.Nam, an economist and former international relations professor at Ewha Womans University, was named to the post last month.As of this year, a total of 95 cities -- including Paris, Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Barcelona -- and two friendship organizations have joined the group. Once the cities join the organization, they can benefit from various programs ranging from e-government consulting to training workshops. Seoul City was reelected a president city last year for the third consecutive time in recognition of its advanced digital government technology and systems. South Korea has topped the United Nations’ e-government survey three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2014. It also ranked the first for six consecutive years in the Rutgers World e-Governance Survey conducted by Rutgers University in the United States.“The central government’s active efforts to provide customized digital administrative service for the public and its policy to share information have played a major role in getting the world’s recognition,” Nam said. The state has been active in promoting the online government system with various measures. It has allowed residents to have their personal documents -- such as birth certificates -- issued or change their residence address online without visiting public institutions. It has also run a “complaint report system” that receives public complaints via mobile applications and social network services. Regardless of the central government’s efforts, the role of each municipality is essential in ensuring that citizens benefit from the e-government system, Nam stressed. “Although the main policies of the e-government system are mapped out by the central government, it is the cities that carry out and deliver the public services based on the distinguished needs of each city. The municipalities connect the citizens and the central government,” she added. As the new leader of the organization, Nam is pushing to widen WeGo’s role in promoting a “smart sustainable city” -- a sustainable city development based on the e-government system -- and in supporting developing countries to better adopt the e-government system. “One of our main goals this year is to expand the support for member cities to enhance their digital capacity with various programs while tightening the cooperation with other international bodies for better global networks,” she added.The organization is gearing up to raise the digital capacity of member cities such as Vietnam, Nepal and the Philippines.“Although we have seen high demand from many cities, most of those which ran the trial programs could not introduce the e-government system due to the financial burden,” she added. Member cities can apply for WeGo to conduct a feasibility study in their countries. This involves a customized on-site consulting program that runs a trial online system for six months and advises how to efficiently utilize the e-government system. About a dozen cities received the free consulting but none of them were able to afford the actual introduction of the system. As part of efforts to solve the funding issue, WeGO has built partnerships with the Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Korean International Cooperation Agency to financially support member cities so that they will be able to run the system. The organization is also preparing a series of training and workshop programs. It is planning to cohost a “smart city forum” with the United Cities and Local Governments Asia-Pacific, the local government union of 140 Asia-Pacific cities, at the United Nations Conference on House and Sustainable Urban Development or Habitat III, in Ecuador in October.The Habitat III is a conference held to “reinvigorate” the global political commitment to the sustainable development of towns, cities and other human settlements. It will also co-host a workshop with the Asian Development Bank in May in Korea, and a “smart city regional forum” with International Telecommunication Union, the U.N’s specialized agency for information and communication technologies, on July I in Phuket, Thailand.   “While providing various network and training programs, WeGo will put more effort to offering more funding schemes based on tighter ties with international bodies such as the World Bank and ADB,” the secretary-general said.  By Lee Hyun-jeong","digital governance the importance ,for city sustainable development ,interview digital capacity crucial ,government system is crucial ,online services is growing",[],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.0869031   0.41869843

The city said it would include 550 public and private parking places in that integrated system by 2020.Seoul's ambitious plan for a ubiquitous digital platform comes amid growing worries that the city has lost its momentum for growth with a decline in its population of 10 million people.","will provide free wifi ,provide free wifi networks ,free wifi networks at ,free wifi networks ,free wifi would also","['Seoul', 'WiFi', 'Seoul', 'Park Won - soon']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.9343698   0.12006678

The Korea Economic Research Institute cited the correlation as a major avenue that the international community should tap into to improve efficiency of sanctions on the country.""The recent shrinkage in exports was the result of a significant drop in exports of its natural resources ... Its natural resources exports continued to decline into the third quarter of last year,"" the think tank said in a report.""Behind the positive growth of the North Korean economy after 2010 was its abundant resources buried under the ground and high-quality labor force, which combined to expand its trade with China,"" it added. ""Pyongyang's efforts to secure foreign currencies could hit a snag should the China-bound exports continue to decline.""The report said that North Korea's natural resources exports to China rose to an all-time high of $1.84 billion in 2013 but fell to $1.52 billion in 2014. During the same period, the ratio of natural resources to its total overseas shipments fell from 63.2 percent to 53.7 percent. North Korea depends almost entirely on China for its overseas trade. The heavy reliance on China could further increase down the road after South Korea recently shut down the operation of an inter-Korean industrial complex in the North's border city of Kaesong in apparent retaliation against its recent series of provocative acts. The North drew international condemnation by conducting its fourth nuclear test early this year, which was followed by a recent rocket launch which is regarded by many experts as a disguise for a test of its long-range missile technology.","exports have been shrinking ,blocking korea resources exports ,toughen sanctions report china ,drop in overseas sales ,economic sanctions being ramped","['China', ""North Korea 's"", 'Pyongyang', 'the Korea Economic Resear']",21,"[ 1.          0.          0.         ... -0.31394276  0.63566869

Of these cases, 38 percent are related to stray cats and 17 percent to pets. YonhapConflicts usually occur between residents and those that feed stray cats out of goodwill. Overpopulation of stray cats has long been a source of dispute in the city. Other complaints include noise from dogs barking, and owners refusing to clean up after their dogs when they leave a mass on walks. Violence against animals and abandonment will also be subject to surveillance, the city said.Once a case is reported, a team of two will be dispatched to the scene, conduct interviews, attempt to mediate and take any legal measures when necessary.The city said the team will operate until the end of this year before deciding on whether to expand.As of 2014, 18.8 percent of households in Seoul have pets, with the number of abandoned animals reaching an average of 9,000 each year.","receive training next month ,pets the seoul metropolitan ,five volunteers the members ,training next month ,training next month and",['the Seoul Metropolitan Government'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.50779903  0.4875899

They usually refer to families consisting of parents and children or a childless couple living with their parents. YonhapTwo-generation households accounted for 67 percent of the total in 1985. The proportion declined to 47.2 percent last year, but remained the most common form. The report said the proportion would further decrease to 35.9 percent in 2035.At the same time, one-generation households are expected to increase, it added.The researchers also compared household type, the actual number of offspring and the number of children that those surveyed wished to have, using its fertility statistics released in 2012.It showed that the average number of children that women have in their childbearing years  was 1.75. The number varied among different types of households, with the average reaching 2.00 for families where three generations lived together. The comparative figure was 1.90 for two-generation households and 0.58 for one-generation households. The report pointed out that one-generation households included many newlyweds. By definition, they also do not include households with children.The difference was more noteworthy in the number of children that the respondents wished to have. While the average was 1.96, the number was higher among those living in multiple-generation households. It was 1.51 for one-generation households, 2.02 for two-generation, and 2.08 for three-generation households.“It appears that those living with multiple generations have a great desire to give birth as they are affected by various factors such as parental pressure and less burden in taking care of the children,” the report said.","korea surged nearly eightfold ,next 20 years statistics ,06 million in 2015 ,wednesday the korea institute ,showed wednesday the korea","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60575449  0.78590679

In response to the unprecedented move, North Korea expelled all remaining workers and froze all assets inside the park, with the losses suffered by companies estimated to reach over 2 trillion won .“The closure of this last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation is credit negative for the South, as it heightens geopolitical risk,” the global credit rating agency said in a report, noting that its analysis is based on the premise that the status quo would prevail.Moody’s upgraded South Korea’s credit rating to Aa2 from Aa3 in December last year, the highest-ever rating Asia’s fourth-largest economy has received from the agency.The Aa2 rating is the third-highest rating given by Moody’s.The ratings agency pointed out that the mere perception of geopolitical risk “can hurt a country’s capital, current and fiscal accounts, making it harder for it to service its debts ... and can lead to lower foreign direct investment and higher funding costs for the public and private sectors.”","shutdown hurt south korea ,korean workers in retaliation ,gaeseong shutdown hurt south ,hurt south korea credit ,moody the recent shutdown","['Gaeseong', 'North Korea ’s', 'South Korea ’s', 'Moody ’s Investors Service', 'Seoul', 'south korean', 'north korean', 'Pyongyang']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.25205275  0.76838899

The remaining 4.4 percent answered they have no idea or did not respond to the question.Pyongyang expelled all 124 South Korean firms from the factory park in the North Korean border city of Gaeseong on Thursday, two days after Seoul announced its own decision to at least temporarily shut down the industrial complex.Opened in 2004 following the first Seoul-Pyongyang summit four years earlier, the Gaeseong factory park is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. With some 54,000 North Korean workers on payrolls before the shutdown, it has often been considered a cash cow for the impoverished North.Earlier Sunday, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, Seoul's point man on inter-Korean affairs, said in a television interview that North Korea would first have to display ""sincere willingness"" to assuage security concerns among South Koreans before any talk of normalizing Gaeseong's operations.Yonhap, the nation's key wire service, and state broadcaster KBS commissioned pollster Korea Research Center to conduct the survey Thursday and Friday, covering a wide range of current issues. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Among other issues, 48.9 percent of the polled said they were in favor of hardline policies on North Korea, but nearly as many people -- 47.8 percent -- said they supported a more moderate approach.Of the 48.9 percent who backed tough North Korean policies, nearly 31 percent said more financial sanctions should be imposed, and 18 percent said South Korea should also consider taking military measures to remove North Korea's nuclear facilities.Of those who supported a more moderate approach, 40.1 percent said the two Koreas should resolve the tension through dialogue while 7.7 percent said Seoul should recognize Pyongyang's nuclear weapons possession.South Koreans weren't nearly as divided on the issue of the potential deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, in the country.The poll showed that 67.1 percent were in favor of THAAD's presence in South Korea to better counter North Korean threats. On Feb. 7, Seoul and Washington agreed to begin negotiations for the THAAD deployment on South Korean soil, as part of measures to upgrade the two allies' missile defense posture.As for how to respond to the North's nuclear weapons threats, 52.5 percent of those polled said their country should develop its own nuclear weapons or consider redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the country. In contrast, 41.1 percent said the nation should hold fast to the 1991 ""Joint Declaration for a Non-nuclear Korean Peninsula"" despite the North's provocations.In agreement signed between then South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, the two sides pledged not to test, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons and not to possess facilities for nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment.Under the agreement, the U.S. pulled all surface- and sea-launched short-range tactical nuclear weapons out of its army bases in South Korea and President Roh also announced principles for ensuring the peace and non-nuclear status of the peninsula.The survey also showed 46 percent approved of President Park Geun-hye's performance, compared to 44.1 percent at the end of last year. On the flip side, 48.7 percent said they disapproved of the president's job, down slightly from 49.1 percent last December.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the most popular presidential contender with 28.3 percent of support, with Moon Jae-in, former chairman of the opposition Minjoo Party, a distant second at 17.9 percent.Ban, who will conclude his second U.N. term at the end of this year, has repeatedly said he's not interested in South Korean politics.","majority of koreans back ,north korean provocations poll ,half of south koreans ,koreans favor the government ,recent north korean provocations","['South Koreans', 'inter - korean', 'north korean', 'Yonhap News Agency', 'KBS', 'South Korea', ""North Korea '""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.64138079  0.68896919

He would post selfies, details of his daily activities and share about coffee shop and restaurants that he frequented.This has since changed as Kang now sees more pitfalls than benefits to the social networking services which were once a crucial conduit for the 24-year-old college student to share about his day-to-day life with relatives, friends and acquaintances. “I used to put my personal information, such as my phone number and address, on my SNS accounts. I was flabbergasted when these were leaked and circulated online without my consent,” Kang said. He said he eventually chose to remove his previous accounts and establish new ones, finding himself unable to cut off from social media completely, to stay relevant. Kang frets constantly about the possibilities of identity theft, a personal data leak or even online and offline stalking by complete strangers. While Kang’s case involved personal risk and damage, the overwhelming usage of social media in the daily routines of the general public have become a source of unexpected risks for businesses as it could amount to tangible and intangible losses. For businesses, social media accounts have been vital tools to promote products, communicate with customers and foster favorable marketing environments. But they have also been exploited to spread groundless rumors and emotion-laden customer responses, which affect their sales and corporate image. It is for this reason that analysts stress the need for a thought-out crisis management strategy in regards to social media. “Crisis management has been increasingly important as the range and speed of the spread of SNS risks have become substantially bigger than how they were in the past,” said Jung Kyung-hwa, the director of the online team at the local public relations consultancy KPR & Associates Inc. “Through SNS, what used to be a petty issue in the past could escalate into a new crisis, which could give rise to yet another crisis more serious than the previous one. The amount of time needed for an issue to become a crisis may also be shortened as  can serve as a catalyst to make situations worse.”In recent years, firms that care greatly about their corporate image have increasingly focused on managing the potential risks that can arise from social media. They have formed special teams to handle online issues and conduct daily analysis of risk factors vis-a-vis social media. “For enterprises, social media is a double-edged sword: Given its capabilities to quickly disseminate information, social media is a very effective channel for promotional activities. But it can also pose great risks,” said an official at LG Electronics Inc. speaking on condition of anonymity. “We, under the principle of ‘expeditious and sincere’ communication, try to respond to online questions from customers within 24 hours, maintain candid communication with customers and strengthen our monitoring of social media accounts.”Jung of KPR & Associates Inc. pointed out that companies should actively prepare against potential social media-related crises with various scenarios in mind -- largely in three stages: before, during and after those crises. Before a crisis erupts, companies should strengthen their monitoring of issues and problems circulating through social media, she said, noting that false online information about a company could result in an uncontrollable crisis.  During a crisis, a firm should take care of it in a “prompt and active” manner to prevent it from further worsening. Thoroughly verifying the root cause of the crisis and maintaining effective communication with customers is vital at this stage, Jung said.After a crisis, the company should continue carefully watching the situation to ensure the crisis does not spill over into any other areas, she added. By Song Sang-ho","social media amplifies risks ,restaurants that he frequented ,year old college student ,woo social media accounts ,social media accounts were",['Kang'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.78939587  0.48313135

In order to measure the level of corruption, the study looked at factors such as research, administration and contracting with outside vendors. It also examined the frequency of corruption scandals as well as any other act that might compromise the credibility of the institutions. The study was conducted from October to December last year.The 2015 average score was a slight increase from 2014 when the score marked 5.67. It also showed general improvement in areas such as the tendency of schools to provide favors to university officials and general corruption levels in research, administration and personnel management. However, corruption within labs still appears to take place frequently, with 10.5 percent of the survey’s university respondents having pocketed research funds and 12 percent of them misusing funds. The following categories had also worsened: corruption risk, corruption awareness, transparency of procedures and responsibility towards tasks. The schools were classified into five groups, with Group 1 being the least corrupt. No university was put into the first group, with the top-scoring universities all in Group 2. Included in Group 2 were Seoul National University of Science and Technology , Gangneung-Wonju National University  and Korea National University of Cultural Heritage. Seoul National University’s lecture room The bottom three were Chonbuk National University , Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  and Korea National Sport University .Seoul National University, which is widely regarded as the top higher education institute in Korea, barely made it into the fourth group with a score of just 5.44.“We have taken into account 38 corruption cases that occurred at 17 universities in the past year, which was actually less than the year before when there were 45 cases,” said an official from the commission. There were 17 cases involving the embezzlement of research funds, which was the most frequently occurring form of corruption. Meanwhile, 76.3 percent of those caught doing dishonest deeds were professors.“Based on the 2015 results, we will conduct assessments on universities that have scored poorly and induce voluntary anticorruption efforts on their part,” said the commission’s official.

The suggestion marked a step back from Cho and other superintendent’s initial position of asking for a 5 percent increase. However, it was still met with a resounding “no” from the Education Ministry who reiterated that it was the local offices’ legal responsibility to fund the “Nuri” program.The ongoing tug-of-war over the Nuri program is just one issue in a spate of education-related controversies. Nuri situation at a standstillTwo meetings held last month between new Education Minister Lee Joon-sik and the heads of 17 education offices across the country yielded no meaningful results, as the two sides fervently refused to back down. As of Monday, Seoul, Gwangju, Incheon, Gyeonggi Province, Gangwon Province, South and North Jeolla Provinces, have refused to fully allocate budgets for the Nuri program. Saenuri Party members of the Gyeonggi provincial assembly on Thursday demand the provincial government to allocate budgets for the free childcare “Nuri” program in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. / YonhapThe contentious point of the Nuri program, which subsidizes kindergarten and day care center fees for children aged 3 to 5, is the ambiguous nature of the related law. Korean law states that education offices are to support “education institutes,” which has generally been interpreted as facilities under supervision of the Education Ministry.The original version of the program launched in 2012 under the Lee Myung-bak administration targeted children aged 5 -- a year before they start school -- and mainly subsidized kindergarten fees. But the Park Geun-hye administration expanded the age group and local education offices began to refuse to pay for day care centers, which are under the purview of the Welfare Ministry. “The government plan to unify child care and child education is an important step, and I believe it is toward an ideal path,” said Cho Hi-yeon. He added, however, that it was impossible for education offices to fully subsidize the program due to financial limitations. The government pointed out that this year’s budget for education offices had increased by 1.8 trillion won to 41.2 trillion, and claimed that this would allow education offices to sufficiently cover the 4 trillion won cost of the program within their budgets. But the education offices said the increase was barely enough to cover the rise in employment costs and inflation.Although the government allocated 300 billion won extra for the Nuri program, education offices say this is not enough.In a 2014 report, the state-run Korea Educational Development Institute said that the central government should provide for the Nuri program as no additional budget has been given specifically by the Education Ministry for it. According to the education offices, their accumulated debt stands at 7.89 trillion won, more than one-third of their total budget. Vice Education Minister Lee Young said that as the number of students are decreasing, authorities need to take a cautious approach toward raising the budget. But the Seoul education office countered by saying that the ideal approach should be to provide higher quality education to fewer students with an increased budget, rather than reducing the funding as student numbers drop. The two sides dug their heels deeper as they engaged in a debate of who gave in first to increasing public demand to get the Nuri program back on its feet. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Thursday visit a kindergarten in Jongno-gu, central Seoul. / YonhapFinance Minister Yoo Il-ho on Monday released a statement saying again that the responsibility of funding Nuri is on the education offices. “We  will provide the supplementary budget for offices which allocate budgets for Nuri ... If they continue to refuse, we will fix the law to ensure that it is done,” he said.The association of education superintendents said Monday that they will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss countermeasures. College reform off to a shaky startLast month, the Education Ministry unveiled its plans for this year. Headlining the blueprint was its kickoff of the Program for Industry Needs-Matched Education, or PRIME project.The project, which is currently the largest government subsidy program for higher education institutions, will pump 600 billion won overall in financial support over the next three years for 19 universities to conduct reforms to expand the number of students in disciplines that are in high demand based on research.While the project says “industry needs,” in reality the project is moving in the direction of expanding departments related to engineering or medicine while downsizing humanities-related fields. A December report by the Labor Ministry forecast that the job mismatch will worsen over the next 10 years, with majors in social sciences, education and humanities from four-year universities exceeding demand by 438,000. But the report showed the engineering majors and medical students from universities would be in short supply by 255,000.The Education Ministry said that it would increase the number of students studying disciplines in short supply -- including engineering -- by 20,000 before 2020, while reducing the quota of those in excessive supply. Its plan did not include one to expand medical departments as this would require a sign off from the Welfare Ministry.“With the PRIME project, I will reinforce fields of study that are in high demand in the job market, hen solving the problem of job mismatch,” said Minister Lee at the meeting with heads of college presidents on Wednesday.He also emphasized the state-led college reform plans, which mandate colleges and universities to downsize by 160,000 in terms of student numbers by 2022. While the law mandating students to follow government reform is still pending in the National Assembly, the ministry can still cut subsidies for institutes that refuse to comply.Although neither the PRIME reforms nor the college downsizing are mandatory at the moment, universities say that government funding is crucial in their operations, particularly with the ministry restricting schools from raising tuition fees in line with the president’s “half-priced tuition” pledge. Vice Education Minister Lee Young / YonhapThe education minister told local media on Wednesday that he planned continue of keeping college tuition as low as possible.The Government’s emphasis on the PRIME project has had ripple effects. Konkuk University announced last month that it was merging departments to “improve competitiveness and to vitalize industry-linked education opportunities such as the PRIME project.”Dance majors from Busan-based Silla University on Monday denounced the school’s decision to shut down the dance department in order to conduct reforms for the PRIME project.Student bodies of nine universities in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province -- including Seoul National University, Kyung Hee University and Ewha Womans University -- jointly held a protest last month to denounce the project.“The Education Ministry is trying to pin the blame of youth unemployment on colleges and students. But we students are the ones being penalized by their misguided education policies,” they said. “Higher education institutes that have continued for decades face the threat of being restructured in just months for the sake of employment rates.”‘Secrecy’ accusations on history textbookOn Wednesday, Vice Education Minister Lee Young said that the authoring process for new history textbooks has already begun, without its authors or criteria being revealed to the public. These books are slated to be used in secondary education from next year's academic year.“There had been requests to reveal the criteria, but we felt that not disclosing  would be better for maintaining a stable environment for the authors,” he said. Lee said that both would be disclosed eventually, although he refused to specify when. The authorities’ refusal to reveal the authoring criteria to the public has revived the month-long debate about the ministry’s secrecy over the government-issued history textbook.The Park administration, after declaring the current privately-published books biased toward left-wing ideas and North Korea, announced last October it will take over the publishing rights. But there has been a nationwide dispute over whether the conservative president may attempt to whitewash controversial political figures, including her father, former President Park Chung-hee.In an attempt to address the public concern, then-Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea vowed to keep the publication process transparent. Despite Hwang’s pledge, the ministry has only revealed two of its 47 authors.

In 2013, 13,601 merits were awarded and 21,669 in 2014.Last year's figure -- 26,602 merits -- is the highest since the Korean government was established in 1948, with the exception of 1954 when the government decorated war veterans from the 1950-53 Korean War and gave out 72,903 merits. The surge in the number of merits is mainly due to an increase in retired civil workers.Regulations state that government officials who have worked for 33 years or more without being punished for wrongdoing, such as bribery, are entitled to receive order of service merits upon retirement.Last year, 22, 981 such individuals received order of service merits, accounting for 86 percent of the total number of merits given out. Vice Trade Minister Moon Jae-do awards medals of merit, at an event celebrating safe nuclear energy in Seoul on Dec. 23. YonhapThe other 11 government-issued merits saw a relatively modest increase from 2,921 in 2013 to 3,621 last year.The state-led reform on the government workers’ pension program has sparked an outward rush of civil servants in the past two years. The pension program reform raised monthly subscription fees and reduced the benefits that one receives upon retirement.In 2014, the government paid 2.27 trillion won  in severance pay for its employees, the highest amount seen so far.

Suicide has become the fourth most common cause of death here.  According to the report by the Health and Welfare Ministry, almost 90 percent of suicide victims had diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, but only 15 percent of them had received medical treatment regularly before taking their own lives.  A sign that says “life line,” a phone counseling service for those who consider committing suicide by jumping into the Hangang River, is installed at Seoul’s Mapo Bridge. YonhapAlso, while only 25.1 percent of them had visited a psychiatrist at least once in the last 30 days of their lives, a higher proportion of them -- 25.6 percent -- visited a general physician or a traditional Korean doctor for symptoms such as indigestion or insomnia in the same period. One of the victims featured in the report, a man in his 40s, visited a general physician after experiencing loss of appetite and weight loss. The physician diagnosed his condition as chronic fatigue and did not advise him to seek help from a mental health professional. According to researchers of the report, it is likely that his condition may have been depression. He took his own life a few months later.Jeon Hong-jin, a psychiatrist at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, said many studies have indicated that about 70 to 90 percent of all suicide victims worldwide have a psychiatric illness, including depression. What is unique in South Korea, he said, is the collective avoidance of psychiatric treatment which is deeply linked to the social stigma against people with mental illnesses. According to a report released by the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency last year, about 5.6 percent of the entire Korean population – about 2 million people – have suffered depression at least once. However, only 290,000 people sought medical help for the condition, as of last year, and an even smaller number of them, 150,000, chose to receive treatment regularly. “A lot of people are unaware of their mental condition because people avoid visiting psychiatric clinics. But  can be dangerous,” psychiatrist Jeon told The Korea Herald. “When someone with severe depression doesn’t know he is clinically depressed, it’s more likely that he would find his situation hopeless and take his own life. Being diagnosed can give a sense of control, because once you are diagnosed you can learn that there are treatment options available for you to get better.”The report also showed that 40 percent of the 121 victims were drunk when they committed suicide. Also, 25.6 percent had faced legal, professional and personal conflicts resulting from alcohol abuse. At the same time, 54 percent of the victims had family members who had alcohol abuse problems. “It can be concluded that alcohol abuse is very closely associated with suicide cases in South Korea and that drinking control is necessary as an intervention measure for suicide prevention,” the report said.South Korea is known for its culture of binge drinking. According to analysis by the global research firm Euromonitor International, South Koreans were the world’s biggest consumers of hard liquor as of 2014, drinking 11.2 shots per week on average.Many overseas studies have shown that social isolation is one of the most significant factors that contribute to a number of mental health conditions, including depression, addiction, hoarding and social anxiety. According to the OECD data last year, 28 percent of Koreans said they have no meaningful social support at all - not a single person they can rely on - in times of crisis. This rate was the highest among the OECD nations. “Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we are happy and healthy, we’ll bond and connect with each other,” said British journalist Johann Hari who has researched and written extensively on addiction of all kinds, during TED talk last year. “But if you can’t do that, because you are traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will go with something that will give you some sense of relief .”According to the World Health Organization, alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions worldwide, including cancer, road traffic crashes, violence, and suicides. “Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at large,” the WHO said in its factsheet on the harmful use of alcohol.The government report on suicide also found that 93.4 percent of victims exhibited some suicide warning signs, such as experiencing a change in sleeping and eating habits, but 81 percent of the victims’ family members did not consider these signs as anything to be alarmed about. By Claire Lee","korea high suicide rate ,121 suicide victims last ,south korea high suicide ,suicide rate government report ,high suicide rate government","['South Korea ’s', 'South Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.31978029  0.27559859

General electric power used by the private sector rose 2.9 percent to 1,037 kWh, with demand from the industrial sector edging up 0.4 percent to 2,736 kWh. Power used by homes rose 1.8 percent, while those consumed by farms jumped 8.3 percent, vis-a-vis the year before.""The generally sluggish pace of economic growth, and overcapacity in the steel industry, which is a big user of electric power affected industrial demand to some extent, although this was offset by gains in chemicals, autos and general machinery,"" the ministry said.Demand for electricity from local steel mills dropped 5.3 percent to 462 kWh, while power used by carmakers and chemical companies rose 1.5 percent and 0.7 percent, each, compared to the previous year. Electricity consumed by the country's general machinery manufacturers shot up 5.3 percent.Besides power consumption, the ministry said sales at local department stores, large retail outlets and big supermarkets all contracted last year, with gains only being reported for convenience stores.Lower sales were due mainly to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  outbreak that swept across the country from late May to early July, it said. This left 38 people dead and 187 people infected, and scared off people from crowded areas like shopping malls.Sales at the country's department stores were down 1.2 percent on-year, while large discount outlets like E-mart posted sales falling 2.1 percent. Large supermarket chains or super supermarkets also said sales were down 1.3 percent. In contrast, sales at convenience stores surged 26.5 percent, due to a spike in cigarette prices starting in January.The ministry also said that growth of the country's online shopping malls and discount outlets hurt department stores and large discount outlet sales.In the first 11 months of 2015, online shopping malls and discount outlets reported sales gains of 19.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively.For December, the latest data showed sales at large discount stores backtracking 5.1 percent on-year, while the corresponding numbers for department stores and SSMs were each down by 5.7 percent and 5 percent. Sales at convenience stores were up 20.3 percent on-year.The ministry attributed the drop to higher than expected winter temperatures which hurt demand for warm clothing and miscellaneous goods.","776 kwh in 2014 ,837 kilowatt hour kwh ,2015 south korea electricity ,used 837 kilowatt hour ,country used 837 kilowatt","[""South Korea 's"", 'the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.68326205  0.30864131

Many local budget carriers that started off with just a handful of aircraft have expanded their fleet sizes in recent years. Jeju Air, the country's No. 1 LCC, has 22 planes as of Dec. 31, 2015, while Jin Air, owned by Korean Air Lines Co., the country's top flag carrier, has 19 planes.Full-service airlines such as Korean Air and Asiana Airlines also had 159 and 84 planes each at the end of last year.The ministry, meanwhile, said that local operators have been urged to lower the average age of planes in service to enhance flight safety.Korean Air and Asiana have relatively young fleets, with the average age of planes standing at 9.43 years and 10.11 years. On the other hand, numbers for LCCs Air Busan and Eastar Jets stand at 14.49 years and 13.93 years each.Authorities said that with rise in air traffic demand, the total number of civilian planes registered in the country should exceed the 1,000 mark by 2019. It said with a steady increase in numbers, the government will tighten monitoring of safety rules and maintenance checks to prevent accidents from occurring.","korea soared 10 percent ,korea jumps in 2015 ,2015 as airlines increased ,south korea soared 10 ,airlines increased their fleets","['South Korea', 'the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.4645282   0.73464555

The report, based on a survey of 2,889 people aged 65 and older across the country, measured poverty in seven categories: income, assets, residence, health, labor, social participation and social security net.According to the findings, the rates in all seven categories went down in 2013 from two years ago.The rate of income poverty among seniors was 52.8 percent as of 2013. Income poverty refers to a household whose income is less than 50 percent of the median income of all households.The rate for labor poverty was 27.4 percent while 47.2 percent were in social participation poverty. The social security net poverty rate was 8.2 percent.  Meanwhile, 17.4 percent of the people who suffered from poverty in multiple areas in 2011 were able to move into the non-poverty group in 2013. In other words, 82.6 percent remained in the multi-poverty group. Of the people in the non-poverty group in 2011, 39.1 percent fell into the poverty group for the first time in 2013 while 60.9 percent maintained the status of ""not poor."" The report said the relationship among the seven poverty categories was low except for that between income and residence. It said the impact of one area to other factors is low and that simply offering income support cannot resolve the various types of poverty.","majority of seniors suffer ,south koreans aged 65 ,majority of seniors ,seniors suffer from multidimensional ,2013 down percentage points","['South Korea', 'the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs', 'South Koreans']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.53325468  0.37066683

Those who sell, distribute, lease or openly screen such pictures can also face the same punishment.Various types of illegal hidden cameras confiscated by police in Seoul last year YonhapThe court currently reviews the following when making rulings: the way the victim was dressed when he or she was violated; the place the violation took place; camera angles used for photographs; and whether or not the photograph captures specific body parts. Yet the specific crime is difficult to curb mostly because the subject of the violation is often unware of the harassment, and therefore feels no “sexual shame.” Also, many smartphone applications, including those that enable users to take pictures without a shutter sound, or zoom in, make it easier for voyeurs to commit the crime, prosecutors said.There also has been debate as to what kind of photographs cause sexual stimulus or shame. On Sunday, the Supreme Court ruled that a man in his 20s who had been charged with following a female stranger and taking pictures of her in an elevator as not guilty. The court explained that the woman wasn’t wearing any “revealing” clothes at the time, and the photograph, which captured the upper body of the woman without her face, can’t be seen as “sexual,” as it did not zoom into any specific body parts. However, the woman testified at the court that she was scared and felt sexually harassed because of the man’s behavior. She said she noticed him taking pictures of her body without her consent and reported him to the police the next day after checking security video footage. In November, a 36-year-old man received a “not guilty” verdict for taking a total of 16 pictures containing different women’s full bodies, rather than specific body parts such as breasts, at a subway station in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province. But he was sentenced to eight months in prison with two years of probation for 42 other pictures he took, all of which captured bare legs of women in the subway in the summer.In explaining its decision, the Seoul Northern District Court said it was illogical to interpret a woman in her summer clothes as constituting a “body that may cause any sexual stimulus,” as more women choose to dress casually and less conservatively today.Lee Soo-yeon, a researcher at the Korean Women’s Development, argued that the laws should expand the definition to acknowledge all forms of voyeurism as stalking. “With the current laws on the punishment of sexual crimes, it is hard to punish voyeurism offenders. But taking pictures of someone without the person’s consent is just wrong,” she told The Korea Herald.“It would be more efficient if the law acknowledges the specific behavior as stalking  and make it punishable.”Meanwhile, the Ministry of Gender Equality was criticized during a National Assembly inspection last year for its campaign ad against sexual harassment using smart devices in public transportation. The ad encouraged women not to wear miniskirts, or to cover their legs when they do, when riding the subway or climbing the stairs at stations -- instead of discouraging possible offenders from committing the crime. Rep. Lim Su-kyung from the then-New Politics Alliance for Democracy, now The Minjoo Party of Korea, said at the audit, “Such ads are based on the notion that when a woman gets sexually harassed, she must have done something to deserve it.” By Claire Lee","number of sex crimes ,of all sex crime ,office monday in 2014 ,sex crime perpe ,all sex crime perpe","['South Korea', 'the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51832724  0.16439755

From 2005-2015, power output grew at an annual average rate of 3.5 gigawatts.Last year, thermal power plants that used liquefied natural gas as the source of fuel generated 33 percent of all power output at 32.2 gigawatts, followed by coal-fired plants that made up little over 28 percent or 27.3 gigawatts. Nuclear power added 21.7 gigawatts or 22.2 percent of power output for the country, with renewable energy making up 7.6 percent and 7.4 gigawatts.According to government plans, the Shin-Kori No. 3 reactor capable of generating 1.4 gigawatts will go online in April with two coal-fired thermal power generation units in Dangjin and two others in nearby Taean to start generating power. The combined output of the new power generation units in Danjin and Taean on the west coast will reach 4 gigawatts.Industry insiders said that while growth in power output is a positive development, the country's growing reliance on fossil fuel is worrisome, as other countries are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which are cited for causing global warming.Coal is a cheap source of power generation but it releases 2.2 times more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere than LNG.""The country's dependence on coal-fired thermal plants is due to actions taken by the government following the 2011 limited blackout shock,"" a business insider said. He, however, said that because it takes such a long time to build power generation plants it is very hard for policymakers companies to predict energy demand trends down the line. Last year, South Korea actually had excess capacity.The insider said that with demand not rising as fast as expected, and with LNG becoming cheaper, the country needs to follow what other countries are doing to meet electricity demands.The United States has already said LNG will make up 60 percent of its power generation needs by 2035, with China pledging to reduce its dependence on coal. Britain has said it will halt all coal-based power generation by 2025.","100 gigawatts this year ,surpass the 100 gigawatt ,to top 100 gigawatts ,108 gigawatts this year ,top 100 gigawatts","[""South Korea 's""]",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -1.00635493  0.48781911

According to statistics released by Korea Disabled People’s Development Institute, the poverty rate, earning less than 50 percent of the nation’s median income, for the disabled’ families stands at 34.5 percent. The poverty rate for the total population is 16.3 percent. The figures mean that one out of three households with a disabled member are so poor that they cannot earn even half the median income in Korea. As of June 2014, the average income of disabled families was 2.23 million won, only 53.8 percent of that of the nation’s total households. The household income for the disabled has gradually risen since 2000, but the disabled households still felt more concerned about their finances than the rest of the population, according to the latest report. The disabled households additionally spent an average of 164,200 won to cover medical costs and pay their caregivers. They spent 40.2 percent of the money on medical fees, 15.6 percent on transport and the rest on purchasing assistance devices and so on. The households with a disabled member felt greater financial problems mainly because the disabled are not able to contribute to family income as they are mostly unemplyed. Only 39.6 percent of the disabled across the nation participated in economic activities as of 2014, according to the report. Only 37.0 percent of the total disabled population were employed, with 25.7 percent of them working in labor-intensive sector. As of 2014, South Korea has a total of 2.49 million suffering from mental and physical disabilities registered with the municipalities. Among them, 58.1 percent were males and 41.9 percent females.

The money saved from this arrangement will make it possible to hire more young job seekers. The jobless rate among people between 15 through 29 reached a record high of 9.2 percent in 2015, the highest reading since 1999, and much higher than the 3.6 percent average for the country as a whole.All government-funded companies and agencies have adopted the payment system which gradually decrease the salaries of employees past a certain age. The ministry added it will also run a special program to offer consultation, training and job matching services to young people.It said it will make efforts to convince the parliament to pass a set of highly contested labor reform bills, which have been held off due to heightening political tensions.The government said the bills are designed to make South Korea's labor market more flexible and give more opportunity to young job seekers and revitalize the economy.Critics, on the other hand, argue that the laws will pave the way for companies to formally sack underperforming employees and amend employment rules more easily even without consent from workers.""South Korea is facing a rapid drop in an economically active population, mounting household debt and rigid labor market, which all hurt growth,"" the government warned.It claimed that unless there is an increase in productivity and a new growth engine is found soon, Asia's fourth largest economy may go into the kind of protracted, low growth cycle that is afflicting countries like Japan and Spain.","2015 south korea will ,reform to fuel growth ,growth in 2015 south ,fuel growth in 2015 ,much needed structural reforms",['South Korea'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.60268211  0.24591906

In a report to President Park Geun-hye, the education ministry said Wednesday it will also decrease by 160,000 the enrollment quota of the nation's university students by 2022 by restructuring universities nationwide.Instead, it will increase the enrollment of students majoring in technology and engineering sciences by 20,000 to meet the industries' requirements for more skilled manpower.According to the education ministry, its plan to increase the enrollment ratio for vocational schools to 30 percent from the present 19 percent by the year 2022 is aimed at easing the severe unemployment rate for young adults.The ministry said the increase of students for vocational high schools, such as ""meister"" schools, is necessary to produce more young and skilled jobseekers that can work at job sites at various levels. South Korea currently has 39 meister schools aimed at giving students technical education and apprenticeships so that they can develop expertise in particular fields, including shipbuilding, mechanical engineering, semiconductors and medical equipment.Boosting employment for young people has become a top priority for the Park administration, since youth unemployment is roughly three times higher than the national average.In South Korea, nearly 80 percent of high school students go to college due to the widespread social practice of judging one's abilities based on one's academic background. This so-called academic inflation has been a chronic social problem in the country.In this sense, the government's plan to utilize a more skilled workforce from vocational high schools is designed to tear down common social practices and promote the employment of high school graduates without college education.","2022 by restructuring universities ,university students by 2022 ,restructuring universities nationwide instead ,education ministry said wednesday ,youth unemployment in report",['Park Geun - hye'],21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.57230258  0.80417275

My male colleagues are always referred to as doctors,” she said.　“And many older male patients don’...","Park Hyun-ju , a 30-year-old medical resident at a general hospital, is used to patients calling her “agassi” -- a Korean term commonly used when addressing a young woman of unknown age -- instead of a doctor.  “But they never call a male doctor ‘chongak’ . My male colleagues are always referred to as doctors,” she said.“And many older male patients don’t take me seriously. Once I told a senior male patient to stop calling me agassi. He said, ‘A young, pretty woman like you shouldn’t act so difficult. No man will want to marry you if you continue to do so.’ I think this would be considered as sexual harassment overseas.”Park’s experience is reflected in the latest research findings released by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea on Tuesday, which found more than 50 percent of female health care workers who have filed complaints with the agency from 2001-2015 were about being sexually harassed at work. The NHRCK researched a total of 59 human rights abuse cases suffered by the nation’s female health care workers -- including physicians and nurses -- that were reported to the commission in the last 15 years.  123rfAmong them, the largest proportion, 54.2 percent, were sexual harassment cases at the workplace.Meanwhile, 35.6 percent of the complaints were about being discriminated at work for being pregnant. Also, 5.1 percent experienced physical or emotional bullying at work.The report found that the majority of those who have been sexually harassed at work were nursing assistants, referring to those who obtained a yearlong certification program offered in non-university institutions. In the local medical field, there is a defined hierarchy among physicians, registered nurses and nursing assistants, whose pay rate, responsibilities and duties vary.Compared to registered nurses, who attended four-year university degree programs and whose responsibilities include providing doctor-ordered treatments, nursing assistants usually have a lower pay with their primary duties consisting of cleaning and bathing patients as well as administrative tasks. The report pointed out that such a hierarchy was one of the reasons behind the high number of sexual harassment victims among nursing assistants. The highest proportion of perpetrators were male patients , and the second-highest proportion  were doctors and owners of the medical institutions where the nursing assistants were employed.Meanwhile, among 153 female medical residents surveyed by the NHRCK, 77.8 percent said they felt hospitals prefer to hire unmarried female residents. Also, 53 percent of them felt they experienced gender-based discrimination during training, while also perceiving barriers to promotion.While not feeling as strongly as female medical residents, Korea’s nurses and nursing assistants also believed that there is gender discrimination in the workplace, the report found. Among the 977 nurses and nursing assistants surveyed by the human rights agency, 58.3 percent said single women have a higher chance of getting a job in the field than those who are married. Also, 55.3 percent said one’s appearance, such as her height, weight and physical attractiveness, played a factor during the job selection process at medical institutions. “Whenever the president of the hospital had guests over, our boss would selectively ask those who are slim and good looking to greet them in a docile manner and keep them entertained,” one of the nurses interviewed for the report was quoted as saying.As of 2015, 98.3 percent of nurses nationwide are female, according to the Korean Nurses Association.The report also revealed that a significant portion of the surveyed women felt that pregnancy can ruin their career prospects. A total of 71.4 percent of female medical residents and 39.5 percent of nurses and nursing assistants said they felt they could not plan on having children freely and were practically required to consult their employer before getting pregnant. Also, 61.7 percent of the nurses and nursing assistants and 77.4 percent of the medical residents said they worked beyond the legal limit while pregnant. One of the cases included in the report consisted of a medical resident who had to work until just a few hours before her own labor -- assisting other mothers giving birth at her hospital’s obstetrics unit. “Most female residents aren’t allowed to breast-feed their babies at work,” said Hyun Jung-hee from the Korean Public Service and Transport Workers Union at a forum in Seoul on Tuesday. “Isn’t it ironic how a female doctor can’t breast-feed her own children at work while their job is to encourage as many women to breast-feed as possible?”Hyun said the biggest problem is that most medical institutions don’t hire enough staff to save on labor costs.“According to government data we obtained from the Health Ministry, more than 80 percent of medical institutions don’t follow the law which stipulates that all hospitals should have at last two nurses per five patients,” she said. “And by allowing hospitals to be so understaffed, the government should know that citizens’ safety and health is at risk.”The report claimed that female health care workers have a higher risk of developing sleep disorders, mental health conditions and cardiovascular disease. “And from our research, we found that they are constantly exposed to gender discrimination at work, which can severely deteriorate the quality of their private and family life,” it said.By Claire Lee","female health workers complaints ,never call male doctor ,30 year old medical ,workers complaints park hyun ,half of female health","['Park Hyun - ju', 'korean', 'Agassi']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.51657641  0.01927277

Travelers started to come back to Korea in September and their number rose 5 percent on-year in October thanks to shoppers who flocked to massive discount events held by retailers.The viral disease took the heaviest toll on the numbers of Chinese tourists, who canceled their flights and tour packages in the peak summer season. The total number of Chinese travelers to the nation declined 2.3 percent to 5.98 million last year, it said. Japanese travelers also decreased as the falling yen further dampened their travel sentiments, marking a 19.4 percent drop to 1.83 million.

In 2013, 45 cases of corporate disclosure violations were detected.Of the 126 cases, the FSS imposed sizable surcharges on 26 cases that violated the rules heavily and fines for five with less severe violations. For 17 cases, the watchdog restricted the issuance of securities, while 78 cases of minor violations received warnings or cautions. Violations of important notices were the most common at 69 cases. There were 34 violations regarding regular corporate disclosures and seven violations of securities issuance disclosures.A total of 55 corporate violators were listed on the tech-heavy KOSDAQ market, while nonlisted companies that are obliged to make disclosures numbered 26.

The figures were in stark contrast to the U.S. and Japan. In the same year, the elderly in the U.S. spent 81.57 percent and had an income of 71.75 percent of the general population, while the figures for Japanese seniors were 86.89 percent and 75.58 percent, respectively. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “Pensions at a Glance 2015” showed that 49.5 percent of Korean seniors were below the poverty line -- marked at half the median household income.“There is a notable disparity between the incomes of elderly households and non-elderly households in Korea, which results in senior citizens spending their money mostly on items closely linked to their survival,” said Sung in her paper “Comparing Income and Expenditure of Seniors in Korea, the U.S. and Japan” published in the journal “Pension Forum” by the NPRI.According to Sung, Korean seniors spent only 5.2 percent of their income on leisure, compared to the 5.8 percent overall average. But American and Japanese seniors’ spending on leisure activities -- in proportion to their income -- increased from 5.9 percent to 6.2 percent and 9.9 percent to 10.1 percent, respectively, flashing warning signs for Korean seniors’ quality of life.Sung pointed out that the discrepancy derives from the country’s pension system. As of 2013, an average pensioner received about 16.31 percent of the average household income in Korea. But the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance federal program in the U.S. offered 34.59 percent of the country’s average income, while Japan’s pensioners got 64.77 percent of the average income.The Police Science Institute recently predicted that the crime rate of the elderly is likely to surge this year, due to their high poverty rate.By Yoon Min-sik","poverty increases in korea ,elderly poverty increases in ,the average korean senior ,elderly poverty increases ,korean income in 2014","['korean', 'korean', 'Korean', 'Sung Hye - yeong']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.58593333  0.48740321

According to “Pensions at a Glance 2015” by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 49.5 percent of Koreans aged 65 or more are below the poverty line, by far the highest rate among OECD member states at more than quadruple the OECD average. The OECD defines the poverty line as half the median household income of the total population.“As poverty of the senior citizens persists, the ‘subsistence crime’ ― committed by the underprivileged for the sheer purpose of survival ― will continue to grow. There is also a high possibility that the increase in crimes will lead to more violent cases, such as sex crimes,” the officials said.The report pointed out that the surge in the crime rate was most notable among the age group of 61 or more last year. Criminal cases by the senior citizens accounted for 15.4 percent of the total population in 2014, marking a steep increase from 11.8 percent in 2011. In terms of the number of criminals, 150,902 seniors were convicted of crimes in 2014, according to the National Police Agency. This marked a 35.4 percent jump from 111,453 in 2011. The officials recommended that the elderly people should be given opportunities to participate in various government-funded programs, while the authorities should carry out campaigns to raise the awareness of the senior crimes. But the report forecast the number of crimes in 2016 to be around 1.79 million, down from 1.85 million in the year before.In addition, the PSI also predicted an increase in the number of crimes by foreigners, who account for 3.5 percent of the country’s 51.5 million population. Crimes committed by foreigners went up from 22,543 in 2010 to 30,684 in 2014, and slid to 28,114 as of September 2015. The number of foreigners had also increased by roughly 700,000 since 2009 to mark 1.82 million. The report pointed out that many foreign workers suffer from poor working conditions, being exempt from most welfare measures.It added that while the situation calls for a “custom-fit” policy to counter the increase in crimes by foreigners, a special caution is needed against possible rise of xenophobia and contempt against foreign cultures in general. A report by Kim Jung-hyu, a professor of American Studies at Keimyung University, extrapolated from his study of 800 immigrants in Korea that distortion, discrimination and mistreatment were among the biggest factors that pushed the foreigners to crime.Among other crimes expected to surge this year were cases related to online feuds, as demonstrated by multiple libel cases involving an ultraconservative website “Ilbe” last year, which included an Ilbe member’s defamation of victims from 2014’s fatal sinking of ferry Sewol. The PSI said that North Korea will likely attempt to sway public opinion during the general elections in April of this year, as it claimed that Pyongyang has schemed against certain parties and candidates in all major domestic elections It said Pyongyang’s cyberoperations team would attempt to spread false rumors and propaganda against the major government policies such as labor reform and the government monopolizing publication of history textbooks, which has received heavy criticism from the opposition, labor circles and education circles across the country.By Yoon Min-sik","rise in elderly crimes ,high elderly poverty rate ,more crimes by underprivileged ,korea high elderly poverty ,overall crime rate police","['the Police Science Institute', 'Korean National Police University', 'Korea']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.33378243  0.1016834

This is an increase of about 55 percent on-year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said. The investments in Seoul also made up 41.6 percent of the total $20 billion FDI in Korea. The previous highest foreign investment amount was $7.2 billion in 2005. The sharp rise in Chinese investments contributed to the record-breaking FDI, the city said. The total investment from China in 2015 was 22 times higher than the previous year. One of the common forms of investment was acquisition of local companies. The increase was mainly seen in the services sector including finance and insurance industries. Investments in the finance and insurance industry rose by 247 percent, and the rest of the services sector by 70 percent. In the meantime, investments in the manufacturing industry dropped by 39 percent, it added. FDI through mergers and acquisitions also skyrocketed by 174 percent, while greenfield investments only rose by 3.7 percent, the authorities said. Seoul City has been aggressively attracting foreign investors with investment briefings and roadshows abroad, including in China, the U.K., the U.S. and Singapore. It has been especially targeting the finance, bio and hospitality industries, they said. It also inked eight memorandums of understanding with organizations related to start-ups, information technology, finance and culture. It will make more efforts to draw FDI this year with a newly launched special task force and more investment briefings, officials said.

The total cost of 23.3 trillion won was equal to 45.8 percent of total medical costs covered by the national health insurance that year.Among the costs, the biggest portion, 39.1 percent, was spent on medical bills, 35.9 percent was lost future income due to early death and 13.9 percent was down to the loss of productivity, such as for lost workdays due to illness. The cost for the problematic lifestyle choices and health conditions has increased significantly in Korea since 2005, according to the report. Health risks cost the nation 13.5 trillion won in 2005, 17.6 trillion won in 2007, 20 trillion won in 2008 and 21.6 trillion won in 2011. Among the three health risks, the cost for obesity increased the most, by 222 percent from 2005 to 2013, while the cost for smoking increased by 162 percent and drinking 156 percent.The report also showed that 71.7 percent of the cost in 2013 was spent on those in their 40s to 60s. Only 3.2 percent of the cost was spent on those aged 20 or under.In terms of gender, a significantly bigger portion of the cost -- 17.2 trillion won -- was for Korean men.Early deaths were the biggest cost for drinking and smoking complications, accounting for 42.3 percent of drinking-related problems and 47.7 percent of smoking-related problems. The costs for medical bills for the two risks accounted for 25 percent for drinking and 34.1 percent for smoking. Yet for obesity, the cost from early deaths accounted for 13.5 percent, but the cost for medical bills accounted for 64.2 percent, which was significantly higher than the proportion for drinking and smoking. The report suggested that the Health Ministry come up with stricter measures to prevent excessive drinking, as the largest sum of money was spent for problems and damage resulting from alcohol consumption in 2013. Researchers also stressed the importance of preventing obesity to maintain the stability of the nation’s national health insurance system. Obesity has emerged as a major health threat in South Korea in recent years. According to a study released by NHIS last year, the number of obese Koreans -- those with a body mass index of 30 or above -- accounted for 4.2 percent of the population in 2012, up from 2.5 percent in 2002.One in 17 South Koreans will be obese in 2025, and some 7 trillion won would be needed to treat them medically if the current trend continues, the report said.Excessive alcohol intake is in fact considered as one of the key contributing factors for obesity, along with job-related stress and physical inactivity. In a 2014 report released by Euromonitor, a London-based market intelligence firm, Koreans were said to drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average. This makes them the heaviest drinkers in the world, beating Russians and Thais, according to the study. Among the three risks, South Korea has been making conscious and consistent efforts to curb smoking since 2014, including an 80 percent increase in cigarette prices that went into effect last year. By Claire Lee","obesity cost south korea ,smoking obesity cost south ,trillion won 19 billion ,south korea 23 trillion ,drinking smoking obesity cost","['South Korea', 'the Health Insurance Policy Research Institute', 'Korea ’s National Health Insurance Service']",21,"[ 0.          0.          0.         ... -0.55049556  0.19811195
